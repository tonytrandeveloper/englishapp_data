All employees who have been working for the company two years or less will receive one week (five working days) of paid vacation per year. Employees who have been working here three to five years will receive two weeks (ten working days) of paid vacation per year. Employees who have been with the company five to ten years will receive three weeks (15 working days) of paid vacation per year. Employees who have been here more than 10 years will receive four weeks (20 working days) of paid vacation per year.\n\nPlease note that this does not effect current policies for sick days and personal leave. All employees, regardless of experience, will still receive five days of paid sick leave per year, as well as two days of paid personal leave. Please post the new vacation policy in your departments as soon as possible. Also, employee handbooks are being revised to reflect the changes in vacation policy. These handbooks should be ready within the next two weeks. When they are, you are responsible to distribute them to employees, and to send us verification that each employee has received the handbook and understands the new vacation policy.\n\nThank you for your cooperation in this matter. If you have any questions, please contact me at extension 254 or the assistant HR director, Gladys Haynes, at extension 256.",

I have enjoyed having your assistance with my projects.\nAlthough the tasks we handled were not as varied as you would have liked, just think about what you and I have accomplished since September. We organized the annual small business conference, updated the association's web site, and answered scores of inquiries, many in great detail, from business owners who needed advice on a range of topics: loans, benefits, licensing, etc.\nI feel the year has been very productive for both of us. You've been an congenial and conscientious assistant and all of us have the highest regard for your abilities. Please feel free to call upon me for a recommendation if you require one for future employment.\nBest of luck,\nThomas",

A History of Sports from Ancient Times to the Present covers everything from sporting events in ancient Rome to the origins of teams sports in North America, and it includes a section on sports played on contemporary university campuses. I highly recommend the chapter with detailed instructions on how to play games that had previously been lost over time. Porter's comprehensive introduction and bibliography, as well as the time line of dates and events, make this a reference work that should be purchased by all public libraries.

This includes a donation of $2,300.00 made by robert Erwin, former trustee and president of the National Library Organization, and must be spent by December 31.\n\nMs. Johnson suggested that the trustees spend the $2,300.00 as follows: $900.00 will be allocated for books; $400.00 for supplies; and $1,000.00 for building repairs. All members present agreed.\n\nBuilding Repairs and Improvements\nMr. Elder expressed concern about the recent electricity bills, which were quite high. The issue will be discussed at the January 14 meeting after the year's budget has been reviewed.\n\nMiscellaneous Business\nMs. Sprague noted that the library building should be kept locked when it is not officially open to the public, even if staff or cleaning crews are present inside the building.\n\nMr. Elder ended the meeting at 7:00 p.m.\n\nThe next meeting will be on Thursday, December 18, at 5:00 p.m. in the Milton Public Library.",

        "transcript": "Sustainability Magazine\n\nVolume 10, No. 6\n\nJune 2009\n\n\n\nManufacturers Going Green\n\nBy Leo Durham\n\n\nAn increasing number of manufacturing companies around the country are going green, which they hope will put more green into their cash registers.\n\nThe Manufacturers Extension Partnership (MEP) works with a variety of state and regional industry associations and economic development groups to teach companies \"lean\" manufacturing techniques.\n\nThis not-for-profit organization, administered by the Department of Commerce, demonstrates how to reduce waste, or \"fat,\" in the manufacturing process. This includes things such as cutting energy use, incorporating more efficient production techniques, and finding cheaper methods of packaging and shipping goods.\n\nThe result is better not only for the environment, but also for company profits. Last year, MEP helped more than 1,000 firms save about $1.4 billion and increase their sales by $10.5 billion. These actions led to the creation of nearly 57,000 new jobs.\n\n\"It was tremendous for us,\" said Mark McCartney, general manager of the Clear Water bottled water company. \"MEP showed us how to cut our energy production in half, which led to a 3-percent increase in sales, and a 100-percent increase in production capacity.\"\n\nMcCartney has been quick to spread the wealth. Last year, a bottle of Clear Water retailed for $1.50. Now, MEP training has enabled the company to slash the price to $1.20.\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\nDear editor:\n\nI enjoyed the article on MEP in the June issue of Sustainability Magazine. When manufacturers pass savings onto customers, everybody wins.\n\nOverall, the writer did a fine job. However, there is one mistake in the article I would like to point out. After our company finished training with MEP, sales jumped 30 percent, and our production capacity increased by 10 percent.\n\nI would encourage every manufacturer to consider partnering with MEP. There's always some fat that can be trimmed from the production process.\n\n\nWilliam Lyons\n\nCEO, Clear Water Bottling",

Thank you for your usual prompt shipment. We appreciate the fast turn-around.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I noticed a couple of discrepancies between the freight and the invoice. First, the discount for the white photocopier paper does not seem to be factored into the total. We have been buying this paper from you at $100 a case, so shouldn't six cases with a 10-percent discount come to $540?\n\n\nSecond, according to my records we had 10 crates of computer chairs on back order. Are more coming? If so, what's the soonest you expect they could arrive? Also, could you please give me an idea when more color ink cartridges will be available? Our inventory is low, and we are planning to have a special sale for Halloween.\n\n\nCould you please get back to me ASAP? I need to clarify these questions before I place our October order. If you prefer to call, it's best to reach me today on my direct line: 556-424-8737.\n\n\nThanks again Marc,\n\n\nIda Velasquiz\n\nComptroller, Office Corral",

Please forgive my relatively late reply, as I was out of town and did not have a chance to read the invitation until last week.\n\nI am thrilled that my friend and former college roommate, Marilyn Strummers, is finally tying the knot. I am disappointed, however, that I will not be able to attend her milestone event. I had a vacation to China scheduled for several weeks prior to hearing Marilyn's exciting news, and subsequent efforts to rearrange my travel plans have proved unsuccessful. Ironically, my flight departs at exactly the same time as the ceremony. I'll miss Jeff and Marilyn at the airport by only a few hours!\n\nIt is with great regret that I must decline this gracious invitation, though I will contact Marilyn and congratulate her personally before I leave. Also, I would like to leave a gift for the newlyweds. Would it be appropriate to send a present to you?\n\nPlease let me know.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nPatty Pakola\n\n4334 Stone Drive\n\n555-762-0091",

Since its inception, Cost Less has rewarded managers of stores that improved their sales revenue and limited the amount of employee overtime.\n\nThese conditions will still apply, but the board has decided to factor in a third condition: the amount of loss prevented by store security. As you know, in the past year shoplifting and employee embezzlement cost our company more than $3 million. To help reverse this trend, we would like managers to be more diligent in hiring and supervising security personnel, and to be more alert in watching for possible theft.\n\nTo help encourage this philosophy, the board has voted to pay a 10-percent bonus to managers whose stores hold inventory loss to less than 2 percent of total revenues for the year. The board has also directed that each Cost Less store be given extra financial resources to help train and motivate employees to be alert for shoplifting and other types of in-store theft. Remind your employees that when merchandise is stolen or money embezzled, it hurts everyone in the company.\nAdditional details will be forthcoming in the next two months.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.",

You were more than a boss to me; you were a mentor and a friend. I will always value your advice, and will remember the lessons you have taught me. I remember the first time I missed deadline, and help up the whole paper. I was scared you would fire me. Instead you were supportive and understanding.\n\nI hope we can stay in touch, professionally and personally. I have the highest respect for your talent and leadership skills. You have the ambition and acumen to be wildly successful. I hope you and Denise will find personal satisfaction in Albany as well. I hear it's a nice city. If there's ever anything I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask.\nAll my best,\nTanya",

This is going to be a very brief review, but suffice it to say the book was erudite, insightful and an excellent revision of the tropes and stereo-types pervasive in Middle Eastern studies to this day. In the last several years I have become intimately familiar with literally thousands of sources, both primary and secondary on the region. If you have a decent foundation on the relevant literature of the period--400 BC to roughly the late 18th century AD--and are interested in the area I cannot recommend this book enough. However, if you don't, this is not a good introductory work. It is dense. The arguments can sometimes seem abstruse and arcane. And the narrative is so wide in scope that one should really have taken an introductory course in the region just to keep up. There still is no standard one volume history of what is commonly called, \"The Middle East.\" This is unfortunate. Boyles' book helps fill that role for specialists, but one is still, sadly lacking for the rest of us.\n-- Paul Robert Kingston",

We have experienced solid new member growth and continue to actively lend to our members. Helping members become homeowners, providing low rate credit cards, lending funds for new or used vehicles, and making home equity loans continue to be areas of focus for City Credit Union. While these efforts will continue, we also realize that many of our members have experienced tough economic times, and may be struggling to meet their current financial obligations. In recent weeks, we have received many letters and phone calls from members telling us about their financial situations and unique challenges. Due to the current economic climate, we have heard from members across a wide array of industries and professions; teachers, construction workers, and automotive sales to name a few, who have either lost their jobs, think they may lose their jobs, or had their household income significantly decreased. If you have not been impacted, chances are that you have a family member, friend or neighbor who has experienced financial difficulties as a result of the economy. If you are having difficulties in making any of your loan payments, whether it's your mortgage, auto, boat or RV, credit card or equity loan, we want to assure you that we are here to help you with our Member Assistance Team. This team was assembled exclusively to help members through stressful financial situations. We can help you by offering realistic solutions and may also be able to offer advice for working with other financial institutionsâ€”even if CCU  is not your primary mortgage holder. If you're experiencing difficulty in meeting your financial obligations, or worried about your future ability to do so, we encourage you to contact us as soon as possible and we will do our best to help you through these challenging times.\nCity Credit Union Member Assistance Team\n216-555-8957 or 800-555-2823 extension 5987\nmemberassistanceteam@ccu.org\n\nRemember, we have your best interests in mind.

        "transcript": "Community Care Meeting\nNov. 2nd, 2010, 7 p.m.\n1. Hopeshare presentation\nTwo representatives from Hopeshare, Leslie Graves and Rebecca Steinman, gave a presentation about their organization. Like us, they give financial aid to low-income people and help them budget their money. But they also  provide a food bank, shelter, transitional housing, transportation program, adult education, and an employment program. Their annual operating budget is about $10 million. Leslie said that Hopeshare wants to form a stronger partnership with Community Care, and explore ways we can share resources and avoid overlapping services. She recommended that we meet together at least twice a year.\n\n2. Treasurer's report\nTreasurer Jacob Hall passed out current budget figures showing our up-to-date income and expenses. He said that we have $851.52 total liabilities & capital. Our total revenues for Oct. were $1,690.97.\n\n3. Promotional plans\nRobin Sayers proposed that we produce a DVD promoting our services, which could be shown to churches and other potential donors. Gina Mauer said that it would also be good to make a brochure that could be handed to clients and distributed throughout the community. We agreed that everyone should pitch in to help write, take photos, and help with graphics and design. We set a deadline of Dec. 4th to have preliminary plans in place. Mary Burley agreed to be in charge of the project and to keep everyone on  track.\n\n4. Problems and concerns\nCommunity Care director Bill Lyons discussed the need to improve coordination between team members. He said he is working on upgrading our website so everyone can have instant access to information about clients we help and resources available to them.\n\n5. Next meeting\nWe agreed to meet again at 7 p.m. Dec. 4th at Bill's house, 1134 Midvale Ave. N.\n\nThe meeting was adjourned at 9 p.m.",

        "transcript": "The Advantage Edge\nAdvantage Tutoring creates independent readers, spellers, writers and thinkers by giving them the multi-sensory tools necessary to \"learn how to learn.\"\n\nOur one-on-one, hourly sessions stimulate three skills vital for language processing:\nPhonemic awareness - the ability to identify and order sounds within words. Symptoms of weak phonemic awareness include errors in reading (\"steam\" for stream), spelling (\"gril\" for girl) and pronunciation (\"death\" for deaf, \"pacific\" for specific).   \nConcept imagery - the ability to see the \"big picture\" when reading and listening. Persons with weak concept imagery have difficulty with reading comprehension, critical thinking and following directions.\nSymbol imagery - the ability to visualize letters within words. Weaknesses here can result in trouble with spelling, word recognition, contextual fluency and mathematics.\nOUR PROGRAMS\n\nLindamood Interactive Phoneme Sequencing (LiPS). This sequential, multi-sensory program teaches students to identify separate sound segments within words. There is particular emphasis on the vowel segments and mouth movements to help with reading and spelling.\nVisualizing and Verbalizing This unique method teaches students to broaden the visual imagery of their language. By incorporating these visualization strategies, the student expands the richness and detail of oral and written language, as well as the ability to comprehend what they've read.\n\n\"Seeing Stars\" Symbol Imagery This program teaches students to form visual images of individual phonemes (t-o) through multisyllable words (t-o-m-o-r-r-o-w), enhancing development of spelling, reading and sight word vocabulary.\n\n\"On Cloud Nine\" Mathematics This hands-on program hones competency in addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Students touch, feel, write and visualize concepts as they move from concrete to abstract math realities.\n\nFor more information, contact us at www.advantagetutoring.com",

        "transcript": "Biz Weekly\nJuly 15th, 2011\nDiabetics Need Exercise\nBy Pat Warbrouck\nFor Chris Carter, exercising is as simple as a lunchtime walk.\nCarter, a software developer, knows it's vital to find ways to do so during work days that require sitting for long stretches of time.\nHis life literally depends on it.\n\"Exercise is like the one trump card I have,\" Carter said. \"I realize that I have a lot of control over my condition.\"\nHis condition, Type 1 diabetes, robs his body of the ability to produce insulin -- a hormone needed to convert glucose (blood sugar), starches and other food into the necessary energy for daily life. This puts him at risk for a host of serious complications that includes heart disease, blindness, and nerve and kidney damage.\nThough Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, it can be controlled through a regimen of monitoring, diet and exercise. Carter keeps careful track of his glucose level, takes daily insulin shots, and keeps juice and energy bars close at hand.\nMost importantly, he said, he takes care to get enough exercise. Carter will stroll outside during lunch breaks, or hike up and down the stairs of the company parking garage.\nIt's a good example of the types of activity busy diabetics should be doing, said Dr. Arnold Asher, director of the Diabetes Health Center at Michigan Health and Science University (MHSU).\nPhysical activity helps control blood sugar in three ways, according to Dr. Asher.\nFirst, it burns glucose, ensuring energy is delivered to the body and that glucose does not build up in the blood. Second, it increases bodily sensitivity to insulin. As fitness increases, the body needs less insulin to move glucose into cells.\nFinally, exercise helps reduce weight. For overweight patients, losing about 7 percent of body fat will lower blood sugar.\n\n* * * *\n\nSound off\nEditor:\nThank you for running the article on Chris Carter in last week's issue. As a diabetic myself, it renewed my determination to make sure I get up from my desk and exercise a few minutes every day.\nI also hope your story will open the eyes of supervisors, and remind them of the importance of exercise -- not only for employees who have diabetes, but also everyone else in their office. When you're sitting at a computer all day, it's sometimes hard to tear yourself away from the screen and move around.\nI would love to see more companies encouraging employee exercise by giving them free gym classes, taking group stretching or walking breaks, and subsidizing those who walk or bike to work.\nRobert Fuda\nAnn Arbor, Michigan",

If you have not received it yet, you will shortly.\n\nI'd like to call your attention to a mistake in the invoice. Per our contract, we had agreed to waive our usual installation fee because you placed a bulk order. However, I note that in the totals at the bottom, we have billed you for a $300 install fee.\n\nRest assured we're not trying to pull a fast one on you. We're training a new person in accounting, and she neglected to delete that line item from the bottom of our standardized invoice forms.\nSo please disregard invoice # 774. We will send an accurate one to you today, without the installation fee charge. Sorry for the inconvenience, and we look forward to working with you again in the future.\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to call or e-mail.\nBest,\nJason McGraw\nPresident, CompuPros",

I'm so sorry that I have to miss it!\n\nBrad and I are going skiing in Utah that weekend. We've been planning the trip for months, and it's too late to change even though we wish we could. I'm dying to meet little Keegan! We'll be back on the ninth, and I'd like to get together ASAP after that. Would that be OK?\n\nYou must be so proud, grandma! Wow, I never thought I'd be calling you that so soon. I'm glad that Cath had a smooth delivery, and that Keegan is healthy. Thanks for sending his picture. He's a cute little guy.\n\nAnyway, we'll check the gift registries you mentioned, and I'll look forward to seeing Cath and Keegan shortly. Hope the open house goes well. I know it takes a lot to plan and host one.\n\nI'll e-mail Cathleen separately and say sorry and hi. Please give my love to Ken.\n\nSee you soon,\n\nRobin",

While this work is in progress, third-floor workers will be housed on other floors as follows: the sales department will move to the second floor, and graphic design will move to the fourth floor. Supervisors will arrange these accommodations and show staff in those departments their temporary work stations.\nWe expect the remodel to take approximately three weeks. During this time, we appreciate your cooperation in sharing space and working together. While the arrangement presents some logistical challenges, we are confident that we can meet them and work with minimal disruption to our normal routine during the remodeling period.\n\nTo make this transition as smooth as possible, it would be greatly appreciated if the third floor could be vacated, and everyone were in their new stations and ready to work, at 8 a.m. on the First. If there are questions or concerns with the new arrangement, be sure to tell your supervisors ASAP so we can tackle the problems ahead of time.\n\nThanks in advance for your patience and cooperation. Once the work is finished on the third floor, we are sure you'll agree that it was worth the time and trouble.\n\nBest,\nAlan Shepard, VP",

Sales of $2 million and BizTimes' \"Best New Business of the Year\" award?! That was more than any of us here could have imagined.\n\nI remember when you started as an intern five years ago. Time flies, doesn't it? I knew from the moment we met that you had the talent and ambition to succeed with your own company. Now that you've had a taste of it, don't rest on your laurels. I don't have to worry; I'm sure you won't.\n\nIt would be great to get together again when you have time. I'll treat you to lunch. I know it's a busy time of year. Please give me a call when you have time. I look forward to it.\n\nBest,\n\nDennis",

Gradually, we learn that the two are hiding and flirting in other personas so they can reconnect after a horrific experience, though by the time that would-be revelation comes, the movie - which had to wait two years to find a distributor - is about more than secrets.

(Last month's) meeting minutes were amended and approved\n. Chief Executive's Report:\n- Recommends that if we not able to find a new facility by the end of this month, the organization should stay in the current location over the winter. After brief discussion, Board agreed.\n- Staff member, Jackson Browne, and Swanson attended the National Practitioner's Network meeting in Atlanta last month and gave a brief extemporaneous presentation. Both are invited back next year to give a longer presentation about our organization. After brief discussion, Board congratulated Swanson and asked her to pass on their congratulations to Browne as well.\n- Drucker asserts that our organization must ensure its name is associated with whatever materials are distributed at that practitioner's meeting next year. The organization should generate revenues where possible from the materials, too.\n- Swanson mentioned that staff member, Sheila Anderson's husband is ill and in the hospital. MOTION to send a gift to Anderson's husband, expressing the organization's sympathy and support; seconded and passed.\n. Finance Committee report provided by Chair, Elizabeth Drucker:\n- Drucker explained that consultant, Susan Johns, reviewed the organization's bookkeeping procedures and found them to be satisfactory, in preparation for the upcoming yearly financial audit. Funds recommends that our company ensure the auditor provides a management letter along with the audit financial report.\n. - Drucker reviewed highlights, trends and issues from the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. Issues include that high accounts receivables require Finance Committee attention to policies and procedures to ensure our organization receives more payments on time. After brief discussion of the issues and suggestions about how to ensure receiving payments on time, MOTION to accept financial statements; seconded and passed.\n. Board Development Committee's report provided by Chair, Douglas Carver:\n- Carver reminded the Board of the scheduled retreat coming up in three months, and provided a drafted retreat schedule for board review. MOTION to accept the retreat agenda; seconded and passed.\n- Carver presented members with a draft of the reworded By-laws paragraph that would allow members to conduct actions over electronic mail. Carver suggested review and a resolution to change the By-laws accordingly. Kyumoto suggested that Swanson first seek legal counsel to verify if the proposed change is consistent with state statute. Swanson agreed to accept this action and notify members of the outcome in the next Board meeting.\n. Other business:\n- Porter noted that he was working with staff member, Jacob Smith, to help develop an information management systems plan, and that two weeks ago he (Porter) had mailed members three resumes from consultants to help with the plan. In the mailing, Porter asked members for their opinions to help select a consultant. Porter asked members for their opinions. (NOTE: Zevon noted that she was also a computer consultant and was concerned about conflict of interest in her Board role regarding this selection, and asked to be ABSTAINED from this selection. Members agreed.) The majority of members agreed on Lease-or-Buy Consultants. MOTION to use Lease-or-Buy Consultants; seconded and passed.\n- Swanson announced that she had recently hired a new secretary, Karla Writewell.\n. Assessment of the Meeting:\n- Kyumoto noted that the past three meetings have run over the intended two-hour time slot by half an hour. He asked members to be more mindful and focused during discussions, and suggested that the Board Development Chair take an action to identify solutions to this issue. Chair, Carver, agreed.\n. Meeting adjourned at 9:30 p.m.\n. Minutes submitted by Secretary, Bhata Bhatacharia.",

        "transcript": "Manufacturing Magazine\nVolume 33, No. 4\nApril 2010\n\nRevolutionary plastic\nBy Adam Munster\n\nA motto at EarthFirst Products Inc. is to \"go green wherever you are.\" In this case, wherever includes the cash register.\nThe manufacturer of environmentally-friendly plastics, started six years ago with $200,000 in seed money, projects revenues of $6 million this year and about $10 million the next. But EarthFirst President Tim Orsborne does not expect the growth to stop there.\n\n\"The sky's the limit,\" said Orsborne. \"In the world of plastic, the potential is enormous. People use disposable food-service items every day. It's a gigantic market.\"\n\nEarthFirst carved its niche in this estimated $15 billion-a-year industry by making biodegradable plastic bags from natural plant and vegetable sources rather than petroleum. It has since expanded into cutlery, including plates, trays, cups, and take-out boxes. Its website claims that if EarthFirst made all plastic disposable products in America, it could reduce annual oil consumption by 350 million barrels.\n\nThe company uses a blend of organic polymers, proteins, and plant starches such as corn and tapioca to make products that biodegrade in landfills within 36 months. Traditional plastic bags, made of high-density polyethylene, do not biodegrade and persist on the planet up to 1,000 years, according to Chicago-based ReusableBags.com.\n\nMore than 200 Taco Loco restaurants use EarthFirst's products, and the company recently struck similar deals with eight Office Universe Business Centers and 128 Super Store delicatessens.\n\nDepending on the market, Orsborne said EarthFirst goods sell in grocery stores for about the same to 10 percent more than traditional plastic cutlery, plates, and cups. His goal is to give businesses and retail customers a \"green plastic\" alternative, then let them decide if it's worth the slightly higher price.\n\nOrsborne said EarthFirst is also testing compostable products -- bioplastics that decompose within 180 days in a commercially controlled composting facility. But since there are only 48 such facilities in the United States, the chief focus will continue to be on biodegradable plastics.\n\n\"We're becoming the incubator for big plastic producers out there. We want to make sure that our core values are built into the product,\" Orsborne said.\n\n\"Did we develop sustainable materials? Sustainable packaging? I want to be able to reduce our carbon footprint.\"\n\n* * *\n\nLetters to the Editor\nDear Editor:\nRegarding the article in your April issue about EarthFirst plastic products: Bravo for Tim Orsborne!\n\nEven though they cost more, EarthFirst plastic forks, knives, spoons and plates are well worth it. I bought some for our company party last month. My supervisor initially complained about the price, but after I showed her the article, she enthusiastically supported my decision.\n\nLooking at the huge mound of dirty dishes afterward, it was comforting to know that they would biodegrade back into the soil, instead of sitting atop a pile of trash for years and years.\n\nWe all need to do our part to help the environment. Buying EarthFirst products is a small but reasonable step toward attaining that end. Keep up the good work, Mr. Orsborne!\n\nBryan Bosworth\n\nOmaha, Neb.",

        "transcript": "NOTICE\n\n\nBus route change\n\n\nBeginning Monday, May 5th, the number 312 bus will be changing its route and pick-up times. On Main Street, the bus will no longer stop at Elm, Sycamore, and Fir streets. It will add stops at Pine and Spruce streets.\n\n\nAlso, the 312 bus will travel east and west along Second Avenue, instead of Third. It will continue to stop at the same cross streets.\n\n\nFinally, the bus will be changing the timing of its stops. Starting with the current 6 a.m. run, the 312 will now arrive at each stop on the quarter hour, instead of the half. The bus will continue to operate 12 hours daily, between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.\n\n\nWe hope these changes will make the 312 more convenient for more people. The new 312 schedule is now available for free at all city 24/7 convenience stores. To see the schedule posted online, visit www.citybus.com. If you have any questions or comments about the changes, please call 555-8444 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, or email supervisor@citybus.com.\n\n\nTo: supervisor@citybus.com\n\nFrom: danadavis@jmail.net\n\nSubject: Bus 312 route change\n\n\nHello,\n\n\nI'm writing in regard to the recent changes for city bus 312. I have been riding the 312 for about three years now, catching the 7 o'clock bus at the Main and Elm stop each morning.\n\n\nI'm dismayed at the changes, because the bus will no longer stop at Main and Elm. The stop has moved to Pine Street, which is nearly three blocks away from Elm. And uphill, to boot! What was the city's thinking in cutting down the number of stops along Main?\n\n\nAlso, the new timing of the 312 stops is inconvenient for me. I start work at 7:30. Catching the bus at 7 left me plenty of time to get to work, even if traffic was bad. Catching it at 7:15 threatens to make me later for work and stresses me out. Catching it earlier, at 6:45, gets me to work too soon while forcing me to wake up earlier than necessary.\n\n\nI am sure there are others who share my concerns. Hopefully near future the city will consider making alterations in the new route and stop times based on customer comments.\n\n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\n\nDana Davis",

Think of it this way: Your company's message is virtually meaningless if no one ever encounters it.\n\n\nKerry Randall, author of many comprehensive Yellow Page advertising books, states, \"Any graphic that does not leap from the page may as well be invisible.

Two slip-ups on beam kept OSU from an even higher score.\n\nRodriguez scored a 39.375 to take the all-around title. She tied with teammate Makayla Stambaugh for the floor title with a 9.950 and took first on the beam with a 9.850.\n\nRodriguez was the No. 10 all-arounder in the country entering the meet and Stambaugh, who finished second, was No. 9.\n\nBecky Colvin hit for a 9.925 to win vault and Stambaugh won bars with a 9.900.\n\nThe biggest boost came on floor. The Beavers rolled up a season-best 49.475 with Rodriguez and Stambaugh's 9.950s leading the way. Melanie Jones, a freshman from Australia, scored a 9.900. It was her first time in the floor lineup for the Beavers this season.\n\nThe Beavers return home to Corvallis to take on Arizona on Friday.",

        "transcript": "The urban planning which has taken place in numerous European cities, especially in the postwar period, favors the needs of pedestrians and thus promotes a higher quality of life. Instead of designing the cities to accommodate large vehicles, architects and civil engineers in some European cities have decided to close major streets to traffic and transform them into healthier and more enjoyable pedestrian zones.\r\nThe city in Rotterdam in the Netherlands witnessed such a change in its infrastructure. By closing the Lijbaan Street in 1953, the city center became a welcoming, calm place, ready to thrive. Initially, the shopkeepers in the area feared that they would have to close their local businesses due to lack of traffic and customers, however the opposite happened. More and more people visited the city center and the sales rose. \r\nNowadays, we can witness a movement promoting the wellbeing of people by creating car-free zones. The two most notable examples in the USA are New York City and San Francisco. Both of these cities have transformed some of their busiest streets into people-oriented, friendly zones, perfect for walking, jogging, or cycling.\r\nThese changes reflect the shift in people’s priorities and the desire to use city space wisely.",

        "transcript": "One of the current trends in the western world concerning finance is shutting down ATMs and closing branches. This action makes digital banking a more practical alternative to going to banks which are not in the vicinity of the customers. The main reason for promoting digital banking is for banks to be able to monitor people’s spending habits and thus gather information on their customers. Moreover, due to the closure of branches, staff has become redundant, so the banks are able to boost profits by cutting down on these costs. Banks want people to use the digital alternative by making drawing cash more difficult. In economics the term which is used to describe this type of behavior is called “nudging.” In this case, it means that banks strategically make people use the digital option of handling your money, rather than the non-digital one. Banks are trying to convince people that making digital payments is a more convenient way of purchasing goods.",

It could be used to replace human organ transplants, accelerate surgical procedures, produce cheaper versions of required surgical tools, and produce custom-made prosthetics. 3D printing technology can be used to create artificial tissues by using bioprinters, which layer living cells. This way they are used for medical research connected to the creation of artificial human organs. Furthermore, 3D printing can produce patient-specific organs that help surgeons prepare for complex surgeries. By doing so, such operations can be performed faster, causing minimal trauma for the patients. Sterile surgical instruments, such as forceps and clamps can be produced using 3D printing technology. Finally, in order to improve the quality of life for people in need for prosthetic limbs, 3D printers are used to produce custom-made prosthetic pieces that fit patients perfectly, and are much cheaper than the serial production alternative.",

Wireless charging is becoming technologically attractive in different industries because it might enable small IoT (internet of things) to become more mobile by getting power from a certain distance. In fact, in 2017, an MIT physics professor Marin Soljačić managed to transfer electricity at a distance of a couple of meters; however, he achieved a power transfer of 40% efficiency, which indicated that 60% of the power was lost in translation. The same year Professor Soljačić set up WiTricity in order to commercialize the technology. It is worth noting that the 40% power-transfer efficiency has dramatically increased since then. WiTricity's primary market is the automobile industry. According to WiTricity CEO Alex Gruzen, a number of electric car manufacturers are expected to announce using wireless charging for their cars and other motorized vehicles. WiTricity technology would enable electric cars to be powered by simply parking on a large charging pad.",

        "transcript": "Presently we are living in the urban century. In approximately 30 years 2.4 billion more people are expected to live in cities, so the 21st century can be rightly called the urban century. Humanity is witnessing and participating in the greatest migration from rural into urban places, since migrants move into new urban areas. In only 10 years it is expected a new area of 1.2 million square kilometers to be built to accommodate the needs of millions of people. The cities of the future are being developed on an epic scale. This begs the question: why so many new cities are being developed? Two factors have been identified by demographers: push and pull factors. The push factors are negative and include the lack of financial prosperity in rural areas, as well as political instability. However, there are pull factors, which include the benefits from living in urban areas. The principal reasons for the growing popularity of cities is the larger number of people, their proximity, and the financial opportunities. People are social beings who wish to interact with each other, so living in cities might even be considered their natural habitat.",

In fact, more and more firms are going paperless due to a few very good reasons. Office space is extremely important, so instead of maintaining large storage cabinets full of files, managers navigate the process of transitioning into the cloud. Not only do they save money on space and rent, but the process of finding a certain document is much easier and faster. Other costs which are cut by going paperless are on postage, printers, ink, paper, etc. Moreover, clients can be billed more easily and the communication with them is timely and more effective. Digital processes make documents more secure, and there is always data backup, so accessing sensitive files is easier and more reliable.",

High meat consumption negatively affects the planet’s ecosystem and human’s health. Despite the fact that the consumption of meat increases the risk for several types of cancer, people continue to largely include meat in their diets. A 2018 survey conducted in Sydney regarding various aspects of meat consumption has shown that the majority of people are unaware of the adverse impact that meat has on their wellbeing and on the planetary health. In fact, close to 90% of the people reported eating meat. Since meat is often considered healthy and beneficial, 19% of the respondents associate it with strength. Although there are new trends that promote plant-based diets, they are still not made popular enough. One way to promote plant-based diets is to link them to vegan athletes and their achievements. There is hope that this approach will inspire more people to make changes in their dietary culture.",

Phishing messages are sent with the purpose of illegally obtaining sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, usernames, etc. Phishing messages are sent by seemingly legitimate companies, such as AliPay, Payoneer, Stripe, PayPal, or your bank, and these mails usually warn the user about a suspicious activity and ask the user to verify their accounts, passwords, usernames, etc. Users are thus deceived because they believe that they maintain communication with a trustworthy entity. One of the outcomes from phishing messages is identity theft, or credit card fraud. There are some steps that people can take to protect themselves from becoming a phishing victim. When they are contacted about verifying a certain account, they should check with the company directly before typing in any private information. Also, when PayPal contact their customers, they avoid using generic terms, but instead they use people’s actual usernames. Finally, users should avoid clicking on hyperlinks which are included in the suspicious emails, but rather go to the actual website.",

All bases should be covered before scaling the autonomous driving systems because oversights are difficult to fix later. Källenius made an executive decision to initially use the existing technology in trucks. This move came as a result from Daimler’s reality check that it will take a certain amount of time before self-driving vehicles can be used in cities. The company decided to withhold releasing autonomous cars on the streets for some time in the future. The difference between cars and trucks is that trucks spend 80% of their driving time on high-speed highways. So, if human drivers can operate the trucks in the urban areas, then everything else can be automated, which would largely reduce transportation costs, and it will make driving a truck a more attractive occupation.",

Most notable among these applications are bioprinting and custom-made prosthetics. Bioprinting is the process of layering living cells using a computer-guided pipette. The printed copies mimic real organs on a small scale, and are currently undergoing trials as a cheaper alternative to real organ transplant. Also, there has been a breakthrough in prosthetics, as 3D printing has eased the difficulty of making cheap perfectly-fitting prosthetics, which can also be designed to serve specific functions. With the rate at which 3D printing is breaking ground, there are bound to be more inventions that make life easier.",

Many manufacturing, retail, truck driving and other blue collar jobs are expected to be lost as machines and robotics continue to replace workers.  Andrew Yang, entrepreneur and candidate for President of the United States, has proposed universal basic income (UBI) as a solution to the problem with automation. UBI is an economic policy where every citizen is guaranteed payments from its government.  Under Yang’s UBI or “Freedom Dividend,” every American would receive $1,000 montly, which would be funded by consolidating government welfare programs and instituting a value added tax (VAT).  His idea to introduce UBI is becoming more popular, and well-known entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Richard Branson have now endorsed UBI.  Supporters of UBI advocate the potential benefits are abundant, such as reduced poverty and increased opportunities for people to undertake new life ventures such as starting a new business or returning to school.",

Additionally, new homes will be required to comply with other energy efficient mandates such as installing thicker insulation and tighter window and door sealings.  Aside from the environmental impact, proponents also suggest this mandate will further promote an already positive public opinion of renewable energy.  David Bywater, CEO of Vivint Solar, a company that installs residential rooftop solar energy, offered a 2016 Pew Research study that found 89% of Americans supported the expansion of solar energy, generally.  Moreover, in a more recent study published by CITE Research, a national poll showed that 70% of Americans would even support a nationwide mandate.  Bywater suggests that his company must continue to educate other states and municipalities beyond California and encourage them to become more willing to adopt solar energy.",

Meat made in laboratories could mean the end of most unethical treatment of animals and the reduction of environmental costs imposed by meat production.  However, for these companies to provide meats that are commercially viable, they will have to overcome certain barriers to entry, most notably cost and taste.  While the cost of a single patty has fallen significantly since 2013 (from $300,000 to $600 per patty), expenses will have to drop significantly lower if companies want to compete with traditional meat production.  Moreover, they will have to address issues with taste as the patties were reported to have been overly dry from a lack of fat.  Nevertheless, if successful, these companies could alter everyday eating habits, making meat consumption more ethical and sustainable for the environment.",

To alleviate this problem, The Boring Company (owned by Elon Musk) proposed drilling underground tunnels in several US cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago and Baltimore with the hopes of revolutionizing the way people travel.  Boring is now developing high-speed Loop and Hyperloop transportation systems that will enable travelers to bypass traffic and maneuver around cities much faster and more efficiently.  The systems would achieve this by transporting passengers in autonomous, underground “pods” that could travel up to 155 miles per hour with the possibility of reaching an upwards of 600 miles per hour in the future. Currently, Boring’s first system is being developed in Las Vegas, USA and is expected to be fully functional by 2021.",

SpaceX will certainly face obstacles as it moves forward with its development.  Most notably, it must develop user terminals (high-tech devices designed to receive the broadband signal on the ground) that are affordable, reliable and low maintenance.  It’s currently estimated that a single unit would cost users about $1,000, nearly $850 more expensive than SpaceX’s target price.  Moreover, in order to deliver Internet signals at competitive speeds, SpaceX must set the orbit of its broadband satellites at approximately 340 miles high, which is drastically lower than traditional telecom satellites currently orbiting at about 20,000 miles overhead.",

In 2017, The Musée du Louvre began a partnership with HTC, a Taiwan-based electronics company, to launch its new Vive Arts program.  The first VR exhibit developed by HTC was called Mona Lisa: Beyond the Glass, which allows visitors to experience a seven minute digital tour of the world’s most famous painting.  Moreover, Louvre offers an extended version of the tour to those with VR headsets to download and view for free remotely.  Dominique de Font-Réaulx, head of Louvre’s interpretation and cultural programming department, is optimistic that the museum will develop more VR experiences in the future as a means to connect information and imagination.  His goal is to develop beyond the mere educational use of VR of and begin implementing the technology in more creative, artistic, entertainment mediums.",

Science has now confirmed that people who spend a lot of time in areas with polluted air are more likely to be affected by mental disorders.\r\nSeveral studies show that children who grow up in polluted areas tend to end up in emergency rooms due to mental health problems. 1 in 7 children already suffer one mental health disorder or the other.\r\nAir polluted by toxic gases, metals and chemicals are the causes of air pollution. Air can be polluted by traffic, power plants, fires and chemicals. \r\nBecause of these particles’ small sizes, people easily breathe them in. When people breathe polluted air for long periods, the particles in the polluted air penetrate into the body and ruin the lungs. When the lungs are struggling, air cannot be circulated. Over time, the brain which is deprived of oxygen starts to suffer from the stress and the cells that help maintain mental health become inflamed. \r\nResearchers in the university of Washington say that the higher the pollution, the greater the impact on health.",

It has long been known that drones have many uses: filmmaking, broadcasting, warfare, etc. Now, air taxis are being considered for urban transport.\r\nAir taxis are small, capable of carrying a few passengers, and they are powered by batteries. The merits are enticing: They are much smaller than traditional helicopters and planes, and as such can do not really require specialized landing pads. Also, they are environmentally friendly, they cannot cause air pollution. \r\nThey are capable of short flights and they do not have to land at airports to pick or drop passengers.\r\nAnother valid concern is the safety.

Although named after a blueberry-loving  Danish King, Harald Blatand, it was invented by Ericsson in 1994 (a time when wires ruled) with the primary objective of providing a wireless solution to headphones.  It quickly became evident that it was capable of so much more. The rest, they say, is history. To function, a Bluetooth chip is required on both devices (the receiver and sender), to send small packets of data over a short radio wave. Since its invention, Bluetooth has retained its status as a primary wireless solution. This is mostly due to its affordability and its ability to maintain a stable wireless connection with low battery consumption. With IoT rapidly growing, Bluetooth has made considerable effort to meet the needs of multiple devices by releasing a new update allowing the connection of up to 7 devices at once. It’s safe to say that Bluetooth will be here for a long time.",

Some animals even die in zoos while on display.  \r\nThere are several reasons why it can be difficult to keep track of extinct species. One of the reasons is that extinction takes time. Animals do not just suddenly die off; they go one by one until the last one dies. Researchers will have to track down every last one of an animal species before they can know for sure that it has gone extinct. And so while there are many extinct species, there are also many extinctions that researchers are inconclusive on. An example is the po’ouli, a Hawaiian bird that is listed as “critically endangered and possibly extinct.” On the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\r\nAnimal extinction is getting the attention it deserves. Just that, with many measures put in place to save animals, and with many successfully rescued species like the California condor, a species of Mexican gray wolf; scientists have to be sure before they make conclusive statements.",

This is another fitting situation for the application of technology. Rather than being forced to comprehend at the pace of fellow course mates in a classroom, mobile applications and tutorial videos for language learning help students learn whenever, at their own pace.

These underrated businesses have very lucrative prospects:\r\n1.\tTraining Services\r\nOffering training services is an industry on its own. The good thing about it is that you can apply your previous knowledge, expertise and experience. It does not matter if you’ll be tutoring high school kids or teaching people how to do Yoga, offering training services is one of the fastest growing businesses around today.\r\n2.\tLogistics businesses\r\nThe world is getting smaller every day. People are completing more businesses online.  You can do business from any part of the world. The logistics and supply chain industry has never been in more demand than now. E-commerce is thriving. The great thing about logistics is that you don’t even need to own huge vans and containers. You can either host a dispatch-hailing platform or start by being a dispatch rider and scale up from there.",

ESC is designed to help prevent a driver from losing control in cases of over and under-steering.  Currently only thirteen of the twenty G20 countries follow the recommendation of the United Nations and require the ESC technology in vehicles.  However, Argentina and Brazil are expected to begin applying the regulation in 2020.  This leaves China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa as the remaining five G20 countries without any mandate on anti-skid technology.  According to a study by the U.K.’s Transport Research Laboratory, if the remaining seven G20 countries were to mandate ESC technology, this would create over $21.5 billion in economic benefit as a result of death and serious injury prevention.  A simple cost benefit analysis also supports a mandate for the technology.  The cost for installing an ESC system on a vehicle already equipped with an anti-lock braking system is around $50.  It’s estimated that an ESC system is approximately 38% effective in reducing the number of deaths in loss of control accidents.",

Spot, the semiautonomous, four-legged dog, weighs seventy pounds and walks up to three miles per hour.  The machine is capable of tasks such as walking up and down stairs, dancing, hauling trucks and opening doors.  According to American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts State Police Department (MSPD) leased Spot from Boston Dynamics for a ninety-day evaluation.  Though, Kade Crockford, director of the ALCU of Massachusetts’s Technology for Liberty Program insists that the public knows very little about how these technologies are being deployed.  It has been reported that the MSPD’s bomb squad has used Spot on two separate occasions to examine suspicious items and clear high risk areas.  However, Crockford says there must be laws in place to keep pace with technological advances to prevent police agencies from infringing upon civil liberties.  Michael Perry, VP for Business Development at Boston Dynamics, on the other hand, says they leased Spot intentionally so they could revoke a robot that was misused.  As technology continues to advance, striking a balance between civil liberty and public safety remains an extremely difficult task, indeed.",

SQ4D utilizes its Autonomous Robotic Construction System (ARCS) to 3D print houses but can also print things like roads, bridges, and commercial buildings.  Recently, the company 3D printed the largest permitted home in the world (1,900 square feet).  Total construction took a mere 48 print hours over a span of eight days and cost less than $6,000.  Even more impressive than the 70% reduction in time and costs was the system’s ability to eliminate twenty manual labor jobs, including tasks such as siding, framing, and sheathing.  Ultimately, the project required only three laborers.  SQ4D’s 3D printed houses are mold and fire resistant and can also withstand severe weather.  In the future, SQ4D anticipates that houses will be printed in half the time.",

However, problems exists as to where the food production will take place since there are often restrictions on converting forests into farms.  Shivendra Bajaj, Executive Director of the Federation of Seed Industry of India says vertical farming is one innovation that could help avert a potential crisis.  Vertical farming is the process of growing crops in vertically stacked layers in a controlled environment to optimize growth and conserve space.  Moreover, crops can be grown indoors without soil, meaning the capability of harvesting produce in, otherwise, foreign climate conditions.  This process also has a minimal carbon would footprint, which is beneficial during a time when climate change is becoming more pervasive.  Consequently, vertical farming provides an alternative means for growing fresh, nutritious, and safe produce.",

If chatbot is unfamiliar with a query, they will forward the customer to a representative that knows the answer.  If no human representatives are available, a representative will answer as soon as possible.  A chatbot might use someone’s purchase or web browsing history to identify products similar to the ones they showed interest in before but might not be aware of now.

        "transcript": "Listening to podcasts and streaming music are rapidly growing in popularity among US consumers. This new trend has attracted advertisers to find ways to monetize people’s interest in digital audio formats. Since the US population is spending more time using Spotify and Pandora, brands are starting to put their ad dollars in streaming audio. In terms of listening to podcasts, although the listeners comprise just shy of 27% of the US internet population, this part of the population is growing the fastest. As of 2019, 51% of Americans ages 12 or older have ever listened to a podcast, according to Edison Research and Triton Digital survey data. Moreover, it is predicted that more than 30% of the US listeners will access radio content via a smart speaker.",
