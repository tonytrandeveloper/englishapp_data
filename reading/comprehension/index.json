All employees who have been working for the company two years or less will receive one week (five working days) of paid vacation per year. Employees who have been working here three to five years will receive two weeks (ten working days) of paid vacation per year. Employees who have been with the company five to ten years will receive three weeks (15 working days) of paid vacation per year. Employees who have been here more than 10 years will receive four weeks (20 working days) of paid vacation per year.\n\nPlease note that this does not effect current policies for sick days and personal leave. All employees, regardless of experience, will still receive five days of paid sick leave per year, as well as two days of paid personal leave. Please post the new vacation policy in your departments as soon as possible. Also, employee handbooks are being revised to reflect the changes in vacation policy. These handbooks should be ready within the next two weeks. When they are, you are responsible to distribute them to employees, and to send us verification that each employee has received the handbook and understands the new vacation policy.\n\nThank you for your cooperation in this matter. If you have any questions, please contact me at extension 254 or the assistant HR director, Gladys Haynes, at extension 256.",

I have enjoyed having your assistance with my projects.\nAlthough the tasks we handled were not as varied as you would have liked, just think about what you and I have accomplished since September. We organized the annual small business conference, updated the association's web site, and answered scores of inquiries, many in great detail, from business owners who needed advice on a range of topics: loans, benefits, licensing, etc.\nI feel the year has been very productive for both of us. You've been an congenial and conscientious assistant and all of us have the highest regard for your abilities. Please feel free to call upon me for a recommendation if you require one for future employment.\nBest of luck,\nThomas",

A History of Sports from Ancient Times to the Present covers everything from sporting events in ancient Rome to the origins of teams sports in North America, and it includes a section on sports played on contemporary university campuses. I highly recommend the chapter with detailed instructions on how to play games that had previously been lost over time. Porter's comprehensive introduction and bibliography, as well as the time line of dates and events, make this a reference work that should be purchased by all public libraries.

This includes a donation of $2,300.00 made by robert Erwin, former trustee and president of the National Library Organization, and must be spent by December 31.\n\nMs. Johnson suggested that the trustees spend the $2,300.00 as follows: $900.00 will be allocated for books; $400.00 for supplies; and $1,000.00 for building repairs. All members present agreed.\n\nBuilding Repairs and Improvements\nMr. Elder expressed concern about the recent electricity bills, which were quite high. The issue will be discussed at the January 14 meeting after the year's budget has been reviewed.\n\nMiscellaneous Business\nMs. Sprague noted that the library building should be kept locked when it is not officially open to the public, even if staff or cleaning crews are present inside the building.\n\nMr. Elder ended the meeting at 7:00 p.m.\n\nThe next meeting will be on Thursday, December 18, at 5:00 p.m. in the Milton Public Library.",

        "transcript": "Sustainability Magazine\n\nVolume 10, No. 6\n\nJune 2009\n\n\n\nManufacturers Going Green\n\nBy Leo Durham\n\n\nAn increasing number of manufacturing companies around the country are going green, which they hope will put more green into their cash registers.\n\nThe Manufacturers Extension Partnership (MEP) works with a variety of state and regional industry associations and economic development groups to teach companies \"lean\" manufacturing techniques.\n\nThis not-for-profit organization, administered by the Department of Commerce, demonstrates how to reduce waste, or \"fat,\" in the manufacturing process. This includes things such as cutting energy use, incorporating more efficient production techniques, and finding cheaper methods of packaging and shipping goods.\n\nThe result is better not only for the environment, but also for company profits. Last year, MEP helped more than 1,000 firms save about $1.4 billion and increase their sales by $10.5 billion. These actions led to the creation of nearly 57,000 new jobs.\n\n\"It was tremendous for us,\" said Mark McCartney, general manager of the Clear Water bottled water company. \"MEP showed us how to cut our energy production in half, which led to a 3-percent increase in sales, and a 100-percent increase in production capacity.\"\n\nMcCartney has been quick to spread the wealth. Last year, a bottle of Clear Water retailed for $1.50. Now, MEP training has enabled the company to slash the price to $1.20.\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\nDear editor:\n\nI enjoyed the article on MEP in the June issue of Sustainability Magazine. When manufacturers pass savings onto customers, everybody wins.\n\nOverall, the writer did a fine job. However, there is one mistake in the article I would like to point out. After our company finished training with MEP, sales jumped 30 percent, and our production capacity increased by 10 percent.\n\nI would encourage every manufacturer to consider partnering with MEP. There's always some fat that can be trimmed from the production process.\n\n\nWilliam Lyons\n\nCEO, Clear Water Bottling",

Thank you for your usual prompt shipment. We appreciate the fast turn-around.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I noticed a couple of discrepancies between the freight and the invoice. First, the discount for the white photocopier paper does not seem to be factored into the total. We have been buying this paper from you at $100 a case, so shouldn't six cases with a 10-percent discount come to $540?\n\n\nSecond, according to my records we had 10 crates of computer chairs on back order. Are more coming? If so, what's the soonest you expect they could arrive? Also, could you please give me an idea when more color ink cartridges will be available? Our inventory is low, and we are planning to have a special sale for Halloween.\n\n\nCould you please get back to me ASAP? I need to clarify these questions before I place our October order. If you prefer to call, it's best to reach me today on my direct line: 556-424-8737.\n\n\nThanks again Marc,\n\n\nIda Velasquiz\n\nComptroller, Office Corral",

Please forgive my relatively late reply, as I was out of town and did not have a chance to read the invitation until last week.\n\nI am thrilled that my friend and former college roommate, Marilyn Strummers, is finally tying the knot. I am disappointed, however, that I will not be able to attend her milestone event. I had a vacation to China scheduled for several weeks prior to hearing Marilyn's exciting news, and subsequent efforts to rearrange my travel plans have proved unsuccessful. Ironically, my flight departs at exactly the same time as the ceremony. I'll miss Jeff and Marilyn at the airport by only a few hours!\n\nIt is with great regret that I must decline this gracious invitation, though I will contact Marilyn and congratulate her personally before I leave. Also, I would like to leave a gift for the newlyweds. Would it be appropriate to send a present to you?\n\nPlease let me know.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nPatty Pakola\n\n4334 Stone Drive\n\n555-762-0091",

Since its inception, Cost Less has rewarded managers of stores that improved their sales revenue and limited the amount of employee overtime.\n\nThese conditions will still apply, but the board has decided to factor in a third condition: the amount of loss prevented by store security. As you know, in the past year shoplifting and employee embezzlement cost our company more than $3 million. To help reverse this trend, we would like managers to be more diligent in hiring and supervising security personnel, and to be more alert in watching for possible theft.\n\nTo help encourage this philosophy, the board has voted to pay a 10-percent bonus to managers whose stores hold inventory loss to less than 2 percent of total revenues for the year. The board has also directed that each Cost Less store be given extra financial resources to help train and motivate employees to be alert for shoplifting and other types of in-store theft. Remind your employees that when merchandise is stolen or money embezzled, it hurts everyone in the company.\nAdditional details will be forthcoming in the next two months.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.",

You were more than a boss to me; you were a mentor and a friend. I will always value your advice, and will remember the lessons you have taught me. I remember the first time I missed deadline, and help up the whole paper. I was scared you would fire me. Instead you were supportive and understanding.\n\nI hope we can stay in touch, professionally and personally. I have the highest respect for your talent and leadership skills. You have the ambition and acumen to be wildly successful. I hope you and Denise will find personal satisfaction in Albany as well. I hear it's a nice city. If there's ever anything I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask.\nAll my best,\nTanya",

This is going to be a very brief review, but suffice it to say the book was erudite, insightful and an excellent revision of the tropes and stereo-types pervasive in Middle Eastern studies to this day. In the last several years I have become intimately familiar with literally thousands of sources, both primary and secondary on the region. If you have a decent foundation on the relevant literature of the period--400 BC to roughly the late 18th century AD--and are interested in the area I cannot recommend this book enough. However, if you don't, this is not a good introductory work. It is dense. The arguments can sometimes seem abstruse and arcane. And the narrative is so wide in scope that one should really have taken an introductory course in the region just to keep up. There still is no standard one volume history of what is commonly called, \"The Middle East.\" This is unfortunate. Boyles' book helps fill that role for specialists, but one is still, sadly lacking for the rest of us.\n-- Paul Robert Kingston",

We have experienced solid new member growth and continue to actively lend to our members. Helping members become homeowners, providing low rate credit cards, lending funds for new or used vehicles, and making home equity loans continue to be areas of focus for City Credit Union. While these efforts will continue, we also realize that many of our members have experienced tough economic times, and may be struggling to meet their current financial obligations. In recent weeks, we have received many letters and phone calls from members telling us about their financial situations and unique challenges. Due to the current economic climate, we have heard from members across a wide array of industries and professions; teachers, construction workers, and automotive sales to name a few, who have either lost their jobs, think they may lose their jobs, or had their household income significantly decreased. If you have not been impacted, chances are that you have a family member, friend or neighbor who has experienced financial difficulties as a result of the economy. If you are having difficulties in making any of your loan payments, whether it's your mortgage, auto, boat or RV, credit card or equity loan, we want to assure you that we are here to help you with our Member Assistance Team. This team was assembled exclusively to help members through stressful financial situations. We can help you by offering realistic solutions and may also be able to offer advice for working with other financial institutionsâ€”even if CCU  is not your primary mortgage holder. If you're experiencing difficulty in meeting your financial obligations, or worried about your future ability to do so, we encourage you to contact us as soon as possible and we will do our best to help you through these challenging times.\nCity Credit Union Member Assistance Team\n216-555-8957 or 800-555-2823 extension 5987\nmemberassistanceteam@ccu.org\n\nRemember, we have your best interests in mind.

        "transcript": "Community Care Meeting\nNov. 2nd, 2010, 7 p.m.\n1. Hopeshare presentation\nTwo representatives from Hopeshare, Leslie Graves and Rebecca Steinman, gave a presentation about their organization. Like us, they give financial aid to low-income people and help them budget their money. But they also  provide a food bank, shelter, transitional housing, transportation program, adult education, and an employment program. Their annual operating budget is about $10 million. Leslie said that Hopeshare wants to form a stronger partnership with Community Care, and explore ways we can share resources and avoid overlapping services. She recommended that we meet together at least twice a year.\n\n2. Treasurer's report\nTreasurer Jacob Hall passed out current budget figures showing our up-to-date income and expenses. He said that we have $851.52 total liabilities & capital. Our total revenues for Oct. were $1,690.97.\n\n3. Promotional plans\nRobin Sayers proposed that we produce a DVD promoting our services, which could be shown to churches and other potential donors. Gina Mauer said that it would also be good to make a brochure that could be handed to clients and distributed throughout the community. We agreed that everyone should pitch in to help write, take photos, and help with graphics and design. We set a deadline of Dec. 4th to have preliminary plans in place. Mary Burley agreed to be in charge of the project and to keep everyone on  track.\n\n4. Problems and concerns\nCommunity Care director Bill Lyons discussed the need to improve coordination between team members. He said he is working on upgrading our website so everyone can have instant access to information about clients we help and resources available to them.\n\n5. Next meeting\nWe agreed to meet again at 7 p.m. Dec. 4th at Bill's house, 1134 Midvale Ave. N.\n\nThe meeting was adjourned at 9 p.m.",

        "transcript": "The Advantage Edge\nAdvantage Tutoring creates independent readers, spellers, writers and thinkers by giving them the multi-sensory tools necessary to \"learn how to learn.\"\n\nOur one-on-one, hourly sessions stimulate three skills vital for language processing:\nPhonemic awareness - the ability to identify and order sounds within words. Symptoms of weak phonemic awareness include errors in reading (\"steam\" for stream), spelling (\"gril\" for girl) and pronunciation (\"death\" for deaf, \"pacific\" for specific).   \nConcept imagery - the ability to see the \"big picture\" when reading and listening. Persons with weak concept imagery have difficulty with reading comprehension, critical thinking and following directions.\nSymbol imagery - the ability to visualize letters within words. Weaknesses here can result in trouble with spelling, word recognition, contextual fluency and mathematics.\nOUR PROGRAMS\n\nLindamood Interactive Phoneme Sequencing (LiPS). This sequential, multi-sensory program teaches students to identify separate sound segments within words. There is particular emphasis on the vowel segments and mouth movements to help with reading and spelling.\nVisualizing and Verbalizing This unique method teaches students to broaden the visual imagery of their language. By incorporating these visualization strategies, the student expands the richness and detail of oral and written language, as well as the ability to comprehend what they've read.\n\n\"Seeing Stars\" Symbol Imagery This program teaches students to form visual images of individual phonemes (t-o) through multisyllable words (t-o-m-o-r-r-o-w), enhancing development of spelling, reading and sight word vocabulary.\n\n\"On Cloud Nine\" Mathematics This hands-on program hones competency in addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Students touch, feel, write and visualize concepts as they move from concrete to abstract math realities.\n\nFor more information, contact us at www.advantagetutoring.com",

        "transcript": "Biz Weekly\nJuly 15th, 2011\nDiabetics Need Exercise\nBy Pat Warbrouck\nFor Chris Carter, exercising is as simple as a lunchtime walk.\nCarter, a software developer, knows it's vital to find ways to do so during work days that require sitting for long stretches of time.\nHis life literally depends on it.\n\"Exercise is like the one trump card I have,\" Carter said. \"I realize that I have a lot of control over my condition.\"\nHis condition, Type 1 diabetes, robs his body of the ability to produce insulin -- a hormone needed to convert glucose (blood sugar), starches and other food into the necessary energy for daily life. This puts him at risk for a host of serious complications that includes heart disease, blindness, and nerve and kidney damage.\nThough Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, it can be controlled through a regimen of monitoring, diet and exercise. Carter keeps careful track of his glucose level, takes daily insulin shots, and keeps juice and energy bars close at hand.\nMost importantly, he said, he takes care to get enough exercise. Carter will stroll outside during lunch breaks, or hike up and down the stairs of the company parking garage.\nIt's a good example of the types of activity busy diabetics should be doing, said Dr. Arnold Asher, director of the Diabetes Health Center at Michigan Health and Science University (MHSU).\nPhysical activity helps control blood sugar in three ways, according to Dr. Asher.\nFirst, it burns glucose, ensuring energy is delivered to the body and that glucose does not build up in the blood. Second, it increases bodily sensitivity to insulin. As fitness increases, the body needs less insulin to move glucose into cells.\nFinally, exercise helps reduce weight. For overweight patients, losing about 7 percent of body fat will lower blood sugar.\n\n* * * *\n\nSound off\nEditor:\nThank you for running the article on Chris Carter in last week's issue. As a diabetic myself, it renewed my determination to make sure I get up from my desk and exercise a few minutes every day.\nI also hope your story will open the eyes of supervisors, and remind them of the importance of exercise -- not only for employees who have diabetes, but also everyone else in their office. When you're sitting at a computer all day, it's sometimes hard to tear yourself away from the screen and move around.\nI would love to see more companies encouraging employee exercise by giving them free gym classes, taking group stretching or walking breaks, and subsidizing those who walk or bike to work.\nRobert Fuda\nAnn Arbor, Michigan",

If you have not received it yet, you will shortly.\n\nI'd like to call your attention to a mistake in the invoice. Per our contract, we had agreed to waive our usual installation fee because you placed a bulk order. However, I note that in the totals at the bottom, we have billed you for a $300 install fee.\n\nRest assured we're not trying to pull a fast one on you. We're training a new person in accounting, and she neglected to delete that line item from the bottom of our standardized invoice forms.\nSo please disregard invoice # 774. We will send an accurate one to you today, without the installation fee charge. Sorry for the inconvenience, and we look forward to working with you again in the future.\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to call or e-mail.\nBest,\nJason McGraw\nPresident, CompuPros",

I'm so sorry that I have to miss it!\n\nBrad and I are going skiing in Utah that weekend. We've been planning the trip for months, and it's too late to change even though we wish we could. I'm dying to meet little Keegan! We'll be back on the ninth, and I'd like to get together ASAP after that. Would that be OK?\n\nYou must be so proud, grandma! Wow, I never thought I'd be calling you that so soon. I'm glad that Cath had a smooth delivery, and that Keegan is healthy. Thanks for sending his picture. He's a cute little guy.\n\nAnyway, we'll check the gift registries you mentioned, and I'll look forward to seeing Cath and Keegan shortly. Hope the open house goes well. I know it takes a lot to plan and host one.\n\nI'll e-mail Cathleen separately and say sorry and hi. Please give my love to Ken.\n\nSee you soon,\n\nRobin",

While this work is in progress, third-floor workers will be housed on other floors as follows: the sales department will move to the second floor, and graphic design will move to the fourth floor. Supervisors will arrange these accommodations and show staff in those departments their temporary work stations.\nWe expect the remodel to take approximately three weeks. During this time, we appreciate your cooperation in sharing space and working together. While the arrangement presents some logistical challenges, we are confident that we can meet them and work with minimal disruption to our normal routine during the remodeling period.\n\nTo make this transition as smooth as possible, it would be greatly appreciated if the third floor could be vacated, and everyone were in their new stations and ready to work, at 8 a.m. on the First. If there are questions or concerns with the new arrangement, be sure to tell your supervisors ASAP so we can tackle the problems ahead of time.\n\nThanks in advance for your patience and cooperation. Once the work is finished on the third floor, we are sure you'll agree that it was worth the time and trouble.\n\nBest,\nAlan Shepard, VP",

Sales of $2 million and BizTimes' \"Best New Business of the Year\" award?! That was more than any of us here could have imagined.\n\nI remember when you started as an intern five years ago. Time flies, doesn't it? I knew from the moment we met that you had the talent and ambition to succeed with your own company. Now that you've had a taste of it, don't rest on your laurels. I don't have to worry; I'm sure you won't.\n\nIt would be great to get together again when you have time. I'll treat you to lunch. I know it's a busy time of year. Please give me a call when you have time. I look forward to it.\n\nBest,\n\nDennis",

Gradually, we learn that the two are hiding and flirting in other personas so they can reconnect after a horrific experience, though by the time that would-be revelation comes, the movie - which had to wait two years to find a distributor - is about more than secrets.

(Last month's) meeting minutes were amended and approved\n. Chief Executive's Report:\n- Recommends that if we not able to find a new facility by the end of this month, the organization should stay in the current location over the winter. After brief discussion, Board agreed.\n- Staff member, Jackson Browne, and Swanson attended the National Practitioner's Network meeting in Atlanta last month and gave a brief extemporaneous presentation. Both are invited back next year to give a longer presentation about our organization. After brief discussion, Board congratulated Swanson and asked her to pass on their congratulations to Browne as well.\n- Drucker asserts that our organization must ensure its name is associated with whatever materials are distributed at that practitioner's meeting next year. The organization should generate revenues where possible from the materials, too.\n- Swanson mentioned that staff member, Sheila Anderson's husband is ill and in the hospital. MOTION to send a gift to Anderson's husband, expressing the organization's sympathy and support; seconded and passed.\n. Finance Committee report provided by Chair, Elizabeth Drucker:\n- Drucker explained that consultant, Susan Johns, reviewed the organization's bookkeeping procedures and found them to be satisfactory, in preparation for the upcoming yearly financial audit. Funds recommends that our company ensure the auditor provides a management letter along with the audit financial report.\n. - Drucker reviewed highlights, trends and issues from the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. Issues include that high accounts receivables require Finance Committee attention to policies and procedures to ensure our organization receives more payments on time. After brief discussion of the issues and suggestions about how to ensure receiving payments on time, MOTION to accept financial statements; seconded and passed.\n. Board Development Committee's report provided by Chair, Douglas Carver:\n- Carver reminded the Board of the scheduled retreat coming up in three months, and provided a drafted retreat schedule for board review. MOTION to accept the retreat agenda; seconded and passed.\n- Carver presented members with a draft of the reworded By-laws paragraph that would allow members to conduct actions over electronic mail. Carver suggested review and a resolution to change the By-laws accordingly. Kyumoto suggested that Swanson first seek legal counsel to verify if the proposed change is consistent with state statute. Swanson agreed to accept this action and notify members of the outcome in the next Board meeting.\n. Other business:\n- Porter noted that he was working with staff member, Jacob Smith, to help develop an information management systems plan, and that two weeks ago he (Porter) had mailed members three resumes from consultants to help with the plan. In the mailing, Porter asked members for their opinions to help select a consultant. Porter asked members for their opinions. (NOTE: Zevon noted that she was also a computer consultant and was concerned about conflict of interest in her Board role regarding this selection, and asked to be ABSTAINED from this selection. Members agreed.) The majority of members agreed on Lease-or-Buy Consultants. MOTION to use Lease-or-Buy Consultants; seconded and passed.\n- Swanson announced that she had recently hired a new secretary, Karla Writewell.\n. Assessment of the Meeting:\n- Kyumoto noted that the past three meetings have run over the intended two-hour time slot by half an hour. He asked members to be more mindful and focused during discussions, and suggested that the Board Development Chair take an action to identify solutions to this issue. Chair, Carver, agreed.\n. Meeting adjourned at 9:30 p.m.\n. Minutes submitted by Secretary, Bhata Bhatacharia.",

        "transcript": "Manufacturing Magazine\nVolume 33, No. 4\nApril 2010\n\nRevolutionary plastic\nBy Adam Munster\n\nA motto at EarthFirst Products Inc. is to \"go green wherever you are.\" In this case, wherever includes the cash register.\nThe manufacturer of environmentally-friendly plastics, started six years ago with $200,000 in seed money, projects revenues of $6 million this year and about $10 million the next. But EarthFirst President Tim Orsborne does not expect the growth to stop there.\n\n\"The sky's the limit,\" said Orsborne. \"In the world of plastic, the potential is enormous. People use disposable food-service items every day. It's a gigantic market.\"\n\nEarthFirst carved its niche in this estimated $15 billion-a-year industry by making biodegradable plastic bags from natural plant and vegetable sources rather than petroleum. It has since expanded into cutlery, including plates, trays, cups, and take-out boxes. Its website claims that if EarthFirst made all plastic disposable products in America, it could reduce annual oil consumption by 350 million barrels.\n\nThe company uses a blend of organic polymers, proteins, and plant starches such as corn and tapioca to make products that biodegrade in landfills within 36 months. Traditional plastic bags, made of high-density polyethylene, do not biodegrade and persist on the planet up to 1,000 years, according to Chicago-based ReusableBags.com.\n\nMore than 200 Taco Loco restaurants use EarthFirst's products, and the company recently struck similar deals with eight Office Universe Business Centers and 128 Super Store delicatessens.\n\nDepending on the market, Orsborne said EarthFirst goods sell in grocery stores for about the same to 10 percent more than traditional plastic cutlery, plates, and cups. His goal is to give businesses and retail customers a \"green plastic\" alternative, then let them decide if it's worth the slightly higher price.\n\nOrsborne said EarthFirst is also testing compostable products -- bioplastics that decompose within 180 days in a commercially controlled composting facility. But since there are only 48 such facilities in the United States, the chief focus will continue to be on biodegradable plastics.\n\n\"We're becoming the incubator for big plastic producers out there. We want to make sure that our core values are built into the product,\" Orsborne said.\n\n\"Did we develop sustainable materials? Sustainable packaging? I want to be able to reduce our carbon footprint.\"\n\n* * *\n\nLetters to the Editor\nDear Editor:\nRegarding the article in your April issue about EarthFirst plastic products: Bravo for Tim Orsborne!\n\nEven though they cost more, EarthFirst plastic forks, knives, spoons and plates are well worth it. I bought some for our company party last month. My supervisor initially complained about the price, but after I showed her the article, she enthusiastically supported my decision.\n\nLooking at the huge mound of dirty dishes afterward, it was comforting to know that they would biodegrade back into the soil, instead of sitting atop a pile of trash for years and years.\n\nWe all need to do our part to help the environment. Buying EarthFirst products is a small but reasonable step toward attaining that end. Keep up the good work, Mr. Orsborne!\n\nBryan Bosworth\n\nOmaha, Neb.",

        "transcript": "NOTICE\n\n\nBus route change\n\n\nBeginning Monday, May 5th, the number 312 bus will be changing its route and pick-up times. On Main Street, the bus will no longer stop at Elm, Sycamore, and Fir streets. It will add stops at Pine and Spruce streets.\n\n\nAlso, the 312 bus will travel east and west along Second Avenue, instead of Third. It will continue to stop at the same cross streets.\n\n\nFinally, the bus will be changing the timing of its stops. Starting with the current 6 a.m. run, the 312 will now arrive at each stop on the quarter hour, instead of the half. The bus will continue to operate 12 hours daily, between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.\n\n\nWe hope these changes will make the 312 more convenient for more people. The new 312 schedule is now available for free at all city 24/7 convenience stores. To see the schedule posted online, visit www.citybus.com. If you have any questions or comments about the changes, please call 555-8444 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, or email supervisor@citybus.com.\n\n\nTo: supervisor@citybus.com\n\nFrom: danadavis@jmail.net\n\nSubject: Bus 312 route change\n\n\nHello,\n\n\nI'm writing in regard to the recent changes for city bus 312. I have been riding the 312 for about three years now, catching the 7 o'clock bus at the Main and Elm stop each morning.\n\n\nI'm dismayed at the changes, because the bus will no longer stop at Main and Elm. The stop has moved to Pine Street, which is nearly three blocks away from Elm. And uphill, to boot! What was the city's thinking in cutting down the number of stops along Main?\n\n\nAlso, the new timing of the 312 stops is inconvenient for me. I start work at 7:30. Catching the bus at 7 left me plenty of time to get to work, even if traffic was bad. Catching it at 7:15 threatens to make me later for work and stresses me out. Catching it earlier, at 6:45, gets me to work too soon while forcing me to wake up earlier than necessary.\n\n\nI am sure there are others who share my concerns. Hopefully near future the city will consider making alterations in the new route and stop times based on customer comments.\n\n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\n\nDana Davis",

Think of it this way: Your company's message is virtually meaningless if no one ever encounters it.\n\n\nKerry Randall, author of many comprehensive Yellow Page advertising books, states, \"Any graphic that does not leap from the page may as well be invisible.

Two slip-ups on beam kept OSU from an even higher score.\n\nRodriguez scored a 39.375 to take the all-around title. She tied with teammate Makayla Stambaugh for the floor title with a 9.950 and took first on the beam with a 9.850.\n\nRodriguez was the No. 10 all-arounder in the country entering the meet and Stambaugh, who finished second, was No. 9.\n\nBecky Colvin hit for a 9.925 to win vault and Stambaugh won bars with a 9.900.\n\nThe biggest boost came on floor. The Beavers rolled up a season-best 49.475 with Rodriguez and Stambaugh's 9.950s leading the way. Melanie Jones, a freshman from Australia, scored a 9.900. It was her first time in the floor lineup for the Beavers this season.\n\nThe Beavers return home to Corvallis to take on Arizona on Friday.",

        "transcript": "The urban planning which has taken place in numerous European cities, especially in the postwar period, favors the needs of pedestrians and thus promotes a higher quality of life. Instead of designing the cities to accommodate large vehicles, architects and civil engineers in some European cities have decided to close major streets to traffic and transform them into healthier and more enjoyable pedestrian zones.\r\nThe city in Rotterdam in the Netherlands witnessed such a change in its infrastructure. By closing the Lijbaan Street in 1953, the city center became a welcoming, calm place, ready to thrive. Initially, the shopkeepers in the area feared that they would have to close their local businesses due to lack of traffic and customers, however the opposite happened. More and more people visited the city center and the sales rose. \r\nNowadays, we can witness a movement promoting the wellbeing of people by creating car-free zones. The two most notable examples in the USA are New York City and San Francisco. Both of these cities have transformed some of their busiest streets into people-oriented, friendly zones, perfect for walking, jogging, or cycling.\r\nThese changes reflect the shift in people’s priorities and the desire to use city space wisely.",

        "transcript": "One of the current trends in the western world concerning finance is shutting down ATMs and closing branches. This action makes digital banking a more practical alternative to going to banks which are not in the vicinity of the customers. The main reason for promoting digital banking is for banks to be able to monitor people’s spending habits and thus gather information on their customers. Moreover, due to the closure of branches, staff has become redundant, so the banks are able to boost profits by cutting down on these costs. Banks want people to use the digital alternative by making drawing cash more difficult. In economics the term which is used to describe this type of behavior is called “nudging.” In this case, it means that banks strategically make people use the digital option of handling your money, rather than the non-digital one. Banks are trying to convince people that making digital payments is a more convenient way of purchasing goods.",

It could be used to replace human organ transplants, accelerate surgical procedures, produce cheaper versions of required surgical tools, and produce custom-made prosthetics. 3D printing technology can be used to create artificial tissues by using bioprinters, which layer living cells. This way they are used for medical research connected to the creation of artificial human organs. Furthermore, 3D printing can produce patient-specific organs that help surgeons prepare for complex surgeries. By doing so, such operations can be performed faster, causing minimal trauma for the patients. Sterile surgical instruments, such as forceps and clamps can be produced using 3D printing technology. Finally, in order to improve the quality of life for people in need for prosthetic limbs, 3D printers are used to produce custom-made prosthetic pieces that fit patients perfectly, and are much cheaper than the serial production alternative.",

Wireless charging is becoming technologically attractive in different industries because it might enable small IoT (internet of things) to become more mobile by getting power from a certain distance. In fact, in 2017, an MIT physics professor Marin Soljačić managed to transfer electricity at a distance of a couple of meters; however, he achieved a power transfer of 40% efficiency, which indicated that 60% of the power was lost in translation. The same year Professor Soljačić set up WiTricity in order to commercialize the technology. It is worth noting that the 40% power-transfer efficiency has dramatically increased since then. WiTricity's primary market is the automobile industry. According to WiTricity CEO Alex Gruzen, a number of electric car manufacturers are expected to announce using wireless charging for their cars and other motorized vehicles. WiTricity technology would enable electric cars to be powered by simply parking on a large charging pad.",

        "transcript": "Presently we are living in the urban century. In approximately 30 years 2.4 billion more people are expected to live in cities, so the 21st century can be rightly called the urban century. Humanity is witnessing and participating in the greatest migration from rural into urban places, since migrants move into new urban areas. In only 10 years it is expected a new area of 1.2 million square kilometers to be built to accommodate the needs of millions of people. The cities of the future are being developed on an epic scale. This begs the question: why so many new cities are being developed? Two factors have been identified by demographers: push and pull factors. The push factors are negative and include the lack of financial prosperity in rural areas, as well as political instability. However, there are pull factors, which include the benefits from living in urban areas. The principal reasons for the growing popularity of cities is the larger number of people, their proximity, and the financial opportunities. People are social beings who wish to interact with each other, so living in cities might even be considered their natural habitat.",

In fact, more and more firms are going paperless due to a few very good reasons. Office space is extremely important, so instead of maintaining large storage cabinets full of files, managers navigate the process of transitioning into the cloud. Not only do they save money on space and rent, but the process of finding a certain document is much easier and faster. Other costs which are cut by going paperless are on postage, printers, ink, paper, etc. Moreover, clients can be billed more easily and the communication with them is timely and more effective. Digital processes make documents more secure, and there is always data backup, so accessing sensitive files is easier and more reliable.",

High meat consumption negatively affects the planet’s ecosystem and human’s health. Despite the fact that the consumption of meat increases the risk for several types of cancer, people continue to largely include meat in their diets. A 2018 survey conducted in Sydney regarding various aspects of meat consumption has shown that the majority of people are unaware of the adverse impact that meat has on their wellbeing and on the planetary health. In fact, close to 90% of the people reported eating meat. Since meat is often considered healthy and beneficial, 19% of the respondents associate it with strength. Although there are new trends that promote plant-based diets, they are still not made popular enough. One way to promote plant-based diets is to link them to vegan athletes and their achievements. There is hope that this approach will inspire more people to make changes in their dietary culture.",

Phishing messages are sent with the purpose of illegally obtaining sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, usernames, etc. Phishing messages are sent by seemingly legitimate companies, such as AliPay, Payoneer, Stripe, PayPal, or your bank, and these mails usually warn the user about a suspicious activity and ask the user to verify their accounts, passwords, usernames, etc. Users are thus deceived because they believe that they maintain communication with a trustworthy entity. One of the outcomes from phishing messages is identity theft, or credit card fraud. There are some steps that people can take to protect themselves from becoming a phishing victim. When they are contacted about verifying a certain account, they should check with the company directly before typing in any private information. Also, when PayPal contact their customers, they avoid using generic terms, but instead they use people’s actual usernames. Finally, users should avoid clicking on hyperlinks which are included in the suspicious emails, but rather go to the actual website.",

All bases should be covered before scaling the autonomous driving systems because oversights are difficult to fix later. Källenius made an executive decision to initially use the existing technology in trucks. This move came as a result from Daimler’s reality check that it will take a certain amount of time before self-driving vehicles can be used in cities. The company decided to withhold releasing autonomous cars on the streets for some time in the future. The difference between cars and trucks is that trucks spend 80% of their driving time on high-speed highways. So, if human drivers can operate the trucks in the urban areas, then everything else can be automated, which would largely reduce transportation costs, and it will make driving a truck a more attractive occupation.",

Most notable among these applications are bioprinting and custom-made prosthetics. Bioprinting is the process of layering living cells using a computer-guided pipette. The printed copies mimic real organs on a small scale, and are currently undergoing trials as a cheaper alternative to real organ transplant. Also, there has been a breakthrough in prosthetics, as 3D printing has eased the difficulty of making cheap perfectly-fitting prosthetics, which can also be designed to serve specific functions. With the rate at which 3D printing is breaking ground, there are bound to be more inventions that make life easier.",

Many manufacturing, retail, truck driving and other blue collar jobs are expected to be lost as machines and robotics continue to replace workers.  Andrew Yang, entrepreneur and candidate for President of the United States, has proposed universal basic income (UBI) as a solution to the problem with automation. UBI is an economic policy where every citizen is guaranteed payments from its government.  Under Yang’s UBI or “Freedom Dividend,” every American would receive $1,000 montly, which would be funded by consolidating government welfare programs and instituting a value added tax (VAT).  His idea to introduce UBI is becoming more popular, and well-known entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Richard Branson have now endorsed UBI.  Supporters of UBI advocate the potential benefits are abundant, such as reduced poverty and increased opportunities for people to undertake new life ventures such as starting a new business or returning to school.",

Additionally, new homes will be required to comply with other energy efficient mandates such as installing thicker insulation and tighter window and door sealings.  Aside from the environmental impact, proponents also suggest this mandate will further promote an already positive public opinion of renewable energy.  David Bywater, CEO of Vivint Solar, a company that installs residential rooftop solar energy, offered a 2016 Pew Research study that found 89% of Americans supported the expansion of solar energy, generally.  Moreover, in a more recent study published by CITE Research, a national poll showed that 70% of Americans would even support a nationwide mandate.  Bywater suggests that his company must continue to educate other states and municipalities beyond California and encourage them to become more willing to adopt solar energy.",

Meat made in laboratories could mean the end of most unethical treatment of animals and the reduction of environmental costs imposed by meat production.  However, for these companies to provide meats that are commercially viable, they will have to overcome certain barriers to entry, most notably cost and taste.  While the cost of a single patty has fallen significantly since 2013 (from $300,000 to $600 per patty), expenses will have to drop significantly lower if companies want to compete with traditional meat production.  Moreover, they will have to address issues with taste as the patties were reported to have been overly dry from a lack of fat.  Nevertheless, if successful, these companies could alter everyday eating habits, making meat consumption more ethical and sustainable for the environment.",

To alleviate this problem, The Boring Company (owned by Elon Musk) proposed drilling underground tunnels in several US cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago and Baltimore with the hopes of revolutionizing the way people travel.  Boring is now developing high-speed Loop and Hyperloop transportation systems that will enable travelers to bypass traffic and maneuver around cities much faster and more efficiently.  The systems would achieve this by transporting passengers in autonomous, underground “pods” that could travel up to 155 miles per hour with the possibility of reaching an upwards of 600 miles per hour in the future. Currently, Boring’s first system is being developed in Las Vegas, USA and is expected to be fully functional by 2021.",

SpaceX will certainly face obstacles as it moves forward with its development.  Most notably, it must develop user terminals (high-tech devices designed to receive the broadband signal on the ground) that are affordable, reliable and low maintenance.  It’s currently estimated that a single unit would cost users about $1,000, nearly $850 more expensive than SpaceX’s target price.  Moreover, in order to deliver Internet signals at competitive speeds, SpaceX must set the orbit of its broadband satellites at approximately 340 miles high, which is drastically lower than traditional telecom satellites currently orbiting at about 20,000 miles overhead.",

In 2017, The Musée du Louvre began a partnership with HTC, a Taiwan-based electronics company, to launch its new Vive Arts program.  The first VR exhibit developed by HTC was called Mona Lisa: Beyond the Glass, which allows visitors to experience a seven minute digital tour of the world’s most famous painting.  Moreover, Louvre offers an extended version of the tour to those with VR headsets to download and view for free remotely.  Dominique de Font-Réaulx, head of Louvre’s interpretation and cultural programming department, is optimistic that the museum will develop more VR experiences in the future as a means to connect information and imagination.  His goal is to develop beyond the mere educational use of VR of and begin implementing the technology in more creative, artistic, entertainment mediums.",

Science has now confirmed that people who spend a lot of time in areas with polluted air are more likely to be affected by mental disorders.\r\nSeveral studies show that children who grow up in polluted areas tend to end up in emergency rooms due to mental health problems. 1 in 7 children already suffer one mental health disorder or the other.\r\nAir polluted by toxic gases, metals and chemicals are the causes of air pollution. Air can be polluted by traffic, power plants, fires and chemicals. \r\nBecause of these particles’ small sizes, people easily breathe them in. When people breathe polluted air for long periods, the particles in the polluted air penetrate into the body and ruin the lungs. When the lungs are struggling, air cannot be circulated. Over time, the brain which is deprived of oxygen starts to suffer from the stress and the cells that help maintain mental health become inflamed. \r\nResearchers in the university of Washington say that the higher the pollution, the greater the impact on health.",

It has long been known that drones have many uses: filmmaking, broadcasting, warfare, etc. Now, air taxis are being considered for urban transport.\r\nAir taxis are small, capable of carrying a few passengers, and they are powered by batteries. The merits are enticing: They are much smaller than traditional helicopters and planes, and as such can do not really require specialized landing pads. Also, they are environmentally friendly, they cannot cause air pollution. \r\nThey are capable of short flights and they do not have to land at airports to pick or drop passengers.\r\nAnother valid concern is the safety.

Although named after a blueberry-loving  Danish King, Harald Blatand, it was invented by Ericsson in 1994 (a time when wires ruled) with the primary objective of providing a wireless solution to headphones.  It quickly became evident that it was capable of so much more. The rest, they say, is history. To function, a Bluetooth chip is required on both devices (the receiver and sender), to send small packets of data over a short radio wave. Since its invention, Bluetooth has retained its status as a primary wireless solution. This is mostly due to its affordability and its ability to maintain a stable wireless connection with low battery consumption. With IoT rapidly growing, Bluetooth has made considerable effort to meet the needs of multiple devices by releasing a new update allowing the connection of up to 7 devices at once. It’s safe to say that Bluetooth will be here for a long time.",

Some animals even die in zoos while on display.  \r\nThere are several reasons why it can be difficult to keep track of extinct species. One of the reasons is that extinction takes time. Animals do not just suddenly die off; they go one by one until the last one dies. Researchers will have to track down every last one of an animal species before they can know for sure that it has gone extinct. And so while there are many extinct species, there are also many extinctions that researchers are inconclusive on. An example is the po’ouli, a Hawaiian bird that is listed as “critically endangered and possibly extinct.” On the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\r\nAnimal extinction is getting the attention it deserves. Just that, with many measures put in place to save animals, and with many successfully rescued species like the California condor, a species of Mexican gray wolf; scientists have to be sure before they make conclusive statements.",

This is another fitting situation for the application of technology. Rather than being forced to comprehend at the pace of fellow course mates in a classroom, mobile applications and tutorial videos for language learning help students learn whenever, at their own pace.

These underrated businesses have very lucrative prospects:\r\n1.\tTraining Services\r\nOffering training services is an industry on its own. The good thing about it is that you can apply your previous knowledge, expertise and experience. It does not matter if you’ll be tutoring high school kids or teaching people how to do Yoga, offering training services is one of the fastest growing businesses around today.\r\n2.\tLogistics businesses\r\nThe world is getting smaller every day. People are completing more businesses online.  You can do business from any part of the world. The logistics and supply chain industry has never been in more demand than now. E-commerce is thriving. The great thing about logistics is that you don’t even need to own huge vans and containers. You can either host a dispatch-hailing platform or start by being a dispatch rider and scale up from there.",

ESC is designed to help prevent a driver from losing control in cases of over and under-steering.  Currently only thirteen of the twenty G20 countries follow the recommendation of the United Nations and require the ESC technology in vehicles.  However, Argentina and Brazil are expected to begin applying the regulation in 2020.  This leaves China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa as the remaining five G20 countries without any mandate on anti-skid technology.  According to a study by the U.K.’s Transport Research Laboratory, if the remaining seven G20 countries were to mandate ESC technology, this would create over $21.5 billion in economic benefit as a result of death and serious injury prevention.  A simple cost benefit analysis also supports a mandate for the technology.  The cost for installing an ESC system on a vehicle already equipped with an anti-lock braking system is around $50.  It’s estimated that an ESC system is approximately 38% effective in reducing the number of deaths in loss of control accidents.",

Spot, the semiautonomous, four-legged dog, weighs seventy pounds and walks up to three miles per hour.  The machine is capable of tasks such as walking up and down stairs, dancing, hauling trucks and opening doors.  According to American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts State Police Department (MSPD) leased Spot from Boston Dynamics for a ninety-day evaluation.  Though, Kade Crockford, director of the ALCU of Massachusetts’s Technology for Liberty Program insists that the public knows very little about how these technologies are being deployed.  It has been reported that the MSPD’s bomb squad has used Spot on two separate occasions to examine suspicious items and clear high risk areas.  However, Crockford says there must be laws in place to keep pace with technological advances to prevent police agencies from infringing upon civil liberties.  Michael Perry, VP for Business Development at Boston Dynamics, on the other hand, says they leased Spot intentionally so they could revoke a robot that was misused.  As technology continues to advance, striking a balance between civil liberty and public safety remains an extremely difficult task, indeed.",

SQ4D utilizes its Autonomous Robotic Construction System (ARCS) to 3D print houses but can also print things like roads, bridges, and commercial buildings.  Recently, the company 3D printed the largest permitted home in the world (1,900 square feet).  Total construction took a mere 48 print hours over a span of eight days and cost less than $6,000.  Even more impressive than the 70% reduction in time and costs was the system’s ability to eliminate twenty manual labor jobs, including tasks such as siding, framing, and sheathing.  Ultimately, the project required only three laborers.  SQ4D’s 3D printed houses are mold and fire resistant and can also withstand severe weather.  In the future, SQ4D anticipates that houses will be printed in half the time.",

However, problems exists as to where the food production will take place since there are often restrictions on converting forests into farms.  Shivendra Bajaj, Executive Director of the Federation of Seed Industry of India says vertical farming is one innovation that could help avert a potential crisis.  Vertical farming is the process of growing crops in vertically stacked layers in a controlled environment to optimize growth and conserve space.  Moreover, crops can be grown indoors without soil, meaning the capability of harvesting produce in, otherwise, foreign climate conditions.  This process also has a minimal carbon would footprint, which is beneficial during a time when climate change is becoming more pervasive.  Consequently, vertical farming provides an alternative means for growing fresh, nutritious, and safe produce.",

If chatbot is unfamiliar with a query, they will forward the customer to a representative that knows the answer.  If no human representatives are available, a representative will answer as soon as possible.  A chatbot might use someone’s purchase or web browsing history to identify products similar to the ones they showed interest in before but might not be aware of now.

This new trend has attracted advertisers to find ways to monetize people’s interest in digital audio formats. Since the US population is spending more time using Spotify and Pandora, brands are starting to put their ad dollars in streaming audio. In terms of listening to podcasts, although the listeners comprise just shy of 27% of the US internet population, this part of the population is growing the fastest. As of 2019, 51% of Americans ages 12 or older have ever listened to a podcast, according to Edison Research and Triton Digital survey data. Moreover, it is predicted that more than 30% of the US listeners will access radio content via a smart speaker.",

Most internet users search information online by using their smartphones, although presently there are other channels that can be used as well. It is estimated that approximately a quarter of a billion US internet users will search for information on the internet at least on a monthly basis. Using smartphones to search for information online indicates that people need such access on the go, but also in the comfort of their homes. Nevertheless, mobile searches still convert at lower rates than PC ones. US internet users usually start searching for products on Amazon if they have a clear idea of what they wish to purchase.

England’s former chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies has said that the loss of effective antibiotics would result in deaths caused by common infections. Bacterial mutations are the reason for the ineffectiveness of numerous antibiotics, so researches are tirelessly searching for new sources of drugs. However, there might still be some hope in this apocalyptic scenario. One cannabis compound, cannabigerol (CBG) was exceptionally effective at killing MRSA,  which is one of the most common superbugs found in hospitals. Tests showed that CBG also killed the persister cells of MRSA, which are responsible for the repetition of infections. After the effectiveness of CBG has been established in the lab, the scientists started animal testing. The study, which is under review at the ACS Infectious Diseases journal, showed that CBG cured mice of MRSA infections, making it as effective as vancomycin.",

Some of them are gastric balloons, which have been designed to break down when they receive light from a swallowable LED. Gastric balloons could replace some invasive medical procedures in the future. Moreover, there can also be other medical applications of this method, such as delivering drugs to a desired location in the human body at a specific time. Medical personnel would be able to control the balloons through the LED. The gastric balloons are made of a hydrogel and can be devised to survive or break down in different environments. Researchers carefully select the wavelength of the light so that the surrounding tissues would stay intact. Light-degrading materials have been used prior to this method, and the use of a controlled trigger, which can pass through the body, can open the door to new possibilities. One of the greatest benefits would be the opportunity for doing non-invasive surgeries.",

In fact, the market for co-living spaces there has nearly tripled in the last two years. Presently, there are between 1,000-1,500 co-living habitants and at least 15 co-living occupancies, according to investment management company, JLL. A typical unit, resembling a Japanese-style capsule hotel, measures 2x1x1 meters and cost as low as $450 per month to rent. Units normally have multiple bathrooms, a kitchenette and a laundry area, which can accommodate six or more adults in tight corridors. According to City University Professor, Yip Ngai-ming, who studies how young people live in Hong Kong, co-living seems to be beneficial for all parties involved. For tenants, co-living offers an opportunity for more independence at relatively low costs as well as intellectual discourse with their peers. For operators and investors, they have more flexibility to adjust rents as this lifestyle continues to grow in popularity.",

The company threatens the traditional hotel market, where profits have been on the decline, according to research conducted at Harvard and MIT. But rather than simply improving existing properties and loyalty programs, solutions customary in the hotel industry, Marriott has decided to follow Airbnb’s lead and create a home sharing program of its own. Stephanie Linnartz, global CCO of Marriott, says they’ve embraced that technology platforms have increased the availability and affordability of home rentals and B&Bs. A study conducted by hospitality market research firm, Phocuswright, found that 3 in 10 travelers booked a private rental in 2018. To compete in this market and distinguish itself from Airbnb, Marriott’s Homes & Villas program now offers 5000 premium and luxury homes for rent in 190 locations around the world.",

The helicopters are operated by its partner, HeliFlite, a licensed FAA/DOT carrier. Uber insists safety is its top priority, providing that HeliFlite has acquired ARGUS Platinum and Wyvern Wingman safety ratings. The helicopters are also dually piloted and operated with a Safety Management System, which uses trend analysis and hazard reporting for accident prevention. For its trial run, Uber offered helicopter services for those travelling between the Manhattan or Brooklyn areas and JFK International Airport.

Not since the United States and Soviet Union were engaged in a space race during the 1960s has there been this much aspiration to explore outer space. This year, the United States will begin its Artemis program, which will provide for future manned deep-space missions, the Lunar Gateway space station to orbit the Moon and a manned moon landing by 2024. The U.S. also plans to send its Mars 2020 rover sometime in July or August, when the Earth at Mars are in optimal positions for travel between the two. The mission will be the first of many designed to collect rocks for research and return them to Earth by 2030. Europe will be vital to the Artesmis missions, as it will power the Orion capsules sent into orbit. Europe also plans to send its own Exo Mars rover, which is capable of drilling for rock much deeper than the U.S.’s Mars 2020. However, the craft is currently experiencing landing problems, which could postpone the mission until 2022. By late 2020, China plans to be the third country to successfully bring lunar soil back to Earth, with the hopes of completing successful manned lunar landings in the future. Like the U.S. and Europe, China is preparing its own mars landing this year since failing previously in its 2012 partnered mission with Russia. The UAE’s Hope Mars Mission will also be launched around the same time as the others with plans to study why Mars experienced such drastic climate changes. India will attempt its second rover moon landing after failing previously. Japan is also preparing for the return of samples from its 2018 probe of Bennu, a carbon-rich asteroid that scientists believe contains materials that were once the ingredients of the solar system. Indeed, 2020 will be an exciting year for the global community of space exploration.",

        "transcript": "At NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, the Gaseous Lunar Oxygen from Regolith Electrolysis (GaLORE) project team is currently developing a device could melt the dirt and dust on the Moon made from crushed rock, also called lunar regolith, and turn it into oxygen. The process requires oxidized metals to be heated to more than 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit and then an electric current to be passed through the molten material, a process called electrolysis. This causes a chemical reaction that separates gaseous oxygen from the metals. Experts in the field say there are a few technological challenges limiting the application, however. The high temperatures and high iron content in the soil makes for harsh conditions. They also need instrumentation that can withstand extreme conditions on the Moon and operate autonomously. However, if the GaLORE team succeeds in developing this technology, oxygen could then be mass produced on the Moon. The oxygen could be used by astronauts to breathe or it could serve as an oxidizer for fuel. The metal byproducts would not go to waste either as they could be used for building infrastructure and to 3D print the necessary tools and equipment for sustaining human life there and beyond.",

The two most common systems used are called two-step authentication and two-factor authentication. Mistakenly, people use these terminologies interchangeably; however, they are different. In fact, two-factor authentication is more secure than two-step authentication. Two-step authentication requires the user to first enter the correct password and then enter a one-time password (OTP) sent via email or SMS; a two-step, one-factor authentication. In this situation, a hacker could potentially gain access to the account with just the knowledge of both pieces of information. Two-factor authentication, on the other hand, requires the user to first enter the correct password and then approve the attempted sign in from a second device; a two-step, two-factor authentication. In this situation, the hacker could gain access to the account only with both knowledge of the password and physical possession of the second device. The distinction here is important for knowing how secure one’s private accounts really are.",

With enough data, MIT hopes to teach the supercomputer algorithms it can then use to solve problems on its own. Beyond this level of problem solving lies the point of singularity, which is a permanent threshold when unsupervised AI becomes capable of performing tasks indistinguishable from humans. Also known as the Turing Test, AI that could pass this test would have surpassed human intelligence and be able to autonomously improve upon itself at an acceleratingly infinite rate. Many great minds believe MIT’s accomplishment is a sign that singularity is inevitably close. For example, Ray Kurzweil, Google’s director of engineering, predicts computer intelligence will be comparable to humans by 2029 and reach singularity by 2045. According to him, humans will ultimately merge with AI, effectively multiplying their intelligence by a billion.",

Robotics can help improve surgical procedures by lessening the invasiveness and, ultimately, the recovery time for patients. But robots aren’t exactly replacing surgeons, who still need to control the robots with a remote console. Still, surgeons are not discouraged by the fact that robots are now operating on their patients instead of them. Rather, they have reported numerous benefits to using the technology: increased magnification, 3D, HD vision, 360 degree movement and 7 degrees of freedom. Surgeons can also plan a surgery virtually, which essentially personalizes the procedure specifically for the patient and gives everyone an opportunity to see the likely outcome of the surgery. Robotic surgeries are reportedly less stressful, more effective than open surgeries and expected to be used much more in hospitals moving forward.",

The methods reach beyond the area of traditional medicine and include a wider range of practices. Some people do more common things like Vipassana meditation, intermittent fasting, consuming high doses of daily supplements and tracking sleep. Others may delve into stranger techniques such as stem cell injections, bathing in infrared light, cryotherapy, neurofeedback and wading in virtual float tanks. The goal of biohacking also differs among proponents but, for the most part, is typically to optimize health to the highest achievable levels. This means being as smart and as strong as possible, for as long as possible. According to Gerontologist, Aubrey de Grey, people will live to be 1,000 years old and the first person who will live to be 1,000 is actually already born. He supports this claim based on his current research on repairing different types cellular and molecular damage that is associated with aging.

Historically, the microchips were used for things like organizing products and warehouses or locating livestock and stray pets. Now, the technology is becoming experimented with human use. Jowan Osterlund, owner of the microchip implant company, Biohax, has personally implanted hundreds of people. He says the procedure is a way to intergrade biology and technology, allowing recipients to use the implants to do things like riding the train, paying for gym memberships and accessing work spaces. His company is also looking to eliminate the need for other mundane things like passwords, keys, tickets and access cards. Another tech company in the microchip business is Dsruptive, owned by Hannes Sjoblad. His company is looking to revolutionize the way technology interacts and supports people who track their health. For example, the chip could be used to collect health data and provide blood oxygenation levels, temperature, heart rate and breathing patterns. While Osterlund and Sjoblad are optimistic about the use of microchipping, others are skeptical about its implications. Urs Gasser, executive director at Harvard’s Center for Internet and Society, says microchipping raises different legal and ethical questions, as it could be used to control workers. Ifeoma Ajunwa, professor of labor and employment law at Cornell University, added that microchips raise concerns with increased worker surveillance. However, Osterlund and Sjoblad push back, arguing the fear associated with microchips is less rooted in privacy concerns and more just an irrational prejudice against implants.",

        "transcript": "Since low literacy plays a great role in people’s well-being and countries’ economies, teachers make an effort to increase literacy among middle and high school students. The educational process is different for every student, so teachers try to tailor their lessons to fit the needs of every student. One way to modernize the learning process is through the use of technology in the classroom.  In fact, text-to-speech apps can be highly beneficial for students who lag behind. This app is particularly helpful for students that have learning disabilities, such as dyslexia. As the name suggests, students are able to listen to the text as they read it, which increases the level of comprehension. Another benefit from using technology arises from children’s interest in video and computer games. Educational games can help students master grammar rules and enrich their vocabulary. This way, students are motivated to learn more in an engaging manner.",

Excessive screen time has a tremendously negative effect on the physical, as well as the mental health of an individual. Children often spend hours looking at a screen, and one of the reasons for doing so is the behaviour of their parents. Children adopt behavioural patterns based on what they perceive while watching others. Parents often spend a great amount of time on their laptops and smartphones, so children often feel neglected since the quality of communication between children and parents has decreased. Digital technology often serves as a major distractor in the home, so the parents’ technoference will almost certainly have a negative effect on children’s emotional state. Children thrive when they feel heard, safe, and loved, so it is advisable for parents to switch off their phones and try to be present in the moment.",

        "transcript": "A debt instrument is an agreement between two parties, one that loans the money and another that borrows it. There have been recent discussions regarding the potential use of blockchain and tokenization instead of traditional debt instrumentation. Blockchain technology would essentially eliminate the need for legacy banking channels, thus avoiding commissions otherwise paid to banks. Instead, governments overseeing the entire process would provide their own national tokens to the lenders as debt-tokens and a separate national cryptocurrency to loan beneficiaries. This would increase potential for direct peer-to-peer (p2p) investment between parties. The transparent nature of blockchain would also provide clarity as to the amount lent, the number of tokens issued and the beneficiaries of the funding. Tokens could be programmed to execute other parts of the contract as well, such as extending a loan or paying the taxes owed under the contract. Investors who wanted to leave their investment could even trade and sell their tokens on the open market. Ideally, blockchain and tokenization could be the tools necessary to reduce, even eliminate, wealth inequality stemming from pay to play lobbyism and other forms of political corruption.",

Rather than allowing the tech giants like Facebook and Google to reap the benefits from advertisers, OzoneAI gives its users more control over which companies have access to their data. Under their model, companies can buy anonymized data from the users directly rather than purchase it from third party tech giants. A user’s data is first collected from their different accounts and apps like Spotify, Amazon and other social media and then fed into the app’s machine learning engine to make recommendations for other companies to use to better advertise and target customers. OzoneAI then takes their 30% cut from the businesses who subscribe to use their services and pays data owners the remaining 70%. Many people are skeptical giving a company free access to all of a user’s online accounts. However, OzoneAI insists that users decide how much data they want to sell. That data is then encrypted onto its servers and each user holds a private key to their personal data. Users also retain the power to essentially destroy any data OzoneAI has collected. For those seeking to level the playing field and finally profit from their privacy data, this new startup is creating opportunities to do so.",

        "transcript": "Presently, the US government is conducting multiple investigations of the business practices of the four big tech giants, Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. These investigations stem from complaints brought by smaller competing companies, which could ultimately lead to the breakup of the larger tech companies or forced changes in the way they operate. One complaint came from the wireless speaker company, Sonos, who alleges that companies like Google and Amazon are so profitable in other areas of their businesses, they are able to sell products at artificially low prices to crush their competitors. Another complaint from PopSockets, a cellphone grip maker, states that it is often subject to Amazon’s corporate bullying because of the power asymmetry that exists between Amazon and its suppliers. There has also been accusations of patent infringement, complaining that Google and Amazon will conduct a cost benefit analysis before determining whether to violate a patent or not. That is, if the companies stand to profit more than the cost of defending a potential lawsuit, they will proceed with violating the patent—allegedly. While these claims remain mere accusations, US Congress is taking them seriously and will decide what, if any, corrective measures it needs to take to make competition fairer for everyone.",

Though it’s been heavily debated as to whether Airbnb is benefitting the right people. Primarily, studies have suggested that the number of Airbnb listings in a given area directly correlates with increased housing and long-term rental costs. For instance, the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) found that with each 10 percent increase in Airbnb listings in a given U.S. ZIP code, there was also a rental price increase of .42 percent. Another issue raised is the effects Airbnb has had on jobs. Particularly, Airbnb displaces the need for hotel employees because more people are renting Airbnbs, not booking hotel rooms. Furthermore, Airbnbs are often treated differently than traditional accommodation entities and often times taxed differently as a result. There have also been issues with incomplete accounting and illegal rentals that have likely contributed to hundreds of million in lost lodging taxes. Overall, society must consider whether Airbnb’s model strikes the right balance. After all, those who benefit the most are travelers and wealthy homeowners, while local workers and long-term renters suffer the consequences.",

The benefits of cryptocurrency are abundant as it provides a secure, traceable and public transaction between parties. To make receiving crypto possible for political campaign funding, the United States Federal Election Commission created guidelines for politicians to lawfully accept Bitcoin. Nonetheless, since 2014, there have only been a handful of politicians, including Andrew Hemingway, Dan Elder and Sen. Rand Paul, who have accepted the digital asset to help fund their campaigns. In fact, the number of politicians not accepting cryptocurrency far outweigh the pioneers accepting crypto donations. Some politicians, like Hillary Clinton, have even outright rejected crypto donations in the past. Opponents have cited issues like excessive anonymity, volatility, and potential for fraud. However, crypto continues to withstand criticism, as political candidates such as Rep. Eric Swalwell, Agatha Bacelar and Andrew Yang have all recently embraced cryptocurrency as a form of funding for their campaigns. If cryptocurrency is to become more widely accepted to fund political campaigns, legislators must keep pace with the growing technology to ensure the benefits are fully realized while mitigating the potential negative consequences.",

        "transcript": "In California, legislatures are seeking to create a law that would force some “gig work” companies to treat their workers as employees and not independent contractors. The consequences of such a law would be to require these companies to follow certain employment laws. Take Uber, for example, who would have to pay its drivers a minimum wage and provide them with other employee benefits like health care. On the other hand, drivers would have to follow more strict rules like wearing uniforms and driving standardized vehicles. They would also have less freedom to set their own hours or reject rides. There would also be employment taxes paid on these new wages, which, Uber argues, would increase their costs by 20%. However, it remains unclear whether customers would be forced to pay higher rates, whether drivers would be paid less than 75% of the cost of the ride, or both. Uber also insists they would not be obligated to follow the law because they are an app, not a transportation company. Either way, treating Uber drivers and other gig workers like employees would provide additional employment benefits but might also increase costs for everyone involved and limit freedom generally associated with freelance work.",

        "transcript": "Recently, Facebook announced the launch of its new Off-Facebook Activity tool, which tracks its users even when they are not using the platform. Essentially, other companies are supplying Facebook with information related to a user’s real-world activity that is then used to create target ads and a more personalized experience once users log back into their accounts. By logging in to Facebook, users are able to see which apps and websites have provided data to Facebook. One Vox reporter recently reported she found 518 apps and websites had shared her personal data in some manner. The offsite data collection is so intense, it might make users wonder how the targets ads could be so specifically tailored to them. Though, there are options under the Off-Facebook Activity tool that can limit individual companies from sending data to Facebook and turn off ads based on data from its partners. Moreover, users can even opt out of real-world data collection all together. However, Facebook says it will continue to receive data from the apps and websites accessed by users, but the information would no longer be associated with the user’s account. Ultimately, trying to eliminate all Facebook data collection seems like a futile endeavor but at least there is some control being given to users.",

        "transcript": "Scientists are continuing to study the effects cellular reprogramming has on the aging process. Research began in 2006, when Drs. Takashia and Yamanaka demonstrated their ability to reprogram certain tissue cells in mice to behave like embryonic stem cells and become any other cell type in the body. Later in 2011, a group of French researchers, including Jean-Marc Lemaitre, were successful in rejuvenating aged tissue cells collected from people over 100 years old. Similar to the 2006 study, the reprogrammed cells no longer expressed themselves like aged tissue cells but behaved in a youthful manner and were indistinguishable from young tissue cells. Subsequently in 2016, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte and his research team, rejecting the traditional notion that rejuvenating cells outside of a petri dish was impossible, showed the possibility of reprogramming cells inside a living animal. The mice tested showed improvements in their appearance, spinal curvature, skin, and other major organs. Though, the study reported that signs of aging returned as soon as they stopped treatment. Scientists suggest replicating similar results in humans presents an even greater challenge and, ideally, would not require constant treatment like was necessary in mice. The potential here is great as science moves closer towards preventing, or possibly curing, the diseases associated with aging.",

        "transcript": "Nike recently released its newly popular Vaporfly running shoes, which have raised concerns in athletics. Namely, the shoes use embedded carbon-fiber plates, ultra-springy compressed foam and thicker midsole technologies designed to propel the runner much quicker and reduce energy loss. This has translated into shorter finishing times at competitions. Kenyan marathon runner, Eliud Kipchoge, who wore the Alphafly version of the shoes during his run, just became the first man to run a marathon in under two hours. The next day, Brigid Kosgei, who was also wearing a modified version of the Vaporfly shoe, was able to set a new women’s marathon world record of 2:14.04. World Athletics, the athletic governing body previously known as IAAF, is currently investigating the technology to determine whether it will amend its current rules or not. They may, for example, limit foam depth or restrict the amount of carbon-fiber that can be present in shoes. In the past, there have been added restrictions on shoes for long jumpers and high jumpers, as well as bans on certain swimsuits for swimmers. However other technologies, like skinsuits for skiers, hinged blades for speed skaters, and aero bars and disc wheels for cyclers, ultimately became standard equipment. While it remains unclear how World Athletics will rule in this case, the governing body will undoubtedly provide clarity on what is permissible for competition.",

        "transcript": "Nootropics refers to any natural or synthetic substance that could positively impact mental skills and boost brain power. Generally, nootropics can be classified into three categories: dietary supplements, synthetic compounds, and prescription drugs. Technically, caffeine found in coffee and tea is considered a nootropic. However, people have also experimented with medications designed to treat other problems like memory loss, attention deficit, and sleep disorders. Though many of these drugs are not recommended for healthy people as there could be unintended side effects that result from taking them. Supplementing with certain amino acids (L-theanine and creatine) and nutrients with amino acid-like properties (CDP-choline) has more promising results and could improve memory and increase energy levels. Though, whether nootropics actually work remains debated among doctors. Barry Gordan, MD, PhD at Johns Hopkins Medicine remains skeptical of memory-boosting supplements and says there is no strong evidence that they are helpful or safe. Chris D’Adamo, PhD at the University of Maryland’s Center for Integrative Medicine says there is potential for the drugs to help people think more clearly and could reduce the chances of cognitive decline associated with aging. Ultimately, professionals recommend people to consult with their doctors to discuss the potential health risks associated with taking any supplement.",

For instance, 5G-compatible devices will need just a few seconds to download an HD film weighing about 10Gb. Another benefit of the new cellular technology is its omnipresence: 5G will have coverage literally everywhere. Combined, these factors create the perfect conditions for active IoT development and adoption. 5G will allow manufacturers to enhance automation in plants by creating complex IoT-based ecosystems. This will lead to improved production efficiency and lower risk of human error. The combination of 5G and IoT will also transform the cities we live in. A fast and reliable internet connection and its ubiquitous coverage will bring autonomous vehicles closer to reality. At the same time, traffic sensors, smart street lights, emergency detection systems, and other IoT-based solutions will make urban spaces more convenient and much safer. Large telecommunications carriers have already started a limited rollout of the 5G service in several countries, including the US, South Korea, Germany, and Australia. Now, it’s projected that nearly 65% of the world's population will have access to the 5G internet by 2026.",

        "transcript": "Imagine a future where your mind could be scanned and uploaded. Though we are far from achieving this goal, scientists have pondered the idea of mind uploading for many years. How could it be done? The first place to start is by studying the human brain. The human brain has at roughly 86 billion neurons and each are connected by at least a trillion synapses. There are hundreds, possibly thousands, of different types of synapses, or connections, and each functions in a slightly different way. Regardless of the synapse type, all of these connections would need to be mapped out in a person’s mind. But currently, our understanding of the human brain isn’t as advanced yet. Scientists can accurately scan a person’s brain with resolutions of half a millimeter using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); however, to detect a synapse, scientists would need to scan at a resolution of a thousandth of a millimeter. Unfortunately, the kind of technology needed to safely scan a person’s brain without frying the brain tissues does not exist yet. The next challenge would be to recreate the information digitally. For this to happen, computing power and storage would be needed, two things that are continually developing and improving each year. The last challenge would be to ensure that all the necessary information would be accurately captured. But even with current technology and science, it’s still not enough. Even if mind uploading were achieved, there would still be ethical and philosophical matters to consider. The real question is not whether mind-uploading technology can be developed, but rather, should it be developed.",

        "transcript": "The possibility of developing mind-reading technology has been something humans have wondered about for many years. The ability to detect brainwave patterns is possible; however, the missing link is the ability to interpret them. Finally, thanks to artificial intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning, scientists can now begin to better understand the human mind. Researchers have begun to develop software that takes readouts from people’s brains and allows them to interpret the various brainwaves as the subjects match them to words or pictures. Once a person’s brain is mapped, future readouts can be read, interpreted, or used for different mind-reading or mental-control applications. MIT researchers have developed a prototype in the form of a wearable headset called AlterEgo that can recognize internal speech. So far, the system can only recognize 100 words, but researchers are in the process of expanding its vocabulary. AlterEgo could potentially be used for communication in loud environments, helping those who cannot speak, and communication during private military missions. In addition to reading and interpreting words, mind-reading research is also gaining ground in reading visuals. Though mind-reading technology and applications have a long way to go before they can be readily made available to the public, the potential to combine humans and computers is within reach.",

        "transcript": "The placebo effect is an unexplained phenomenon in which a person can feel a benefit from an inert, or inactive, drug or sham treatment. Doctors have used the term ‘placebo’ since the 1700s and a placebo is known as a fake drug or treatment that miraculously improves a person’s health symptoms. In order to be convincing, placebos had to mimic the real drug or treatment; so, they took the form of sugar pills, water-filled injections, and even sham surgeries. Soon, doctors realized that tricking people in this way could be used to test and evaluate new drugs and treatments. However, this practice raised ethical concerns, and as a result, placebos are no longer used in this way. The effects of the placebo effect are still not fully understood. Some believe that instead of being real, the placebo effect is confused with other factors, such as patients giving false improvement reports to their doctors in order to gain approval. Others believe that if a person unknowingly took a fake drug, their expectations of recovery trigger physiological factors that end up improving their symptoms. However, we should not be so quick to praise the placebo effect as someone may miss out on drugs, treatments, or therapies that are actually proven to work. Even so, the placebo effect is an interesting occurrence that will continue to remain a mystery to us all.",

        "transcript": "The current rhino poaching crisis began in 2008, with increasing numbers of rhino killed for their horn throughout Africa until 2015. Thankfully, poaching numbers have decreased across Africa since the peak of 1,349 in 2015. Yet, a rhino is still killed every 10 hours: there is still a lot more to do.\r\nSouth Africa has by far the largest population of rhinos in the world and is an incredibly important country for rhino conservation. From 2007-2014 the country experienced an exponential rise in rhino poaching – a growth of over 9,000%. Most illegal activity occurs in Kruger National Park, a 19,485 km2 of protected habitat on South Africa’s north-eastern border with Mozambique.\r\nWhat is rhino horn? Rhino horns are similar in structure to horses’ hooves, turtle beaks, and cockatoo bills. They are made of keratin – in rhinoceros horn, it is chemically complex and contains large quantities of sulphur-containing amino acids, particularly cysteine, as well as tyrosine, histidine, lysine, and arginine, and the salts calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate.\r\nAccording to traditional Chinese texts, such as Li Shih-chen’s 1597 medical text “Pen Ts’ ao Kang Mu”, rhino horn has been used in Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years and is used to treat fever, rheumatism, gout, and other disorders. It also states that the horn could also cure snakebites, hallucinations, typhoid, headaches, carbuncles, vomiting, food poisoning, and “devil possession.”\r\nThere has been a recent surge in demand for rhino horn in Vietnam, where it is being hailed as a hangover cure and treatment for terminal illnesses plus many more uses.\r\nA survey, carried out by TRAFFIC in 2013, identified that the motivation for consumers buying rhino horn is the emotional benefit rather than medicinal, as it reaffirms their social status among their peers. Image and status are important to these consumers, they tend to be highly educated and successful people who have a powerful social network and no affinity to wildlife. Rhino horns are sometimes bought for the sole purpose of being gifted to others; to family members, business colleagues or people in positions of authority.",

But in today’s world, those same consumers can now interact with their own digital space.\r\nAs technology progresses, we, as consumers, are getting used to constantly new and impressive technological features. Virtual reality has become a comparatively recent trend in the high-tech development having become incredibly popular with the consumer.\r\nVirtual reality is a computer-generated reality that is meant to substitute the “real reality”. It can either stimulate or differ completely from the real world. By putting on special headsets, a person can get immersed in the computer-generated sensibility that highly resembles the actual world around us.\r\nWhat is the purpose of virtual reality? Virtual reality technology is used to create immersive experiences that can help educate and even entertain consumers. Outside of its popular gaming use, virtual reality is applied in a variety of industries, such as medicine, architecture, military and others.\r\nThere are certain advantages to virtual reality:\r\n-         It creates interest – for some it’s more enjoyable than reading.\r\n-         It improves educational value – doctors take advantage of the VR technology to know about the new traits of medicine.\r\n-         It helps to overcome language barriers, especially in the field of education.\r\n-         It allows students to get engaged - With the introduction of the Virtual Reality technicality, interaction with the student has become so easy\r\nAlthough there are many more advantages, there are also disadvantages:\r\n-         People get involved too much in virtual reality, and, thus, lose interest in the actual reality.\r\n-         There is no scope for positive interaction in a classroom situation.\r\n-         Ineffective human connections.\r\n-         It is addictive - People already spend too much time staring at the computer screens or smartphones, and virtual reality would lead to more time staring at a screen, removed from reality.",

They take cold showers in the morning, swim in chilly lakes and oceans, and even hop into baths filled with ice. But why? Cold water lovers swear by the benefits of this activity. They emerge shivering from the water, but with smiles on their faces. Dutch cold water pioneer Wim Hof, nicknamed “The Ice Man,” has even climbed Mount Everest wearing nothing but a pair of shorts and shoes! While it would be unsafe for you to just hike up a freezing mountain with zero experience and hardly any clothes on, there are actually a number of scientifically proven benefits of cold water therapy. First, it increases circulation and decreases inflammation in your body, helping to relieve pain. Getting into cold water also improves our mental health and resilience, as it triggers the release of “feel-good-chemical” serotonin in the brain, while it also forces us to deal with an uncomfortable or scary situation. Finally, contrary to popular belief, taking a cold water plunge won’t make us sick, it actually fortifies our immune system. This is because the shock of getting into cold water forces our body to produce more white blood cells, which fight off viruses like the common cold. As The Ice Man says, “A cold shower a day keeps the doctor away!”",

However, they weren’t even looking for this cell, in fact they discovered it by accident! The researchers from Cardiff University in Wales were actually testing samples of human blood, hoping to find cells that could fight bacteria, but instead they stumbled upon a completely new type of T-cell. This T-cell can scan the body for cancerous cells and attack them, while leaving healthy tissues unharmed. This works similarly to the way in which white blood cells can kill an infection. The discovery of this cancer-killing cell represents a monumental moment in the hunt for a cure to cancer for two reasons. First, it suggests that many members of the public may already be immune to cancer. Secondly, if scientists can find a way to control, modify and distribute these cells, they could be provided to all cancer patients. However, progress is only beginning now. So far, scientists have only tested this research on animals and cells in the laboratory. There are many more safety precautions and tests needed before they can begin trialling it on humans.",

Grains and cereals were recommended, while red meat and eggs were frowned upon. But in the last decade, the conventional wisdom has been questioned. More and more people are doing the complete opposite, and have begun eating a high fat, low carbohydrate diet. They claim that this diet actually leads to weight loss, because it forces the body to use fat as fuel, rather than the sugar that is formed by carbohydrates. Science is divided over whether this diet is actually healthy though, as some experts claim that it can prevent heart disease, while others claim that it can cause it. Also, the type of fat that people consume is coming the topic of a lot of debate. Some people trying this diet eat lots of red meat and dairy products, while others lower their animal fat consumption and fill up on natural fats like avocado, almonds, olive oil and macadamia nuts.  However, one thing that nutritionists seems to agree on is that certain refined and processed carbohydrates such as white bread, white rice and breakfast cereals are indeed quite bad for us, as they contain a lot of sugar.

        "transcript": "In 1962, French geologist Michael Siffre became curious about darkness and isolation. The nature of his job meant that he spent a lot of time underground, and this made him curious about how our minds and bodies can be affected by loneliness and darkness. In his experiments, Siffre and a number of other subjects ventured alone into dark caves. They stayed there for months with no clock, calendar, or contact with the outside world. The only electrical light they had would turn on when they woke up, and turn off when they slept. The results that the research team found were astounding.

We now accept this as truth, as recent scientific studies show that over-consumption of ultra-processed food is linked not only with obesity, but with an increased risk of most cardiovascular issues like heart disease, and many types of cancer. This is mostly because of the high sugar and salt content of processed foods, as well as the fact that they often contain a significantly lower content of necessary vitamins, fibres and minerals than whole foods like. However, even though many of us know that processed food is bad for us, there is still confusion over what actually defines “processed food”? After all, almost everything we buy at the grocery store has gone through some sort of process. Even the fruit we buy has been washed and packaged, so is this processed food? Not really, according to the experts. When they use the term, they’re referring to foods that have gone through such extreme change that they’ve lost crucial nutrients, or have been filled with added ingredients like salt, sugar or oil. Therefore, foods like bread, cheese, canned fruit or fish are indeed processed, they’re much less dangerous than “ultra processed” foods like candy bars, soda drinks, chicken nuggets and hotdogs.",

This uncertainty sometimes triggers further disorganization within the economy as the instability tends to exist as a function of the prevailing economic fluctuations.\r\nGermany, once referred to as the European superpower economy, got into trouble in 2019 when analysts argued that the economy was stagnant.

This might be hard to accept because the younger generation has witnessed the best technological innovations that have greatly improved quality of life. But while the technology was on the rise, social life reduced and the economic burden increased; these are all interlinked. \r\nNew pricey attractive technological innovations were introduced. People had to work more to earn enough to acquire them outrightly or get them on credit and be in debt. Comparing the population in debt in the whole of the 20th century to the current 21st, the results are staggering. Both the cost and standard of living is supposed to be better with all these innovations but ironically, there’s so much to acquire. You’re forced to be a debtor; which leads to more time at work and less with family and friends, ultimately a reduced social life.\r\nThe simplicity helped to maintain a balance. The beauty of the absence of technology is underrated.

It is stated as the number of persons born in a population per 1000.\r\n\r\nIn the last decade, the birth rate has decreased drastically and if not checked, would result in a continued decline in the working population which could lead to a poor labor force. Today, the patterns of family formation in most developed countries have been a matter of concern as a result of low birth rates. While the decline in the birth rate can be attributed to affluent lifestyles, the desire for women to pursue careers, the gross effect could have a negative impact on the economy.\r\n\r\nGovernments have created steps particularly through immigration to increase the birth rate. Although recent studies by (Office of National Statistics, 2009) have shown that there has been an increase in the birth rate in the United Kingdom, which is mainly due to immigration.

One advantage is that it provides various types of solutions that are almost impossible to hack in comparison to passwords.

They can monitor situations, identify possible hazards, alert people about unsafe conditions as well as create and maintain safe environments. This technology is continually improving, and the cost of buying a drone is not as expensive as it used to be. They are vulnerable to wild animal attacks and can also endanger nature. They are even used to record important events like sport games, concerts and festivals.

Unprofessional and bad behavior can be damaging to the company’s professional success.  There are a few signs that a person represents a problem at the office. Being overconfident means that employees overestimate their own abilities, therefore they don’t deliver great results despite their self-assurance. Lacking good communication skills in a work environment may be critical to employees’ professional success. Listening to other colleagues’ opinions and suggestions can be a strenuous process for a person who is unconcerned with other people’s viewpoints. Since emotional intelligence plays a great part in maintaining smooth communication, it is safe to presume that those employees are less open to discussing new ideas. Finally, the constant gossiping about co-workers and managers can undermine a person’s credibility and integrity. Moreover, it is a strong indicator of a toxic work environment.",

Moreover, they start by making a basic mistake: they confuse the terms “resume” and “CV” (curriculum vitae).  As a result, they miss out on fantastic job opportunities.The CV is a document which lists your previously held job positions, your education (diplomas, degrees and certificates), achievements, proficiency in languages and computers, awards, publications, translations etc. The resume is a summary of your CV, containing information relevant to the job post you are applying for.The CV merely shows what you have done; the resume shows what you have achieved and what you can achieve in the future for the company. In addition, be careful not to make any grammar and spelling mistakes. Also, a resume that is over-packed with information and visually messy will not leave a good first impression.

By offering a tremendous mélange of possibilities for impacting society and people’s perceptions, they have strengthened their position in modern life. There are numerous benefits from using social media platforms, such as: Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. Their planetary success to a high degree is due to the open flow of information on a world’s scale, people’s ability to share life experiences, to fight a shared cause, to seek and get help, to connect with people from all over the world in order to communicate freely. Moreover, people are able to voice their opinions, fight repression, build their self-identity, learn about the world and its wondrous side, broaden their horizons, make memories and impact economies. Social media platforms empower individuals and encourage their active participation in society. However, it would be frivolous to solely focus on the positive aspects of social media, since there is an overwhelming body of evidence that its overuse can lead to anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, loneliness and a lack of meaningful human contact. A recent survey has shown that Instagram is the platform which is the most detrimental to mental health, especially in young users. Although Instagram, a platform predominantly focused on photo-sharing and estheticism, can have a positive effect in terms of self-expression and fostering uniqueness, still it may be driving feelings of inadequacy and anxiety in young people.",

The ban caught some people off guard when it included hybrid vehicles. Unlike diesel and petrol cars, hybrid cars use an electric battery along with an engine running on fossil fuel. Although the benefits from reducing carbon emissions are more than great, other implications from the ban aren’t. The UK’s car industry possesses decades of experience and an immense talent regarding the production of petrol and diesel vehicles. In the next 15 years, much of the existing workforce will have to be retrained in order to start producing electric cars in order to put the UK on track for zero-carbon travel. One upside to this plan is that universities and start-ups are already working on different ways to power electric cars. The UK government is already investing a shy of £300 million in battery research, which is a process that will have to continue in order to secure the success of the complex transition from prototype to mass production.",

However, engineers in the field of robotics argue that the robotic entities are here to assist and complement us, rather than replace us. Japan is years ahead of many other countries in the world in terms of incorporating robots in the workplace. It is widely known that Japan is facing great demographic challenges because it is rapidly aging while the birth-rate is plummeting. As a consequence, there is a major shortage of health workers working in elderly care facilities. One solution to this problem is the introduction of robots in these facilities. This is the case at the Hyogo nursing home, where the residents love Paro, the talking seal bot. Paro is a big hit because he doesn't need to maintain personal hygiene, eat, sleep, and nobody is allergic to him.",

They also hope that this change in approach will help them to attract the best talent by offering a better work-life balance. People born in the mid to late 1990s, known as Generation Z, are not attracted to the traditional office environment, preferring to work in their own environment, as they feel they can be more productive while in less formal, more relaxing surrounds. Given that modern technology allows us to be connected and to work from just about anywhere, these companies now see the benefits of offering workplace flexibility.

Our apathy increases and we become less open to having new experiences. Researchers have known about this drop in curiosity for a long time, but they’ve also found that greater curiosity in aging adults has a correlation with good mental health. In old age, it appears that cognitive performance can actually be maintained by curiosity! As part of a 2018 study, elderly people ranked as “curious” performed much better in memory and cognitive function tests. It’s not just the elderly who reap the benefits of staying curious either. People of all ages were examined in the study, and those who had high levels of curiosity tended to be much more satisfied with their lives, and in very good mental health, regardless of age. But what exactly do we mean by curiosity? In simple dictionary terms, it’s a desire to know or learn things. But there’s more to it than that - it also means being willing to engage with new and unfamiliar experiences, philosophies and concepts. If these studies are correct, perhaps we must start believing that “Curiosity did not kill the cat,” and that “You can teach an old dog new tricks!”",

If like most people you use Google products like Gmail, Maps, and Google Search, your information is being gathered by the company.  The longer you use Google’s products, the better a picture they can paint of you. But just how much do they know? Lots, it turns out! It’s likely that Google not only knows your name, gender, birthdate, address, phone number and browser history, but it also knows where you’ve visited, if you travelled by car, train, bus, motorcycle, or even if you walked! It knows your interests, such as your favourite music, sports teams, hobbies, the media content you engage with, where you work and what your career is, if you’re married or are a parent. It even collects and stores voice recordings from anytime you’ve used the voice activated Google Assistant! \r\n\r\nAccording to Google, all this data is collected simply so that they can provide a better service to you. Your YouTube homepage is usually filled with things you find interesting right? That’s because Google has learned what you usually watch or listen to. It’s because of all this data collection that the adverts you see online are usually for things that you are likely to be interested in. There’s no point advertising children’s clothes to someone who’s not a parent after all! It’s also because of  large-scale location tracking that Google Maps can let you know almost exactly how long your journey will take. \r\n\r\nGoogle, by the way, doesn’t hide any of this information from you, and they ensure us that they do not sell your information to any third parties. By visiting the “Ad Settings” page on your Google account, you can view everything they know, and indeed opt out of some services. By accessing your “Timeline” in Google Maps, you can see a map of everywhere you’ve visited for as long as you’ve been as you’ve been using this app.",

        "transcript": "Two scientific studies carried out in Denmark and England have shown that there has been a huge decline in the abundance of insects. The “splatometer” tests, which observe the number of insects “splattered” on car windows, show that in rural Denmark, the insect population fell by a staggering 80 percent between 1997 and 2017. In Kent, England, a similar test carried out in 2019 showed that there had been a 50% drop in the amount of insect impacts since 2004. These studies are further evidence of what is being called an “Insect Apocalypse”. Insects are crucial to the earth’s ecosystem as they pollinate three quarters of the world’s crops. Without this pollination, we may face a disaster in the natural world, which will threaten all life on earth. Leading entomologists claim this rapid decline has been caused by the destruction of insects’ natural habitats, pesticides, climate change and global warming, as well as increased light and air pollution. While the vast majority of scientific studies have shown similarly worrying results, most research has only been carried out in North America and Europe, so it has not yet been established if insect populations have fallen in a similar way in other climates such as Southeast Asia and South America.",

        "transcript": "Scientists in Zurich, Switzerland have developed technology that can secretly send data using soundwaves. This data is stored in musical notes which are imperceptible to the human ear, but can be received and interpreted by a smartphone. Theoretically speaking, this technology will allow small amounts of simple information, such as Wi-Fi passwords, to be embedded into a regular piece of music and sent to a device without the listener even noticing. While existing wireless communication technology already exists in the form of Bluetooth, it uses radio waves instead of sound waves to send data, and it requires two devices to be paired together deliberately. This can make Bluetooth frustrating and unreliable. However, all cell phones already have an in-built microphone which can receive data through music. To enable your phone to decode and interpret this data could just be a straightforward matter of downloading an app that can do this. Transmitting data through sound waves has been in the experimental stage with a number of companies since 2009, but the research team in Zurich are the first to attempt embedding data into a piece of music without changing the original melody. They use very high frequency notes, which are inaudible to humans, to prompt the decoder to “listen” for data. Then,they embed both high and low frequency notes at a much lower volume than the melody, and these carry the relevant data. Thus far, the highest data transfer rate they’ve achieved is about 400 bits per second, so while it is useful for sending small chunks of data, it’s still a long way from being used to transmit large volumes of information.",

        "transcript": "People are complex. Everyone’s background is different, and every experience we’ve had affects who we are, how we behave, and what we value. Even though no two of us are exactly the same, our personalities can be categorised into five main types, known collectively as OCEAN. OCEAN is an acronym, and it stands for Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Most people have certain personality traits from all of these groups, but we usually score much higher in one or two groups than the rest. \r\n\r\nNone of these personality types are considered better or worse than another. They each have their benefits depending on what we do with our career. A salesperson, for example, would benefit from being extroverted, while a teacher would benefit from being conscientious i.e. hardworking and serious about their duties. \r\n\r\nOne common misconception about the OCEAN personality types is that the least desirable and valuable is Neuroticism. Neuroticism suggests high levels of anxiety, emotional instability or even envy, but this doesn’t make it any less valuable. Neurotic people have been proven to perform better on tasks that require great detail and precision under pressure. It might not be the most fashionable personality type, but neuroticism is shaking off its negative image at last.",

        "transcript": "The UK Labour party has been discussing the abolition of private schools, claiming that they do more harm than good for society. In the UK, 93 percent of school children attend publically-owned schools which are funded by taxpayers’ money. However, the small percentage of children whose families pay for a private education go on to hold the most power in society. In the UK, 74 percent of judges were privately educated, as were 71 percent of high ranking military officers, while almost half of the Conservative Party’s MPs also attended private school. Indeed, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is the twentieth PM to have attended the prestigious Eton private school. The basis of the Labour Party argument is that the private school system allows the wealthy to buy power. In their opinion, the problem is not so much that it affords financially privileged children a better standard of education, but that it fosters a network, or a “club”, of powerful people with strong connections to other people in power. The result is that it becomes more difficult for children from working class backgrounds to reach their full potential in life, regardless of their academic ability. If “who you know” is as important as “what you know”, then private education may be partly to blame for the UK’s growing wealth inequality, which is now double what it was in the 1970s. The UK Labour Party is not alone in this movement. Indeed, Finland is already slowly merging public and private schools, hoping to allow for greater equality of opportunity later in life.",

Most people will have seen this process in action when they sent an email to somebody and immediately got a reply saying, “I am out of my office”. That out-of-office notification is a very basic function – there are much more sophisticated programs, particularly those used by marketing companies. For example, when somebody signs up to a company’s newsletter, they will usually receive an email sequence of 7 or more emails spread over a few days or weeks. Why 7? The received wisdom in marketing is that a potential customer online needs to see your sales pitch at least 7 times before they decide to buy. Marketers also have to be careful that their emails are not marked as spam. \r\nThere are several steps they can take to overcome this hurdle. One way is to avoid words that spam filters consider problematic, like ‘free’ or ‘make money’. Marketers can also send plain text emails that don’t contain any HTML or clickable links; however, these are not very effective at converting prospects into customers. The best way to ensure subscribers receive your emails is to ask them to ‘whitelist’ your email address. This involves telling your email provider that a particular email address is safe and that you want to receive emails from that address.",

But our research shows that while students enjoy learning with robots, teachers are slightly reluctant to use them in the classroom.\r\nIn a recent study, teachers and students were seen interacting with a humanoid robot (Nao), teachers said they were more sceptical of robots being integrated into the classroom. The teachers felt that the robot should take on a restricted role in the classroom and should have full autonomy. The teachers also wanted full control over the robot. There was a technological bias associated with their opinions as they were in general unaware of robots.\r\nThe study showed that teachers didn’t trust the technical capabilities of the robot and wanted the robot to function as a learning buddy to the children, and not a teacher. This reluctance could be due to an uncertainty of how best to incorporate robots in the class, and a lingering concern that robots may eventually replace teachers.\r\nThe students, on the other hand, were much more enthusiastic about a robot in their classroom, enjoying the human-like interaction. However, they wanted the robot to adapt its behaviour to their feelings and display a wide range of emotions and expressions. Such fully autonomous behaviour will require further research and development in robotics.\r\n Some of the children felt the robot’s voice was unnatural and did not adapt to situations by changing tone or pitch. The children preferred as natural behaviour from the robot as possible, even to the extent that they were untroubled by the robot making mistakes, such as forgetting. It was clear the children were imagining the robot in the role of their teacher.",

        "transcript": "Try to pay for something with cash in Sweden these days and you will probably earn yourself a strange look. Almost the entire population uses a mobile payment called Swish, to the point where retailers might stop accepting cash altogether by 2023.\r\n\r\nIs this a good thing? Well, for convenience, of course, but there are also concerns. Sweden's central bankers fear that if payment infrastructure is left to the private sector to deal with alone, certain groups might be excluded altogether. Also, faith in the monetary system might be undermined if people can no longer convert what is in their bank account to a 'cash' form backed by the government.\r\n\r\nThis is why Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, is launching a year-long pilot project of the 'e-krona'. The idea is to create a digital payment system that is user friendly and accessible to everyone. This currency will use the distributed ledger technology inspired by blockchains that run cryptocurrencies. The pilot will test if a state-backed digital currency can play a similar role to the physical one cash plays today. This way, instead of private companies in effect running currency and doing so purely with the motivation of making a profit, a central bank would have the public good as its main focus. \r\n\r\nThe pilot will run until the end of February 2021, with no obligation on the public to use the e-krona. It will be interesting to see how the Swedish people react, to know how such digital currency might eventually be accepted elsewhere.",

        "transcript": "What do you do when you can’t afford therapy but are struggling to handle your mental illness alone? You could download an app. In recent years, there’s been a proliferation of mental health apps available to smartphone users. These reasonably-priced, or most often free, mental health apps offer a wealth of resources that make therapeutic techniques more accessible, portable, and cost-effective.\r\nWithin minutes, you can find and download a myriad of apps that incorporate proven techniques and address everything from depression to eating disorder recovery, anxiety, PTSD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and more. While the vast majority of these apps do not have peer-reviewed research to support their claims, health experts predict they will play an important role in the future of mental health care by providing innovative solutions for the self-management of mental health disorders. Some researchers are working on guidelines for mental health apps. \r\nSome professionals believe mental health apps have the potential to reach people who would otherwise not receive help by removing the barriers to treatment. Sadly, only a small percentage of people actively seek professional help for their mental health problems. This could be for any number of reasons. Another part of the appeal of smartphone-based apps is their anonymity. The apps also allow for privacy and confidentiality and can be a safe space for individuals who may be too ashamed to admit their mental health issues in person.\r\nSo, what kind of mental health app could be of real value to people struggling with mental health challenges? According to some professionals, the ideal app will have mental health practitioners on board, ready to answer questions, plus a 24/7 support hotline for more severe cases.\r\nBut other mental health professionals question the effectiveness of mental health apps when used in isolation. A psychologist who has used a variety of mental health apps with her patients, finds they’re an excellent way to help people stay connected outside of sessions to the work they are doing in therapy, but is critical of their use as an alternative or replacement for traditional treatment. These apps can be very useful, but they cannot take the place of engaging with someone who can offer individualized interpretations and insights.",

        "transcript": "The Doomsday Clock is a symbol that represents the likelihood of a man-made global catastrophe. The decision to move (or to leave in place) the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock is made every year by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists (BAS) in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which includes 13 Nobel laureates. When the Clock was created in 1947, the greatest threat to humanity was nuclear war as the US and Soviet Union were headed into a nuclear arms race. In 2007, The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists felt they had to include climate change. In recent years, the Bulletin's panel of scientists and other experts has started to look at other \"disruptive technologies,\" including artificial intelligence, gene editing, and cyber threats.\r\nCivilization-ending nuclear war is a genuine possibility. The world is sleepwalking its way through a newly unstable nuclear landscape. The arms control boundaries that have helped prevent nuclear catastrophe for the last half century are being steadily dismantled.\r\n2019 also brought alarming new evidence of climate change's momentum, and demonstrated its destructive power. In fact, humanity's disruption of climate on land and in the oceans is \"unprecedented,\" according to a report released in September 2019 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations body that evaluates the impacts of climate change. Globally, the year was the second hottest since record keeping began in 1880, and the past decade was the warmest on record, NASA reported earlier this month. July 2019 smashed records as the hottest month ever recorded on Earth, after a sweltering heat wave baked countries across Europe and then flowed over Greenland, where it melted 217 billion tons (197 billion metric tons) of ice. Ocean temperatures are warmer than they've been at any point in human history, and they're heating up at an accelerating rate. The world's thickest mountain glacier is retreating, the Sahara Desert expands by about 10%, and the Arctic's most stable sea ice is disappearing.\r\n \r\nThe development of artificial intelligence (AI) for use in weapons that make kill decisions, and its use in military control and command systems is another new cause for concern. Equally troubling is the growing deluge of fake news, and the rise of \"deepfake\" footage — digitally manipulated video that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from the real thing. By blurring the lines between truth and fiction, these technologies disrupt information and trust, introducing a dangerous global instability.\r\nThe threats of nuclear destruction and global warming might seem too big for us to handle, but the BAS’s goal is not to use the Clock as a scare tactic, but to get people talking. What they try to do is give the public the ability to talk about the state of nuclear security and to really pressure their leaders to pay attention to that and climate change and show that they're concerned about it. In fact, the Clock hand has been moved away from midnight almost as often as it was moved closer, the Bulletin said.",

        "transcript": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency over a new coronavirus that has killed more than 2,800 people worldwide following an outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. More than 83,000 cases of infection have been reported globally, most of them in mainland China. The novel coronavirus is affecting 57 countries and territories around the world.\r\nAccording to the WHO, coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). These viruses were originally transmitted between animals and people. The novel coronavirus, identified by Chinese authorities on January 7 and since named COVID-19, is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans. Little is known about it, although human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\r\nSigns of infection include fever, cough, and shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and even death. Current estimates of the incubation period range from one to 14 days. Most infected people show symptoms within five to six days. However, infected patients can also be asymptomatic.\r\nSARS killed about nine percent of those it infected - nearly 800 people worldwide and more than 300 in China alone. While the new coronavirus is more widespread in China than SARS in terms of case numbers, the mortality rate remains considerably lower at approximately two percent, according to the WHO. \r\nScientists around the globe are racing to develop a vaccine but have warned that one is unlikely to be available for mass distribution before 2021. Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have effectively sealed off Wuhan and placed restrictions on travel to and from several other cities, affecting some 60 million people. Many international airlines have cancelled flights to China. Some countries have banned Chinese nationals from entering their territories and several more have evacuated their citizens from Wuhan.",

        "transcript": "An implant is an object used for either health or cosmetic purposes that is inserted inside the human body for a period of time. While implants can be physically or aesthetically pleasing, our immune systems think otherwise. They are designed to attack any foreign substance, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, and implants are no exception. While it is good that our immune systems can tackle, intercept, and destroy anything they believe should not be there, our immune systems treat helpful implants, like a prosthetic knee for instance, the way they would a harmful bacteria or virus. When an implant is placed in the body, its presence triggers a “foreign body response”. The process begins with free-floating proteins, such as antibodies, that stick themselves to the surface of the implant. As the antibodies attempt to neutralize the new object, they send out a signal that brings other cells to the site to strengthen the attack. Among the early-responding inflammatory cells are neutrophils and macrophages, which work to help breakdown and degrade the implant. If the cells are unable to degrade the implant, the macrophages quickly group together to form a mass of cells known as a “giant cell”. As this happens, another group of cells, called fibroblasts, travel to the site to deposit layers of dense connective tissue. Overtime, the connective tissue builds up, forming a scar around the implant. While our immune system might celebrate a victory for successfully stopping the foreign body, it is us who pay a hefty price in the end. The scar created by the immune system acts as an impassable wall, which may block vital interactions between the body and the implant. However, researchers are continually finding ways to trick the immune system into accepting the new devices and implants we put into our bodies. Some implants are coated with certain chemicals and drugs, which can weaken the immune response, and others are made out of natural materials and in ways that directly imitate the tissue, so the immune system isn’t as aggressive. If researchers continue to improve the implants we put into our bodies, it could open the door to a whole other world of medical discoveries and answers.",

        "transcript": "The binary code is a simple code based on a binary system that has two possible states, on and off, usually represented by the values of 0 and 1. This digital code of 0 and 1, usually in groups of 8, is used to represent text, machine instructions, or data. Computers use the binary code because it is the fastest and most efficient way to work, and it also the only reliable way of storing data. The benefit of this system is that a given binary sequence does not have an established meaning on its own. Instead, data is encoded in binary according to a separate set of rules. Binary is read from right to left instead of left to right. To interpret numbers, each binary digit is multiplied two to the power of its place number. When you have the values, you add them all up. Letters, on the other hand, are understood by standard rules that assign a letter or a character to a specific set of binary digits. For example, the string 01010100 represents the letter “T”. Even though it may not always be clear whether a string, or a row, of binary digits represent a letter or a number, you can still interpret the string based on the context, just as you would if you were trying to guess whether a person was speaking Spanish or Italian. Binary code is also used to interpret images and sound. Though computer programmers, people who write computer code, will typically use more simple programing languages to give instructions to computers, learning how to read and write binary code is still important as it is considered to be the fundamental concept of programing and computer science. Ultimately, it’s the language that computers speak.",

It’s predicted that by 2040, 33 countries will face extreme high water stress. Does this mean that Earth is running out of clean water? On one hand, it is impossible for Earth to run out of fresh water because it has the water cycle, which will always replenish the fresh water supply. But on the other hand, only 3% of all the water on earth is freshwater; the rest is salt water. Within the small percentage of freshwater, two thirds is frozen in the polar ice caps. This leaves us less than 1% of fresh drinkable water, which is spread out in the form of rivers, lakes, underground reserves, ground ice, and permafrost. Unfortunately, these sources are being depleted quicker than they can be replenished, especially in areas that have a lower water supply to begin with. When this happens, humans use the limited underground reserves to meet the demand. But surprisingly, it is not manufacturing or household water consumption that is draining our water supply; it is the agriculture industry, claiming 92% of our water consumption. It is estimated that farms drain roughly 3.3 billion Olympic-sized swimming pools each year, all of which go to growing crops and livestock for us to consume. While this is necessary, it’s beginning to threaten earth’s water supply. Luckily, farmers are finding ways to reduce their consumption, such as using special irrigation techniques. Other industries are also looking for ways to reuse and recycle water. Individuals can also be water conscious and adopt new dietary lifestyles, such as vegetarianism. While the earth may never run out of water, we still run the risk of draining our water supply dry if we are not careful.",

Despite what many people may think, being left-handed or right-handed is not a choice and it can even be determined while a baby is growing in the womb. Though it was previously thought that genetics was the only factor that played a role in determining hand preference, research that started 30 years ago suggests otherwise. In fact, research from the 1980s showed that hand preference could be determined as early as the eighth week of gestation, or pregnancy. However, a recent study done by researchers from Ruhr University Bochum in Germany has found that the potential determining factor of hand preference is actually the spinal cord. Through the study, it was discovered that gene activity in the spinal cord was asymmetrical in the womb. The arm and hand movements of a fetus begin in the part of the brain known as the motor cortex. The motor cortex then sends a signal to the spinal cord that translates into a motion; however, the motor cortex and spinal cord do not connect until the first trimester is over. This means that the fetus technically has the ability to move around and choose a favourite hand before its brain connects to its spinal cord and starts controlling the rest of its body. This discovery prompted the researchers to analyze the gene expression in the spinal cord in the eighth to twelfth week of pregnancy. They ultimately found remarkable differences in the right and left sections of the spinal cord that control arm and leg movement. It was concluded that epigenetics, changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression, was at play and could ultimately determine hand preference. However, more research needs to be conducted to ultimately determine what causes hand preference. For now, we will continue to enjoy the mystery behind those who are left-handed.",

        "transcript": "Though self-driving cars are still in the special testing phase, the future has the potential to see them on the roads in the next several years. While this may be a fascinating idea, one big question remains: how does a self-driving car “see”? Essentially, there are three key elements that give a self-driving car its sight: radar, lidar, and high-resolution cameras. Radar (radio detection and ranging) can detect the size and speed of objects hundreds of meters away and works by sending out radio waves that bounce off distant surfaces. However, radar produces poor image quality and is unable to make out the details of an object. Cue in lidar (light detection and ranging). Lidar uses a narrow infrared laser that sends out short pulses that bounce off objects to measure their shape, size, and distance, resulting in the ability to detect objects with finer detail and produce higher quality images. Lidar can even make out the holes of a button on a person’s shirt as they cross the street! However, lidar is the most expensive sensor option and because sensors are constantly moving, there is more room for error. Lidar is also limited by poor weather conditions. That’s where the final key element, high-resolution cameras, comes into play. High-resolution cameras are placed in a variety of places around the self-driving car so that the car can have an accurate and clear view of its surroundings. But, just like lidar, poor weather can limit the vision of the cameras. These high-resolution cameras also require the car’s computer system to take measurements of an image in order to judge its distance. So even though the technology is possible and available, it needs to be further developed and perfected. Lastly, ethical factors, such as whether self-driving cars are truly safe, also need to be considered before they are made available to the masses. Despite these obstacles, one thing is certain: there is tons of potential in the automotive industry and we should expect drastic changes in the next several years.",

        "transcript": "Though the technology and production of self-driving cars is still under way, self-driving cars could soon be made available to the public. But now the question of whether they should be remains to be discussed. Part of being a responsible driver is the ability to make moral decisions when presented with a potential problem; however, in a self-driving car, the moral decision-making is left to the computer. But how does the computer determine what is right? Settling on a universally accepted moral code then becomes instantly more complicated. In order to find out the public’s perspective on moral decisions made by machine intelligence, such as self-driving cars, researchers built an online game called “Moral Machine.” On average, people who played the game believed that the moral thing for the self-driving car to do was spare the young over the old, humans over animals, and the masses over a few. However, researchers did find some variations among the responses based on particular cultural systems, beliefs, and values. For example, sparing those who are younger over those who are older was a preference from those in Latin America, France, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, whereas those in Asia and the Middle East favoured sparing the old over the young because those cultures place importance on elderly respect. Of course, the study should not be taken as the final answer as to what is universally moral. Before making any final decisions, more research needs to be done and more discussions need to be held globally so the best decision, programing, and policies can be made.",

        "transcript": "Overfishing has become a global issue and certain breeds of fish are becoming endangered. Fishing is not as simple as sitting quietly in a boat for an afternoon and waiting for the daily catch; instead, fishing has evolved into something larger and much more invasive. Today, large industrial boats patrol the ocean with the help of radar, sonar, helicopters, and spotter planes in search of schools of fish. These boats use nets or long lines with hundreds of hooks to catch fish, and sometimes, other sea creatures. Once the fish are caught, they are hauled to the deck where they are quickly frozen, through a process called flash freezing, and processed for consumption. At this point, nearly 31% of the world’s fish population is overfished and another 58% are fished at the maximum sustainable level. This becomes problematic because certain fish don’t repopulate as quickly as they are caught and consumed. Additionally, when a large group of fish or shellfish are caught, other unwanted sea creatures are also accidentally caught and are usually dead by the time they are noticed and thrown back into the ocean. So, what can humans do to control overfishing? First, through government regulations and restrictions, limits can be set as to how, when, where and how much fishing occurs. They can also ban harmful practices, such as bottom trawling. Marine reserves can also be established to restore ecosystems. Lastly, consumer awareness can be increased. At the end of the day, overfishing is an issue that affects us all and we should all work together to end it because our ecosystems, food, jobs, and economies all depend on it.",

        "transcript": "For centuries, scientists believed that pain was a direct response to tissue damage. Based on this logic, the implication would be that the more severe an injury is, the greater pain a person feels. However, pain does not always co-relate to tissue damage. Instead, two factors are at play: the experience of the pain and a biological process called nociception. Nociception is part of the nervous system’s protective response. When a harmful or potentially harmful stimulus activates a certain amount of sensors in specialized nerve endings, electrical signals are sent through the spinal cord to the brain. The brain then reacts accordingly. But if the sensors in the specialized nerve endings are constantly being activated, the experience of pain changes. On a biological level, if nerve fibres are constantly being activated, the brain may decide that the nerve fibres may need to be more sensitive to protect the body from harmful stimuli. As a result, more stress sensors are added to nerve fibres until they become so sensitive that even the lightest touch sparks an electric signal. Psychological factors also play a role in the experience of pain as a person’s emotional state, memories, beliefs, and expectations about pain can greatly influence nociception and the brain. Social factors, such as the availability of family support, can also play a part in the perception of pain. While the experience of pain is not fully understood, scientists are continuing to research the mechanisms behind it and have already found some promising things. Who knows: perhaps with enough research and technology, there could be a way to eliminate pain once and for all.",

Until then, people would often die from infections that we now consider to be easily treatable. Antibiotics fight and kill bacteria within our bodies. However, a big problem is developing, as bacteria are now becoming resistant to the power of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance occurs when the DNA bacteria adapts in order to be able to survive the effects of the drug. In recent years, antibiotics have been over-prescribed and wrongly used to treat illnesses that don’t require it, and it's because of this overexposure that bacteria naturally changes its own makeup. Thus, certain bacteria become impervious to whichever antibiotic it has been overexposed to. This is a significant problem in the medical world, as bacterial infections are now more dangerous than they were just a few decades ago. It should be noted that antibiotics are still generally very effective; resistance is still a minority occurrence. But the potential long term effect, experts fear, is that recovery time and even death rates for seemingly innocuous infections will increase. They maintain that there are two courses of action that must be taken now: To stop needlessly prescribing antibiotics, which increases resistance; and work towards better understanding the exact ways in which bacteria become so resilient. If they can get to the bottom of that question, we will be much better prepared to create more effective treatments.",

        "transcript": "CBD oil’s popularity is growing quickly because it’s being hailed as an effective treatment for various health issues. Known officially as cannabidiol, CBD oil is a chemical derived from the cannabis plant. One misconception about cannabidiol is that it’s the same chemical used as a recreational drug, but in fact CBD does not have any psychoactive effect. These psychoactive effects are instead created by another chemical found in the cannabis plant, THC. CBD is not used to “get high”, rather it’s used as an alternative to traditional western medicine. It’s been proven to relieve pain by reducing inflammation. This is why it’s becoming a staple of athletes, whose hard training has an impact on their bodies. CBD, they claim, helps them recover quickly from training. Its pain killing effect also makes it popular with sufferers of chronic conditions such as arthritis and sclerosis. CBD has also been shown to have a positive effect on mental health, as it can trigger the brain’s serotonin receptors, which regulate our mood. Studies are showing that CBD can also be effectively used by cancer patients to treat chemotherapy-related symptoms like nausea, vomiting and acute pain, while it also appears to improve quality of life for people with Parkinson’s disease. One last potential benefit of CBD oil is that it has been linked with reduced high blood pressure, which suggests that it’s a heart-healthy supplement too. It’s thought that the anxiety and stress-relieving properties of CBD oil are responsible for this effect. However, it’s worth noting that we do not yet know the entire truth about CBD oil, so it’s too early to believe that it’s a miracle cure. Indeed, there are potential side effects, with a notable number of users experiencing above average fatigue, convulsions, diarrhea and rapid weight change. Before trying CBD, it’s important to first check its legal status in your country or state, and consult your doctor for advice.",

While it’s considered a cutting edge, futuristic technology, facial recognition has actually been in development since the 1960s, but hasn’t been in mainstream use. But until recently it wasn’t considered very reliable, or even particularly practical, as our security threats were not not as sophisticated as they are now. In decades past, a simple signature or pin code was enough to keep information secure. With the huge technological leap had in the past decade though, and the subsequent need for improved security, facial recognition is now considered the highest level of biometric authentication. It’s still not without its flaws in the real world however; When Apple launched Face ID as a feature of the iPhone X, people quickly realized that it could be fooled with a simple photograph, or indeed someone who looked similar to the user. In 2017, it even emerged that Face ID could not differentiate between multiple Chinese faces! Amazon had a similarly embarrassing scenario, where their “state of the art” system, Rekognition, wrongly identified 28 US Congress members as known criminals. Still, tech companies are keen to continue developing and refining their systems, as the future demands dependable facial recognition technology. It’s not just law enforcement and national security that will improve, but operations like personal online banking, home security, confidential contracts, and crypto currency wallets will all be made safer by facial recognition technology.",

        "transcript": "Whether you’re buying a used car or a home, or discussing a salary rise, the key to good negotiating is to make everyone involved believe that they’ve got a fair deal. Often, people claim that you should always employ an ultimatum when negotiating, but in this case, you’d better be prepared to walk away with nothing most of the time. If all negotiating parties are willing to concede some ground, you can still reach a good deal. However, like all rules, sometimes the need arises for it to be broken! If you’re being exploited, for example being asked to do much work for too little money, perhaps the time is right to lay down a final offer and be prepared to walk away. So, how should we negotiate effectively? First, communication is of the utmost importance. Listen to the other person and find out exactly what they want. You’ll learn more about them in the process, and be better prepared for the next round of talks. On top of this your reputation as a fair, polite and respectful negotiator will grow. An overlooked but important factor to good negotiating to choose the scene carefully. A comfortable, relaxed environment will create a lot less hostility than a cold, dull office. That’s exactly why businessmen often have dinner meetings! One tip we often hear is that we should initially ask for more than what we want. Since negotiating usually demands compromise from both parties, this is indeed a good idea, as long as you don’t take it too far. It’s also important not to rush through negotiations. If you become impatient to just get the deal done, it’s usually you who will suffer the consequences, by either giving up too much or receiving too little. Remember, the other party is not your enemy; you should want both of you to succeed. This is known as a win-win situation!",

        "transcript": "A quick Google search of the terms “Salt” and “Risks” will return a deluge of articles that demonize the popular flavour enhancer. For almost a century, it’s been linked with high blood pressure, heart disease, increased risk of strokes and even cancer. But is the fear of salt actually justified? It’s a simple fact for example, that we need salt in our system to stay properly hydrated and transmit nerve impulses. It can even be used to alleviate gum disease, fight infections and decrease inflammation. Meanwhile some modern studies suggest that the link between salt and high blood pressure and heart disease is in fact non-existent. So what’s the truth? Is salt our friend or our enemy? Should we choose Himalayan salt over regular table salt? It all depends on where your salt comes from, and also with the volume you consume. Too much of anything is generally bad for you. Too much sun, too much food, even too much fruit which contains natural sugar and acid. In fact, drinking far too much water can be dangerous, as it dilutes the necessary salt in your blood! As for the apparent health benefits of Himalayan salt over table salt, studies show that there actually aren’t any! Where salt becomes unhealthy is when it’s used to flavorize ultra-processed foods like your favourite fast food restaurant’s hamburger, or a packet of potato chips. These often contain close to, or even more than, your maximum recommended daily intake of salt, while the food itself is unhealthy on its own. In conclusion, it seems that moderate amounts of salt itself won’t harm your health at all, but consuming far too much of it, especially in already unhealthy foods, will catch you up in the long term.",

Instead, you could just hop in a teleportation machine one second, and arrive at your destination the next. But could it ever be possible? After all, humans have figured out fire, electricity, supercomputers, the internet, flight, and even space travel. Often, if we can imagine something, we can develop the technology to do it over time. But unfortunately, it seems that teleportation will never be an option for us, simply because of physics. Physics allows us to fly to the moon and all explore the universe, but it also prevents us from teleportation. Nothing made of matter can travel at the speed of light, so even if we could physically teleport, it would still take considerable time to arrive at your destination. Regardless of time, it’s a proven law of physics that matter can not pass through other materials, like we would be expected to when teleporting. Simply put, teleportation demands that we can bypass the laws of space, and there’s about a 0% chance of that happening. For now, we’ll have to leave teleportation to the imagination.",

        "transcript": "Many of us spend around 30% of our entire lives asleep. It’s patently obvious that we get tired, and sleeping recharges our batteries so to speak. But even to this day, scientists are finding out more and more about what our bodies, and particularly our brains do when we sleep. Until the 1950s, scientists believed that during sleep, our brains as well as our bodies went into a dormant mode. However, since then we’ve discovered that the brain continues to work diligently while our body rests. During sleep, our brain cycles between REM sleep and non-REM sleep (rapid eye movement). Non-REM sleep comes first, and it’s in this time that our heart rate slows and our body temperature drops, before entering deep sleep. It’s in deep sleep that our body and mind recovers the most. About 90 minutes after falling asleep, we enter into REM sleep, which is the period related to dreaming. Our eyeballs move around very quickly behind our closed eyelids, and our brain waves become as active as they are when we are awake. This brainwave activity is the reason why we dream during this phase.  Our breathing speeds up and our bodies become paralyzed to protect us while we dream. Dreaming is an essential part of sleep as well, as it’s widely believed that this helps us store memories and work through our subconscious thoughts. On a normal night, we tend to go through this whole sleep cycle five or six times. If your alarm clock wakes you up in the morning in the middle of a dream, it’s an indication that you didn’t get not a perfect night’s sleep. Ideally, we should cycle out of REM sleep before our bodies wake up. To that end, people who claim to sleep very well and wake up rested, often don’t remember much of their dreams at all!",

U.S. Congress is currently assessing the business practices of these tech giants to determine whether any remedial action is necessary to create a healthier, more competitive marketplace. For example, the software company Basecamp has complained that Google has a monopoly over the internet search engine market to the point where it can charge higher-than-market-rate prices and unwarranted fees at its leisure. Basecamp argues that its competitors are able to pay Google so they appear as the first result in the search engine, even when people search specifically for the word “Basecamp.” Samsonite, who raised a similar issue with Amazon, argues that advertisers, competitors of Samsonite, can pay to be the first result in the query results, even when a shopper searches for “Samsonite luggage.” A different complaint came from Tile, a company that makes small Bluetooth trackers to help find lost items. Tile argues that Apple’s “Find My” tracking app favors the interests of Apple over its competitors. According to Tile, Apple does this by including “Find My” as a pre-loaded app on its devices, programming the devices to actually request permission for location-tracking during initial operating system setup and making it impossible to delete the “Find My” app. On the other hand, if a consumer wants to use the Tile app, they are required to first download the app and then make changes in their phone’s settings that grants Tile permission to track their location. Tile argues this special treatment given to Apple creates an unfair playing field and makes it more difficult for Tile to compete with Apple. These claims by Basecamp, Samsonite, and Tile are only a few of many that have been brought forth recently against the major tech companies.",

However, none of the faculty members were black, causing harsh criticism for the institute’s complete lack of diversity across the board. Additionally, Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have also created a joint AI ethics research initiative, which includes just one woman. Though, problems with representation in the area of AI ethics goes beyond just academics. There is also a history of major tech companies creating AI ethics boards that lack diversity and often times include people with interests that contradict the ethics mission. For instance, Google developed an advisory council for AI ethics that included the CEO of a drone company, Dyan Gibbens, and the president of a rightwing thinktank, Kay James, who has a history of advocating for anti-immigrant and transphobic policies. Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft also created an ethics group called The Partnership on AI, which did not have any black board members or staff listed on its website. The lack of diverse representation among these groups is alarming given how much AI is being used in criminal justice, education, government surveillance, and other systems of society. Consequently, there is a risk that, with a lack of diversity in AI ethics, the algorithms that govern AI could operate with unintended biases that produce real-world inequality.",

Her main argument is that computers have built-in bias that reflect the ones held by their programmers, which are usually men. Her film explores the A.I. facial recognition experiments of Joy Buolamwini, who discovered that these programs have trouble registering faces of women more than men. Buolamwini also investigates potential race-based bias too, suggesting that coders may have neglected to consider their personal prejudices when programming their A.I. algorithms. These algorithms are then used by authorities, for example, law enforcement to identify criminals. However, according to the documentary, 117 million Americans have uploaded their photos into the facial recognition network but it has never been audited for accuracy. As Kanyayya explains, a small number of corporations are creating facial recognition software for profit, while the people using the technology do not even know how accurate they even are. U.S. Congress has even admitted it is aware of the danger this coding bias can have on personal privacy. Ultimately, police could misidentify people as criminals before they even have a chance to prove their innocence.",

        "transcript": "Recently, the United States Department of Justice charged Huawei, the global leader in networking equipment, with racketeering and stealing trade secrets from U.S. firms over the last two decades. The DOJ claims that Huawei illegally copied intellectual property, including protected information about cellular antennas, robotic technology, and internet routers, and sold it in products around the world. Prosecutors have also charged them with violating a confidentiality agreement with T-Mobile by copying technology from T-Mobile’s robot, Tappy, which the mobile carrier uses to test the different phone and tablet functions. These charges come a year after the DOH accused the company of financial fraud and violating U.S. trade sanctions against Iran. However, Huawei has brought its own counter lawsuits as well, claiming the U.S. government is violating its constitutional rights through a defense spending bill that prohibits federal agencies and contractors from buying Huawei products. In addition to these pending legal charges, Congress and the Trump administration also recently added Huawei to a Commerce Department blacklist, preventing U.S. firms from selling their products to them. The United States Department of State has also convinced its allies, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan, to ban the company entirely. Many argue these efforts by the U.S. government stem from their fear of China’s desire to spy on foreign governments and citizens in its pursuit of global dominance.",

        "transcript": "Recently, the Chinese government has introduced an app that allows people to check whether they have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus. Users first register their phone number, name, and ID, and then scan a QR code, which allows the app to determine whether they have been in close contact with someone who has been infected. The app then recommends users found to have been in close contact and at risk of being sick to self-quarantine and contact local health officials. While the app is aimed at reducing the continual spread of the disease, others have criticized the app for different reasons. Perhaps the biggest criticism of the app is that the technology would not be possible if not for the China government’s “oversurveillance” of its people. Other issues raised about the app is its inability to account for human error as virus testing is never 100% accurate. Consequently, false negative readings could lead app users to let down their guard by mistake whilst still at risk of contracting the disease. On the other hand, false positive readings might have the opposite effect of creating moral stigma and panic amongst the people. The question remains whether China ought to be using data-collection and surveillance tools to make these epidemic maps readily available in a mobile app.",

Biometrics, including fingerprint and facial recognition technologies, are currently being tested in a few hundred airports globally to help improve flier identification. Though, it’s anticipated that the technology will continue to grow exponentially. For example, Singapore’s Changi Airport is currently using iris scan and face capture technology to allow Singaporeans to pass through arrival immigration without showing their passports or scanning their thumbs. It’s also likely that biometrics will help automate the check-in process, security checkpoints and boarding gates. AI is also expected to become more prevalent in airports over the next decade. Coupled with robots, AI will likely help improve luggage screening, security screening and customer service. Better mobile apps will also continue to improve airport experiences for everyone. They are likely to include useful tools such as airport maps, checkpoint wait times, taxi wait times as well as online food and retail shopping for goods that can be delivered to the passenger's gate. As airports become more technologically advanced to promote more safety and comfort, it seems as though fliers are likely going to begin experiencing less and less human interaction as well.",

        "transcript": "Tonal is a high-tech home gym designed specifically for strength building as opposed to the more common weight loss machinery. The entire gym is a small digital machine that attaches to the wall. There are two arms that extend from the machine, which are used with attachable hands, allowing users to push, pull, and lift up to 200 pounds of digital weight. The machine generates its weight unlike traditional workout machines. It utilizes computer chips to generate an electromagnetic field and magnets to push and pull against the field, which feels like actual weight. One of the major benefits of Tonal is the compact design of the machine. Its small size is convenient for those living in large cities where apartments and condos are typically smaller and more difficult to house bulky gym equipment. Another perk is that, since the weight is digital, it can be adjusted in real-time making workouts more efficient with less time spent collecting, cleaning and re-racking weights. The machine is also designed with safety features that are designed to prevent injury. With the digital spotter feature, the machine recognizes when a lifter is struggling and will decrease the weight accordingly. Tonal also has an initial strength assessment feature, which gives users a custom profile that tracks their workouts and progress towards the goals they set for themselves. The system then uses this data to provide recommended weight and reps for each exercise. Currently, the home gym costs $2,995 for the unit and an additional $1,000 for accessories and installation costs. Admittedly, most gym goers are unlikely to forgo their gym memberships to purchase a unit at this cost. Though, for those that can afford it, a Tonal home gym may make sense for people looking for a more innovative way to exercise at home, especially when traditional gym equipment is not practical.",

However, a study conducted by nonprofit research group, Urban Future, shows that many locals may miss out on opportunities to seize the job opportunities because of a lack of training. The study further predicts that many New Yorkers could be left behind as new residents who relocated for work would cause increased housing prices and cost of living. The study does provide some hope, pointing to nonprofit company, Per Scholas, as a potential solution for closing the opportunity gap and helping more locals better prepare themselves for careers in the tech industry. Per Scholas offers free technology training courses that last about 15 to 19 weeks. The nonprofit trains its students for jobs in technology-support, cybersecurity, cloud computing, software engineering and data engineering. As big tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple continue to add office space for their expected 20,000 additional employees to be hired by 2022, they will need to look beyond the traditional sources of recruiting and begin looking at local people without college degrees. For companies like Per Scholas, which has seen its enrollment triple since 2015, they will continue to be relied upon to help close the training gap for tech jobs in New York.",

        "transcript": "As suggested by Andrew Yang, our current economic system of capitalism determines what type of behavior is valuable, and people, therefore, will engage in more of those behaviors. On the other hand, there are many activities that people engage in that are not considered as participating in traditional capitalism. Some examples include parenting and caring for loved ones; creating music, dance, art; reading or writing for pleasure; preserving the environment; or having a hobby. These are activities most people typically do for free, not for money. However, people are finding it more difficult to accomplish these activities of a “normal life,” according to Yang. Meanwhile, he argues capitalism is failing to increase the standard of living of citizens and, at the same time, forcing Americans to abandon their hometowns and dreams that inspired them to pursue academic success in the first place. He continues that the most well-educated young people succumb to jobs designed to generate and concentrate wealth and work crazy hours so they can pay off their extremely high student debt. Yang states that, without changing the current perception of what constitutes valuable human activity, the future of the “normal life” does not look promising.",

Think of the Coronavirus and the impact it is having on remote working. Working from home already is a great idea that many take advantage of, yet it has taken a pandemic for more businesses to even consider it as an option!\r\n\r\nRemote work is an entirely new way of living and working for those who have never known anything but the normal 9-5. It sounds like an easy way of working, though for us who remote work we know it is anything but! Managers may worry that staff will slack off or not put the same effort in as they might do if they can 'keep an eye on them' in a traditional work environment. And if we don't have good self-motivation and discipline, then we might be concerned as individuals that we will be tempted to do any other task in our home but work. While both of these things are issues to consider when working remotely, to protect ourselves from this virus they are hurdles we should work on to overcome. Perhaps if we can look for a silver lining of this current pandemic, then, it is the possible beginning of a transition to a whole new way of approaching how we get our jobs done.\r\n\r\nTo protect their staff from the spread of the Coronavirus, companies around the world are either sending people home or advising them not to come to work in the first place. The internet and access to a computer are really all many people need to go about their usual workdays. And through using platforms and systems like Slack and Trello to collaborate on projects, colleagues can still be in regular communication and meet their deadlines! The working world will continue; even if we are doing it from the comfort of our armchairs!\r\n\r\nRemote working, while we deal globally with the Coronavirus, might only be a temporary solution. But if businesses see how successful and beneficial it is, will the change become a more permanent one?",

        "transcript": "A Polish inventor has invented biodegradable and edibles plates. Jerzy Wysocki, whose family has been running grain mills northeast of Warsaw for generations, has found a new use for wheat bran. When you grind up wheat to make flour, around 30% of what you get is actually bran. Jerzy used to dislike wheat bran. It takes up more space than the flour and it’s a big problem for mills. Sometimes mills even have to stop production because they have nowhere to put all the bran. \r\nBut Jerzy, an engineer, was determined to find a solution. He experimented for six years and finally figured out how to make disposable, edible plates out of the wheat bran using the right amount of pressure and heat. With his company, Biotrem, he developed a specialized production line with unique machines to make the plates. A ton of wheat bran makes about 10,000 plates and bowls. After use, the plates and bowls biodegrade within a month. Or, you can choose to eat the plates, which taste like dry cereal. \r\nThis eco-friendly alternative to plastic, foam or paper disposable plates is so popular that Biotrem is having trouble keeping up with demand. They currently make 15 million plates a year. And, with the EU ban on all disposable plastic coming up in 2021, these plates are only going to get more popular.",

With China no longer taking trash, waste flooded into Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. \r\nNow, more and more governments across Asia are saying no to imported trash. They simply don’t have the capacity to process the amount of trash they receive. About 70 percent of the trash can be recycled, and the rest is contaminated with food. This contaminated garbage is often burned illegally or dumped in waterways, causing major pollution problems. \r\nCountries in southeast Asia have started sending exported trash back to where it came from. Malaysia says it has become a dumping ground for wealthier nations. The Philippines sent 69 containers of garbage back to Canada. Many believe that this is the only way that developed countries will take responsibility for their own waste. The message they are sending is clear: deal with your own garbage.",

This system is free and all it requires you to do is lie in your bed for seven to nine hours every night. Sleep is the most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body health each day. \r\nSo, did you get enough sleep this past week? When is the last time you woke up without an alarm clock, feeling refreshed and not craving caffeine? Two-thirds of adults throughout developed nations are not getting the recommended eight hours of nightly sleep. \r\nWhy is sleep so important? And what happens if we don’t get enough of it? Sleeping less than eight hours, and especially less than six hours a night affects our thinking, concentration, reaction times and moods. This makes it more difficult for us to effectively perform our daily tasks and increases the risks of mistakes and accidents. Scientific studies have now linked poor sleep to long-term health problems such as obesity, diabetes and poor mental health. \r\nSo, the next time you’re feeling tired, don’t rely on caffeine or energy drinks. They may boost your energy temporarily, but can seriously disrupt your sleep patterns in the long term. Instead, go to bed early and take advantage of nature’s incredible life-support system: sleep.",

In many parts of the world,  including the Mediterranean region, China, Mexico, Greece and Nigeria, naps are a regular part of everyday life.\r\nHowever, it’s important that you don’t nap too long. Experts found that there is no benefit to sleeping longer than 90 minutes in the afternoon. What’s more, you’re likely to suffer from sleep inertia, which is a dazed state caused by waking up during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. \r\nFor a quick boost of alert and focused energy, a 10-to-20 minute power nap is ideal. For memory processing, a 60-minute nap may do more good. This slow-wave sleep helps us to remember facts, places and faces. Scientists also found that people who napped for 30 - 90 minutes were able to recall words better and quicker than people who did not nap or who napped for longer than 90 minutes. \r\nIt also helps to choose the right time of day for your nap. Most people feel sleepy sometime after lunch due to a natural dip in their circadian rhythm. This is the perfect time to take a short power nap that will help your brain and body to stay on track for the rest of the day.",

        "transcript": "Economic inequality bothers us. But is our sense of fairness the only reason we find inequality so disturbing? It’s easy to see why inequality is bad for those who have less. However, recent studies show that inequality is bad for everyone in society, not just for those on the bottom. Harvard philosopher T. M. Scanlon has identified four reasons we should address the problem. \r\nFirst, economic inequality often gives wealthy people some control over the lives of poorer citizens, such as where they can work, what they can buy and what the general conditions of their life will be like. \r\nEconomic inequality can also cause our political leaders to have unfair biases. For example, if politicians are dependent on large contributions for their campaigns, they will be more concerned about pleasing the wealthy contributors than the everyday citizens.\r\nEconomic inequality also makes it hard for us to believe in the fairness of the economic system itself. The fact that some people have so much while others are struggling to survive can cause us to doubt the justice of our system. For example, it makes it nearly impossible for us to create equal opportunities. Some children simply grow up having access to a better education than others, and will therefore enter the workforce more prepared.\r\nLastly, workers are entitled to their fair share of what they produce. The people who work to produce an increasing level of goods and service should be able to share in the results. Henry Ford didn’t pay his workers high wages out of generosity, but because he wanted them to buy his cars. This helps us understand why economic inequality is bad for everyone in society, as it depresses economic growth.",

It is a company that is so far-reaching, that we don't even really know what it is anymore. How can we define Amazon? Amazon isn't just a supplier of everything our heart desires at the click of a button. It is a streaming service and a publisher of books, and just about everything else you can imagine.\r\n\r\n82 percent of households in the U.S. are on Amazon, meaning it is one of the most appealing platforms for advertisers trying to reach new target markets. The Amazon Media Group has grown to a $15 billion business, making it the third largest advertiser behind Facebook and Google. And as streaming wars continue with Netflix now facing competition from the likes of everyone from Disney and Apple to yes, of course, Amazon, it is safe to say that in terms of distribution and flywheel, Amazon is heading to dominating the streaming market as well.\r\n\r\nWhat is a flywheel? In business terms, a flywheel is a business that, as it rotates (operates), it increases output or revenue without increasing input or cost. Amazon Prime as an example of a flywheel attracts shoppers wanting a range of products on demand. It is the ultimate in disruption platforms that, with cheap capital, can use its flywheel effect to spin into completely different industries. How many of us have been tempted by the benefits that come with Amazon Prime? We go online to buy a book, for example, are attracted by the idea of cheap or free and fast delivery, find ourselves watching its streaming service, and then when we need anything in the future go to Amazon because our accounts are already set up, and it's easier than looking elsewhere? At this rate, it seems there is no industry Amazon won't easily branch into.\r\n\r\nWhere does Amazon's control over everything in our lives stop? This companies continues to grow, appears above the law, avoids paying taxes, and is alleged to treat its staff terribly. Yet here we all still are using its products and services, creating a world where a business isn't a business if it doesn't sell on Amazon. Which is to say, is Amazon really unstoppable, or is it our reliance on convenience that makes us passive to its continued dominance?",

The mission is set to launch by the end of 2021. The companies, in a joint statement called this the \"first-ever fully private human spaceflight mission\" to the ISS.\r\nIt is not yet clear how much each ticket will cost. But with the cost of launching a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at around $60 million (€53.4 million), plus the cost of building a fresh Dragon capsule, estimated to be over $100 million, the tourists will likely be paying tens of millions for their trip.\r\nSpaceX's Crew Dragon has previously launched NASA satellites into space and is due to launch its first crewed mission this year. SpaceX President, Gwynne Shotwell said that thanks to Axiom and their support from NASA, privately crewed missions will have unprecedented access to the space station, furthering the commercialization of space and helping usher in a new era of human exploration.\r\nThis was the second space tourism-related deal announced by SpaceX in the past month.

The asteroid, estimated to be between 1.1 and 2.5 miles wide will pass around four million miles from Earth, travelling at just under 20,000 miles per hour. Experts predict it will fly by on April 29 2020. \r\nNamed 52768 (1998 OR2), the asteroid was first picked up by scientists in 1997 and scientists then described it as \"large enough to cause global effects\" if it impacted our planet. After next month's pass, the asteroid is set to come quite close to the Earth again - 11 million miles away - in May 2031, and again in May 2042, before coming relatively close to Jupiter in 2058, according to NASA's asteroid monitoring service.\r\nEarlier this month, astronomers discovered a \"mini-moon”, which has been in Earth's orbit for the past three years. At this stage, it is unclear whether the object is 'natural', or a piece of space debris, according to the researchers at the Gemini Observatory in the US who discovered it. If it's 'natural' - an asteroid, for example - the object is only the second of its kind that scientists have spotted, other than the moon. The last 'natural' object in the Earth's orbit was discovered in 2006 and has since moved away.\r\nThe last collision with the Earth took place in 2013 near Chelyabinsk, in Russia. Around 1,500 people reportedly sought medical attention in the aftermath, mostly for cuts from shattered glass. The largest asteroid to come close to the Earth was between 2.5 and 5.5 miles wide. Named 3122 Florence, it missed the planet by about 4.4 million miles in 2017.",

Shares of gas utility companies have long dominated the market, and been considered sound investments. Well, that is perhaps no longer the case. It seems investor confidence in the future of our fossil fuel dependency has finally reached a tipping point. \r\n\r\nHow big of an impact are we seeing? Well, for the first time in a decade, the shares in local gas distributors in the U.S. are selling for far less than those of electricity utilities, in relation to their projected earnings. For a side-by-side comparison, S&P's gas utilities index is currently trading at 16.7 while its electric utilities index is trading at 17.1. This might only be a small margin, but given the dominance of the natural gas supply market, it is a significant one. And if you want another, more eyebrow-raising figure, then look at NextEra Energy Inc. This company is the world’s largest investor-owned developer of wind and solar, and is trading at 28 times its projected earnings.\r\n\r\nNone of this means we are going to wake up in a world tomorrow where nobody uses natural gas anymore. Natural gas remains the primary source of energy in the U.S. since easy-to-source, low-cost alternatives are not widely available. Fracturing gas is still cheap, and gas has even contributed to cutting carbon dioxide emissions by replacing the 'dirty coal' used in power generation. Those within the gas industry point to examples like these for why gas should be a bridge to cleaner energy alternatives instead of being replaced by them.\r\n\r\nWe aren't quite there yet in terms of widespread renewable energy use, but if the tide is beginning to turn in the U.S. hopefully we will see change elsewhere as well.",

        "transcript": "Although blockchain is often considered revolutionary technology, there are those who believe it is not really necessary in today’s world. There are several arguments against using blockchain more widely in today’s world. One is that writing smart contracts is hard unless you are very good at programming, but auditing written software is even harder. This means that a small bug can potentially be exploited to steal your funds, if the malicious actor knows what they are doing. Additionally, it takes a lot of technical know-how to follow the blockchain’s processes without relying on third party apps that can also misuse your trust. \r\nAnother common reason is that blockchain is not applicable to many cases, and even when it is, it is often too complex for them. In other words, it is considered an overengineered solution to many problems. Since it is computationally heavy, many projects would benefit more from a lighter, but similar solution. For example, even though so-called dapp games like CryptoKitties are fun, they can also be hard to navigate and often suffer from network issues due to the number of users. This makes other games that feature collecting items, like Stardew Valley, much more popular. Last but not least, the unregulated space surrounding the technology gave it a bad reputation, furthered by frequent hacks from its early days. But another technology has started with similar criticisms and is now thriving: the Internet. Will blockchain follow in its footsteps?",

However, the new technology is set to revolutionize many different industries - and even if it doesn’t truly revolutionize them, it might offer a different way of doing things. One of these industries is gaming, or betting, as it is known in some places. This industry is often considered highly controversial, due to the potential of fraud, data protection issues, high fees, and hidden odds. Blockchain’s innate transparency and immutability could solve most of these problems. For example, once you win and the tokens are transferred to you, there is no way for someone to steal those funds from you unless you are extremely careless, as a traditional hacking approach does not work on blockchain. Additionally, nobody can take on your identity as they would need your private key to do so - and the key cannot be guessed. Again, the only way they could harm you is if you explicitly let them do it. There is also the added layer of security with blockchain’s public addresses: when you know the public address of the casino itself - and you can find it when you get your funds transferred from them to your own wallet - you can know whether they have enough funds to pay everyone out; in other words, the casino’s liquidity is out for everyone to see.",

This means that, when other cells and even whole tissues in the body are damaged, stem cells can be used to repair those areas. Breakthroughs in stem cell research are happening very often and can significantly improve the quality of life. Now, a company called Stem Cell Innovation is working on a blockchain platform that will make the collective knowledge about stem cells widely accessible. Their first step is creating a collaborative network based on blockchain for all scientists working on the topic, so that they can share their discoveries and ideas, but also receive second opinions and help in their own work. \r\nThe second step goes even further: the company aims to collect all patients’ data on their blockchain, controlling who gets to see it, so that patients can connect to any doctor in the world and get help specific to their case. The third and final step of their plan is to create an app that will allow people to sign up for “cord blood banking,” or the process of saving the blood found in the child’s umbilical cord immediately after birth, as this blood contains the best stem cells. The banking process allows for quick collecting and storing of the stem cells found in this blood, which means the child will have them safely frozen in case they need them later in life.",

        "transcript": "According to people like Elon Musk, autonomous cars are inevitable. Tech giants such as Google and Tesla have in fact run partly successful trials with driverless cars! But how close are we really to bringing autonomous cars into the mainstream? It's important to understand the various classifications of automation, which are divided into 5 levels. Level 1 is driver assistance, whereby the vehicle can help control either steering or braking on its own. Level 2 is partial automation, where the car can do both of these tasks at the same time. Level 3 is known as conditional automation, where the car can temporarily take care of itself in the short term, and level 4 is high automation, where the car can take full control for a longer period of time, allowing the driver to focus elsewhere. Level 5, full automation, is where the car does everything on its own. \r\nSo where are we now? According to Bryan Reimer of the Society of Automotive Engineers, we’re somewhere between levels 2 and 3. Reimer claims that while we haven’t yet made a safe, fully autonomous vehicle, the technology exists to do so, “Volvo, for example, already has technology that allows their cars to communicate with each other and alert drivers of hazards via a cloud-based network,” He explains. The thing that’s actually holding us back is our infrastructure. “The reality is, today's infrastructure is not well equipped for autonomy. Potholes, poor lane markings, and all the other crumbling aspects of our nation's infrastructure aren't going to support high-tech well.” Traffic laws are also a big obstacle for automated cars, “Governments will have to initially find a way for autonomous vehicles to safely navigate public roads amongst traditional cars. A possible solution could be designated lanes, similar to the bus lanes found in certain cities.” \r\nOne more issue that has to be addressed is the public’s perception of automated driving. A recent study by Forbes magazine found that 3 out 4 Americans were fearful of riding in a fully autonomous car, as they would have no control over their own safety. Even though manual driving is recognized as one of our most dangerous everyday activities, it appears that most of the public would rather take the risk.",

        "transcript": "Popular dieting trends seem to come and go like waves in the ocean: Huge one moment, non-existent the next. However, in recent years the practice of intermittent fasting has soared in popularity, and it appears that it’s here to stay. It’s being used as a tool to achieve not just weight loss, but steadier levels of both physical and mental energy. The concept involves limiting the time frame during which we can eat in a day, without necessarily limiting how much or what we eat. Intermittent fasting works by forcing our body to use up fat stores for energy, rather than the glucose from food we’ve just eaten. The most popular routine is a 16 hour fast, along with an 8 hour window during which we can eat. The first 8 to 10 hours after eating, we remain in a ‘fed’ state, i.e. our body uses that glucose for energy. However, after around 10 to 12 hours without food, the ‘fasted’ state begins, and our body starts to burn off fatty acids to sustain our energy levels. \r\nThe list of scientifically proven benefits is quite comprehensive: Intermittent fasting causes helps us lose weight and improves our glucose and insulin regulation. This in turn helps our energy levels to remain much more stable throughout the day, rather than being dependent on a meal or snack. Fasting also reduces inflammation in our body. In fact, it is during a fast that our body’s molecules begin to repair themselves. In the long term, this can help us avoid obesity, cardiovascular issues, diabetes, certain cancers and even neurological conditions. \r\nContrary to what might seem the truth, fasting helps us increase our physical endurance, and maintain muscle mass. This actually makes sense on an evolutionary or anthropological level, as thousands of years ago when humans were hunter gatherers, they went hunting on empty stomachs. While intermittent fasting might sound like a difficult habit to develop, the easiest way to start is simply by skipping breakfast and sticking to coffee or tea for the morning. If, for example, you have dinner at 7pm, then you could eat again at 11am. That’s not too difficult, is it?",

Now however, they’ve taken it one step further, and are using computer algorithms to decide if an applicant is a suitable “cultural fit”. But how can a computer predict something that is so heavily dependent upon innate personality rather than ability? \r\nOne London hiring consultancy does this by using interactive “cultural fit” questionnaires, which simulate a prospective day working for the company. This questionnaire is tailored specifically for each company, according to its own work culture. For example, an applicant could be asked about their attitude to working irregular, unpredictable hours, or how they would approach solving a specific, unexpected problem. These are of course the kinds of questions that are often asked in face to face interviews, but since the companies using this technology are usually very large, it allows them to filter out hundreds or even thousands of candidates before even interviewing them personally. \r\nThis kind of algorithmic talent search can be taken further again, by using it to source and contact potential employees based on their social media data analytics. For instance, a social media user whose profile shows that they’re interested in computer games, would prove a better fit for a gaming company’s customer care job than someone with no interest at all. Using this kind of technology, Canadian telecommunications company Telus International hired over 6,000 new employees from social media in 2019!",

        "transcript": "Over the last number of decades, the Amazonian Yanomami tribe has had its existence threatened by a series of epidemics, wildfires and rampant deforestation, as well as government persecution. Ever since the discovery of gold in their homeland along the Venezuela - Brazil border in the 1980s, the Yanomani, one of South America’s oldest cultures, have witnessed a huge rise in outside influence. This has led to aggressive destruction of their forests, while the human influx has brought with it illnesses like the flu and measles, which have been catastrophically fatal for the Yanomami. \r\nTo add insult to injury, the 2019 Amazon wildfires have led the Yanomami to fear that they will soon be completely extinct. 89 year old photographer Claudia Andujar hopes that her work can be a catalyst for change, though. Andujar first met the Yanomami in the early 1970s while on an expedition, “When the Yanomami women first saw me, they were not sure if I was a man or a woman because I wore clothes and they did not. When they found out that I was a woman, they invited me to live with them.” Through her close relationship with the tribe, Andujar has been able to document misunderstood aspects of Yanomami life, and is trying to use her photography as a way of raising awareness of the plight of the Yanomami. \r\nSince 2012, a new gold rush has boomed, and it has led to violent clashes between the Yanomani and gold miners, who have reportedly killed dozens of tribesmen. Even at the age of 89, Andujar is keen to help them. ““I am still very much involved in trying to defend them and their land because I know that their survival and their culture depends on the possibility of being able to go on living according to how they feel, their ability to live together as a people.”",

Solar and wind farms, for example, require large amounts of land and rare natural resources, while nuclear energy is not yet trusted as safe. In the search to find an energy source that is truly green, scientific engineers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have managed to invent a piece of technology that creates electricity from thin air! It’s called Air-gen, and while it is still very small scale, its inventors believe that it could be scaled up to power our cell phones, computers and even our electric cars. But how does this seemingly impossible technology work? It's actually a completely natural occurrence. Threads of protein called nanowires emerge naturally from  the bacteria Geobacter sulfurreducens, and these nanowires, as the name suggests, generate tiny amounts of electricity. \r\nHowever, the researchers discovered that the driving force behind their electricity generation is moisture in our air. In its most basic, unharnessed form, electricity is simply the natural flow of electrons from an area of ‘high charge’ to an area of ‘low charge’, and water is a great source of these highly charged electrons. The team behind Airgen claims that by creating a mesh from these nanowires, the moisture from the air is collected at the top, creating an area of ‘high charge’. The bottom of this mesh remains an area of ‘low charge’, and thus ideal conditions for electrical flow are created. \r\nThe researchers next step was to insert this nanowire mesh between two gold electrodes to create a functioning electrical circuit. Using this circuit, they were able to produce a very small, but scientifically significant, 0.5 volts of electrical current. The next step for these pioneering researchers is to find a way to mass produce these nanowires without causing any harm to the environment. If they succeed in doing so, the world will have its very first source of 100% clean, green energy.",

        "transcript": "From January 2017 to December 2018, Finland put the concept of a Universal Basic Income (IBI) to the test. This is the idea that rather than providing people with means-dependent unemployment benefits, every citizen would be given a flat monthly fee. It’s not a new idea; in fact the earliest recorded mention of UBI dates back to 1516, in Thomas More’s novel Utopia. The Finnish trial differed in that the 2,000 participants were already unemployed. Each was given a small fee of €560 per month, regardless of whether they could prove that they were seeking a job. Even if the recipients did get a job, they were allowed to continue receiving this payment. \r\nThe Finnish experiment wasn’t so much a trial to see if UBI itself could work, but an experiment to see if it would change peoples’ behaviour. Would this “safety net” of UBI help them find jobs, or even allow them to be more open to taking on insecure, short term jobs or zero hours contracts? Or would the unemployed become more complacent and less motivated to make a salary on top of their UBI? \r\nThe results after two years showed that employment levels did not improve as hoped. However, those who took part almost all claimed to be less stressed and happier in general, even though the payment was just enough to contribute to very basic living costs. Finland is not the only place to trial UBI, so we will see in the future if contrasting results emerge. UBI trials have been carried out to varying degrees in the Netherlands, Canada, Italy and Namibia, while a 2016 national referendum in Switzerland ruled out the possibility of it becoming a reality there.",

        "transcript": "Some of the main reasons that companies are moving towards remote working is that, by removing the daily commute and having fewer employees in the office, they are able to reduce their carbon footprint. However, what about the carbon footprints of the employees themselves?  According to new research carried out by London based engineering consultancy WSP UK, working from home in the UK may only be environmentally friendly in the summer months! This is because each remote worker will likely be heating their own home during the winter, rather than working together in a single heated office. “Energy management in buildings is generally more sophisticated than at individual homes,” says David Symons of WSP UK. Even when taking every employee’s commute to work into account, it still seems that working from one office during winter has a smaller environmental impact. It seems that it’s not only more environmentally friendly to share an office during the winter, but more economically sustainable for employees too. \r\nBy working at home, they must pay higher energy bills, which is a factor they don’t have to worry about while at the office. The situation changes in the summer of course. In the UK, people rarely use air conditioning as it rarely gets too hot, so the daily energy consumption falls. In fact, air conditioning consumes even more energy than home heating! It seems then, that the answer is to work remotely when the weather is mild, and work in the office when it’s cold!",

After this, they are then distributed onto damaged parts of the reef. Scientists from various universities in Australia are working together in order to master the technique called 'coral IVF'. It is part of the Larval Restoration Project. Coral spawning usually takes place the week after the November full moon. Queensland University of Technology developed the Reefbot robotic drones. They could either be submerged or float on the surface of water, this is to distribute the coral larvae to where it’s needed. Robots could increase the coral IVF effectiveness by spreading larvae across several kilometers.

Pepper is a talking robot, it can tell the customer all about the ice cream and help with the decision-making. It also helps to track eye contact, simulate emotion and have a basic conversation. This amazing robot also dances and poses for selfies. Tony is responsible for delicate tasks such as putting toppings on ice cream. Eka is designed for efficient scooping. Depending on the level of the ice cream in the tub, a specific scooping motion can be used. The aim of the company is to change the retail experience. In a survey, half of Australian employees indicated that their employment had changed because of automation. These three robots weren't created to replace traditional roles but to enhance overall customer experience. Human beings can't be replaced by robots but they are good at repetitive tasks. By having robots, staff are free to focus on customer service as they don't have to serve the ice cream.",

In the study, mothers were asked to play with their infants, ages three to four months. It was found that if an infant became really excited, a mother also became really excited. But once a mother put on her “still face”, a neutral face with no emotion, her baby instantly noticed that something was wrong and that its mothers had stopped engaging with it. In an attempt to try to get back into relationship with its mother, a baby would try to elicit a response from its mother by smiling and pointing to things; however, if the baby was unsuccessful, the baby would start to experience some of the negative emotions and stress attached to situation and would eventually start to cry in order to get its mothers’ attention. The experiment indicated that babies are born ready to engage in social interactions. At the end of the day, humans are social creatures. Social interaction is something all of us were built for and need in order to develop. If a relationship is disrupted, it leaves a powerful and emotional impression on all those involved.",

        "transcript": "Does parenting style impact a baby’s development? Many parents want their children to be curious and courageous, but at the same time be safe, and it is a struggle to find the balance between these two things. In a study conducted in Singapore, researchers observed how parenting impacts a baby’s brain. Within the first few weeks of life, newborns were placed into an MRI machine to have their brains scanned as a baseline for their brain development. Then, when the participating babies were six months in age, their mothers were invited back so that their parenting behaviour could be observed. \r\n\r\nThe mothers began to play with their babies while researchers rated the mother’s behaviours using a system of descriptive cards. For example, if an infant started to cry, was the mother quick to respond? Or, if the baby wanted to play with something, did the mother choose the toy for the baby or did she let the baby pick the toy? These types of actions helped show what the relationship between the mother and her infant was like. \r\n\r\nWhen the observations were finished, the babies were placed back into an MRI machine to have their brains scanned again. It was discovered that hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for the formation of new memories, learning and emotions, differed according to the different parenting styles. The babies who received less attention and responsive caregiving had a larger hippocampi than the babies who received more attention and responsive caregiving, which indicated that the babies had already started to learn how to manage stress due to lack of attention. It was concluded that the more attention a baby received, the more likely they were to feel comfortable and safe, which would ultimately give them the freedom to explore the world around them because they didn’t need to prioritize their safety and comfort first.",

But how important is milk to the baby’s growth and development? Using samples of monkey milk, as it’s the most similar to human milk, researchers measured the amount of fat, proteins, and carbohydrates present in the milk along with the volume of milk produced at different time points of lactation. Among many other things, it found that the female monkeys were making a different biological recipe for each infant. When human milk was investigated, it was discovered that human mothers also produced individualized milk for each child she had as well.\r\n It was also noted that the milk the mother produced changed across time. As a mother goes about her day, the milk she produces, including all the minerals in it, also changes. When the mother’s body detects an illness in her baby’s body, her own immune system increases the production of antibodies in her milk, which gets passed through to the baby during feeding time, which ultimately allows the baby to fight off any bacteria or viruses. Additionally, hormones from the mother’s body also transfer into her milk. In this way, breastfeeding is a physiological “conversation”, a connection that takes place between a mother and her infant.",

        "transcript": "Feeding time for a baby can become a point of concern for many parents, as they want to make sure that their baby is getting all the right nutrients from the milk its drinking so that they can grow. The aspects of growth are weight, size, and brain development. The more advanced a baby is, the stronger it is. In 1983, proteins in babies were studied and the research showed that many babies were iron-deficient. This means that babies with an iron-deficiency may be less physically active and may develop more slowly, which may affect the child later on in life.\r\n\r\n But, how could it be possible for a baby to be iron-deficient so early on in its life? When a baby is inside its mother’s womb, it receives all the iron it needs because the mother’s womb is stockpiled with iron. However, the transfer of iron to the fetus becomes difficult in mothers that have high blood pressure or diabetes, or who smoke. To see if babies had issues with cognitive skills from being iron deficient, an EGG (electroencephalogram) experiment was performed in order to measure the electrical activity that comes from the brain. A baby needs to be able to recognize its own mother’s voice.\r\n\r\nWith the baby wearing an EEG net, a recording of the mother’s voice played, repeating the word, “baby” over and over again. Then, a “stranger’s” voice played, repeating the word “baby” over and over again. Researchers then analyzed the EEG patterns and the results were astounding. In an iron sufficient baby, they were able to memorize and differentiate between the two voices, which meant that the baby had a great memory. The iron-deficient baby, on the other hand, wasn’t able to distinguish the difference between the two voices, which meant that the baby’s hippocampus, the part of the brain involved with learning, was not functioning adequately. However, micronutrient deficiencies are quite common. \r\n\r\nTherefore, expectant mothers need to make sure they are as healthy as they can be during pregnancy and make sure they are eating the right types of food so that the baby can also receive those nutrients. If these issues could be resolved, it is estimated that the world’s IQ could shift positively by 10 points.",

In one study, the lengths and head measurements of 30 babies were recorded for a period of time. The parents were also asked to keep a journal to record their baby’s behaviour on a daily basis. At the start of the experiment, the babies were measured once a week and it was noted that baby growth happened in the span of one week. Next, the measurements were taken biweekly. Again, it was noted that a baby was growing even within half a week. Finally, the babies were measured daily. The growth that took place among the babies was surprising because it differed between 0.5 centimeters and 1.65 centimeters in the span of one 24-hour day. In between these days of extreme growth were days of no growth. This meant that the babies experienced growth in spurts.\r\n Additionally, it was noted that the growth spurts correlated to the baby’s behaviour, which showed up in the forms of temper tantrums, irregular sleep, and unsatisfied hunger. This data proved that growth doesn’t happen the way we think it does. Instead, growth happens in two very distinct phases. Unfortunately, this new data was criticized and disputed by the scientific community, even though it had been formally published and accepted warmly by the public. But occurrences such as these are not uncommon in the scientific world. Whenever new information is brought to light that challenges an older way of thinking, one can always be prepared for some push back. But the negative feedback isn’t always bad because this is how science evolves.",

In an experiment, an adjustable slope apparatus was made and used to study which actions were possible for a baby and which ones weren’t. A successful trial meant that the baby could crawl from one end of the slope to other without falling or having an adult interfere to help. The babies who had just learned to crawl, the novice crawlers, were able to crawl across a flat slope, but showed poor judgement when it came to bigger slopes. The inability to properly judge what can actually be done is often seen in novice crawlers, as they just want to try everything and learn from their experience. \r\nThe intermediate crawlers, babies who had a little more experience with crawling, were better judges of what they could and could not do. The advanced crawlers, as one may guess, were the best judges of all. The advanced crawlers seemed to know what they could and could not do, and they could also adjust their bodies accordingly to help them overcome any obstacle they encountered. As babies learn how to crawl, they become aware of the many ways they can move their bodies in any given environment and circumstance. \r\nLearning to crawl is essentially learning to behave in a flexible way. There are days when a baby can crawl and there are days when a baby can’t seem to crawl, but movement is not linear. Babies acquire the skills they need for movement in no particular order. This means that crawling is not a mandatory phase like everyone seems to think it is. Instead, crawling is just another way for a baby to move from one place to another.",

But if language is a complex thing, how do babies learn it? First it begins with a rhythm. For babies, language is all about flow. It is like music to them. They don’t understand the words that their parents are saying to them, but they are listening all the time and have been doing so since their days in their mother’s womb. In fact, research has shown that a baby can hear muffled sounds from the outside world inside their mother’s womb, and research has also shown that a baby can respond to voices and noises while inside its mother’s womb, and by the third trimester, a baby can already recognize the sound of its mother’s voice.\r\nWhen babies listen to language, they essentially hear the rhythm of their native language and they are able to notice certain patterns in speech and can hear the difference in tone and pitch and can respond accordingly. This development begins as early as two days into a newborn’s life. Even at two days of age, babies can recognize the classes of language; for example, they can already understand that English and some other Germanic languages sound alike. In terms of language learning, babies are much more advanced than adults think they are. If parents take the time to have “conversations” with their babies, to carefully watch and listen to their baby while interacting with them, then parents will be in for a big surprise when they realize what their baby is learning and how their babies are communicating with them.",

Since they introduced a new technology, their intention was for the passengers to sit alongside the fuel cell because they felt that by doing so, people would be more keen on accepting the latest tech advancement. One reason for the potential passengers’ discomfort is the disreputable history of hydrogen as a power source. Namely, hydrogen is extremely flammable, however engineers have taken precautions and secured it in high-pressure tanks.

Given that daylight hours are minimal for a large part of the year, producing solar energy sounds like science fiction. However, the Willow solar farm, which is in the vicinity of Anchorage, makes all of this a reality. This proves that the desire to explore renewable sources can yield results in the strangest of places. The Alaskan solar company Renewable IPP set up the Willow solar farm, making it the largest in the state. What prompted this company to pilot this project is the speed of climate change particularly in the Arctic and its surroundings. In fact, the four business partners that founded Renewable IPP met while working in the oil industry. They decided to explore different sources of energy, ones that would not harm the environment, so they took their mutual interest in solar energy and transformed it into a real project.",

Serious businesses, if they wish to keep up with the tech development, should spend quite some time thinking about the future. Still, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the future, so experts claim that businesses should make use of different strategies in order to make this constant change bearable. Cloud9 Insight is a company that provides apprenticeship in order to keep up with the world’s tech change. Carlene Jackson, the CEO of Cloud9 claims that businessmen ought to spend more than 20% of their time at work thinking about the future. This is called future proofing and, according to carlene Jackson, hiring the right staff makes all the difference in the company. The future employer should focus on creating specific work environments, that is productive cultures that include flexibility, life-long learning, and collaboration. It can be quite helpful if the staff think about their future and create a so-called “future CV.” This exercise encourages people to think about mastering new skills, personal development. The staff should also be required to create a list of short-term goals, as well as a list of long-term goals, along with a plan involving specific steps that they need to undertake in order to achieve the highest goal.",

There are numerous positive aspects of this particular farming practice. The most important is the preservation of forests, which plays a key role in fighting climate change. Also, trees prevent soil erosion, enrich the land, and help to conserve different living species. People who are in favor of agroforestry either plant acres of trees on patches of land, or start farming in forests that already exist. For instance, a man named Jono Neiger has created a farm alongside the Connecticut River in Massachusetts called Big River Chestnuts. He planted chestnuts, smaller trees, bushes, elderberries, and he released chickens into the forest. Agroforestry favors biodiversity and is associated with a variety of valuable species that thrive in cooler environments covered in shades, such as the shiitake mushrooms, as well as different medicinal plants. Forest farming protects forests and encourages planting more in order for agricultural engineers to make profits while preserving the environment.",

Extensive research on emotions has influenced our perception of them. Instead of discarding them, we should try to use them in the best possible way in order to be able to flourish. The first step is to start nurturing the so-called self-transcendent emotions, which include: empathy, gratitude, and wonder. Having and acknowledging these emotions can help people manage complex situations that require cooperation and sharing ideas.

Namely, the ice-wine harvest in Germany failed, snow had to be imported for a variety of winter sports events in Sweden and in Russia, etc. It is believed that global warming plays a key role in the rise of temperature across the globe.

Another reason why these interviews aren’t welcomed with enthusiasm is the potentially problematic internet connection, which can cause interruptions and spoil the flow. Every candidate wants to leave a good professional impression, however frozen screens and wi-fi glitches may diminish this impression. Also, sometimes we might experience technical difficulties, such as bad sound, black screen, etc. Finally, we can’t rely on body language for maintaining non-verbal communication, which might mean that we can easily misinterpret the gestures and the facial expressions of the person on the other side.",

He proposes an economic system, like the one in Singapore, that relies on the government to set investment policy, rather than an “invisible hand” offered in Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations. Traditionally, a country’s economy is measured using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and economic progress. However, people then focus their time and energy to improve in those areas, rather than focusing on “normal life” activities. Under a new system, like the one Yang proposes, economic policy would be structured to maximize and also prioritize human well-being and fulfillment first—human capitalism. For Yang, human-centered capitalism would follow three core tenets: humanity is more important than money, the economy measures each person (particularly their well-being) and not each dollar, and markets serve human goals and values (not the other way around). As Yang eloquently put it, “Instead of having our humanity subverted to serve the marketplace, capitalism has to be made to serve human ends and goals.”",

        "transcript": "Presently, there is a movement towards earning micro-credentials in addition to, or in lieu of, traditional university degrees. Micro-credentials have been described as bite-sized chunks of education, which include online courses, bootcamp certificates and apprenticeships with specialty providers and online learning platforms. According to Simon Nelson, CEO of FutureLearn, a learning platform that offers online courses through its partnerships with universities, micro-credentials have stemmed from three global “macro trends.” The first trend is that there is a higher demand for high-quality tertiary education. Secondly, the digital transformation experienced by many industries has created a skills gap left unfilled by traditional education systems. \r\n\r\nFinally, the higher education sector has been digitized in response to a greater demand for people to easily acquire new skills in addition to their university degree. Ultimately, micro-credentials are often sought after by companies looking to source talent beyond just university graduates and target candidates with non-traditional backgrounds. However, whether these new forms of education will replace or simply supplement university degrees remains unknown, since the current job market still values candidates who have earned degrees.",

One panel, titled “Tech Forward: New Jobs for New Lawyers,” discussed jobs that involve the use of legal technology or the use of technology and software to provide legal services to clients. According to the panel, employers are seeking knowledge more than experience in these areas due to the fact that not everyone is comfortable working with the technologies. Though, everyone agrees that legal work is becoming very dependent on the use of technology to work more efficiently and serve clients more effectively. One of the job titles discussed by the panel was privacy officers or managers, who are in charge of ensuring that companies are compliant with privacy laws. Another job available in this niche market are legal procurement officers, who procure legal services from law firms similar to how purchasing officers buy merchandise from companies. There are also legal technologists, who are hired in hybrid roles to bridge the gap between IT departments and lawyers.",

Most of the tech is being used in China, however its use is likely to spread globally as more and more countries may need to rely on them to prevent an outbreak of their own. One technology currently being utilized is infrared thermometers, or thermometer guns, which health officials use to regularly check people’s temperatures. Robots have been programmed to complete tasks like disinfecting hospital rooms, communicating with people in quarantine, delivering medications and taking vitals. Self-driving vehicles are also being used to transport medical supplies short distances to hospitals. Even drones have been deployed to scan public places for people violating quarantine rules, spray disinfectant and conduct thermal imaging.\r\n\r\n AI has been called upon to track, diagnose and possibly treat the virus. There has also been an increase in facial recognition technology, and at least one company, Panasonic, claims its FacePro system can even identify people wearing masks. Combined with thermal imaging, these systems can also detect whether people have elevated temperatures. While these new technologies seem beneficial towards helping reduce the risk of a pandemic, it’s also quite chilling to realize that fear of a potential outbreak is being used to support heightened public surveillance.",

Once the US acquires any Bitcoin, the US Marshals then auctions them off to the public. Cryptocurrency enthusiast, Jameson Lopp, recently created a portal that approximated the total value of US government-seized Bitcoin at $151 million USD. Another enthusiast, Hard Fork, used the portal to estimate that each Bitcoin was sold for about $818 on average. However, had the US Marshals waited to sell the Bitcoins in their entirety, Lopp’s portal suggests they would have netted over $1.5 billion USD, assuming they were sold for $10,000 or more. In the UK, the Crown auctioned off its seized Bitcoin for the first time ever for $396,000 USD, or $8,365 each, which was well above the $8,000 market rate at the time. One country that has sold its Bitcoin for even higher profits is Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government recently sold about 200,000 Bitcoins to Asian investors and sovereign wealth funds for about $16,000 USD each. It’s apparent that governments are even susceptible to the volatile nature of trading cryptocurrency, which is apparent given that some have made large profits selling off their coins, while others not so much.",

To date, the company owns about 500 Whole Foods grocery stores. Amazon has also added 26 Amazon Go convenience stores. The Amazon Go convenience stores are cashier-less stores that utilize different technologies such as computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion that automate much of the purchase, checkout and payment processes. The stores are typically located in business districts designed to attract workers for breakfast and lunch throughout the day. However, Amazon recently announced its plan to open a larger Amazon Go grocery store in downtown Seattle, Washington. \r\n\r\nAccording to Amazon, the new store will be located in a more residential area closer to customers’ homes with the expectation of enticing customers to come and grocery shop after work and on weekends. In addition to its Whole Foods and Amazon Go stores, Amazon also plans to open a few dozen supermarkets throughout the US that will have a more traditional checkout experience. They will also offer non-organic groceries at lower costs than Whole Foods, with the hope of attracting customers from lower and middle-income classes. Amazon’s business decision makes one think clear: the company is becoming a major player in the food industry.",

When it comes to clinical gene-editing, there is changing the DNA of embryos and changing the DNA of individuals. Changes made to the genes found in individuals only affect the individual patient. \r\n\r\nHowever, changes made to the genes found in embryos are quite different because any changes would be heritable by future generations. For Jennifer Doudna, a scientist who is currently researching CRISPR gene-editing, this distinction is extremely important and there ought to be strict global regulation of embryonic gene-editing. However, she has been a proponent of individual gene-editing, given its potential to correct disease-causing mutations in patients. For example, recent clinical trials have been done to treat sickle cell anemia. On the other hand, there has been at least one documented case of the much more controversial embryonic gene-editing. In 2018, Chinese scientist, He Jianjui, altered the DNA of twin embryos, which resulted in twin girls being born with altered genomes. This immediately raised ethical concerns among, not only scientists in the field, but the entire global community as well. It’s impossible to remove embryonic gene-editing technology from existence, and so the scientific community, and humanity in general, must ensure the technology is better regulated.",

Gartenberg argues that this push for more productivity has come at the expense of less efficient sleep cycles, as more and more people have disrupted their naturally occurring circadian rhythms. In fact, Americans on average are sleeping one hour less per night than they were in the 1940’s.  While studies show the importance of sleep quantity, there are new studies showing that sleep quality is of great importance, too. \r\n\r\nAccording to Gartenberg, poor sleep and sleep apnea correlate with diseases like Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular disease, stroke and diabetes. It also leads to riskier behavior and lessens the capacity for empathy of others. He mentions that deep sleep, which is tracked using Delta brain waves, has been shown to be the most regenerative kind of sleep. Without deep sleep, studies show a severe decrease in learning capacity, long-term memory formation, personality development and cell recovery. It’s also the case that as humans age, there is a decrease in deep sleep Delta brain waves. As Gartenberg suggests, these waves are essentially a marker of a person’s biological youth. A lab in Germany recently discovered that certain sounds can increase Delta brain waves, causing deeper, more efficient sleep cycles. Gartenberg and other researchers are now developing deep sleep stimulating devices that could be worn during sleep.",

        "transcript": "The Alliance of Small Island States - AOSIS - has a lot to say about climate change. And who could blame them? These are the islands and communities that will feel the most devastating impact climate change can bring. This isn't just about mild inconvenience. Entire islands are facing a future where they will be submerged by rising sea levels. It doesn't get more serious than that.\r\n\r\nSo who are the members of AOSIS? These are a coalition of 44 small islands and low lying coastal developing states, including five who have 'observer' status. You will find them throughout the African, Indian, and South China seas, in the Caribbean, and in the Pacific Ocean. Have you been on holiday recently to places like the Seychelles, Barbados, or Mauritius? Then you have visited one of the AOSIS! \r\n\r\nRemember how beautiful these places looked? If we don't do something about our climate crisis, these beautiful views might be no more. Still not convinced we have a problem? Well, look at it this way. More than half the territory of the Maldives is less than a metre above sea level. If global temperatures rise by around 1.5 °C, the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) predicts that sea levels could rise by 26 to 77 centimetres by 2100.\r\n\r\nIt isn't just sea level rise that is a threat to AOSIS. The impact of flooding caused by increasingly powerful storms is also going to devastate these communities and the industries they are a part of, like farming and fishing. In short, anything we complain about in nations where we are inconvenienced by extreme weather could see the literal end of these small islands and low level coastal states.\r\n\r\nSo what is AOSIS trying to do to make a difference and protect their futures? AOSIS has implemented changes so their energy efficiency and sustainable development is as good as possible. Many have climate resilience projects in place to tackle the impact of climate change on their doorsteps. AOSIS also aims to help raise marginalised voices who fear for their lives and livelihoods if nothing is done to protect our planet. \r\n\r\nThe core focus of the AOSIS campaign is to raise awareness about climate change, sustainable development, and ocean conservation. These islands and communities are leading the way with action on climate change and these other concerns, while other, richer nations stall to do anything to change their ways. What is it going to take for the world to understand the real threat of this global crisis, and do what needs to be done?",

        "transcript": "Social media, for all its faults, is an amazing tool for language learners. Whether you prefer Instagram, Twitter, or the strange world that is Tumblr, social media can be an amazing language tool. Here are some reasons why.\r\n\r\nMultiple language availability\r\nAll social media can be accessed in a range of languages, meaning you can change your settings to Italian, Spanish, Mandarin, and so many other languages. This is only one small change, and the language you need to understand how to use your preferred social media perhaps limited to words such as like, reblog, retweet, favourite, and so on. But this is still an important stepping stone to getting used to using your target language all the time.\r\n\r\nLessons whenever you want them\r\nIf you don't have much time to spare for studying, scrolling through the trending tags on Twitter from a country that speaks your target language can be a quick, bite-sized lesson. Or, you might follow an artist or actor whose native language is the one you are learning; keeping up to date with their Instagram posts and stories is a great way to get a little language practice in. There are lots of options for you!\r\n\r\nInstant practice from all over the world\r\nThe internet has made international friendship easy, making awareness of different timezones one of the most important elements of keeping in touch. So once you are comfortable with Tweeting in your chosen language, or commenting on an Instagram post, maybe you can speak with your new friends in direct messages using the language you are learning.\r\n\r\nPerfect grammar and vocabulary\r\nThe more you are exposed to the correct way to structure sentences, the easier grammar will be for you to understand. Equally, by having new vocabulary on the posts you are reading, every minute you 'waste' on social media is actually a learning experience. You have the perfect excuse!\r\n\r\nKeep up to date with language\r\nSometimes when we learn a language traditionally, the language in our textbooks and other material can feel old, and outdated. By accessing Twitter, Instagram, and so on daily, not only can you be sure your language is the most modern used, but you will also pick up some current slang and expressions as well. Possibly even some curse words. Who doesn't like to curse?\r\n\r\nSo the next time someone says that you are wasting your time online scrolling through the same few websites, tell them to leave you alone. You are studying a whole new language! What better use of your time is there than that?",

Now a tenth of its original size, the Aral Sea is regarded as one of the world’s largest man-made environmental disasters. \r\nIn the 1960s, the Aral Sea started to retreat. At that time no one thought about the Aral Sea’s fate. No one thought that it would dry up and lead to an ecological catastrophe. The water from the two rivers that fed the Aral Sea was used for irrigation without any consideration of the consequences. The fashion industry plays a part in this story, as cotton was one of the main crops that was grown with the water. Cotton requires vast amounts of water. For example, it takes 2,700 liters of water to grow enough cotton for a single T-shirt. \r\nThe Aral Sea shrank so much that it became divided into two parts, now known as the Large and Small Aral Seas. This had a devastating effect on the lives of local people and animals.  In an effort to save the Small Aral Sea, a dam was built between the Large and Small Aral Seas in 2005. The water levels in the Small Aral Sea rose significantly, enough for fish to return and small-scale fishermen to resume fishing. \r\nBut the sea has not returned everywhere. The Large Aral Sea remains a shadow of its former size, although there are still some who remain optimistic that one day the sea will return to its former glory.",

There has also been a lot of speculation about who controls our Facebook news feeds. The answer is that you have a surprising amount of control over your feed. Well, you, and a small team of engineers in Menlo Park, California. \r\nWhen you open Facebook, a powerful algorithm scans everything posted by each of your friends, each group you belong to and everyone you follow. Then, the algorithm ranks everything according to what it believes you will find the most interesting and displays it for you on your news feed. \r\nThe results of this ranking process are consumed by Facebook’s 1 billion plus active users, a full one-fifth of the world’s adult population. Most users will only ever see the top few hundred posts, making this closely-guarded algorithm one of the most influential and controversial in the world. The algorithm’s viral power shapes our social lives and reading habits.\r\nIn a way, each time we like a post on Facebook we are “voting” on how accurate the algorithm is. The like button is more than just a way for users to interact on the site. It is a way for Facebook to figure out how best to filter its users' news feeds. The fact that we can personalize our own Facebook experience is very important. In fact, it allowed Facebook to develop its latest algorithm, which works by ranking posts according to how likely users will be to react positively to them.",

He began walking in Ethiopia, the birthplace of our first human ancestors. He plans to walk across Asia and then down along the western coast of North America until he reaches the very tip of South America. It is a journey that will take him at least ten years to complete. \r\nPaul practices slow journalism. He believes that it’s important to slow down, study the world around him closely and interact with people at a human level and pace. \r\nPaul says that the first thing you learn about walking is that slowing down allows you to think. You are forced to focus on the visible, physical world at your feet. Walking makes use of our problem-solving brains. Each day you must figure out how to cross rivers or deserts, how to find roads, leave roads, find water or find people.\r\nEvery 100 miles Paul takes a “milestone reading.” This involves taking a panoramic photo, plus a picture of the sky and his boots on the ground. He also records a video with the first person he sees.

        "transcript": "We are facing an epidemic of loneliness and social isolation. In a recent study, nearly half of Americans reported feeling lonely.\r\nWhy are so many of us so lonely? Many experts believe that social media may be one of the main culprits. Lonely people are more likely to go online when they feel isolated, and the Internet can temporarily give them a feeling of social satisfaction, even though it eventually isolates people. Also, our community and civic society have been slowly breaking down. \r\nJohn Cacioppo, who was a psychologist at the University of Chicago, wrote a book about loneliness and how to deal with it. He used the acronym EASE to help people ease their way back into feeling connected. The first E stands for “extend yourself.” He recommended volunteering or doing community service in an area that you enjoy.\r\nThe A stands for “action plan.” Go through your phone and other social media contacts and start reaching out to other people. Ask others about themselves and their interests.\r\nThe S is “seek collectives.” As humans, we find it easier to bond with people who have similar values, activities and interests.  \r\nLast but not least, “Expect” the best. Give others the benefit of the doubt. Lonely people tend to feel more easily socially threatened, but it’s important to approach others with optimism. Once you’ve done so, you’ve made the first step in escaping from the trap of loneliness.",

However, English is the most popular second language worldwide, and with an estimated 1.8 billion people using English, it easily tops the list of official languages spoken around the world. \r\nBut is English really capable of taking over the world? At first glance, the growth of English seems convenient. It makes it easy for us to communicate when travelling abroad or doing business overseas. However, some people believe that the spread of English represents a worrying problem. They believe that the world is threatened by English and that it’s bringing about the premature death of other languages.

        "transcript": "Over the last few decades numerous diets and food trends have come and gone. With contradictory advice coming from nutritionists and doctors, it can be difficult to find a feasible diet. Lately, intermittent fasting has seen a rise in popularity. Fasting is ancient and steeped in tradition, with most religions advocating some form of fasting. Scientists now believe that our body is designed to deal with a scarcity of food. They say that we are genetically programmed for metabolic rest for 12-18 hours overnight because our DNA has not yet evolved to handle the regular stream of food that we feed ourselves throughout the day. \r\nThere are many forms of intermittent fasting. One method is to fast for 16 hours a day and eat during the remaining 8 hours. Another form involves fasting for two days a week (consuming between 500 - 600 calories) and eating normally for the other five days. \r\nResearch done on animals has shown that intermittent fasting reduces the risk of obesity, diabetes and cancer. A recent student found that mice who fasted lived longer and were healthier than their counterparts who had constant access to food. \r\nThe purpose of intermittent fasting is to trigger autophagy, or “self eating,” in which the body literally eats itself. This is an important detoxification function in the body that cleans out damaged cells and creates new ones. \r\nIt’s safe to say that, as humans, we’re prone to overconsumption. Fasting - whether we give up food, shopping or social media consumption -  may prove to have benefits that we can’t ignore.",

        "transcript": "Bad language, violence, drug and alcohol abuse - critics have no trouble finding reasons to dislike video games. Grand Theft Auto is particularly controversial, which each new release seemingly more extreme than its predecessor. \r\nFor the British computer game designer Richard Bartle, the appeal of online RPGs (role-playing games) is that they are free from the pressures of daily life. “In video games, we are free to be who we really are - or at least find out who we really are if we don’t already know.” He said that video games offered people a chance to simply be themselves. \r\nIn a study published in 2012, a team of psychologists found that video games allowed players to be their “ideal selves,” for example, to experience themselves as braver or more generous. They noted that a player’s disposition is often reflected in their choice of character. In RPGs, players who assume the role of the medic (whose job is to keep the rest of the team alive in battle), will tend to play the same role in other games as well. \r\nBartle believed that these kinds of games are a search for identity. “Basically,” he said, “if you’re a jerk in real life, you’re going to be a jerk in any kind of social setting, and if you’re not, you’re not.” \r\nReturning to Grand Theft Auto, we find that it offers its players a playground. Video game worlds provide people with places where they can act free of judgment or punishment. Interestingly, freed of meaningful consequences, people continue to act according to their personality. As the philosophers say: wherever you go, there you will be.",

        "transcript": "Growth is good, right? Since World War II, GDP (gross domestic product) has been used to determine economic growth and a country’s overall prosperity. But now, some researchers and activists are questioning if growth is actually good. \r\nIn 1972, a report called The Limits to Growth was published by a team at MIT. The report simply stated that on a planet of limited resources, infinite growth isn’t possible. Eventually, non-renewable resources like oil and gas will run out.\r\nThis conclusion has led to the degrowth movement, which claims that the economy is largely responsible for an increase in carbon emissions and the climate crisis. Supporters of the degrowth movement call for a drastic reduction in energy and material use, which would mean the death of GDP. The degrowth movement believes that we need to separate the idea of progress and economic growth. The definition of economic success would change, resulting in a shorter work week and more free time. This shift in our cultural values could be  a way to change how we measure success and well-being, thereby addressing the growing financial and social inequalities that we currently face. \r\nUltimately, degrowth would mean that we’d have less stuff. With fewer people working to produce goods and materials, there wouldn’t be as many brands in supermarkets or so much clothing in shops. We’d have to take trains and buses instead of planes, and our free time would be spent doing free activities with loved ones rather than shopping and spending money.",

        "transcript": "We hear a lot about how bad social media is for us, though we all still use it. So it can't be that bad, right? Like anything in life, there are good and bad points to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and whatever other social media you use. \r\n\r\nAnonymity\r\nAnonymity is great, isn't it? We can be whoever we want to be when we are online, keeping our private lives completely separate. Anonymity also means we can keep ourselves as secure as possible, so would-be identity thieves can't access our personal details. Which is great. What is not so great about anonymity on social media as actually the same thing that is good about it; how can you really be sure who anybody is? People can be anyone; that doesn't necessarily mean they are being good!\r\n\r\nCommunity\r\nOne great part of all social media is networking and making friends. If you follow the Twitter account of a favourite TV show or the Instagram of a singer you like, you will get to 'meet' all kinds of people who share your interest. This makes us feel closer to the rest of the world, break down communication barriers, and overall lets us meet people we like. Though it also means social media is faceless, and sometimes that makes people forget there are real people behind the accounts. We can be cruel and unkind to strangers, not think before we speak, and when there is an argument, take sides that turn disagreement into bullying. The social media community is not so great when that happens!\r\n\r\nSafety and help\r\nSocial media has been a great help after natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis, helping people locate their loved ones and know where to go for shelter. For terrorist attacks, social media has helped keep people informed, safe, and help with coordinating emergency services. People even offer taxi services and spare rooms to help those in need. Equally, social media can be used to track down people who don't want to be found, like those who have left abusive relationships. Social media is filled with scams that rely on people being too trusting;  especially when there are events like natural disasters. Social media can do good, but can also do so much bad.\r\n\r\nNews \r\nIf you want to keep up to date with the latest news, places like Twitter are the place to go. With published news and personal views on everything that is happening in our world literally posted every second, you will always know what is going on. Which is not ideal for some; sometimes bad news is impossible to look away from, making us nervous or anxious. Sometimes the news on social media isn't factual either. If we don't use critical thinking and just blindly trust what we read, social media can be a dangerous place.\r\n\r\nSocial media. Good and bad, right and wrong, fun and frustrating; we know these things, and yet still can't keep ourselves away!",

        "transcript": "Sea turtles seem to think that sea debris smells like food. Sea debris could be anything like cigarette butts, fishing gear or plastic bags. Researchers at the University of North Carolina have discovered that ocean plastics inhabited by algae and microscopic ocean life, produce similar odors to the food eaten by sea turtles. Plastic in the form of plastic bags usually don't have a strong odor when we come into contact with it. Once this material ends up in the ocean, sea life tends to make it their homes. \r\nAlgae and microscopic organisms release compounds such as dimethyl sulfide which give off a really foul-smelling odor. Due to these compounds, the material starts to smell like food that sea turtles eat. A study was conducted to find out why sea turtles were attracted to plastic. Kayla Goforth and her team at the University of Georgia Marina Extension, took empty bottles and submerged them in an experimental water tank.  They decided to put fifteen Loggerhead turtles into this tank for testing purposes. A pipe ran into the tank and a fan blew the odors across the surface of the water. Four tests were conducted with deionized water, clean plastic as controls, turtle food and aged sea plastic. The team tracked the time spent out of the water and how many breaths they took. These turtles usually remain underwater for about 4 to 5 minutes and exchange air as they return to the surface.  It has been suggested that the main reason sea turtles end up eating and getting tangled in plastic is because they smell it out just like food. Additionally, plastic appears to look like jellyfish as they float, which could confuse sea turtles. Everyone  should be careful when using plastic as it might end up in the ocean, which is detrimental to turtles.",

        "transcript": "Elon Musk has been asked by NASA to help explore a nearby asteroid. This asteroid contains so much gold that anyone can become a billionaire on earth. SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, will join NASA to launch an uncrewed spacecraft to the solid metal blob called 16 Psyche. This could happen as early as 2022. The asteroid is very unique because it appears to be mostly made of exposed nickel-iron, which is from an early planet. \r\nPysche contains a lot of platinum, iron and nickel. It is also 193 km wide. The estimated value of all these metals are worth $15.8 quadrillion. If all these metals were brought back to earth, the world's economy would collapse as there would be an oversupply of metals. The value on earth would decrease significantly. The SpaceX Falcon rocket has been sent to the International Space Station (ISS) with a load of supplies. \r\nThis trip is to examine what the asteroid is made of and there is no intention of any mining. NASA scientists are confident to suggest that 16 Psyche is a survivor of planetary collisions. When the solar system was forming, collisions occurred regularly. Through this information, it could tell us how the earth's core and other planets were formed. The probe will hopefully reach the chunk of metal in 2026. Jupiter Trojan asteroids are considered to be relics of the solar system's earlier era. There is a possibility that Psyche is one of these relics. Every year four to five million ounces of gold is brought to the market which is not much compared to the amount in space. Asteroid ownership was made legal in 2015. Two space mining companies, Deep Space Industries and Planetary Resources are planning to get in on the action.",

It can be great for keeping in contact with people, and gives us the chance to see things from new perspectives. Though social media can also contribute to one of the worst parts of being online; cyber-bullying.\r\n\r\nWhen we post online or comment on other posts, much of what we do can be anonymous. Though whether we choose to share our personal details on Twitter, Instagram, and so on or we use pen names, we can still be victim to bullying. Or be the bullies ourselves! When we feel like saying something unkind, or don't think before we speak, it is an entirely different experience saying those words face to face than over the internet. Face to face, most of us would pause and think, but online the impact of those words perhaps doesn't feel so strong to the bullies. Though to those being bullied, whether their real name or their pen name is used, the impact can be awful.\r\n\r\nSo what is cyber-bullying, really? It is the kind of bullying that uses digital technologies, including social media. Bullying can include spreading lies, sharing embarrassing photos, sending hurtful messages or messages encouraging someone to hurt themselves, and impersonating someone sending cruel messages in their name. This can happen to anyone online, child and adult alike. \r\n\r\nThe impact of bullying ranges, depending on the individuals involved. For some, it can be a physical thing like losing sleep, stomach ache, and headaches. For others, bullying can result in feeling upset, angry, embarrassed, and all sorts of other negative emotions. And in some cases continued bullying means a person will lose all interest in the things they once loved, as well as trust in those around them.\r\n\r\nSocial media is beginning to take cases of bullying seriously. On Facebook and Instagram, we can send anonymous reports, and on Twitter users are encouraged to report bullying accounts. Cyber-bullying can be a very lonely, frightening experience, and it can feel like these platforms are doing little to help. They aren't doing enough, but as awareness of cyber-bullying increases, hopefully our understanding of what it means to be bullied will as well. \r\n\r\nOur online lives have become equally important to our offline ones, so when things like cyber-bullying happen, the answer isn't as easy as just walking away. The answer is that we work together, as members of the public choosing better ways to express our disagreements with strangers online, and social media platforms like Twitter doing all they can to make their spaces safe.",

        "transcript": "For the last century, the world’s most valuable resource was oil. However, now that we’re well rooted in the digital age, the value of data is soaring. It’s a little too simplistic however, to claim, “Data is the new oil!” Oil is a commodity, whereas data is an asset. But what’s the difference? Well, a commodity is an asset whereby each unit has the same value as another, such as oil, cocoa, coffee, gold or any other resource. But not all assets are commodities. Some examples of an asset are a house or a used car. The value of assets is not uniform i.e. two used cars are not necessarily worth the same amount of money. \r\n\r\nData is an asset which grows in value as it is used. To that end, one person’s data is of very little value, but the data of thousands of people is worth a fortune in the modern age because of how it can be used to improve services. For example, a company like Amazon, which wants to connect with customers or suppliers on demand, utilizes user data to match the customer with ideal products. Even YouTube works in this way: your homepage is tailored exactly to your tastes because of the video content you’ve watched before. An e-commerce company like Amazon or Alibaba can also interpret the data of its users to gain insight on market trends, users’ shopping habits, popular products and popular sales times. \r\n\r\nPlenty of companies do sell data of course, to other companies that wish to improve their own services. But the important thing to note is that data is more than just a saleable asset; it’s at the core of an organisation’s performance. The data that companies like Amazon and Alibaba have is of course incredibly valuable to third parties, but it’s even more valuable to the company itself! Much like selling your car might be a mistake as it will leave you without a car, it’s counterintuitive for these companies to sell all their data, as it’s much more valuable in the company’s possession than in the possession of another.",

Scientists in Sydney though have discovered a new use for it though, having created a way of using the Durian fruit to store energy for rapidly charging our electrical devices. It’s a little more complicated than simply plugging your iPhone into the flesh of the infamously foul-smelling fruit though! In a new scientific paper by University of Sydney professor Vincent G. Gomez though, the author describes a novel method for turning biowaste from these fruits into “supercapacitors” which can hold large amounts of energy. Since the materials used to make batteries are in rapid decline, there is now a bigger demand for alternative sources of energy storage. These electrochemical supercapacitors have the ability to store large amounts of energy, but can also be refilled when empty, unlike regular batteries, which are useless once the chemical within has been depleted. \r\n\r\nBut what’s the difference between a supercapacitor and a rechargeable lithium ion battery like the one that’s in your iPhone? They work in a similar way, but supercapacitors like the Durian fuelled one don’t contain toxic metals and can be recharged indefinitely without “wearing out”. Supercapacitors consist of large metal plates which are coated in a porous substance such as activated charcoal, or indeed the even more porous flesh of the durian fruit. These porous, or absorbent, qualities work just like a sponge, allowing a greater charge to be absorbed and stored within the capacitor. The only problem is that it is still quite an expensive exercise, but if the researchers can find a way of bringing it into the mainstream with a relatively low cost, it could be a huge boost in our fight against environmental unsustainability. \"Converting food wastes into value-added products will not only improve the overall economy, but also reduce environmental pollution,\" the researchers wrote in their paper.",

On the other hand, languages like Russian, Danish and and Norwegian are filled with consonants and narrow vowel sounds. A new study of over 600 languages suggests that the development of our languages is affected in large part by its climate, and its terrain. This kind of linguistic development has long been acknowledged in the animal world; birds tend to sing at a higher pitch in urban environments to help them be heard more easily, whereas forest-dwelling birds sing at a lower frequency. \r\n\r\nHowever, this new body of research carried out by University of California linguists Ian Maddieson and Christophe Coupe is the first to suggest that human language has followed a similar developmental pattern. They gathered data on 633 world languages, omitting widely spoken international languages such as English, Mandarin and Spanish because they are no longer limited to one climate. Using these language samples, they cross-analyzed them with ecological and climatic data to find out if indeed our languages are affected by our surroundings. A very clear pattern revealed itself: Languages in hotter, more tropical areas were often more full-bodied and melodious, and used much fewer consonants. In contrast, languages in colder, drier and more mountainous areas were much harsher in sound, and contained a lot more consonants.",

It doesn’t matter how outlandish or bizarre the dream is, we believe it. It’s only when we wake up that we notice how unrealistic the dream was. However, about 40% of us experience “lucid dreaming” at least once in our lives. This is when we become aware, while dreaming, that our dream is actually a dream. \r\n\r\nOften, when we suddenly realize that we’re dreaming, the shock  forces us into wakefulness. But for those of us who can remain asleep, this realization can give us control over our dreams! Imagine being able to turn your nightmare into a great adventure, one where you can fly, be invisible, have super strength, or live out any other fantasy you’ve ever had. Well, skilled lucid dreamers can do just that. The idea of lucid dreaming became incredibly popular after it inspired the 2010 film Inception, but the earliest record of it was made by Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle during the 4th century B.C. \r\n\r\nBut can we train ourselves to lucid dream, or is simply an in-born talent that certain people have? For most, lucid dreaming is just a spontaneous occurrence, where they suddenly find themselves able to control aspects, or indeed the entire narrative or setting of their dream, but the last decade has seen a rise in the number of people who are ‘training’ themselves to lucid dream. Many experienced lucid dreamers and trainers claim that it has a multitude of benefits, from allowing people to overcome phobias by encountering them in the dream state, to boosting their own creativity. For others, it’s simply a way of seeking adventure and escape from their own lives, like a kind of virtual reality game.",

These characteristics make it increasingly likely that mushrooms will soon be used to help aid many of the world’s problems. While we associate mushrooms only with eating, the edible part is just its body that grows above the ground. Below the surface however, mushrooms span out in a huge interconnected network of filaments called mycelium, which is renowned for being a tough and lightweight material. Mycelium is now being used by a growing number of engineers and even designers to make items from hats to shoes, and lighting fixtures to furniture! The reason for this is that it is so environmentally sustainable. Mushrooms can be grown very easily, even using food waste, and can be grown into any shape. They’re cheap to grow too, needing only water, some food from our own household waste, and air. Almost any type of waste has a species of fungi that can break it down and feed on it; there’s even one species that can soak up toxic metals, one that can eat plastic, and some that can grow on nuclear waste! While it might be quite a while until we all accept the idea of “growing” clothes from mycelium, waste-digesting mushrooms are already being used to help clean up the environment. At the site of the world's biggest oil spill in the rainforests of Ecuador, scientists are planning to grow giant mushrooms which will soak up toxic oil from deep down in the soil!",

        "transcript": "USA based scientists have developed a new piece of technology that allows amputees to control a prosthetic arm by simply using their mind. It’s called “nerve interface technology”, and it works by using muscle grafts, machine algorithms and electrodes to magnify the amputees’ faint nerve signals. These amplified nerve signals are then sent to the prosthetic limb in real time, effectively mimicking the function of a real limb. The technology, which until now existed only in the fictional world, is still in its early testing stage, and has only been applied to prosthetic arms thus far. Study co-author Dr Robert Oneal, of the University of Michigan, has labelled this “the biggest advance in motor control for people with amputations in many years.” The study used only four test subjects and each used the already existing Mobius Bionics LUKE arm. \r\n\r\nInitially, the researchers and developers found that the nerve signals in the amputated limb were too weak to be received by the electrodes they had inserted in the prosthetic arm, but by placing miniscule muscle grafts around the nerves, they were able to increase the strength of these signals. During the trial, the four participants were able to continuously pick up objects, make hand signals and move their fingers and thumbs individually simply by using thought. According to the researchers, the nerve interface worked for a little under one year before needing any adjustments or recalibration. One participant claimed, “It’s just like having a hand again… It brings back a sense of normality.” As of now, the researchers are planning on taking the technology into clinical trials.",

        "transcript": "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently announced that research was being done to test the possibility of a bridge connecting Scotland and the island of Ireland. The idea of connecting the neighbouring islands of Ireland and Great Britain by road has long been a popular one, but it has always been dismissed as impossible. In this most recent reincarnation of the idea, the locations for each entry to the bridge are the Scottish coastal town of Portpatrick and Larne on the northeast coast of Northern Ireland. If completed, this bridge would reach 40 kilometers in length, making it the world’s longest bridge built over open sea. That title is currently held by the Hangzhou Bay Bridge in China, while spans 36 kilometers across the Qiantang River Delta. \r\nThe bridge poses a number of significant challenges though, not only regarding its length. The Irish Sea reaches depths of up to three hundred meters, and the sea bed would have to be dug into to lay the foundations for the bridges support structure. As well as this, it would have to be built very high to allow ships to pass under safely, as the Irish Sea is an exceedingly busy body of water for commercial ships.\r\n\r\n Ian Firth of the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering suggests that there are alternative solutions though. “We could use floating foundations; the Norwegians have already done this for their own sea bridges.” In theory, this would entail a pontoon floating on the surface, which is tethered to the seabed to prevent it from floating very far. This would allow engineers to build the structure of the bridge on these floating platforms, rather than having to build hundreds of metres down through the sea. However, questions have been asked of the practicality of such a bridge. Northern Ireland and Scotland experience frequent inclement weather such as heavy rain, dense fog and gale force winds. Thus, cynics claim that while the bridge would cost an enormous sum of money, it would spend a great deal of its time closed to the public.",

        "transcript": "The sports brand Nike seems to have been around forever, such is its ubiquity in modern culture. However, it’s only actually existed since 1972, and it could have been a very different brand to what it is now. Originally founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports by Bill Bowerman, a university track and field coach, and his former student Phil Knight, it underwent a rebrand with the launch of the first Nike shoe in 1972. Six years later, Blue Ribbon Sports was renamed Nike, Inc. and they went public in 1980. However, before the launch of the now iconic shoe in 1972, the Nike narrative almost went in a completely different direction. \r\n\r\nPhil Knight writes in his book, Shoe Dog, that he’d ordered 3,000 pairs of sports shoes from a factory in Mexico, and he needed to make them appealing to the market. He hired a designer by the name of Carolyn Davidson and asked her to come up with a logo which evoked the idea of ‘motion’. In return for just $35, she came up with the now famous “swoosh” logo. Knight confesses that he didn’t like the logo much, but since his business partners did, he decided to let it go. Now all they needed was a name. After much deliberation, they were left with a choice of two: Falcon and Dimension Six. In a poll of their employees, neither was particularly popular, but the general consensus was that everyone hated Dimension Six apart from Knight, who himself had thought of the name. \r\n\r\nThe night before the final decision had to be made, Knight’s head salesman Jeff Johnson had a dream. In this dream, he thought of the name Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Upon hearing the name, Knight noted that many big brands had short names with strong letters like K and X; Kleenex, Xerox, Clorox etc. He also conceded that a brand named after the goddess of victory was an idea he liked, but, he writes, he wasn’t yet convinced. With the deadline to publicize the brand name upon them, Knight reluctantly elected for the name Nike. “Maybe it’ll grow on me,” He thought.",

        "transcript": "The genetic make-up of an octopus is so vastly different from any other form of life on earth, that some imaginative zoologists have gone as far as labelling it an alien life form! This of course suggests that the octopus is not even originally from this planet, which seems quite far fetched. Regardless of whether or not the octopus is actually an alien being, it has been found to be one of the most mystifying species in the animal kingdom, as no other invertebrates, i.e. animals with no backbone, display the intelligence of an octopus. In 2015, scientists managed to decode the genome of the octopus. Through studying all 2.7 billion characters of its genetic code, they found that its incredible intelligence developed much earlier than that of vertebrates. In fact, octopuses emerged on planet earth about 400 million years ago, 230 million years before mammals. \r\n\r\n“They were the first intelligent beings on the planet.”said Clifton Ragsdale of the University of Chicago, who helped lead the research project. It’s this intelligence, and indeed some almost “supernatural” powers that fascinate people like Ragsdale. For example, they’ve been shown to be able to figure out ways of escaping enclosures, even by using their “suckers” to grip and twist the lid of a closed jar in which it is trapped. They can fit through incredibly small spaces, despite their large size since they have no backbone, and can also hunt prey while it’s on land by jumping from the water at a high speed. They’ve even been documented using shells and other marine objects as tools! These traits all display incredible levels of intelligence, but making it almost supernatural is the octopus’ ability to simply detach one of its limbs if attacked and trapped! And finally, the octopus is a master of camouflage and shape shifting. It can mimic other animals and even the environment around, making it almost totally invisible...\r\n\r\nIt’s time to treat the octopus with some serious respect, it seems!",

        "transcript": "In a startling new discovery, research has shown that the speech of penguins follows some of the same rules and principles as human speech.There are two main laws of language that penguins have been found to adhere to. First, Zipf’s Law of Brevity, which dictates that the words we most frequently use, in almost any human language, are shorter and easy to say. Then there’s the Menzerath-Altmann Law, whereby longer words are composed of extra, but shorter, syllables. Language evolves slowly over many long years, but one pattern spans most human language: Information compression. This follows Zipf’s Law, as we tend to compress the most common words in order to convey information more efficiently. Everyday English examples of this are stop, walk, listen, eat, sleep, good and bad. \r\n\r\nAccording to the scientists behind this new body of research, the similar patterns observed in penguin speech is the first time that this has been seen outside of primates. The research team from L’Equipe de Neuro-Ethologie Sensorielle of the University of Lyon/Saint-Etienne recorded almost 600 mating calls of 28 adult African penguins between 2016 and 2017, and through careful of analysis, they found that the “words” used most often were indeed the shortest. On top of this, the longer words were made up of shorter syllables, following the Menzerath-Altmann law.",

        "transcript": "Tyres don't create fumes like our cars' tailpipes do, right? Well, that's not exactly true, and they're likely a bigger problem than we previously thought, according to a new study.\r\nEmissions Analytics released its latest study last week that showed tyres can produce emissions 1,000 times worse than tailpipe emissions. We've heard a lot about how governments, specifically in Europe, are working to limit tailpipe emissions in new vehicles, but tyres are a new area.\r\nNo, tyres don't spew fumes by themselves, but the problem comes from their wear over time. As a car rolls down the road, a tyre degrades and the particles enter the world. Not only tyres, but brake wear and even road surface wear are big contributors to what Emissions Analytics calls non-exhaust emissions.\r\nThe proof is in the figures. The study took a typical European hatchback, fit it with high-quality tires and performed some measurements. The tires created 5.8 grams worth of pollution in a single kilometre. Compared to European regulations that limit tailpipe emissions to 0.0045 grams per kilometer, it's a giant gap.\r\nThat's not all. The study noted it performed this test in near perfect conditions. If a driver's tyres are underinflated, they drive over rougher road surfaces or a driver equipped their car with cheap, budget tyres, the figure would grow.\r\nIn the US, they don't really like small hatchbacks, or small cars in general. Instead, bigger and heavier vehicles are the norm, and they're likely contributing to the problem. Not to mention, electric cars aren't perfect, either. EVs weigh a lot more than a comparable vehicle, and more weight means more tyre wear.",

Though he was earning $1.1m a year. His friend brought home to him that a lot of his staff must be struggling - and he decided to change that.\r\nBefore 1995 the poorest half of the population of the United States earned a greater share of national wealth than the richest 1%.But that year the tables turned - the top 1% earned more than the bottom 50%. And the gap is continuing to widen. In 1965, CEOs in the US earned 20 times more than the average worker but by 2015 it had risen to 300 times (in the UK, the bosses of FTSE 100 companies now earn 117 times the salary of their average worker).\r\nAfter crunching the numbers, Price arrived at the figure of $70,000. He realised that he would not only have to slash his salary, but also mortgage his two houses and give up his stocks and savings.\r\nSince then, Gravity has transformed. The headcount has doubled and the value of payments that the company processes has gone from $3.8bn a year to $10.2bn. But there are other metrics that Price is more proud of. Before the $70,000 minimum wage, employees were having between zero and two babies born per year amongst the team, and since the announcement - and it's been only about four-and-a-half years - they've had more than 40 babies.\r\nAt the time, Seattle was debating an increase to the minimum wage to $15, making it the highest in the US at the time. Small business owners were fighting it, claiming they would go out of business. The right-wing radio pundit, Rush Limbaugh, whom Price had listened to every day in his childhood, called him a communist. “I hope this company is a case study in MBA programmes on how socialism does not work, because it's going to fail,\" he said.\r\nTwo senior Gravity employees also resigned in protest. They weren't happy that the salaries of junior staff had jumped overnight, and argued that it would make them lazy, and the company uncompetitive.\r\nThis hasn't happened. Raising salaries didn't change people's motivation - Price says staff were already motivated to work hard - but it increased what he calls their capability.",

        "transcript": "With March 13, 2020, falling on a Friday, here are some facts and beliefs associated with the date that is synonymous with bad luck and superstitions.\r\nThe apprehension surrounding Friday the 13th may have biblical origins, as Christ's crucifixion is believed to have taken place on a Friday. Thirteen was also the number of guests present at the Last Supper, and the apostle Judas, who would later betray Jesus with the infamous Kiss of Judas, supposedly was the 13th person seated at the table, according to the New Testament. \r\nThe scientific term for the fear of Friday the 13th is “paraskavedekatriaphobia,” derived from the Greek words “paraskeví” meaning “Friday” and “dekatreís” meaning “thirteen.” Another term used to refer to the irrational fear of Friday the 13th is “friggatriskaidekaphobia” with “Frigga” referring to the Norse goddess and seer Frigg, after whom Friday is named in English.\r\nIt is estimated that every Friday the 13th costs the U.S. economy approximately $800-900 million in losses, according to the Stress Management Centre and Phobia Institute in Asheville, North Carolina, U.S., as many people refuse to do business or travel by air on the day. The Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapels in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., offers special zombie, vampire and horror-themed wedding ceremonies on Friday the 13th.\r\nFor a month to have a Friday on the 13th day, it must begin on a Sunday.\r\nHotel and hospital buildings often skip the 13th floor, and airports sometimes don’t have a gate no. 13. Airlines such as KLM, Air France, Lufthansa, and Continental Airlines have no 13th row on some of their aircraft. Lufthansa has no 17th row on its planes flying to certain countries, such as Italy and Brazil, because the number is considered unlucky in these parts. In Italy, Friday the 17th and not Friday the 13th is believed to be the day that brings misfortune. In fact, 13 is thought to be a lucky number.\r\nEvery year, Finland has dedicated one Friday the 13th as a National Accident Day. Since its inception in 1995, the day is aimed at raising safety awareness. During World War II, five German bombs hit Buckingham Palace in the U.K. on Friday, Sept. 13, 1940, and destroyed the Palace Chapel, as part of Adolf Hitler’s strategic “Blitz” bombing campaign.\r\nOn Friday, Oct. 13, 1989, the U.S. stock exchange suffered a major crash. The day is sometimes referred to as “Black Friday.”",

Unfortunately, this is not the case. Here is why this emergency situation does not mean we can ignore the damage we are doing to our planet.\r\n\r\nThe Coronavirus, or COVID-19, has changed the way we interact, work, and go about our daily lives. Because of the incubation period of the disease, and advice to self-isolate for two weeks if we show symptoms, travel and traffic overall, worldwide, has dramatically reduced. With less pollution from our daily commutes, we have seen a drop in emissions. But this is only temporary. The moment we return to business-as-normal, those emissions will spike again. We can't forget about the climate crisis while we are trying to keep ourselves (and our neighbours) safe.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations is demanding that we continue to take action on global warming following a report that shows 2019 to be the second hottest year ever on record. Who knows how 2020 will shape up in comparison, considering we started the year with the devastating forest fires that hit Australia? January 2020 was the hottest January on record! We are breaking all sorts of records currently, and not one of them seems to be good. The U.N. is concerned that all the attention we are giving the Coronavirus means we are paying less attention to the ongoing climate crisis. \r\n\r\nThe Coronavirus might reduce emissions for a few months, but with the smoke and pollutants from the Australian fires circumnavigating the globe, there was actually a spike in carbon dioxide emissions. Perhaps all the Coronavirus has done, then, is cancel some of those emissions out. But global heating is still accelerating. The last decade saw not only some of the hottest years on record, but also an entire decade that was the hottest in human history. And while the Coronavirus is frightening and something we do have to deal with, the virus is only temporary. Our climate crisis is ongoing, and will need working on for decades, perhaps centuries to come.",

        "transcript": "Phrenology is, or rather was, a pseudo-scientific discipline that surrounded the belief that the shape, size and imperfections of the skull could be interpreted into knowledge about one’s personal traits. This “science”, originally known as cranioscopy, was the product of Austrian physician Franz Joseph Gall in the 18th century. Gall maintained that the make up of someone’s personality could be attributed to the size of certain organs within the brain. By feeling the outside of the skull with one’s hands, it was possible to feel parts that were bigger than others, and therefore more likely to play a major role in their personality. This practice was widely accepted, even by leading figures such as Queen Victoria and Karl Marx. Indeed multiple thousands of books were sold on the subject during its zenith. \r\n\r\nOf course, over time the legitimacy in phrenology was debunked, as Gall neglected to take simple things like bone and muscle density and into account! By the 1840s, it was longer an accepted school of science, and was scoffed at by its peers. While there’s little doubt that Phrenology is an incredibly inexact science, it actually has helped pave the way for modern day Neurology. For example, phrenologists were derided for their belief that damage to the brain could lead to impaired mental facilities. This of course has been proven to be completely true today. Another belief that phrenologists held, and were criticized for, was that certain parts of the brain were responsible for different mental and motor functions. Yet again, the phrenologists were proven to be right! Phrenology may have been folly, but it did help lay the foundations for a lot of what we now understand about the brain.",

Also the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, Musk has long warned of the impact AI might have on humanity, and he maintains that to survive in an AI led world, we will need to foster a kind of symbiosis with machines! To that end, he and his team have developed fine ‘threads’ that can be woven into your brain which will be able to communicate with and control a machine with the power of thought. These threads work with a computer chip, and can pick up signals from your neurons. The company has also built a smart robot which can perform the surgery. In their latest announcement though, the researchers have said that for now, they will focus on using Neuralink to assist people with neurological illnesses. \r\n\r\nThe long term goal is to make it available to everyone however. This sounds like mere science fiction, but Musk and his colleagues have already made significant strides in perfecting this groundbreaking technology. The tiny chip called the N1 is placed inside the skull, and from this chip, ultra thin wires reach out to and connect with 1,000 brain cells. In theory, we could have as many as 10 chips installed in our brain! The chip connects wirelessly to a device that the user can wear over their ear. Musk claims that this technology will aid the lives of people with impaired brain-nerve connections, such as sufferers of epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease and even paraplegia due to spinal nerve injuries. Human studies have not yet begun, but they are pencilled in for later in 2020.",

        "transcript": "As the number of cases of the novel Coronavirus climbs past 160,000 worldwide, scientists from Stanford University are developing a way to speed up the process for finding a cure by using the general public’s computers. The Folding@home project uses the resources of personal computers around the globe to carry out research on the disease. The initiative has been around since 2000, and has contributed significantly to combatting a number of illnesses including Parkinson’s disease, Dengue Fever and Ebola. The incredible thing is that this research is done remotely, when the owners are not using the computers themselves. \r\n\r\nThe computers do not belong to just anyone though, rather they are volunteered by the owner. When the computer is idle, or unburned by resource-heavy work, it is controlled passively by the research team. This is known as “distributed computing,” which involves doing a multitude of different tasks simultaneously on thousands of devices. In essence, these thousands of computers work as a supercomputer, but they actually have more processing power as they are not accessible by other agencies. But how might this technology help fight the Coronavirus? Well, by using the power of this network of computers, scientists can run hundreds, and even thousands, of simulations on the performance of potential cures. With the widespread deployment of distributed computing, we stand a better chance of overcoming the spread of this disease.",

        "transcript": "It is a scary time for all of us right now. No amount of money, privilege, or perceived wealth of a country can really protect any of us from the Coronavirus spreading around the world. It is at times like these, when something external makes us all equal, that we really get to see the best and worst of one another.\r\n\r\nWe have seen so many examples of best and worst. We have seen people stockpiling things like toilet paper and hand sanitiser to then sell on for a higher price - a practice called price-gouging that is if not illegal then definitely frowned upon in situations like this. On the other hand, we have people buying a larger than normal amount of these products only to hand them out for free to the most vulnerable, such as our elder citizens and others whose health means they need to stay at home. We have seen fights break out in supermarket aisles, and kind shoppers picking items up for others too scared to go inside. We have witnessed ourselves at our most selfish and our most selfless. There is no way we will come out of this pandemic unchanged.\r\n\r\nItaly and Spain seem to be leading the way with keeping spirits up for those quarantined or in self-isolation. We see impromptu orchestras across balconies, opera singers serenading the streets from their own homes, and even community exercise where classes are taught by an instructor in the middle of apartment complexes so everyone can join in. We have seen shops and individuals post kind messages both online and around our streets offering their phone numbers and emails to those in need, whether they need a chat or some help with their shopping. Everything feels like bad news, but moments like these show us so much good.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration to look at during this difficult time is how technology has played a part. Thanks to the internet, Skype, social media, and other platforms, not only can many of us carry on regardless, but we can stay in touch. We can check on relatives, friends, and neighbours without even leaving our couches. We can laugh, and sing, and dance with other people from around the world, without even leaving our homes. The number of people who are learning, through kind helpers, that they can stay in touch with the rest of the world online is on the increase. So while we all do our bit to stop the Coronavirus spreading, we are still in contact with those we know and love. Perhaps that is the greatest kindness of all. \r\n\r\nWhat the Coronavirus has revealed is that we really are a community. We need to do our part to support that community; whether that is out and about helping our neighbours or staying home so we don't pass the virus on. We are all here, and we are going to get through this; one kind gesture or Skype call at a time!",

        "transcript": "Climate change is going to impact all of us, whether we accept it is a reality or not. We need to start thinking about ways to combat and cope with it as a society, moving away from individualist thinking. The answer is interdependency. But what does that really mean?\r\n\r\nInterdependency is actually how all of us really deal with our lives; we just don't know it! True interdependence really just means that we are mutually reliant on one another; as individuals, and as entire nations. Interdependence means teamwork and cooperation, collaboration on a scale that takes account of the needs and capabilities of everyone involved. We each hold on to our individuality bringing our own skills and experiences to a team setting, yet our goal is to achieve what is best for the whole.\r\n\r\nSo what does this mean in terms of climate change? Well, for starters, the belittling dismissal by world politicians and so-called 'boomers' of younger generations fearful of their future needs to stop. This isn't an interdependent view, it is an 'I won't be personally impacted so don't care' mentality that is both dangerous and selfish. On a wider scale, this also means wealthier nations that might have the financial ability to survive repeated storm surges and other extreme weather changes need to move away from only considering themselves. AOSIS states and poor countries will need their support. The efforts of these states and countries towards combating this climate crisis show far more interdependence than any of the rich countries in the world!\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest reason why the world hasn't come together with interdependence to help solve our climate problems isn't just about the money involved, though that will play a large part in the lack of decision-making we are seeing. Perhaps what is more important is that some nations perceive themselves as leaders, and in doing so think they should have dominance in any discussions about world policy. Interdependence doesn't need one true leader, it needs true collaboration from all involved. This would mean the likes of America would have equal status at the table to, for example, Indonesia. Interdependence means relinquishing control. Larger, wealthier nations aren't ready to do that!\r\n\r\nUntil we reach a point where we recognise the importance of using interdependence to shape our future, we are stuck. What is it going to take to change the way we view the world and our contribution to it?",

        "transcript": "The beginning of 2020 saw a series of storms that devastated a number of countries. Every week that we took a breath to recover and survey the damage, another storm seemed to be on its way. How can we ignore an inundation of storms as evidence of our rapidly changing climate?\r\n\r\nIn 2015, we had Storm Desmond, where 40 percent of the conditions were made more likely by climate change. In 2020, Storm Dennis is thought to be 100 percent due to climate change. Our climate is one degree celsius higher than it was a hundred years ago back in industrial times. One degree doesn't sound like much, but every degree puts seven percent more water in our atmosphere, which in turn leads to more and heavier rain. It is thought that a three degree rise in climate temperature would lead to about 20 percent more water in the atmosphere. How will we cope with the resulting flooding?\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the devastation suffered as a result of Storm Ciara and then Storm Dennis, that governments are not prepared. Storm Ciara alone brought a month's rain in the space of four hours; how do you prepare for that? In the U.K. many homes are built on flood plains leaving them exceptionally vulnerable to flooding, and often finding themselves unable to get insurance. Flooding relief measures and defences already in place are not sufficient, not for the individual, businesses, or communities as a whole. \r\n\r\nStorms are not just about heavy rain. They lead to flooding, which cuts off infrastructure, makes it impossible for businesses to trade, and forces us from our homes. Flood water is contaminated meaning that those who wade through flood water to safety or to salvage their possessions put themselves at risk of disease. Flooding puts strain on emergency services, and those within the insurance industry trying to get their policyholders back to 'normal', and the trickle-down effect can have consequences we don't really think of. From road repair following damage by flooding, to staff shortages while people try to put their homes back together, the impact of a simple storm and its resultant flooding is far wider reaching than we think!\r\n\r\nThe early storms of 2020 could be just a taster of what to come; when will our governments take our climate crisis seriously and make it a priority?",

One Chinese news outlet has shared that there has been a series of scandals regarding the misappropriation of public donations ever since the pandemic broke out, which caused a lack of confidence in how people’s funds are being distributed. In an effort to work against this, Chinese blockchain startup Hyperchain has developed a blockchain-based donation tracking platform called Shanzong. Anyone who wants to donate can use the platform to track their donation and see when their money is spent and for what. But Hyperchain is not the only blockchain solution for this problem. Another platform, this one developed by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, has enabled 87 China-based businesses to receive more than $200 million in loans since the Lunar New Year. \r\n\r\nThe importance of these small businesses to China’s economy cannot be overstated, as they contribute to more than half of national economic growth and employment. Additionally, in October 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the need for the country to become a leader in the technology. The pandemic has served as an incentive to implement many new technologies, like blockchain and artificial intelligence, into ways to detect the virus and even try and develop a cure. Chinese authorities are also using drones in remote parts of the country in order to ensure that citizens are using facemasks.",

        "transcript": "For a long time, physically coming into an office was considered a badge of honor, especially among older generations. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic in the world, it seems like this is about to change - and not just temporarily. As it turns out, fears about lack of productivity when working from home, often harbored by employers, are largely unfounded, and a big percentage of office jobs can be done at least equally well from home. In fact, a Stanford study found that people who work from home were able to work longer days, focus harder, and were generally happier, and their attrition rate also decreased by 50%. Additionally, the company was able to save almost $2,000 a month per employee in rent costs. \r\n\r\nAccording to Global Workplace Analytics, 67% of people want to work from home, and 36% would choose it over a pay raise. There’s also the added incentive of helping the environment by cutting out your daily commute, especially if you drive to and from work. However, there are also drawbacks, especially felt during the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for social isolation. Aside from losing out on office perks, like snacks and events, there is also the lack of social interaction. Working from home means you can’t head to the pub for a pint with your coworkers after a strenuous day. Still, most of these drawbacks have ways to be replaced, while the perks like increased productivity and employee happiness cannot be overstated. It’s only too bad that it took a global pandemic before employers realized this.",

According to officials, TCM experts have been working side by side with Western medicine professionals to find a cure for the pandemic. A study had even claimed that Shuanghuanglian, a traditional Chinese medicine, could “inhibit” the virus, although these claims were later withdrawn. However, traditional cures - while not necessarily a true cure - could help alleviate some of the milder symptoms of the disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). \r\n\r\nAlong with Shuanghuanglian, the Chinese often use Banlangen, a traditional cold medicine. Some of them have also historically had a bigger impact on medicine: Artemisinin was used by Chinese herbalists for more than 2,000 years for the treatment of malaria, and in the 1990s, it was adapted for use by the broader medical community. But the remedies used for COVID-19 have either not been tested in a laboratory setting or have been deemed not effective enough. That is why Western officials warn that traditional medicine should not be used to replace peer-reviewed solutions.",

While the term is usually used for companies, especially young startups that need to attract as many people as possible to remain viable, the coronavirus - or COVID-19 as it is more specifically known - has shown us how many people we’re in contact with daily, even if we don’t consider those people close friends. That’s also the reason why many people with backgrounds in technology and finance took the pandemic more seriously from the get-go than others: techies understand Moore’s Law, which says that computing power increases exponentially as its cost decreases dramatically, while people from finance understand the principle of exponential growth, at least from a monetary perspective. The analytical mindset, which is so common to these professionals, helps understand the way a pandemic spreads. And while growth hacking in businesses relies on ads specifically tailored to your tastes and maybe even hidden behind funny pictures and relatable content which you then send to your friends and spread that way, the virus doesn’t much care what you like to do in your free time - it only cares what route you take to work, and how many people you can sneeze at there. In that way, the interconnectedness of our society is, unfortunately, best taken advantage of by an actual virus, instead of viral internet content.",

Finland has settled on a simple solution to homelessness: give people a place to stay. \r\nHousing First is a program that provides homeless people with permanent homes - no strings attached. It also provides support services to help treat addiction, mental health and other problems, as well as to help people get back on their feet. It is based on the belief that having a permanent home can make it easier to solve health and social problems. The homeless are given a normal lease and pay as much rent as they can, depending on their income. The rest is covered by the local government. \r\nAll the homeless shelters in Finland have been turned into supported housing units like this. Of course, Housing Firsts costs money. However, a recent study showed that as much as €15,000 can be saved every year for each homeless person that is in supported housing.\r\nTraditionally, homeless people are told to sort out their problems, such as addiction or mental health problems, as a precondition to housing. With this approach, an apartment is seen as the ultimate reward. Critics point out that it’s nearly impossible to overcome an addiction while living on the street and trying to figure out how you’re going to survive another freezing night. \r\nAnd Finland’s approach is definitely an improvement. Since 2008, the number of long-term homeless people in Finland has decreased by 35%, and sleeping on the street has been nearly eliminated in Helsinki.",

Gary is an investigative science and health journalist. He has written a number of books, including a book called The Case Against Sugar. He believes that sugar is the cause of this epidemic. \r\nAs far back as 1978, we knew that diabetes was a major killer. Kelly West, the leading American authority on diabetes said, “Diabetes has already killed more people in the twentieth century than all wars combined.” \r\nBut how do we know it’s sugar? Researchers have looked at what happens when sugar is introduced to a population that normally does not consume sugar. For example, the Inuit and Native Americans experienced a large increase in diabetes, Alzheimer’s and cancer after being introduced to the typical western diet, which includes a lot of sugar. \r\nThe average American consumes 67 pounds of sugar a year. That’s a lot! Sugar is addictive, and its effects have been compared to that of a drug. Sugar causes our brain to release dopamine, which is associated with reward. However, the more sugar we eat, the less dopamine we produce naturally in the brain, which means we need more and more sugar to get the same pleasurable response. \r\nWhile the verdict may still be out on sugar, it’s safe to say that reducing our sugar intake will do us all some good.",

The Cavendish is the most common variety of banana, and today, it’s under threat. \r\nA fungus known as Fusarium Wilt started affecting banana plantations in Asia and Australia and has made its way to the Middle East and Africa. If the disease reaches Central and Latin America, where the majority of exported bananas come from, it could be game over for the Cavendish. \r\nWhy can’t we just stop the fungus? The problem is the bananas we eat don’t have seeds, so the ones eaten commercially are all clones. To make a new banana plant, you simply cut off a piece of an existing banana tree, plant it, and wait for it to grow. This means that if the fungus can kill one banana, it could potentially kill every banana of that type. \r\nSo what happens if the Cavendish goes extinct? At the moment there is no clear replacement. Scientists around the world are searching for alternatives. In Honduras, scientists are attempting to crossbreed two varieties to create a new breed that’s more resistant to this disease. In Australia, work is underway on a genetically modified super resistant Cavendish. \r\nUltimately the goal is to increase the genetic diversity of bananas so that we’re not dependent on single clones like the Cavendish.

These days, there’s a strong belief that using self-control is beneficial, although some psychologists disagree. \r\nStudies have found that it’s impossible to teach people to resist temptation. At best, there is a short-term gain. Psychologist Brian Galla from the University of Pittsburgh says, “We just don’t seem to be that good at self-control.” \r\nResearchers have found that the people who are really good at self-control are the ones who rarely have to use it. For example, if you are trying to eat fewer sweets and you find yourself in front of a chocolate cake, researchers say that the cake has already won. \r\nSo what can we learn from the people who are rarely tested by temptations? \r\nFirst, people who are good at self-control usually enjoy activities like studying, eating healthy or exercising - activities that many of us resist. Goals that you enjoy achieving are much more likely to be obtained than goals that you work towards out of obligation. \r\nYour habits also shape how good you will be at self-control. “People who do the same activity - like running or meditating - at the same time each day have an easier time accomplishing their goals,” according to Galla. \r\nGalla and other psychologists are excited about their new understanding of self-control. Rather than forcing ourselves to use self-control, it’s best to use it as a last resort to save ourselves from bad behavior.",

It’s not a new problem, although the citizens of first-century Rome probably didn’t experience today's level of productivity panic. \r\nThese days, we feel compelled to respond to the pressure of time by making ourselves as efficient as possible. Efficiency clearly has its appeal: it’s the promise of doing what you already do, only better, more cheaply and in less time. \r\nThe promise of efficiency led to the birth of time management. It promised that you could still create a fulfilling life while dealing with today’s increasing work demands.\r\nAnd yet, the most common experience for those trying to live as efficiently as possible is that the better you get at completing your tasks, the faster new tasks seem to arrive. After all, “Work expands to fill the time available for its completion,” noted British historian C. Northcote Parkinson back in 1955. \r\nSo you can make your days as efficient as possible, but the truth is that the techniques designed to improve our productivity more often than not serve to highlight the very anxiety they were meant to dispel of.

You’re probably also aware of what time it is, how much you weigh and approximately how much money is in your checking account.\r\nHowever, not all cultures have numbers. There are numberless tribes living deep in Amazonia along the banks of the world’s largest river. They rely on terms similar to “a few” or “some” in place of the numbers that you or I would use. \r\nHistorically, we are the unusual ones. For the majority of our species’ lifespan, we had no way to precisely represent quantities. \r\nAnumeric, or numberless, languages show us just how much the invention of numbers has changed the human experience. In one experiment, researchers placed nuts into a can one at a time, then removed them one by one. The (anumeric) person watching had to signal when all the nuts had been removed. The outcome? Anumeric people had trouble remembering how many nuts remained in the can, even if there were only four or five in total. \r\nHow did we even invent numbers? Most of the world’s languages use number systems based on the numbers 10, 20 or 5. Our linguistic ancestors used their hands to realize things like “five fingers on this hand is the same as five fingers on that hand.” These thoughts turned into words which were passed down through generations.\r\nKnowing about anumeric people helps us to appreciate the depth of our linguistic diversity.",

Millions of tons of organic waste end up in landfills each year, yet food waste is not usually a priority for climate activism, even though the recycling of organics is at least as important as that of paper, metal or plastics.\r\nOrganic waste does more than just stink when it ends up in a landfill; it turns into climate poison. When organic material is left to rot in a landfill it releases methane, which is a far greater threat to global warming than CO2.\r\nThings are different in South Korea. Today, South Korea recycles 95 percent of its food waste. A mere 25 years ago almost nothing was recycled. Trash used to end up in dumps on the outskirts of major cities where poor families went through it looking for anything of value. Rotting food waste began to make the garbage pickers sick and the government knew it had to do something. \r\nBy 2006, citizens were required to separate their food waste so that it didn’t end up in a landfill. Residents of Seoul now purchase biodegradable bags for their food waste, which they dispose of in automated bins. The bins weigh the food waste and people are charged according to how much they throw away. The average cost of food-waste recycling for a Seoul family is $6 a month. \r\nSouth Korea produces around 13,000 tons of food waste daily. Thirty percent of this food waste is now turned into compost, 60 percent into animal feed and 10 percent into biofuel. \r\nThe economic benefit of these policies, over the years, is estimated to be in the billions of dollars.",

The announcement came via a press release rather than a media event, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\r\nThis is the first time that Apple has announced such a high-profile product with such little fanfare. Apple said the Lidar technology can also be used for measurement apps, to more accurately deduce a person’s height, for example, or the width of an object.\r\nThere are 11in and 12.9in versions of the new tablet, starting at $799 and $999 respectively. They claim that it has the most advanced camera they’ve ever seen on a tablet by far. He suggested consumers would see an increasing \"push\" for augmented reality technology in the coming months and years. Apple also unveiled a separate detachable keyboard, the Magic Keyboard, it costs $299 (£250) for the 11in version and $349 for the 12.9in version.\r\nApple has never shied away from charging a premium for its products. Some 10in HD tablet computers are available for a lower price than the Magic Keyboard alone, but Apple had a unique position in the market.\r\nApple also launched a new MacBook Air with a redesigned keyboard mechanism. The company has faced criticism in the past regarding the “uncomfortable” typing mechanism on some of its older MacBook Pro computers, and there were many complaints of keys breaking after months of use.",

In the case of Belgium, that turns out to be french fries.\r\nPeople are generally allowed to go out to buy groceries. They can visit the doctor and the pharmacy. But, beyond that, what’s considered essential varies from country to country, and many have allowed culturally flavoured exceptions.\r\nBelgians can still get their fries - In Belgium, people can still buy tasty, oil-fried potato slivers from the iconic sidewalk stands, the friteries. Belgians, at least, think these fries are the best in the world. Shut down Belgium’s fries stands, apparently, and shut down the soul of the nation. Leaders have avoided dealing such a grievous blow, even as they.\r\nThe French can still get their wine - France shut down most commerce on Monday. But the government published about 40 categories of exceptions. The country will not have to do without its wine stores. And small-food-shop life can keep going, as bakeries, butchers, tobacco shops and fine grocers may remain open.\r\nSeveral wine shops, instead of opening to the public, are offering delivery of “survival wine packs” of six or 12 bottles of wine. The French lockdown will last until at least April 16.\r\nThe Dutch can still buy marijuana - In the Netherlands, leaders have declared cannabis a coronavirus-era priority. The decision may help ease anxieties in a pandemic-stricken nation.\r\nOfficials are allowing the coffee shops to open their to-go counters. Customers can’t light up in the shops anymore, though, in a nod to social distancing.\r\nThe Germans can still rent and buy bikes - In Germany, life is less locked down than elsewhere in Europe, and each German state can decide for itself what will remain open and what will close. But bike shops have been singled out by national and some state authorities as essential assets.\r\nGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn encouraged Germans to get around by bike as a healthy, social-distancing-appropriate mode of transportation, in preference to trains and buses.\r\nItalians can still read print newspapers - Italy remains the European country hardest hit by the coronavirus, and there are few exceptions to its near-total shutdown.

        "transcript": "St. Patrick’s Day is a cultural and religious holiday celebrated by the Irish community around the world on March 17. The day traditionally marks the death of Saint Patrick, and acknowledges the arrival of Christianity in Ireland. However, the day has evolved to also celebrate the Irish spirit and Irish culture more generally.\r\nBorn in the fourth century, the main patron saint of Ireland, Saint Patrick, was not actually Irish. He is believed to have been born into a well-off family in Britain, then a part of the Roman Empire.\r\nThe colour green has become symbolic with the day because of Ireland's lush landscape, earning it the name Emerald Isle. However, back in the 17th century, the colour associated with festivities was blue.\r\nAs far back as 1681, a popular practice (usually by children) on the day was to wear decorated Celtic crosses made of paper. The practice began to disappear in the 20th century.\r\nSt. Patrick is believed to have used the three-leafed shamrock to explain the Christian Holy Trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The shamrock has since been linked to the festival and is sported by the Irish around the world. Shamrocks aren't an actual plant. They can refer to several botanical species of clovers or three-leaved grasses like wood sorrel.\r\nTill the 18th century, St. Patrick’s Day was only considered a Roman Catholic feast and was celebrated only in Ireland, where people would pray in a church or at home. However, the now-popular tradition of parades started in the U.S. began when Irish immigrants began celebrating on March 17 as a show of pride and ode to their culture. \r\nThe first gathering in the U.S. to honour St. Patrick took place in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1737, and the tradition of parading began in 1766 when Irish Catholic members of the British Army ushered in the day with fifes and drums.\r\nOn this day, people around the world are seen wearing green clothes, drinking green beer and even dyeing water bodies, like the Chicago River, green. Not wearing green on this day can get you pinched. An early 18th-century American belief was that wearing green made one invisible to leprechauns and fairies. These mischievous creatures would pinch those they could see, so anyone not donning the colour gets pinched as a reminder.\r\nAs part of the celebration, revellers around the world indulge in corned beef and cabbage with soda bread, considering it an authentic Irish meal. However, cabbage is traditionally eaten with bacon in Ireland, but the Irish picked up corned beef to go with cabbage when they immigrated to the U.S.",

One of the major preoccupations of HR is tracking time and attendance, and employees’ smartphones can be an extremely useful tool to do that.

For instance, if there are imbalances in our gut bacteria, usually caused by antibiotics or a bad diet, we will suffer different consequences, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, or we will develop other conditions that are harmful to our health. Taking antibiotics can destroy the healthy bacteria in our gut (those that help different processes, such as synthesizing vitamins, or digesting fibre), so one way to prevent that is to take probiotics. They are living microorganisms, which naturally occur in some fermented foods, such as yoghurt.

        "transcript": "Before 60 years of whaling decimated their population, the South Georgia Island off the coast of Antarctica was a teeming feeding ground for humpback whales, blue whales, fin whales, and southern right whales. Now, researchers at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) have discovered that many of these whales have returned—some in large numbers—to South Georgia.\r\nSince the international moratorium on whaling in 1982, decades of protection have allowed the critically endangered blue whale—the largest of these beasts and the largest animal ever to live—to bounce back considerably after losing 97% of the species.\r\nIn 2018, the research mission recorded only 1 sighting and several acoustic confirmations of blue whales—but this year’s voyage logged 36 sightings, totalling 55 individuals. The 2020 expedition also found evidence of around 20,000 humpback whales, and managed to satellite tag several rare southern right whales.\r\nResearchers were thrilled to see so many whales visiting South Georgia to feed again. South Georgia is a place where both whaling and sealing were carried out extensively. It is clear that protection from whaling has worked and the sighting of so many blue whales suggests there is still ample food available for these leviathans.\r\nNo whale is worth more to the public good than the blue, and these massive beasts take more than 33 tons of carbon with them down to Davy Jones’ locker when they die. While alive, their massive “faecal plumes” nourish entire communities of phytoplankton which suck up hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 every year.\r\nThe discovery during the BAS 2020 survey has prompted the call for a new assessment of Antarctic blue whale recovery to be conducted by the International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee next year in order to find out how well they are recovering from the whaling years.",

        "transcript": "The pandemic that has idled scores of commercial flights is having a little-noticed consequence for meteorologists, whose forecasts rely, in part, on data collected from planes. In terms of importance, aircraft data are usually in the top five.\r\nAirplanes have been gathering weather data since WWI. The U.S. Weather Bureau first paid pilots in 1919 to carry instruments attached to wing struts to a height of 13,500 feet (4,100 meters). The flyers who got higher were paid a bonus. \r\nThe modern data-collection network took shape in 1998 when the World Meteorological Organization created the Aircraft Meteorology Data Relay Panel, which led to a fully automated system for gathering weather data from commercial, private and military aircraft. The flight information is radioed to ground stations and relayed to meteorologists. That data is combined in forecasting models with satellite observations and readings from weather balloons, ground stations and even buoys at sea.\r\nTotal loss of airplane data can have an impact. The European Centre, whose Euro weather models are touted as the gold-standard among many forecasters, ran a simulation last year that eliminated all airliner reports and found short-range forecast skill for temperature and wind fell by about 15%, with a smaller loss in prediction of high- and low-pressure patterns.\r\nSome of the data could also be made up by additional weather balloon launches, an undertaking that is often used in anticipation of weather emergencies such as a hurricane bearing down on a coastline. Balloons are currently launched twice a day at 850 weather stations worldwide, climbing to heights up to 115,000 feet while radioing back information every second.",

        "transcript": "Sleep is fundamental to an infant’s development. On average, a newborn baby sleeps for about 16 hours in a 24-hour time period. Though it may seem like an infant spends a lot of their time sleeping, it does not feel this way for new parents because an infant’s sleep cycle is much different than an adult’s in that it changes quickly and often. Therefore, getting an infant to sleep through the night becomes a challenge for many new parents.\r\n\r\n Since a baby’s sleep patterns change so frequently, parents often become sleep deprived because their own sleep patterns become disrupted. The big question becomes: when does a baby’s sleep pattern start to emerge? Through an NYU sleep study, an app was created to track and collect data regarding the sleep patterns in adults. More specifically, it tracked when a parent woke up to feed or change their baby. The participants tracked their time down to the minute. Through the study, it was observed that at one month, there were no sleep patterns developed, but at around 4 months, an initial sleep cycle began to emerge. By 8 months, a pattern started, and within a year, a clearer pattern was seen. Since the NYU Sleep Study is still in the early stages, the data has not been officially published. However, it is evident that the transition from no sleep pattern to sleeping through the night is something that all babies figure out in about one year.",

        "transcript": "Every animal on Earth has a circadian rhythm, a 24-hour cycle that is linked to the sun. Humans have an internal clock that is located in the hypothalamus of the brain. On average, babies sleep 16 hours a day, but these are not consecutive hours. Instead, they are broken up throughout a 24-hour day, resulting in wake and sleep cycles. Babies cycle through wake and sleep rapidly. In fact, over the course of 24 hours, babies can have over 100 wake and sleep cycles! \r\n\r\nBut as babies begin to grow, their internal clocks begin to regulate. At what age does this occur? Researchers used baby rats to answer this question because baby rats cycle through wake and sleep just as quickly as infants do. In the experiment, researchers put a dye into the brain of a newborn rat, right where their internal clock is located. At first, the researchers saw nothing new in regards to how the red dye spread, but a week later, researchers found that the red dye that was located near the internal clock region had spread closer to the rat’s brain stem. This meant that connections in the rat’s brain were being made and the evidence suggested that the same thing was happening in a newborn. Ultimately, the connections between the internal clock region, the area where the hypothalamus is located, and the brain stem, where the wake and sleep cycles happen, is what regulates the circadian rhythm. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no way for a parent to speed up the process of regulating the circadian rhythm in an infant. Instead, a parent will have to wait for three to four months for these connections to happen naturally.",

For example, if you dreamed about running away from something, your legs might start to twitch. But now, science is suggesting otherwise. In an attempt to understand what twitching is a result of, researchers studied the brain activity of newborns while they slept. It was found that when a baby twitches in their sleep, their brain sends out signals to the rest of their body, similar to how a submarine transmits signals out into a deep ocean. In essence, the brain is trying to figure out “what’s out there” as it tries to figure out the rest of the body. From the results of this study, researchers now believe that when babies twitch, they are really mapping out all the different parts of their body and how they are all connected to one another.",

In a past study, it was concluded that sleep deprivation in young adults was bad for the memory, and that sleep was ultimately necessary for human development and maintenance. Is this the same for newborns? \r\n\r\nIn one experiment, 9-month old babies were taught a simple task: how to play with toys they hadn’t seen before. The infants were shown eight different toys and four of them had to be played with in a certain way. The researchers showed the infant how to play with the specific toys and then they gave the toys to the infants to see if they could remember the actions the researchers performed. After this initial process, the research began. For the first part of the experiment, the babies were kept awake during the time they would normally be napping. It was observed that if the babies skipped their naptime, they couldn’t remember any of the toys they were initially shown. However, in the second part of the experiment, the researchers let the babies take their normal naps. It was found that the babies were able to remember the toys and, more importantly, how to play with them correctly. \r\n\r\nThis experiment ultimately showed the importance of sleep. Babies need to take naps multiple times a day because they need time to process the information that’s coming in so that they can store that information in a more permanent location. Ultimately, sleep is important for our cognitive, emotional, and physical health.",

In the last decade or so, researchers have discovered that babies’ bodies can change and respond to exercise and loading the same way adults’ bodies can. Researchers studied this idea by observing and comparing how adults and toddlers walk using 3D imagery, motion sensors, and force plates. Researchers observed that when adults walked, their knees were underneath their center of mass, which allowed them to lift one foot up and stay balanced on their standing leg. Most of their force was angled from front-to-back. This resulted in their bones forming a teardrop shape. \r\nWhen the toddlers were observed, their legs just went straight down from their thighs to the knees to the feet, resulting in them having a really wide base to support themselves with. Researchers specifically wanted to measure the front-to-back force and the side-to-side force in toddlers. It was concluded that during this brief period of development, a baby’s body is laying down more bone on the sides of their legs in order to resist the back and forth movements, resulting in the baby having more oval-shaped bones than teardrop-shaped bones. \r\nHowever, once babies do stand up and start walking around more frequently, the shape of their skeleton will change. In essence, this reaffirms that babies need to exercise as early as possible in order to maintain healthy muscles and skeletons as they continue to grow.",

In an experiment, researchers showed crawling and walking babies different objects and gave an emotion towards each object. The babies were then observed as they played. As the babies were playing, parents were given a language survey to fill out so they wouldn’t distract their babies too much. \r\n\r\nInteresting enough, it was found that babies who walked had significantly larger vocabularies, in terms of understanding what their parents were saying to them, than babies who crawled. In a follow up study, the participating babies wore a LENA recording device all day so that researchers could capture what the baby heard and said. In terms of quantity, the crawling infants heard the same number of words and made the same number of vocalizations as walking infants; however, in terms of the quality of the language environment, parents seemed to be interacting differently with toddlers who walked versus toddlers who crawled. \r\n\r\nFrom the research, it seemed that when babies made the transition from crawling to walking, there was an increase in their vocabulary development as well as an increase in the rate at which they were learning new words. Talking is important at any age, but it becomes even more important as a baby begins to walk. When a baby begins to walk, the way a parent interacts with it changes.",

        "transcript": "The ability to fall asleep quickly can be a challenge for many people. But, there are a few ways you can fall asleep within a matter of minutes. One of the ways you can fall asleep quicker is by sleeping in a cooler environment. Sleeping in a cooler environment not only helps you ease into sleep, but it also can improve your sleep quality. Oftentimes, we unintentionally overheat ourselves by sleeping with heavy blankets, wearing warm pyjamas and socks, or by sleeping in a hot bedroom. \r\n\r\nHowever, sleeping in a cooler environment has been shown to decrease slow-wave sleep and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. To begin falling asleep, your body has to drop 2-3°F (1.5°C) and being in a cooler room helps bring your body temperature down faster. The recommended room temperature ideal for sleep is roughly 65°F (18°C). Another way to help you fall asleep faster is to take a hot shower or bath before bed. When you expose your body to hot temperatures, your body can’t hold onto the heat, and so, it sends your blood to the surface of your skin. When you step out of a bath, the dilated (widening) blood vessels radiate out inner heat to your surrounding environment causing your core body temperature to drop. This drop in temperature triggers your body and brain to think that it’s time to go to sleep. \r\n\r\nThe last way you can fall asleep quicker is by limiting or avoiding caffeine before bed. Beverages like coffee, tea, Coca Cola, and even some chocolate contain caffeine and can take up to eight hours to fully wear out. So, it’s better to eat foods or drink beverages with caffeine earlier in the day. Of course, these methods are not the only ways to quickly fall asleep; there are many more that exist. In the end, sleep is important and you must find what works best for you.",

        "transcript": "Sleep is extremely important and necessary to function efficiently and productively on a daily basis. What happens when your body doesn’t get enough sleep? In a study, researchers were able to find out how much sleep is required each night by assigning groups of people to four, six, and eight hours of sleep per night over a period of fourteen days. Those who slept for eight hours were more attentive and had fewer cognitive lapses. Those who slept six hours showed a steady decline in cognitive testing. In fact, the people who slept for six hours over a two-week span displayed a similar reaction time to those who had a blood alcohol level of 0.1%, which is the equivalent to being legally intoxicated. \r\n\r\nThose who slept for four hours suffered even more and occasionally fell asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, the participants’ brain functions decreased daily, resulting in the accumulation of sleep debt. However, it was noted that after a couple nights of good quality sleep, the body and brain were fully able to recover. But if sleep debt continued, the recovery time would take longer. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, most studies show that anywhere from seven to eight hours of sleep each night is best. However, there are individuals who genuinely don’t need a lot of sleep each night and this is attributed to genetics. Ultimately, a person’s body and brain needs to figure out its own sleep needs.",

        "transcript": "When the movie Inception came out, it sparked a lot of interest behind the idea of what it means to dream. Lucid dreaming is a dream in which the dreamer is aware they are dreaming. But is lucid dreaming a concept only fit for the movies or is it something the average person could achieve? It turns out that lucid dreaming is possible with effort and practice. On average, everyone has roughly 3-7 dreams each night. The problem is that we tend to forget them. One way you can work toward lucid dreaming is to keep a dream journal beside your bed. Every time you wake up, record what you can remember. In doing this, you are tracking your dreams and improving your ability to recall them, thus improving lucidity. \r\n\r\nThe next step is to perform reality checks. In a dream, a simple action such as counting one’s fingers often becomes distorted. If you form a habit of doing reality checks, such as counting your fingers when you’re awake, you’ll be able to tell when you are dreaming and when you aren’t. \r\n\r\nNext comes MILD (Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dreams). As you begin to fall asleep, think of a recent dream and imagine yourself becoming lucid. The idea is to help you realize you’re dreaming in your dream. When you’ve succeeded with MILD, you can try a technique called WILD (Wake Induced Lucid Dreams). The idea behind this concept is to keep your mind aware while your body falls asleep. Be careful though: you may experience a phenomenon that prevents your body from moving called sleep paralysis. Research done on lucid dreaming has provided us insight into the location of the meta consciousness in the brain, and has also provided opportunities for dream therapy and nightmare recession. Who knows: perhaps with more time, research, and practice, we could actually shape and manipulate our dreams in any way we’d like.",

The reason for the bleaching has possibly been caused by warmer ocean temperatures. This reef is 1400 miles long and it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the longest and largest coral reef in the world. Due to the widespread bleaching, it is in danger of losing its status. Some areas which were previously unaffected have undergone moderate or severe bleaching. The good news is that scientists have also found healthy coral pockets. One thing to be noted is that bleached corals are not dead corals. There is a pretty good chance that most bleached corals will recover on mild or moderately bleached reefs and survive this event. In the same way, coral mortality would increase on severely bleached reefs. Some major tourism areas, specifically the northern and central Great Barrier Reef, have shown only moderate bleaching. These reefs are expected to regenerate and survive. The UN has warned that 90 percent of the world's corals will die if temperatures increase by 1.5 degrees Celsius.",

Hasty initiatives to access mobile phones to trace population interactions and especially infected persons threatens privacy, freedom of expression and freedom of association.\r\n“Dictatorships and authoritarian societies often start in the face of a threat.\" UN Special Rapporteur Joseph Cannataci said. \"That is why it is important to be vigilant today and not give away all our freedoms.\" \"We must not sleepwalk into a permanent expanded surveillance state now,\" cautioned Rasha Abdul Rahim, deputy director of Amnesty International's tech division.\r\nHRW said — just weeks into the pandemic — 14 nations were using applications to trace carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus or enforce quarantines. And some 24 countries already used telecommunications for location tracking.\r\nChina's blanket \"health code\" tracing in Wuhan, the city where the virus is said to have been first passed on to humans, has parallels in South Korea — where maps emerged tracing patients — and Singapore. Voluntary usage has been encouraged in other nations such as Austria, where an app called \"Stopp Corona\" has been downloaded 130,000 times.\r\nUsers are told they will be notified if later one of their contacts contracts the virus. Austria's Justice Minister Alma Zadic dismissed privacy concerns, saying she would download the app herself. In Israel, 1.5 million people have downloaded \"HaMagen,\" an app that alerts users if they have crossed paths with a coronavirus patient. \"We need to make sure all Israelis have the app,\" said Morris Dortman, deputy director general of Israel's Health Ministry.",

        "transcript": "Tourism is down in the ancient city of Lopburi, and the local monkeys are going ape. In one of the more unusual incidents being attributed to the new coronavirus outbreak, a turf war between dozens of street monkeys and temple monkeys broke out in Thailand's historic city of Lopburi. According to city residents, the furry fracas likely resulted from a sharp dip in tourism to the 800-year-old city — and thus a dip in free food offerings to thousands of local monkeys.\r\nThousands of crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) live in Lopburi and the nearby Phra Prang Sam Yot temple complex, which dates to the 13th century. Both groups are used to being fed human food by the hundreds of tourists who visit the site every day. The city even hosts an annual Monkey Buffet Festival, where visitors construct elaborate towers of fruits and vegetables for the temple monkeys to feast on.\r\nBut with tourism to the area down, even the macaques are feeling the squeeze. A gang of dozens of \"invading\" temple monkeys entered the town in search of food, eventually brawling in the street with the town's local monkey population. What were they squabbling over? A single yogurt cup. The fight stopped traffic for 10 minutes as paws flew and screeches filled the air.\r\nBy late in the day, city residents laid out additional food offerings at the temple, and the monkey crowd largely dispersed.\r\nAbout 39 million tourists visited Thailand last year. More than 10 million of those tourists were Chinese. Ongoing travel bans in China (and increasingly around the world) have seriously hampered Thailand's tourism industry.",

A lot of people have found that there is so much free time on their hands.  Governments have had to make many decisions such as closing schools and limiting the number of people together.  No one can go to the movies, sports events or concerts anymore. It's really difficult to think about what to do with all this free time. In order to make social distancing fun, one needs to keep busy with a variety of activities. In particular, children should remain active to ensure that their physical and mental health is maintained. A variety of different exercises can be done indoors or outdoors. Taking up a new hobby will benefit anyone who does it. Learning new skills will help people stay focused and alert. There are new skills that people could start developing such as baking, painting, sewing or playing an instrument. It is also essential to keep your brain active, so reading books is good too. Taking a break from the news and social media is also necessary at times. Using apps like WeChat, WhatsApp, Telegram, Hangouts, Facetime or Skype is a good way to keep in touch with family and friends. It is vital to keep a regular routine, such as waking up in the morning and going to bed at the same time. By doing these kinds of activities, everyone will feel more uplifted and energized.",

However, since it is so new, the learning curve is also steeper than in other, more established areas. This means that anyone who wants to work in this industry has to be ready for constant challenges and ways to improve themselves. You are more likely to land a good job if you already have a few years of experience working in tech, and if you have experience working with blockchain directly, you should have no problems finding a new job. \r\n\r\nAnother good idea is having a portfolio of blockchain-related projects you have worked on. Even if it’s just something you were experimenting with on your own time, it shows both interest and initiative, since you’ve picked it up without any external obligation. Then, make sure you update your CV. If you have a lot of work experience, it’s best to highlight relevant experience, and only mention the rest. \r\n\r\nMake sure to mention your knowledge of any relevant programming languages like Solidity. For best results, you should look at blockchain-specific ad boards like blockew.com and cryptocurrencyjobs.co. Another big aspect of successfully finding work is networking. Try to attend as many local meetups as you can, which will help you meet people from the industry who could help you find the job you want.",

Due to the world-wide quarantines and lockdowns, everything is coming to a halt. This leads to shortages of essential goods like food and medicine, and a surplus of non-essential things like luxury items. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, since many salaries are being cut and many people are losing jobs, governments that rely on tax payments from those salaries are also feeling the hit. That means they have to encourage everyone to spend more - and nobody wants to spend on anything they don’t need in the crisis, since they don’t know how long it will last. \r\n\r\nBlockchain offers a temporary solution which can minimize the effects of the crisis: governments can issue tokens, backed by their national resources for example, that can later be redeemed for fiat currencies. Individuals can tokenize their work time - instead of working for just one employer, they could be offering their services to multiple people and getting paid accordingly. This means employers are still effectively saving up money as they’re paying only the amount of time employees actually spend working, while individuals can choose how much they want to work (and earn) on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nCompanies can tokenize their output. Governments then buy those output tokens and put the companies to use (either using their machines or their services) based on the amount they purchased. Then, companies buy the employees’ workforce tokens, completing the circle. The system is not too different from what currently exists in the world, but bringing it onto the blockchain makes it run faster than it has before, minimizing paperwork and bureaucracy, and the tokens act as promises which additionally prevent forgeries and double spending due to the nature of blockchain.",

That he was different from a stereotypical football player first came to light when the paparazzi noticed his phone’s screen was cracked and asked him about it. \r\n\r\nHe said he didn’t see the point in spending money on a new phone when his old one was still working, and revealed what he instead considers a more worthwhile investment. “I was hungry, and I had to work in the field; I survived hard times, played football barefooted, I did not have an education and many other things, but today with what I earn thanks to football, I can help my people,” he told the press, adding, “I built schools, a stadium, we provide clothes, shoes, food for people who are in extreme poverty. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I give 70 euros per month to all people in a very poor region of Senegal which contributes to their family economy.” Mané’s story could serve as an example of how easily life is improved for those living in extreme poverty - but instead of relying on the goodwill of a few rich people, we should have a system which lets everyone live a dignified life, either through a set income or through free access to basic services. That way, Mane would not have to feed entire villages - nor would they have to wonder what they will do once he retires.\r\nLet's discuss Sadio Mané's story here",

There have been several key takeaways from this: that we need to take better care of our environment, that we need to appreciate our friends and families more, and that there has to be a system in place to protect society from economic hardship during a crisis that cost millions of people their jobs, if not their lives. \r\n\r\nWhile this health crisis will pass, the International Monetary Fund now expects the global economy in 2020 to suffer its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Research professor at the University of London Guy Standing believes that it will be impossible to revive the global economy without a universal basic income. “We are going to have some sort of basic income system sooner or later, but I think getting the establishments of many countries to do it is like pulling the proverbial tooth,” he said. \r\n\r\nSo far, many political parties are pushing for government help to citizens during the time of this crisis, but Standing warns that it will not be enough to only cover people’s expenses for a limited amount of time, as they are less likely to spend the money if they don’t expect to get any more anytime soon - and money not spent spells trouble for the whole economy.",

One is the question of how either UBI or UBS would be funded. Many opponents of these ideas argue that there is no way to fund them, and that simply asking taxpayers to pay more is unfair. But an individual contribution is actually far less than it seems: after all, if you’re also a recipient of UBI (or using services provided for free by UBS), you’re getting a part of your contribution back - and if you’re extremely wealthy, you won’t feel the difference anyway. \r\n\r\nAnother common argument, this time from people who support UBI/UBS, is, “Why should we give UBI/access to UBS to billionaires anyway?” It’s simple: a billionaire (or just someone wealthy) will simply return that favor through their taxes. But if they suddenly became destitute, they will still receive the income (that they have effectively prepaid). \r\n\r\nIn the case of UBS, they would simply have to give up luxuries, but they would be able to live a dignified life either way. A third argument is that people would simply use their income/extra cash not spent on UBS on drugs and alcohol - but studies have proven that economic security improves decision-making, and unfortunately, the idea that poor people misuse any extra funds is much more of a hurtful stereotype than it is rooted in reality.\r\n\r\nLet's discuss universal basic income here",

The first is the idea of offering a regular monetary stipend to everyone, so they can afford to survive, while the other proposes making services needed for survival free to everyone, so they don’t have to pay at all.\r\n\r\n Both of these approach the problem of global poverty in their own way: UBI solves it by offering people the money that would take them out of poverty, while UBS gives them access to services regardless of their income. The biggest difference, however, is that UBS takes away people’s freedom to choose what to do with their money that UBI offers them. \r\n\r\nWhile those who receive UBI could choose not to pay rent, instead using the money for more nefarious purposes, UBS doesn’t even give them that possibility - but it does let them earn money that they don’t have to pay rent with, so they can still misuse it. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a successful business owner does not need as much money as a stay-at-home parent, so giving them the same amount doesn’t make much sense, while both of them need access to transportation and housing. This means that working out the specifics of UBI to make it more fair could take more time than simply implementing UBS, even if the latter restrains people in a way. Both of them are ways towards solving global poverty. UBI offers more freedom (and is often considered a more intuitive solution), but UBS would be easier to implement on current frameworks.\r\n\r\nUBI and UBS can solve lots of problems",

        "transcript": "The agreement that the taxes we pay go toward bettering our own lives is almost universally accepted. In many countries, this includes the healthcare and education systems, both of which are provided by the government. The idea behind Universal Basic Services, or UBS, is that we can expand those to other services needed for a dignified life, such as housing, sustenance, transport, information (like access to the internet), and even legal aid. Once a society has their basic needs taken care of, they can contribute to their environment better, as they are free to pursue a better education, or to apply themselves in areas that traditionally don’t pay too well but are useful to the world. \r\n\r\nThe usual simple but low-paying jobs can easily be automated, which is already happening all around the world. An important, though hypothetical question that is often asked is, “How many people could have cured cancer, but were forced into hard labor jobs because they needed them to survive?” While the answer will remain unknown forever, it is obvious that simple survival is far from enough to optimize society. \r\n\r\nFree public housing means no more struggling to pay rent and utilities; access to good quality, nutritious food means people’s health is not an obstacle to reaching their potential; free public transport means more incentive to use that instead of private vehicles, which pollute the environment; free access to information means opportunities to better yourself; free legal aid means nobody can take advantage of you. All of these lead to a happier, healthier society full of people looking to give back to it.\r\n\r\nTell us what you think about this article",

Now, thanks to technology, you can simply talk to chat robots, or chatbots as they’re more commonly known, who will teach you new concepts and correct any mistakes you make. One of the biggest advantages of chatbots, compared to humans, is that they’re available 24/7. \r\n\r\nThey are usually designed to take your skill level into account and provide customized exercises tailored to your needs, and many will let you pick one of the offered options as a reply to the conversation. This prompts you to think about how each of the options fits in with the topic - but you can also type your own response in and see what happens. Additionally, the chatbots often have a pronunciation feature (how many of us who learned English primarily through reading never knew that “colonel” was pronounced “kernel?”), and offer the definition of any word you may not understand. \r\n\r\nFor many learners who are new to the language, chatbots offer a less stressful environment. After all, you don’t have to worry about sounding silly or making terrible mistakes, because artificial intelligence just doesn’t care. Once you’re feeling confident, you can always have a more organic conversation by finding another human willing to talk.",

Now, social network Facebook is joining the race with its new chatbot “Blender”. Trained using 1.5 billion examples of human exchanges from public domains, Blender has been taught to demonstrate empathy, knowledge and personality. But it’s also come with its own issues. Since it learned from social media like Reddit, it’s sometimes resorted to using offensive language or even just made up facts. This makes Blender a very interesting example of exactly how humans sound online: either caring, compassionate and kind, or offensive and mean-spirited. \r\n\r\nOne might argue that there is no real use for a mean chatbot, but the fact that it can so fully encapsulate the human experience is what sets it apart from a form of intelligence that can only emulate what we consider “nice” qualities. Blender’s source code is also available in open source on GitHub, so that anyone who wants to tweak it (or just take a look under the hood) can do so, bringing experts and amateurs alike from all over the world together to aid in the efforts of creating the best chatbot to date. \r\n\r\nSome of its limitations include the fact that it doesn’t remember the conversation after a while, and that it stops making sense after 14 turns on average. But that may just make it more human - how many of us remember everything we say to someone?",

Aside from a short statement telling you whether the information you have entered is true or false, you will also get two recently fact-checked pieces of information, along with the link to the organisation’s page that did the fact-checking. \r\n\r\nEven if you don’t know what you’d like to learn more about, the bot will offer you a list of common misconceptions and explanations behind them, as well as tips on how to fight misinformation.

While this myth is easily disprovable, it is an example of the fact that teachers are held in high esteem worldwide (which may not always be mirrored by their income). But, as with many other jobs, teachers in many areas are being replaced by artificial intelligence (AI), or robots. According to Chinese big data and AI company Squirrel AI Learning, machine teaching has consistently outperformed human teaching at four different teaching competitions held throughout China from October 2017 to December 2018. \r\n\r\nOne difference was that machines were versatile and adaptable to different student profiles, so students receive information more tailored towards their own level of understanding, while human teachers can have trouble adjusting to a wide range of different profiles. The Squirrel AI system was also able to detect the causes of mistakes made by individual students and address them, enhancing divergent thinking, which is not necessarily intuitive to human teachers. \r\n\r\nThe machine’s computing power also represents a strength not found in humans, which leads to a self-evolving teacher. While human teachers find that their energy and memory are both limited, machines have very little need for downtime other than regular maintenance. However, Squirrel AI Learning believes that AI can never fully replace human teachers -- but that humans who use AI in teaching will almost certainly replace those who do not.",

In order to be successful going forward, we will need to adjust what success looks like, with collaboration and cooperation remaining front and center. \r\n\r\nOrganizations and institutions can implement this by asking a few key questions. For example, who was heard, and how often? By asking this question, they can focus on developing to meet the needs of those they serve. \r\n\r\nAsking who was helped also addresses whether or not direct needs were served through listening, and opens up the possibility that news ways of helping can be discovered. \r\n\r\nAs individuals, we can also focus on a few key things to help us collaborate and cooperate with those around us. \r\nWe can start by practicing active listening. An active listener’s goal is to understand better, which demonstrates respect, builds trust and makes others feel valued. \r\n\r\nWe can also employ empathy. Becoming more empathetic involves shifting our mindset to put people first; seeing others as humans rather than a means to an end. When we see things from another’s perspective, we’re better able to understand our colleagues, partners and customers, which will enhance our ability to communicate with them.",

But now, some countries and states have agreed to let gyms open up, so long as they follow strict social distancing and hygiene protocols. \r\n\r\nPlenty of eager clientele will no doubt return through the doors as soon as they open, perhaps even relishing the idea of a less crowded workout area. However, given how infectious the coronavirus has been shown to be, it appears that it’ll be quite a while until spaces like gyms will have the full trust of the public again. \r\n\r\nEven if gyms follow protocol by keeping “safe” distances between customers, and keep equipment regularly sanitized, is it really possible to safeguard a space where people come together, sweat, breathe heavily and share equipment against infection? After all, data shows that it only takes one infected person to trigger a bigger cluster of infections. “It doesn’t make sense that indoor gyms are reopening,” says one former city health commissioner. “The risks from heavy breathing in a confined space are simply too great.”\r\n\r\nA physiologist at the Mayo Clinic takes a more balanced view, “There are smart ways to reopen, and there are ways to turn any gym into one big incubator (of infections).” The smart approach, it seems, would be to restrict the number of people allowed in a gym at one time, but one wonders how long such measures will be necessary for. It appears that ultimately, the popularity of gyms won’t fully return until the risk of the coronavirus is a thing of the past.",

        "transcript": "Not all immune systems are equal -- some are more effective than others. Most of us know at least one person who claims they never get sick, not even with a common cold or a seasonal flu. On the other hand, chances are you know someone who seems to catch a cold almost every month. The good news is that our immune system is within our control. Through taking the right simple steps, we can quickly boost the body’s ability to combat illness and disease. \r\n\r\nFirst up is diet. You don’t necessarily have to radically change what you eat, but a good way to start is by consuming more foods or supplements that contain prebiotics and probiotics. These populate our gut with more healthy bacteria, which we need to fight off “bad” bacteria. On top of this, Vitamin C-rich foods such as citrus fruit and antioxidant-rich foods like carrots and spinach will have a fast effect on your immune system’s performance. One lesser known immune “superfood” is garlic. When crushed or chopped, it produces a compound called Allicin, which has been shown to reduce inflammation in the body. \r\n\r\n\r\nReducing inflammation is a huge part of avoiding illness in general. Luckily, this is also within our control. Simple measures like quality sleep, regular hard exercise, and keeping our blood sugar regulated all massively reduce inflammation. Studies have shown that stress and anxiety are among the biggest contributors to inflammation, and in turn a weakened immune system. To that end, relieving stress in a healthy way will do wonders for your immune system, be it through meditation, yoga or simple breathing techniques.\r\n\r\nOne rather extreme immune boosting method has been growing in popularity of late - cold water therapy. It sounds counterintuitive, but swimming in cold water, or simply taking a 30-second blast of cold water while showering, actually provides a wide range of benefits, including immune response to illness like the cold! As well as quickly reducing inflammation, cold water exposure teaches our bodies to deal better with stress, and boosts our mood. Over time, it actually increases our body’s production of white blood cells, which fight off infections. \r\n\r\nWhile you may not be keen to hop in an icy shower every morning, you can still boost your immune system in a more gentle manner by making sure to rest well, eat well, and exercise regularly.",

        "transcript": "Many people do not believe that food and housing should be basic human rights, rather they should be something you have to work for. However, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), around 14% of the world’s food is lost from post-harvest up to (but not including) the retail level. A big part of this is limited shelf life, the need for food products to meet aesthetic standards in terms of colour, shape and size, and variability in demand. The FAO also estimates that around 10.7% of the world’s population is suffering from chronic malnourishment as of 2016. Matching up these percentages, the problem of world hunger seems to be easy to solve.\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein, about 2% of the world’s population is estimated to be homeless, while another 20% lacks adequate housing. Reasons for homelessness include “shortages of affordable housing, privatization of civic services, investment speculation in housing, and unplanned and rapid urbanization,” according to demographer Joseph Chamie. Yet the houses are there -- it’s just that many landlords will decide not to rent at all if nobody can pay their price.\r\n\r\nBoth of these examples serve to illustrate the concept of artificial scarcity: in a capitalist system, an enterprise is judged to be successful and efficient if it is profitable. For maximum profits, some may opt to restrict production rather than utilize their resources to the fullest. Artificial scarcity is said to be necessary to promote the development of goods, as higher prices can serve as an incentive for increased competition. Opponents, however, argue that it enables the owner to capitalise off ideas and products that are otherwise not property in the physical sense. But the biggest question is this: are we willing to leave a fellow human being to die because we choose profit instead? Unfortunately, it seems many of us are.",

        "transcript": "Gross domestic product, most commonly abbreviated as GDP, seems like one of the most important numbers in a conversation about a country’s standard of living. The most basic definition explains that GDP is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period. Mostly, we talk about GDP per capita, or per person, meaning the number just gets divided by the average population. This is GDP (nominal) per capita. GDP (at purchasing power parity, or PPP) per capita is considered a more accurate calculation, as it takes the cost of living in a certain country into account as well.\r\n\r\nComing back to the topic of our title, the most intuitive answer is that the higher the GDP is, the better an individual has it. In large part, this holds true: countries with higher GDP per capita have better life expectancy. However, GDP is not the only reason for this: Costa Rica’s universal healthcare system, considered some of the best in Latin America, means that their life expectancy is the same as in the United States at only 20% of the US’ GDP per capita. Additionally, happiness levels in both the US and UK remain largely unchanged since the 1970s, while GDP per capita has skyrocketed. \r\n\r\nMost of all, past a certain point, the correlation between well-being and GDP simply falls apart. A study shows that after this threshold, the social and environmental costs of GDP growth become significant enough to cancel out consumption-related gains. These statistics are often used by proponents of the degrowth movement to show that incessant production does not have to be the modus operandi for the world -- at least if we intend to keep it for much longer.",

        "transcript": "The concept of degrowth aims to reduce the radical production that thrives in Capitalism, bringing it down to the levels needed to sustain dignified human lives and nothing more. The current regime, which encourages growth at any price, serves to create unnecessary competition among people and a highly individualistic society that seems to forget the concept of empathy way too often -- all the while creating a strain on the planet and endangering, if not completely wiping out, lifeforms beyond our own. But it is also set up in a way that it only works if people are constantly producing more of everything -- otherwise a recession breaks out, leading to a general decline in economic activity, people losing jobs, and inflation. Even for the most developed economies, recessions are a stressful time at best, and downright destructive at worst.\r\n\r\nDegrowth, in that way, would logically lead to a recession, simply because production is dropping. However, proponents of the movement state that there can be no recession because a recession is a phenomenon belonging to the current system, while degrowth proposes abolishing capitalist principles completely. The transformation to this new system would mean a fairer redistribution of resources and shifting our focus from an obsession with economic growth towards the wellbeing of the population, social justice and ecological sustainability. \r\n\r\nIn other words, a recession is a shrinkage of the existing, growth-based economy, while degrowth aims to do away with it completely by not needing such extreme growth in the first place. After all, there is absolutely enough for everyone on the Earth -- but it’s locked away by a select few to artificially create a system in which you can only get the crumbs off their table.",

        "transcript": "Modern lifestyles often blur the lines between needs and wants, often convincing us that we need things that we actually just want and could very well do without. But this is not a completely new thing: James Maitland, the eighth Earl of Lauderdale, argued in his paradox -- that later came to be associated with his name -- that there was an inverse correlation between public wealth and private riches in a way that increasing private riches often meant diminishing public wealth. And therein lies the difference: public wealth, according to Maitland, is what people need. He goes a step further from bare necessities and states that public wealth “consist[s] of all that man desires, as useful or delightful to him.” The difference between that and private riches, then, is that they require something additional, making them “all that man desires as useful or delightful to him; which exists in a degree of scarcity.”\r\n\r\nThat way, “riches” simply represent something that you have, that not everyone else can get. While this makes sense for things like gold and art, the problem is in the need to have what others do not only want, but need, which leads to the privatization of public wealth and services. This can range from privatized healthcare to privatized potable water (Nestle is a particularly egregious example), and while it increases the measured riches of a nation or corporation or even individual, the general population suffers. In this way, the constant capitalist race of acquiring more while seeing other humans only as competition, devoid of empathy, leads to happy graphs and full pockets of the chosen few, but a widening chasm between owning excess and struggling to survive.",

They regulate weather by creating clouds that reflect the sun’s heat so that our planet doesn’t overheat, they generate lots of water, which is carried by air currents around the world, they help to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and they give us food, timber, and medicine. Rainforests are also home to half of the world’s species that live on land. Each of these animals, insects, and plants interacts with each other in important ways that help keep the rainforests running properly. However, with the rate at which humans are cutting down trees and clearing patches of land, rainforests are actually in danger.\r\n\r\n The interesting thing is we don’t actually need to cut down any more trees or clear any more land because we already have all the food and timber we could possibly need. Instead, we need to start thinking about how to use the land in a smart way. Pulp and paper companies are beginning to regenerate degraded land to plant fast-growing and super-efficient plantations. They are also restoring the rainforests around their plantations. Some palm oil companies use what they can from the degraded lands in Borneo instead of cutting down trees and clearing more land. Across the world, these methods of taking care of the rainforests are spreading. \r\n\r\nA benefit of planting efficient crops on existing cleared land has resulted in new rainforests that retain more water and prevent fires.

        "transcript": "The tropical rainforest in New Guinea houses some of the most exotic birds of paradise. It is home to the twelve-wired bird of paradise, a medium-sized black and yellow male bird with twelve blackish, wire-like filaments on its tail; the black sicklebill, a larger jet-black male bird with metallic blue highlights; and, possibly the most impressive bird of paradise around, the western parotia, a medium-sized black male bird with some tricks up its feathers. \r\n\r\nThough each male bird of paradise has its own unique way of attracting a mate, a male western parotia takes the cake. First, it begins by clearing its “stage”, or the jungle floor, by removing pieces of twigs and loose leaves that fall from the trees. When everything is tidy and in order, it waits for a prospect. When a female bird shows some interest, the western parotia opens his dance number with a bow before his eyes flash from blue to yellow. When that happens, he puffs up his feathers so that they form a circle around his body and he begins to dance. He sidesteps and twirls about, occasionally stopping to bob his head from side to side. \r\n\r\nAnd if this doesn’t impress the female quite yet, then the male western parotia has one last trick to use: his bright yellow throat, which he flashes at her periodically. The exposure of his beautiful throat typically sends the female into a frenzy, which then concludes the ritual dance. If there’s anything we can learn from this bird, it is that we should never underestimate the power of some good dance moves.",

Each gorilla family is led by a dominant male and it is his job to protect the family from any danger, whether that involves any rival males or poaching humans. In the last 20 years, poaching has become an increasingly big problem to gorillas, decreasing their total population to nearly half. As a result, mountain gorillas have become critically endangered. \r\n\r\nAnother animal that is threatened by poaching are elephants as their long, beautiful tusks are sought after. In the forest itself, gorillas and elephants must be constantly on the lookout; however, they can seek refuge at Mbeli Bai, a large swamp where many animals go to eat and drink water. Gorillas come to the Bai to feed on aquatic plants, which is rich in salt, while the elephants drink water or mine salts from the mud using their long trunks. \r\n\r\nMbeli Bai is considered a safe haven for gorillas and elephants as it is well protected from poaching; however, danger returns once they leave the clearing. To prevent these animals from becoming endangered or extinct, people are grouping together to form organizations that raise global awareness and help to protect and conserve these animals. As a consumer, it is also important to make sure you are not buying products that are made from wild animal parts. At the end of the day, each animal plays a vital role in the ecosystem it lives in. If one animal dies off, then many more species will suffer.",

        "transcript": "Ice is not just for penguins and polar bears to stand on; it is important to our planet. There are three types of ice. First, there is sea ice. Sea ice is simply frozen ocean water found in the Arctic and Antarctic that forms, grows, and melts in the ocean. Second, there is land ice. Land ice includes the ice caps and glaciers. Their main job is to prevent floods and keep sea levels constant. The last type of ice is known as permafrost, which is a thick subsurface layer of soil that remains permanently frozen all year round. \r\n\r\nPermafrost stores almost twice the amount of carbon that is currently in the atmosphere and it is already beginning to melt. Due to its bright surface, ice and snow reflect the sun’s rays back into space, which helps to keep the temperature in the Polar Regions relatively cool because little heat is being absorbed. However, as temperatures begin to gradually rise and melt the ice, there are less bright surfaces for the sun’s rays to reflect off of, which results in more heat absorption and melting ice. If permafrost continues to melt, the carbon stored within will be released resulting in further climate change. \r\n\r\nThe good news is that we can still save our planet’s ice from completely melting if we do our part to restore stability by limiting the amount of waste we produce and burn and by developing renewable energy technologies.",

But as terrifying as they may be, sharks are actually necessary to an aquatic biome. According to the Florida Museum of Natural History, a person has a greater chance of being struck by lightning than being attacked or killed by a shark. And yet, we are still afraid of sharks. Whether you like these big sharp-toothed fish or not, our oceans would look very different without them. \r\n\r\nA thriving reef is swarming with countless sharks and fish, and contrary to what one might think, sharks do not eat all the fish in sight; instead, they keep fish numbers under control. In a healthy reef, smaller fish graze on algae that grow on the coral. In turn, sharks protect these smaller fish by eating larger fish that prey on these smaller fish. Without sharks policing the reef, there would be too many predatory fish eating the smaller fish that feeds on algae. Without the smaller fish that grazes on the algae, the corals would be overtaken. \r\n\r\nThough sharks may be scary, they actually help to keep the reef in balance. Without them, the reefs would essentially die. Just as each fish and plant has their own role to play, we have ours as well by conserving the ocean wildlife and limiting pollution. If we can do our part to protect ocean communities, our oceans will thrive.",

As a result, content creators are taking full advantage of the social media outlet by creating and posting videos and then reaping the economic payouts that come with every click/view. Creators can generate passive income from two potential sources. \r\n\r\nThe first comes from automatic advertisements that can be attached to videos using Google’s AdSense. Essentially, creators earn money whenever viewers click on these ads. Another way to earn money for a video that gets uploaded to YouTube is through the video's content itself. While not all content in and of itself is monetizable, oftentimes videos will reference a product and/or service that the creator is offering for sale. For example, a fitness instructor who creates free workout videos might also offer nutritional and more extensive workout programs for sale on their website, which gets mentioned during the video or is attached in the video’s description. \r\n\r\nCreating video content is time consuming and hard work, and success is really dependent on being able to develop interesting and useful videos. Evenso, the opportunities to create YouTube content are endless as there are tons of niche markets that a creator can develop content for. Whether it be an area like music, food or language, creators can make videos for just about anything they are passionate about.",

And now with the advent of smartphones, everyone has the capability to take high-resolution photos without having to invest in expensive cameras and other photography equipment. Photographers should first start by creating photo portfolios and then uploading them to a photo platform like Shutterstock or iStockPhoto for the site’s clients to view and purchase. Also referred to as stock photos, all photos uploaded to these sites are marked with water markings, which is a logo placed on top of the photo to obscure the image before it’s been purchased. \r\n\r\nOnce a stock photo is purchased, the client is given an unmarked, original version of the photo. Single photos can be sold again and again to multiple clients, which means they represent an opportunity for the owners to make money indefinitely and passively. In other words, once a photo is offered for sale on one of these platforms, the owner of the photo will be paid each and every time it’s purchased. The platforms typically offer one of two payment options: a percentage or a flat fee of each photo sold.",

        "transcript": "For those willing to invest a lot of their freetime upfront, writing an ebook could be a great way to create passive income for yourself. The first step to writing an ebook is figuring out what to write about, which will depend on things like your skill set, expertise, experience and interests. Generally, writing is done in one of two areas: fiction (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, comedy, romance and mystery) and nonfiction (e.g., health, fitness, nutrition, cooking, technology and business). \r\n\r\nThe former usually demands more time and investment from the writer as it requires developing things like a plotline, characters and dialogue. The latter, on the other hand, is often easier to write given there is less of a demand for the writer’s creative hand. Assuming a writer chooses to write a nonfiction ebook, the simpler approach of the two, the next step is to pick a topic that is both interesting and likely to generate a high volume of sales. Next, it's important to recognize the importance of creating an attention-grabbing title and cover page, one that will entice more people to buy the ebook. It’s often recommended to outsource the creation of your cover page to an artist, since an attractive cover page can help increase your sales potential. \r\n\r\nBefore writing, it's also imperative to plan ahead by creating an outline for the material you are going to write about. While writing, keep in mind your authenticity as you want to provide your readers with new, valuable content that readers can apply to their own lives. After your ebook is complete, you will then have to decide how you want to sell the book, whether it be on your own website or through an ebook platform like Amazon.",

Closures of meat plants mean that the country’s farmers and meat producers are facing a logistical disaster. With restaurants, university dining halls and industrial food service providers all but closed, supply lines have been severely impacted and meatpacking facilities across the country have greatly reduced their capacity. In addition to that, at least 20 of the largest meat processing plants have been forced to shut down due to COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. Farmers now have nowhere to send their chickens, pigs and cows. \r\n\r\nFaced with overcrowding, farmers have two options: limiting the growth of their animal populations, or “depopulation,” in other words, killing their livestock. A conservative estimate states that 2 million animals have already died in these ways, and many more will follow suit in the coming weeks.\r\nThe pandemic presents us with the opportunity to ask ourselves some serious questions about the nature of animal agriculture. While many want to do everything possible to spare millions of animals from unnecessary suffering and death, we must beware of empty compassion. Is there a material difference between sending animals to an early death due to the coronavirus, and sending over 50 billion animals to the slaughterhouse under the status quo? We may find that it is animal agriculture that is wrong, not simply the logistical nightmare which caused this mass culling.",

Nearly 1 million insect species have been found and described, and no one knows how many are left to discover. Some scientists estimate around 2 million, others as much as 100 million.  \r\n\r\nInsects make up more than 80% of the Earth’s biodiversity. There’s no quick way to understand the scale of this diversity - just a steady stream of new spiders and beetles and ants being added to the record each day.  \r\nBut as quickly as scientists discover new species, thousands more are silently disappearing.\r\n\r\nScientists are working to establish the rate at which insect species are vanishing. A 2015 study found that animal species are going extinct “up to 100 times” faster than they would without human interference. And a recent report from Germany shows a 75% drop in insect populations since 1989.\r\nThere are several factors that contribute to the loss of insect species. Deforestation is one of the culprits, as many insects depend on a single plant species for their survival. Once a certain type of forest vanishes, as many as hundreds of thousands of species will vanish along with it. \r\nInsecticides are also to blame for insect declines across Europe, and climate change plays a role, too. \r\n\r\nIf insects continue to disappear at this rate, the consequences will be devastating. Within 50 years, all life on Earth would end. It’s high time that we give insects the respect they deserve and do everything we can to ensure their survival.",

        "transcript": "In Arctic Siberia, Russian scientists are working to turn back time by resurrecting an Ice Age environment complete with lab-grown woolly mammoths. Pleistocene Park is a radical geoengineering scheme whose goal is to combat climate change. It’s named for the geological epoch often known as the Ice Age, which ended 12,000 years ago. At that time, huge sections of the earth were covered in grasslands. When the Ice Age ended, many of the grasslands disappeared, along with most of the giant species who called them home. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of Pleistocene Park is to slow the thawing of the permafrost. Research suggests that grasslands reflect more sunlight than forests, which causes the Arctic to absorb less heat. In winter, the short grass enables the season’s freeze to extend deeper into the Earth’s crust, cooling the frozen soil. \r\n\r\nLarge herbivores are needed to test these landscape-cooling effects. While Pleistocene Park is currently home to bison, musk oxen and wild horses, hundreds of thousands of woolly mammoths are necessary to keep the trees back. \r\n\r\nMammoths are cold-adapted members of the elephant family. Geneticist George Church is working on editing the genomes of Asian elephants and switching in mammoth traits. In 2016, he had succeeded in editing 45 of the Asian elephant’s genes, and he hopes to deliver the first woolly mammoth to Pleistocene Park within a decade.\r\n\r\nWhile it might seem like the stuff of mythology, Pleistocene Park provides us with the chance to bring another era back to the Arctic and may even have a shot at saving the planet.",

However, this park closure is expected to be the longest on record. \r\n\r\n\r\n“It’s not like the animals aren’t usually here,” said one park employee. “It’s that they usually hang back at the edges, or move in the shadows.” Now, the bear population appears to have grown and the animals are boldly reclaiming their habitat. \r\nIf tourists were allowed to visit, they might feel as if they had been transported to another era.\r\nChar Miller, a historian at a local college, said that the park is now probably very similar to how it appeared to visitors in the 19th century.\r\nOne such visitor, upon visiting the park in 1871, recorded in her diary, “I felt Heaven itself could not be much lovelier.” \r\nAll this serves to remind us of nature’s enduring power.

Imagine it literally -- you’re looking through your eyes out at the world, but everything seems to have a kind of fog, mist, or cloud over it. It’s not a visual problem, rather it’s a mental one. It’s hard to concentrate, it can even be difficult to perceive reality, and for some, everything might seem very “far away”. \r\n\r\nI remember experiencing this feeling acutely for the first time. After some days, or perhaps weeks, observing the sensation and trying to describe it, I settled on the term “Brain Fog”. Much to my surprise, as soon as I Googled it, it transpired that millions of people have experienced just this feeling. Perhaps you’ve even felt it yourself!\r\n\r\nThe problem with Googling something health related though, is that it’s rarely got good news for you. You might quickly convince yourself that you have a serious disease, where Brain Fog has sometimes been a symptom! \r\n\r\nMuch more common causes of Brain Fog are anxiety or stress, a reaction to medication, or surprisingly often: an undiagnosed food intolerance!\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been suffering from this strange affliction, it’s worth trying to reduce your anxiety by exercising or meditating, or even seeing a mental health professional. On top of that, you might want to experiment with your diet to see if any food has an adverse effect on you. Or even better, visit your doctor to get a  quick test for dietary intolerances.  \r\n\r\nAnd finally -- try to relax about it if you can. Brain Fog is surprisingly common, and is more often than not both temporary, and treatable.",

It makes total sense that our brain is adaptable, and will change depending on what we expose it to, but some people might be surprised to learn just how quickly we can change our brain. \r\n\r\nThe things we do, or even do not do, on a daily basis have an effect on our brain. Just like our physical condition, the brain responds to stimulus, and must be trained to perform at peak condition. The good news is that it’s never too late to begin changing your brain for the better. \r\n\r\nAccording to a study carried out at Oxford University, practising a skill such as juggling i.e. one that requires concentration, motion and problem solving, literally increases our grey matter in just 3-4 weeks! A second habit to build is daily learning. Just like exercise builds and maintains our body, learning builds and maintains our brain. Make sure that you learn something new every day. It doesn’t necessarily have to be deep or complex, just make sure to keep your brain working. The third tip is physical exercise. Brain and body might seem separate at times, but they’re not. Exercising helps to rewire our brains. By increasing our heart rate, we pump more oxygen into the brain. It also releases hormones which help grow more brain cells, while it even improves our mood, our memory, and helps our sleep quality. \r\n\r\nWhich brings us to habit number 4: sleep. Few things can affect your brain more than poor sleep. Sleeping poorly literally shrinks your brain, according to numerous studies. Consistently poor sleep quality or length can affect speech, touch, motor skills, and even decision making and calculation in the long term.",

The company itself says that their platform allows people to guard their own privacy by finding out if, and when their image has been misused online. An example of this would be a fake dating profile. \r\nWhile this seems to be a good sentiment, the issue is that the technology could also be misused. The image you upload does not have to be your own. Theoretically, someone with sinister intentions could take a photo of a random person in public, and use facial recognition technology like this to find more images of and information about that same person.\r\n\r\nWhile the likes of Google’s reverse image search has been around for a number of years, it does not work in the same way as PimEyes.

        "transcript": "Most of us are familiar with the idea that practising things like meditation and mindfulness is a great way of improving our mental health. But there’s much more to it than simply relaxing, breathing and taking some time out to de-stress. Regular meditation allows us to build up a healthy balance between the things that help our brain perceive the world around us: Awareness, attention and emotion. \r\n\r\nAwareness is similar to a radar, in that it doesn’t focus specifically on any one thing. Rather it notices changes in the environment. That’s where attention comes in. Once something is picked up by our radar, we can pay attention to it. Finally, there’s the network of emotions, through which we respond to certain stimuli e.g. fear, pleasure etc. \r\n\r\nHowever, given that our brains have not changed a lot since humans were hunter-gatherers, they’re actually not built very well for the modern day. As a  result, our emotion networks have become oversensitive, whereas our attention has receded. \r\n\r\nThis is where meditation comes in. Focusing on something mundane and repetitive, like our breath, and bringing our focus back to the breath any time we notice our mind wandering, helps to increase our attention span. In short, regular practise of meditation helps us focus on things for longer. The second change meditation makes in the brain is that it regulates the relationship between awareness and emotion. The simple, calming breathing and attentive focus helps to “soften” the emotional signals over time. This means ultimately, that we can learn to notice and observe our emotional responses, rather than being driven by them.  To simplify this, it means that we can have a much better control over our emotional reactions. \r\n\r\nWho wouldn’t want that?",

        "transcript": "Many people are taught that if a lightbulb goes out in your house, you replace it -- you don’t go looking for a whole new house. The same should hold true for many other possessions, ranging from clothes to electronics. However, if everyone were to follow this, there would be no need to always buy the latest generation of a smartphone instead of fixing it, for example, and an economy that is only held up by constant, furious production could not survive that way. This gave birth to a practice called planned obsolescence, which means that a product’s useful life is artificially limited in order to force consumers to replace it sooner (also referred to as shortening the replacement cycle). \r\n\r\nAlthough the definition of “planned obsolescence” might lead someone to think of laptops or smartphones, the phrase is much older than that. Its roots can be traced back to the 1920s and the American automotive industry, when the saturation of the market led General Motors to change designs annually to convince car owners that they had to buy a new car every year. This marked the birth of the phrase, but the business practice had been in use long before that. \r\n\r\nThere are several different types of planned obsolescence, including designing a product to deteriorate quickly, deeming it unfashionable after a while, or having newer programs incompatible with the product. Some inkjet printer manufacturers use smart chips in their ink cartridges to prevent you from using them after a certain number of pages printed, in spite of the cartridge containing more than enough ink. Similarly, YouTube's Android application does not work with older versions of the OS although it theoretically could. All in all, planned obsolescence is a practice that serves to feed the juggernaut of production with no end in sight.",

        "transcript": "In an (almost) ideal world, we’d work eight hours a day (or less), spend quality time with our families, and pursue hobbies that fulfill us. However, many people holding office jobs will find themselves very often staying late -- whether to complete their workload, get ahead of it, or (increasingly often) to show commitment to their company. The latter might not make sense at first glance, but for many, the reality of the job market is that their position could be filled by someone willing to work more, and for a smaller salary. All of this creates an artificial scarcity of time -- artificial, because there is really no reason you shouldn’t have more free time than you already do.\r\n\r\nHowever, this phenomenon actually fits perfectly into the current economic model throughout the world. All of a sudden, you can’t pick your kid up from school on time, so you pay for an extended stay, or even a nanny, and the latter tends to cost more than the former. No time to cook dinner? Buy a ready-made meal, at a significant markup compared to the cost of both the ingredients and the time and effort needed to make it. Can’t get on top of the laundry and house cleaning? Hire a cleaning agency! After all, it is better to spend what little free time you have with your loved ones instead of furiously scrubbing the stove.\r\n\r\nBut the artificial scarcity of time creates even more nefarious demands. The stress from working overtime, lack of sleep and meaningful downtime all create a new market for antidepressants, sleep aids, marital counseling, gym memberships, and (maybe most of all) alcohol -- all of which have their place in people’s lives even under less pressing circumstances, but probably not in the same amount. Sure, you may be helping the economy by injecting your hard-earned money back into it, but that favor is certainly not returned.",

However, the ever-growing number of people boycotting Nestlé’s products would argue that the world's largest food and beverage company has more than earned this title with their deeds, which are deemed questionable at best, and downright evil at worst.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest scandals the company was involved in is certainly their aggressive marketing of breast milk substitutes in less developed countries in the 1970s, which included convincing mothers that their breast milk was not good enough for their babies and that their formula was healthier than breastfeeding. However, formula is expensive, and women, convinced they had to give their child the best possible start in life and that their own milk just would not do, were diluting the powder with more water than needed to save money. Add to that the fact that the water was very often contaminated, this resulted in up to a million annual infant deaths through malnutrition and diarrheal diseases.\r\n\r\nHowever, Nestlé has not only actively harmed infants. The company has been known to use child labor in cocoa production, encouraging modern-day slavery and child trafficking. The work is physically taxing, the workers in slave-like conditions are subject to regular beatings, and the average farmer in Ghana makes less than a dollar a day on cocoa plantations -- yet Nestlé uses children because they’re even cheaper. \r\n\r\nArguably the most important controversy surrounding the company is their hand in changing the status of access to drinking water from a “right” to a “need.” They also claim local springs for themselves, impose restrictions on residential water use, and bottle the water for profit, even during several droughts. \r\n\r\nWhile these instances are only the most famous scandals Nestlé has found themselves in, others -- like demanding Ethiopia repay their debt to them in the middle of a nation-wide famine, or forced labour in the Thai fishing industry, or their deforestation of Ghana and Ivory Coast -- all serve as examples of why people are actively refusing to buy their products. But are they truly the most evil company in the world? Maybe not -- but if that’s the case, exactly how evil is the actual most evil company?",

However, people are already losing jobs in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, but not everyone is hungry. In January 2020, the CEO of Boeing was fired for his terrible handling of the 737 Max crashes, which killed 346 people, and the aftermath. He received a USD 62 million payout on the very same day that the company announced they would let 2,800 workers go because the 737 Max would not be produced anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is only one recent example in a sea of similar ones throughout the years. What they prove is that there may not be enough workplaces, but there is certainly enough money. The current rapid growth serves to line the pockets of the wealthy and keep everyone else busy. This is also why there is no reason not to implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI), as it goes perfectly well with degrowth. People would be free to refuse jobs they don’t want, for example those in the fossil fuel industry, while still being able to lead dignified lives. Instead, they could choose the field they would prefer working in, thus still helping society.\r\n\r\nBoth the current health crisis and climate change mean that a complete overhaul of perspective is sorely needed. The relationship between work and survival should certainly be questioned, especially since it doesn’t hold true for everyone. Both UBI and degrowth stand for a very important cause: putting care for human life in the center of our policies and improving the quality of life for everyone, not just those deemed most useful by an unforgiving system.",

It spawned the so-called Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed back in 2016. Its long-term goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and, if possible, limit the increase to 1.5°C in an effort to mitigate the effects industrialization has had on our planet. \r\n\r\nThe green growth theory is one of several approaches to fulfilling the Paris Agreement. Its main idea is the decoupling of GDP growth from resource use and carbon emissions, which would lead to using natural resources in a more sustainable manner. The idea itself is a worthy cause, but critics warn that to meet the criteria set by the Paris Agreement, green growth is a half-baked measure at best. In reality, it is severely misguided.\r\n\r\nResearchers point out that as of right now, there is no empirical evidence that the necessary decoupling of resource use from growth can be achieved on a global scale, especially if the plan is keeping any growth at all. Additionally, even if it were possible, it is highly unlikely that such an approach could be implemented rapidly enough to meet the necessary criteria. \r\n\r\nPerhaps worst of all, once capitalists lose their access to natural resources, where else will they acquire the free input they need for radical growth? Unfortunately, previous experience points towards them finding new ways to squeeze workers and create an artificial scarcity of immaterial things in order to profit off them -- like knowledge, green spaces, even parenting or physical touch.

Lockdowns and social distancing campaigns have driven us indoors and away from other people, and naturally, the majority of people are feeling the strain. Never in our lifetime have we been so exposed to loneliness. Yet, some people are thriving in the extra time alone with their thoughts. For them, the presence of people does not correlate with a positive emotional state. To that end, the absence of people does not correlate with a negative emotional state either. \r\n\r\nAs it turns out, some people are just less prone to feelings of loneliness. A recent study shows that time spent with other people is not the only way to feel like we belong. Humans have adapted over centuries to be able to feel fulfilment from non-traditional social, or unsocial, activities like being creative, using social media, playing video games, reading, meditating, bonding with a pet, listening to music or watching films. This comes in part as a result of many of us no longer being members of close, tight-knit communities that facilitate social interaction. In short, many of our needs are now being met without the direct influence of other people. \r\n\r\nBut what works for one person may not work for another. While some of us are perfectly happy flicking through Instagram or spending our days amongst books, it’s important to find out what makes us feel fulfilled when we’re alone. Once we know what keeps us content, it could prove very useful should we go back into social isolation in the future.",

It’s also made up of energy, so in short, the universe essentially consists of stuff and movement! But something that puzzles us is the fact that about 80% of the matter in the universe is made up of things we can not observe, which we call “dark matter”. This mysterious ingredient of the universe does not produce any light or energy, and we can only infer that it exists by its gravitational effect on matter. \r\n\r\nBut why is it important? Scientists maintain that dark matter may be responsible for the unexplained motion and movement of stars, and the rotation of galaxies. In essence, without dark matter, there may well be no signs of life in our universe at all.  \r\n\r\nOne common misconception about dark matter is that it is the same as “dark energy”, but this is not accurate. While it’s true that most of the matter in our universe is made up of dark matter, this actually only accounts for about 25% of the universe’s total composition. Dark energy, on the other hand, makes up around 70% of the universe. But why does this matter? Well, dark energy may be responsible for accelerating the expansion of the universe. You see, whereas gravity pulls things together, dark energy drives them apart. Scientists once believed that the universe, which has been expanding outwards ever since the Big Bang, would eventually slow down and run out of energy after enough time. However, they’ve since discovered that it is expanding more quickly than ever before -- something which is totally counterintuitive to gravity. It’s precisely for this reason that experts believe that dark energy is the driving force of our universe’s growth.",

If so, there’s a strong chance you haven’t had much, or any, skin to skin contact with another person. Hugging is out the window, handshakes are taboo, and so is just about any other form of human physical contact. This has led to a rapid rise in what some people are calling “skin hunger”. \r\n\r\nSkin hunger simply describes our need for physical contact with other people - a hug from a friend, an arm around the shoulder. All these things are actually biological necessities according to neurologist Edmund Rolls. It’s not even as simple as a sexual need, but a need for profound contact with other humans. Humans are social animals and touch is effectively a part of our language -- we use it to communicate moods, offer comfort and emphasise meaning. Touch actually increases the brain’s production of oxytocin, the hormone that makes us feel good. \r\n\r\nBy this logic, while the current phenomenon of skin hunger might seem to be just a mental issue, it’s actually a physical one too. A lack of oxytocin can lead to an overabundance of cortisol, the stress hormone, which in turn can lead to a weakening of the immune system. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand though, the socially distant world we’re now living in has been long overdue for some people! After all, there are a huge number of people in the world who don’t feel comfortable with physical contact such as hugs, particularly from people they don’t know very well. While much of the world is crying out for skin to skin contact, one imagines there are plenty of others welcoming the drought.",

        "transcript": "According to evolutionary psychologists, humans don’t just have a physiological immune system, but an emotionally-driven, behavioural immune system too. The behavioural immune system makes us develop unconscious biases and habits to prevent us from encountering things that could potentially harm us.  Think about your own behaviour during the Covid-19 pandemic -- you might have found yourself steering clear of people not wearing masks, or even holding your breath when passing close by someone. You’ve maybe even done this without thinking about it! According to a great number of evolutionary psychologists, this kind of behaviour is our nervous system’s way of preventing the side effects of a physiological immune response such as a fever or a cough. After all, the best way to win a fight is to avoid it in the first place!\r\n\r\nOne simple way the behavioural immune system works is how we often feel disgust or substantial aversion to things that could make us ill. It could be rotting food, a rat, or a spider -- animals that have been known to spread disease at times. This “pathogenic disgust” can also make us feel aversion towards fellow humans who don’t follow normal societal hygiene practices. One fascinating study showed that people who simply saw someone sneezing had almost immediate increases in their white blood cell production -- the cells that fight off illness. \r\n\r\nBut the behavioural immune system’s work isn’t always good, it should be said. While it’s there to protect us, it does not operate on a higher-level thought process. This means that it can be quite unsophisticated, and lead to issues like social anxiety, or even problematic biases like xenophobia or unhealthy cultural stereotypes.",

        "transcript": "Most of us experience a certain amount of stress on a daily basis. But what actually happens to our bodies when we’re under stress? Experts say that the body can handle a single stressful day without any problems. While everyday stressors might make some people feel tired, it’s nothing the body can’t deal with.\r\n\r\nBut what happens when you’re under stress for a whole week? At this point your body is more susceptible to viral infections and sleep deprivation. Lack of sleep can lead to other difficulties, such as poor memory and a compromised immune system. \r\n\r\nIf you’re feeling high levels of stress for a month, both physical and psychological symptoms of burnout will occur. You may begin to feel irritable and start having anxious thoughts. You might even find yourself becoming cynical and detached. On a physical level, chronic stress can cause gut issues, hair loss and diarrhea or constipation. \r\n\r\nAfter six months of feeling constantly stressed out and dealing with these symptoms, you might reach the true point of burnout and become pessimistic and isolate yourself from others. Some people self-medicate with drugs and alcohol during these times. \r\n\r\nSo what can you do to relax and remain stress-free? It helps to pay attention to the stressors in your life and reduce the unnecessary ones. It’s also important to separate working hours from non-working hours. Useful habits include creating a ritual for winding down when returning home from work and ensuring that you get enough restful sleep. Lastly, don’t forget to breathe! Deep breathing has a host of benefits, from decreasing stress to increasing energy.",

At times this can leave us feeling as if our mind is one long, infinite to-do list. This sensation was so intense for product designer Ryder Carroll that he came up with a solution: keeping a journal. \r\n\r\nWriting in a paper journal is a clear way for us to visualize our goals and concerns, come up with strategies and understand how we’re spending our time and energy. \r\n\r\nInterested? Grab a notebook and pen and let’s get started. \r\nFirst, you need to create a mental inventory. Write down the things that you must do, then the things that you feel you should be doing, followed by the things that you would like to do. \r\n\r\nNext, think about why you’re doing each of these things. In order to be mindful of how you’re spending your time, it’s good to check in with yourself and make sure that you’re doing things that you really want to be doing. \r\n\r\nThird, go through your list and ask yourself two questions: “Is it vital?” and “Does it matter to me or someone I love?” If you answer “no” to both questions, cross that item off your list. This will help you to focus on your priorities. \r\n\r\nFourth, break down the remaining items into individual projects. Each project should consist of a clearly defined list of steps and tasks that should take less than a month to complete. \r\n\r\nFinally, spend at least five minutes a day revising your list. It’s important that it continues to reflect your values and priorities. When something doesn’t matter to you anymore, simply cross it out and let it go.",

While working from home initially sounds like the dream, those who have been working from home for years know that it isn’t always as stress-free as it sounds. Thankfully, efficiency is portable and developing a few key habits can ensure a smooth and productive workflow. \r\n\r\nFirst, it helps to have a designated workspace. If this isn’t possible, you can establish the same environment, such as a notebook or a photo, in each location every day. Having the same setup lets your brain know that it’s time to focus and work. \r\n\r\nIt’s also important to get rid of low-value activities that drain your time and get in the way of the meaningful aspects of your work. This includes things like emails, paperwork and meetings.\r\n\r\nTaking breaks is crucial. If timed breaks don’t fit into your workflow, you can take the more intuitive approach of paying attention to your internal cues and resting when it feels best for you.\r\n\r\nFinally, it’s a good idea to create a clocking-out ritual. This can be done by placing all of your work-related items inside a drawer and then closing it. This compartmentalizes the workday and keeps it separate from the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nLike anything else, working from home has its specific set of pros and cons. Doing it successfully means finding a balance between enjoying the autonomy and freedom it allows while accepting the social limitations.",

Most of them were abandoned in the 19th and early 20th centuries as people moved to bigger cities because of casualties or changes in the industry. Many have fallen into ruin, while some have become national parks. A rare few have been developed into luxury vacation spots.  \r\n\r\nDuring the gold and silver rushes of the 19th century, isolation was the price you paid for living the frontier dream. The Wild West is often romanticized in films and stories, although the reality is that it was often a brutal and demanding existence. During dark, cold winters it could be downright boring. \r\nBodie State Historic Park is California’s biggest and most famous ghost town. It is open to the public whenever the road is accessible and sees an average of 150,000 tourists a year. The 19th-century buildings are maintained just to the extent that they don’t deteriorate. For the rangers at the park, living in the middle of nowhere is just another day’s work. At an elevation of 2,550 meters and with the nearest grocery store two hours away, they live in isolation for most of the year. While many would find the isolation of these ghost towns daunting, others find it refreshing or even clarifying.\r\nAnd as quarantines lift but social distancing continues, isolated vacation spots like Bodie may strike many people as a safe option. Rather than spending time in dense urban areas, the thought of having space to spread out may come as a welcome relief.",

At the moment there are about 67 micronations in the world. It’s not difficult to found a micronation - the first step is simply to declare that it exists.

Kevin Baugh is still the president of Molossia, which he says is a military dictatorship. Molossia boasts its own customs office, currency, navy, postal service and rocket program. Molossia is open to tourists from April 15th - October 15th, although visitors are asked not to arrive unannounced. A sightseeing tour of Molossia includes the Friendship Gateway, which was built to symbolize inclusiveness and openness. \r\nWhile you’re there, you can also stop by the bank of Molossia, where you can exchange dollars for the national currency of Molossia, the valora. \r\nOne visitor to Molossia commented that it’s nice to see that the president of Molossia has such a good sense of humor about his micronation. “Obviously, he’s put lots of time and money into creating this micronation.

        "transcript": "What does it mean to be conscious? Consciousness is the awareness of any and every kind of experience that we can have. Without consciousness there’s nothing - no sense of self and no world. \r\nIt’s easy to think that objective reality is revealed to us when we open our eyes. The truth is that all perceptions are acts of interpretation, or informed guesswork. \r\nThe term “controlled hallucination” illustrates this point. It emphasizes that everything we perceive is a construction of the brain. One example of this is our perception of color. It has been proven that colors are not objective. Color is a sensation, just like touch. It doesn’t have a physical reality of its own. What we perceive as red in broad daylight might appear black at night.\r\nThe idea of controlled hallucination is that this concept applies to everything that we perceive, including our perceptions of ourselves, our bodies and our memories. These perceptions are not random - they’re constrained by the sensory data that we get, which is why we can mostly all agree that a table is a table. \r\nWe don’t passively perceive the world, instead we actively generate it. The world we experience comes as much from the inside out as from the outside in. This leads to some interesting questions, such as, how much control do we have over our consciousness? And are we able to shape it? Can we artificially recreate consciousness? The answers to these questions may provide even more fascinating insights into our reality.",

According to cyber security experts, organizations like commercial businesses are tracking and compiling data about you - things like your credit history, shopping habits and your internet browsing history. \r\nEven the act of deleting an image that you posted online is not simple. If you post an image and then later decide to delete it, the odds are that that image will have been downloaded and reposted somewhere else in the meantime. You would then have to contact different service providers in order to get it removed. \r\nWhat do you do when you want to find out personal information about someone? You Google them. Google actually tells you what kind of personal information can be removed. Information like your social security number, bank account numbers and medical records can be deleted upon request. However, your date of birth, previous address and telephone numbers are among the things that Google will not consent to take down. \r\nThere is no centralized service that allows you to remove all of your information with a single request. Information is power, and some people are concerned that we are giving too much of our power away. \r\nA good takeaway is to not put anything online that you don’t want to be there forever.",

One such resource is rare earth minerals, which are vital building blocks for many everyday devices like DVDs, smartphones and magnets to larger things like medical imaging machines and advanced defence weaponry. China currently controls 90% of production and has long dominated the rare earth mineral market when it comes to both mining and processing these critical minerals. \r\nHowever, this may soon change. In western Texas an ordinary mountain called Round Top has been found to contain five out of six light rare earth minerals, 10 out of 11 rare earth minerals and all five permanent magnet materials. It also contains large deposits of lithium, which is critical for batteries. Round Top is thought to offer a 130-year supply of critical minerals. This will reduce the US’ dependence on China. Commercial production for the mine is anticipated to begin in 2023. Developers expect to produce 2,000 tons of rare earth magnets per year, which would fill 17% of domestic demand. \r\nBeing able to produce these critical materials will allow the US to be more independent and create even more jobs.",

The same principle holds true when trying to get work done. \r\nOne method for pacing yourself when it comes to work is to maintain weekly and daily to-do lists. It’s simple. At the end of the week, write a list stating everything you want to accomplish next week. Then, at the end of the day, write a list containing the parts of the weekly list you want to finish tomorrow. \r\nThis simple procedure will help you to manage your energy. A weekly/daily system separates your work into manageable chunks. Rather than trying to do everything at once, you focus on completing your daily list. If you finish earlier than you expected, you can relax and enjoy your time guilt-free. \r\nIt also hinders procrastination. Many of us start procrastinating when we see a mountain of overwhelming work in front of us. Dividing your tasks into daily lists makes them bite-sized and manageable. \r\nYou may also choose to do a monthly review in which you select a few larger projects that you would like to finish that month. You can then keep these in mind when writing the weekly lists. \r\nLife doesn’t have to be complicated and neither does your to-do list.",

But are we human beings the only animals that have an idea of God? Even if we don’t believe in God ourselves, we’re familiar with the idea, but how about other life forms? Well, there’s no exclusive evidence that suggests that they believe in any God, however there is quite a large body of evidence that suggests that some animals perform rituals and may even have spiritual experiences. \r\nFor example, elephants are well known to mourn and grieve the death of other elephants, whereas chimpanzees have been documented dancing in ecstasy at the sight of waterfalls, and even creating rock piles in a somewhat ritualistic manner. \r\nSo it appears that some species of animals do have an awareness of life and death, and indeed the wonder of the world, but as for whether they believe in a creator or an afterlife, we can’t know for sure just yet.",

Well yes, but maybe not for much longer. We might be closer to bringing back extinct life forms than you’d think. In fact, it’s been done before! In 2003, scientists in Europe brought back the Pyrenean Ibex, a type of goat that had gone extinct a few years before. Alas, the newborn only lasted a few minutes before the species went extinct for a second time! Meanwhile, an Australian-based team is coming close to “de-extincting” a type of frog. But how do they do it? The approach changes, but some have used similar species to “back-breed” an extinct one, while some teams are using cloning, stem cells and even gene editing. A team at the Harvard Medical School are using gene editing to edit the genes of a mammoth into the cells of an elephant! \r\nIt should be said though, that on a genetic level, these resurrected animals won’t be exactly the same as their predecessors. \r\nAs for dinosaurs? Sadly (or thankfully) it’s impossible. To “de-extinct” a species, we need its DNA, and despite what Jurassic Park says, dino DNA disappeared a long time ago.",

        "transcript": "It’s a task that some people find perfectly easy, but for many, speaking in public in front of an audience is a nerve-racking experience. One of the oldest pieces of advice in the book is that you should try imagining your audience naked! So the logic goes, this makes them seem less threatening, and even more exposed than you. However, according to a number of public speaking veterans and experts, this isn’t particularly helpful as it takes away from your ability to actually engage with your audience. \r\nAccording to them, a great technique to develop is “cognitive reappraisal”. Cognitive reappraisal means re-interpreting the emotions you feel in a certain situation to make them more manageable. In the case of public speaking or performance, this would mean recognizing your nerves and re-evaluating them as a feeling of excitement rather than fear. For example, every time you feel that spike of nerves, just tell yourself that you're excited, and after a while, your mind will begin to recognize this feeling in a more positive way. \r\nHowever, while cognitive reappraisal will help you get up on stage more comfortably, the greatest approach to speaking well in public will always be preparation. If you’ve prepared accordingly, remember your lines, and have some back up plans for things not going exactly to plan, you can feel much more confident.",

        "transcript": "Unfortunately, pain is guaranteed in life, be it physical or emotional. You might fall over, break a bone or touch a boiling hot pan while cooking. We all know the feeling, but what exactly is pain? In easy terms, it’s a sophisticated warning and lesson learning system. Touch a hot pan for a second and it stings. That’s a warning. Hold it for minutes, and it’ll hurt for days, reminding you that perhaps you should use an oven glove next time. \r\nIn this way, short lived or “acute” pain is a good thing, even though it might not feel like it. It teaches us what to avoid. \r\nBut how does pain actually work in our body? Just under our skin, there is a network of pain nerve fibers that are activated, and send the alarm up to our brain, which is where we feel pain. Pain, after all, is in the mind -- we can build up a tolerance to it the more we feel it. Hence, professional combat sports people can withstand a good deal more pain than the average human!\r\nHowever, our pain receptor system can sometimes malfunction, and it’s this that can result in chronic or permanent pain. Believe it or not, one in five adults suffer from chronic pain, which lingers on long after our tissues have healed.",

        "transcript": "In the early 1800s in Kentucky, USA, Martin Fugate and Elizabeth Smith got married and settled down to raise a family. If you saw a family photograph, you’d be forgiven for thinking that there was something wrong with the camera, as four of their seven childrens’ faces were a cobalt blue colour. They weren’t wearing makeup, and they sure weren’t struggling to breathe the fresh mountain air where they lived -- their skin was just naturally blue. \r\nBy an incredible coincidence, both Fugate and Smith carried a rare regressive gene called methemoglobinemia (Met-H), which had lain dormant in their systems, but emerged in their children. Their skin colour aside, the Fugate family were as healthy as normal, and were accepted in their isolated, rural community in the Appalachian Mountains. \r\nBut the line of “The Blue People of Kentucky” didn’t end there. Due to their isolated location, where there were no roads or rail systems, some of the Fugate family began to intermarry and inbreed with cousins, and so the recessive gene emerged in their children in turn. \r\nCome the 1960s however,  well over 100 years after the first blue Fugates had been born, some began to rebel against their skin, as it had become a sign of the family’s in-breeding. Two of them went in search of a cure, and encountered a hematologist by the name of Madison Cawein. He ascertained that they had a hereditary blood disorder that resulted in too much methemoglobin (a blue version of hemoglobin, the protein that makes our blood red). Whereas most caucasian people are slightly pink in skin colour, those with excessive methemoglobin are slightly blue. And Dr. Cawein was able to help the Fugates too. Ironically he prescribed them pills of blue dye, which encouraged their bodies to turn the methemoglobin into red hemoglobin. Within minutes, their skin shade was “normal”. They did still carry the regressive gene however, and it’s cropped up a few times since. In 1975, a child called Benjamin Stacy was born with dark blue skin. His location? Kentucky. As it turns out, Benjamin was descended from the Blue Fugates. His skin lightened back to white by the age of seven though, and by all accounts, there are no visibly “Blue People of Kentucky”. However, it’s said that descendants of the Fugate family still sometimes show their blue hue when cold or angry!",

Another competing consumer electronics store will be opening in the Crayville area on November 12. In order to ensure that Topline Electronics does not lose business to this new store, District Management is advising you to run a special sale on our new line of curved UHD televisions. These televisions provide state-of-the-art features at moderate prices. By showing your customers that Topline Electronics offers the best deals in the area, you will be able to maintain customer loyalty. We will be shipping the new televisions to your store within the next week. We suggest you prepare a prominent display space in your store to feature them. You should also update your website to advertise the sale. Smooth communication between you and US is vital to effective operational practices. If you have any questions concerning the new televisions or the marketing campaign in general, please don’t hesitate to contact District Management. Sincerely, Josh Fleck District Manager, Topline Electronics",

Within just a couple of hours of opening the doors, most of the Bucci design items were sold out. Similar reports of chaos and empty shelves which once held items from the Bucci line were echoed in major cities around the world including New York, London, Tokyo, and Milan. - [2] - Although B&G has released limited edition collaborations with other famous designers, this is the first time that B&G shops have reported a complete depletion of items within hours of its release. The Bucci and B&G collaboration is the most successful to date and, already, talks are in progress over future collaborations for more clothing lines. - [3] - Meanwhile in Seoul, shoppers who were unable to purchase from the Bucci line were disappointed but excited to have the popular retailer open in Korea. - [4] –",

We are considering reducing the number of paid vacation days and instead increasing the number of paid sick days available to employees. Before we make any changes, we would like to gather the opinions of employees on this matter. Please e-mail Tony Nugent at tonynugent@zimnet.com. He will be collecting and analyzing your responses. Afterward, Management will produce a corresponding policy proposal by February 24. Once the proposal has been made, a meeting will be called to discuss its implementation among all of our employees. I hope this process can be helpful to all of our employees, and please be active in your participation. Sincerely,",

The whole premise of the idea came up after Rachel and Robert Burnelle had their first child. Both working parents had constantly turned to fastfood for their meals and realized that many of their friends did as well. They wanted healthier options which most fast-food fanchises don’t provide. - [2] - The business is so popular that they have been getting orders from outside the city. “The response has been overwhelming,\" says Rachel. “Our customers especially appreciate the freshness and quality of our meals.” Janet, a customer from the start added, “Not only is the food healthy, it’s not that much more expensive than fast-food meals, but it’s much better for you.” - [3] - The Burnelles say they are planning to expand their delivery routes and open three Farm-to-Table grocery shops with ready-made meals around the city of Grandview within the next year. - [4] –",

Both cafes opened last month to fanfare and a great deal of press coverage. - [2] - \"Business has been booming,” says Kevin Blake. “We knew we'd be successful; we just didn’t think we'd be this successful.” Not only are customers enthusiastically flocking to both cafes to hang out with the animals while drinking coffee and tea, many of them are adopting the animals and giving them forever homes. - [3] - “We thought it would be a good idea to take in some of the animals because of the overcrowding in many of the shelters,” explained Ginger Blake. \"And customers have a chance to interact with the animals, which is the best form of advertisement for the shelters.” Since the cafes’ opening, more than 10 dogs and 15 cats have been adopted. “I don’t yet own a dog, but I’ve always wanted one,” says Laurie Jordan, a regular customer. “I come here to play with them. Maybe one day I'll find a dog that I really want.” - [4] - Because of the success, the Blakes are considering expanding by purchasing the adjacent shops. “We need more space to fit all our customers and the animals,” explained Kevin. “It can get very crowded at times.” The Blakes are looking to renovate the dog café next month and the cat café during the fall",

Lucy Mitt  (9:41) We're still waiting for the lace silks from Hand-Made Lace but we received most of the other fabrics yesterday. Our seamstresses will get to work on those today.  Bill Flake  (9:42) Then do you think the project will be completed by this Friday as the Manillo's wanted?  Lucy Mitt  (9:43) I'm not sure. It'll depend on when the lace arrives. Our group can start sewing some of the pieces together, but we need the lace to complete the intricate designs.  Bill Flake  (9:44) Can you contact Hand-Made Lace and find out when the shipment arrives?  Lucy Mitt  (9:45) Actually, Richard is taking care of that. Any word from them, Richard?  Richard Choi  (9:45) Yes, I just got off the phone with them. There was a bit of a delay because the lace artisans used the wrong silks. They had to re-work the lace. We'll receive them this afternoon. They sent a rush delivery to US.  Bill Flake  (9:46) Excellent. Then can the drapes be finished at the end of this week?  Lucy Mitt (9:47) No problem. We'll work around the clock to get them finished on time.  Bill Flake  (9:48) I'm glad to hear that. They are long-time customers and they needed the drapes for their new condo this weekend.",

Over the years it has remained a local favorite hangout for the residents of the city and soon captured the eyes of tourists driving through. - [2] - Bill Jr. took over the business and expanded the shop to keep up with the demand of locals and tourists. Northshore Creamery was even selected as a top-ten shop to visit by Travel 8c Tour Magazine. In 1988, Northshore Creamery was featured in the hit Hollywood movie Future Then and Now, which made it the top ice cream shop to visit by out-of-towners and tourists. - [3] - Efforts were made by various corporations to buy the business from the Bradley family, but Bill Jr. and his son William insisted on keeping the business within the family, which pleased the residents of Northshore. - [4] - “We’re keeping things small in scale and we’re slowly expanding,” explained William. “In order to keep the quality of our ice cream fresh and just the way my grandfather created his recipes, we don't want to take any short cuts, which is why we need time.”",

Collections will be made twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays from the regional recycling center, which will be supplying colored receptacles for different kinds of waste. All oils should be placed in the green container. All metals and glass belong in the red one. All paper waste should go into the blue one. Plastics will be collected for recycling as normal. As this new policy also carries a financial benefit to the company, managers in all manufacturing bays are responsible for ensuring that the new protocols for waste disposal are followed, and failure to comply with the policy could result in disciplinary action. Further information about our updated environmental practices will shortly be available on the website. Training sessions for managers will be held on Monday, October 22, but please contact me if you have any further questions in the meantime. Regards, Davis JeelandOperations Director, Unsworthy Manufacturing",

The farmers’ market will be available between 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. The mayor of Normanville, Tom Daley, will be present to deliver an address at the opening ceremony. A lot of local farmers, food vendors, and street performers will be at the venue. “This vibrant market will give our local farmers a nice place to sell their fresh produce. Additionally, because we cut out some middle processes, our prices are lower than those of average grocery stores,” said Suzy Hammer, executive director of the Normanville Farmers’ Association. Ms. Hammer also mentioned that currently there is not enough parking space to accommodate shoppers. The Normanville Farmers’ Association plans on expanding parking space in the coming months after the market has opened this Saturday. In the meantime, she advises Normanville residents who will visit the market to use public transportation in order to avoid parking difficulties. The Normanville Farmers’ Market is different from other grocery stores that supply mass-produced food products. The market will provide organic produce that is full of essential vitamins and minerals. As you know, the market will also help the local economy. Please come this Saturday and see what the Normanville Farmers’ Market has to offer!  Sincerely, Normanville Farmer’s Association",

As you know, this meeting is a great opportunity for US to assess our operating plan and to make any adjustments that might help US keep up with constant changes in the marketplace. As an advertising agency, it’s crucial we stay informed about the newest market trends. Therefore, I was excited when I heard that Tsuyoshi Ito, manager of our Japanese branch, would be visiting this Friday. In order to take advantage of his expertise and knowledge, I would like to change the meeting date so that Mr. Ito can attend. This will be Mr. Ito’s first time in the country, so I would like you to pick him up from the airport. A company car will be provided to you for this purpose. I will e-mail again once I have more details concerning Mr. Ito’s arrival time. Sincerely, Sam MillerPresidentMiller Advertising",

Therefore, I am urging all of our employees to take part in the upcoming community park cleanup sponsored by the city of Harrisburg. Without the dedication of volunteers, our parks and public spaces would not be free of litter. Donate some of your free time to keeping Harrisburg a beautiful and inviting city.  The community park cleanup will be held next Friday, February 18, from 1:00 to 5:00 P.M. Employees who wish to participate will leave work at lunchtime, yet will still be paid as if they had worked a full day. Volunteers are asked to bring supplies such as protective outerwear, tools, insect repellent, trash bags, and snacks.  A shuttle bus will depart from the company parking lot at 1:20 P.M. on Friday to take volunteers to the volunteer location. If you have a specific preference concerning the type of work you would like to do, please contact Event Organizer Don Lewis at 435- 555-6768.  We appreciate everyone’s enthusiasm and support.

You will continue to be covered by the same insurance company, but because of the new state regulations that have been put forth, all employees must now undergo a basic medical check-up at a local clinic or hospital. This check-up will be covered by your health insurance, so you do not need to pay any extra fees and this by no means will affect the monthly insurance deductions. -[2] - Included in the envelope is  the detailed information about the new medical program for employees. The medical check-ups will include a blood test, urine test, eye test, height and weight measurements, hearing test, and chest X-rays. - [3] - Please make an appointment with a local clinic. You should have your results given to Karen Leigh at Human Resources by December 30th at the latest. If you fail to get a medical exam, then you may be subject to a fine up to $2000. - [4] - We thank you for your cooperation and hope you abide by the new changes. If you have any further questions or concerns, please contact Karen at leighk@jpindustries.com. Sincerely, John BlackExecutive ManagerJ&P Industries",

The Nightingales of Fall is the eagerly awaited sequel to his best¬selling debut novel, The Swallows of spring. The book follows the journey of Sally Harknett through the weird world of Underfell, mixing social commentary with sharp wit and just a dash of magic and mystery. Tepper burst onto the scene over a decade ago with the acclaimed poetry collection, King Harmon’s Castle, and the expectation for this latest novel is another chart-topping success. Later this week, the first editions will be made available in a prize drawing at the New York Book Fair, with the official launch at major bookstores next month.",

While most buses stop running by 1:00 A.M., some parts of downtown will see buses running all night. The Bingham shopping district will also see buses running until 3:00 A.M. “This is when we have the most tourists and out-of-town folks coming to visit,” explained Mayor Bill Nate. “We felt it was important to provide the necessary services during this time.” - [3] - When the bus drivers’ union leader, Nathan Reiner, was asked about the new schedules he responded, \"We worked out a payment that is agreeable on both sides and have enough drivers that can work in shifts so that there is no danger of overworking or exhaustion. Many of US will still get some time off during the holidays with our families.” - [4] –",

In its heyday, Marion Hall was a popular downtown destination for residents to dance, enjoy live music, and watch movies. However, it has lost its popularity gradually since the multiplex building was completed on Henson Street 4 years ago. After all of the necessary repairs are made on Marion Hall, city officials will strive to invite various performers including famous theater companies, musicians, comedians, and speakers to the newly renovated theater. “We hope Marion Hall can serve as a new center for culture here in Marion,” said Marion City Mayor Greg Fields. The revitalization of Marion Hall is part of a larger project to enhance the public facilities in Marion. On April 29, the Marion Children’s Park, which features a baseball field as well as several playgrounds, is scheduled to have its grand reopening.",

After yesterday's meeting, it's clear that they are being sued for the accident that happened last week. - [1] - We all agreed that the whole company shouldn't be liable for the mistakes of a few careless workers. But, that was a conversation we had before we had really thought about the ramifications of our decision. - [2] - Unfortunately, the situation is escalating and there is about to be a lot of bad press. - [3] - It's true that many of them are our friends. But, we must protect our company. We can't handle anything that could alter our sales. For the last four months, we've been operating with a very thin margin for error. If our sales drop even the slightest, it could be detrimental. So, I'm suggesting that, as a means of protecting ourselves from any negative backlash, we cut our ties with cc Wheel Delivery. Maybe later, if they're able to rehabilitate their name, we'll work with them again. - [4] - I propose we vote one more time on whether or not to work with them.",

Your generosity, along with that of other donors, has enabled us to complete construction on the African Savannah enclosure. When it opens in July, the enclosure will provide our antelope, giraffe, and zebra populations an environment that is more similar to their natural habitat than zoo enclosures typically are. Moreover, it will give visitors a better vantage from which to view these beautiful creatures. We are pleased to inform you that your name will be listed with the names of other donors on a commemorative plaque at the entrance to the African Savannah enclosure. As a further token of our appreciation, please accept a full season pass, which will allow you and one guest to enter at no charge. It will arrive this week in a separate letter. Thank you again for your support. We look forward to your next visit to the zoo. Yours sincerely, Joseph Ihimaera  Associate Director  Friends of the Waitakere Zoo",

        "transcript": "Hochstein to Be Headed by Barrault Bondy Executive   February 10 — Recent movement of executives among the fashion industry's leading companies appears not to be ending anytime soon, Hochstein Shoes, Inc., Swiss-based retailer and manufacturer of men's shoes, announced today that its chief executive officer, Gerard Hullot, will retire, and that Angelica Ferrara, current executive vice-president of Barrault Bondy, will take his place.  Experts say the succession represents a major upset within the industry, since Barrault Bondy, the Paris-based manufacturer, is one of Hochstein's leading competitors in the high-end shoe market. Hullot's departure comes as little surprise, however. He had publicly indicated his desire to retire in order to write a memoir of his long career in fashion, over thirty years of which were spent at Hochstein. Nevertheless, most experts had expected him to stay on until after November, when the company's winter collection is released. Ferrara's move has generated much speculation about who will take her place at Barrault Bondy. Sources there indicate that current design director Marcel Hugo will be named the new executive vice president in a press release later this week.",

I know of no other non-profit organization that performs such a vital service for all-natural agriculture as yours does, and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of the Crocket Center working with Integral Harvest. As you know, the Crockett Center has recently turned its attention to urban gardening. On this front, the main priorities are to expand existing community gardens in Austin and to found new ones in neighborhoods currently lacking them. Therefore, I would like to proceed with the gardening classes we discussed in our meeting, to be taught on-site by Integral Harvest representatives and attended by Austin community residents. If you will let me know your representatives' availability for teaching the classes and also the range of topics they will cover, I can prepare a class schedule and generate interest in it among residents. My assistant, Cindy Reed, will call you shortly for this information. As for your proposal that Integral Harvest representatives demonstrate organic gardening to elementary school students here in Austin, since our meeting I have spoken with several school administrators. It seems that a number of the schools have gardening clubs, so students and teachers alike should make a receptive audience. Let us discuss this proposal further in our next meeting, which Ms. Reed will schedule. I am sure that, if our two organizations work together, we can do much to promote urban gardening as a rewarding and healthful endeavor. Yours sincerely, Letitia Price, Executive DirectorCrockett Center for Community Development",

We’re working on restructuring the company and offering consumers what they want. We’ll come back bigger than ever.” - [3] - An internal review of the losses will continue to be conducted as nervous shareholders consider their next moves. - [4] - Nemway is hoping that a good portion of the Re-Fit stores will remain in operation as the company struggles to reinvent the brand.",

However, passengers are still allowed to have one carry-on bag free of charge. We would also like to emphasize that this has been the first increase in baggage fees for Lichtenberg Air in ten years. As always, our goal is to provide safe and reliable transportation at a reasonable price. As the price of fuel lowers, we expect to eliminate the fee increase. We thank you for choosing Lichtenberg Air.",

He explained that the seats, screens, and sound systems will be replaced in all of the theaters. -[1]-  “However,” Mr Malla added, “we’ll be keeping one of the Cloud Theater’s old projectors so we can continue to show classic films in their original format” Up to now, the Cloud Theater has played mainly art house, independent, and foreign films. -[2]-. The former owner, Mr. Eugene Saltier, who has now retired, always sought to make the Cloud Theater a haven for artistic films. He was successful for many years, but ticket sales have declined in recent years anti he decided it was time lo sell. -[3]- “This was a hard decision to make，” said Mr. Saltier. “I will miss working at the theater. I am happy the LCS is going to bring new life to the old theater:’ Under its new ownership, the theater will continue to show those artistic types of movies on special occasions. It will also show more mainstream movies that will appeal to families and children. The society plans to reopen the theater to the public on July I. In addition, it will continue to serve as host for the classic film festival that begins the first weekend in August and continues for ten days. Everything about the festival will remain the same except for one thing. Formerly called the Gordon Street Film Festival, it will now be known as the Lakehurst Cinema Society Film Festival, -[4]-",

        "transcript": "A Long-Lasting Love for Books February 29 - Both in and around Pine Hill, Alfred Carlson，who has been teaching Russian literature at Pine Hill State University for twenty years, is probably best known as the owner of The Treasure Box, the town's oldest bookstore. The store has two unique features: it specializes in rare books and is open for business on Saturdays only. Evidently, walk-in sales make up only a small percentage of Mr. Carlson’s business; the bulk of the store’s revenue is generated by orders placed over the telephone or online by universities, museums, and private collectors. On Sunday The Treasure Box will be celebrating its sixtieth anniversary. “When my mother, Willisa, opened the bookstore all those years ago on Green Edge Road, two blocks from here, she probably had no idea it would still be serving the public six decades later,” Mr. Carlson said. The store still  displays the original sign over the doorway. The interior  retains the living-room atmosphere it always had, with its mismatched tables and chairs. One section of the store is filled with books about baseball, an abiding passion of the Carlson family. On Friday nights the store becomes an informal social club. Not surprisingly, members tend to enjoy conversation about rare books, literature, and baseball. Later this month Mr. Carlson will mark another milestone: he will be retiring from his teaching position. His retirement does not mean, however, that The Treasure Box will see extended business hours; it will continue to be open once a week. “I am not retiring from one job just so that I can spend more time on another,” Mr. Carlson said. “Rather, the fact that I no longer will have to prepare for classes or grade students’ papers means that I will be able to dedicate more time to my children and grandchildren.”",

By Selma Gonzalez On Monday, Chien Motors, the manufacturer now producing Long motorcycles, announced a delay in the the introduction of the new Flash JX model.  Industry competitors responded with surprise at the news. -[l]-. And Long Ride motorcycle fans went online en masse to express frustration with Chien Motors for canceling March s much-anticipated roll- out. It seems the decision to equip the Flash JX with a hybrid system, which uses both gasoline and electric power, is to blame. Chien Motors admits that the prototype was rejected because of its excessive size and weight. This design of the power system would have required a larger motorcycle body than planned. They also had concerns over its lack of power output.-[2]- . In addition to the design challenges, the Long Ride factory, having been equipped to produce previous models, is not ready for production of the Flash JX hybrid -[3]- . New equipment will need to be purchased, and the assembly floor will need to be reconfigured. Last year, Chien Motors was widely praised by motorcycle enthusiasts after it stepped in to save Long Ride from going out of business. What a difference twelve months has made .-[4]-  .",

Mr. Pelligrine had planned to move into the property this weekend. May 7- 8, and he wants to make sure the rental paperwork is in place before he finalizes the moving arrangements. He said that he has been offered another property, also on Grove Street, and will proceed to rent that property if he cannot finalize his agreement with us by the end of office hours today.

The decrease has surprised many，especially given the remarkably hot weather this summer. Local vendors pointed to an increase in the  wholesale price of milk, which has caused their own prices to rise significantly. To oil set the decrease in sales, many ice cream stores are stocking alternative desserts that do not contain dairy. For example, Giordano’s Dessert Shoppe in Wellington has begun selling fruit ices. According to analysts, because ice cream is a specialized market, traditional strategies such as increased advertising and customer discounts are not as effective as they are in other industries.",

Recently, he has lent  his considerable composing skills to Final Chance, a video game produced by Silhouette Gaming Systems (SGS), which has been creating interactive entertainment for 10 years now. Mr. Alcheri was introduced to the managing director of SGS，Harry Jansson, at a social event hosted by Ms. Chandra Bixby who, on occasion, has collaborated with Mr. Alcheri in composing film scores. Mr. Jansson proceeded to invite Mr. Alcheri to write the music for Final Chance. In a phone interview, Mr. Alcheri said that he was “quite impressed” with the graphics and animation of Final Chance. “It left me with the sense that I was watching a movie, and so I did not hesitate to collaborate on the project, said the renowned composer. He further remarked that writing the score for the video game was virtually identical to composing the music for a movie. “All I had to do was write music that matches the atmosphere of the various scenes depicted in the game: he added. As for Mr. Jansson, he said in the same interview that with pre-orders for Final Chance standing currently at 200,000 copies, he has no doubt that the latest SGS product, scheduled to be released on March 20, will be a success.",

Paso Tech, one of the leading producers of elements used in high-definition computer monitors and projectors, completed construction on one of three new factories to be built over the next four years. —[1]—. The first of the factories, built in Australia's Lonsdale, is the company’s most sizable factory and will eventually be responsible for 55% of the company’s output each year. The new factory has brought with it an increase in jobs for local residents. —[2] —. More than 1,000 construction workers were hired to help build the massive factory and its surrounding structures. Paso Tech's President Goro Hashimoto stated, “This was a major endeavor for our company. When we started this construction project, we realized that it was going to take a lot of money, resources, and staff. – [3] -. Not only did we hire locals to expand the physical plant, but we also added many workers to our full-time payroll. We hope to be able to do the same in Japan. We plan to begin building in Tokyo very soon. The company’s headquarters are currently located in Osaka, Japan. Additional factories will be constructed in some of Paso Tech’s other locations, including in Brazil and South Africa. While the remaining factories will not be as large as the Lonsdale location, they will still require additional resources and labor. —[4] —•",

Beginning in November, she will be general manager of City Wheels, a bike-sharing company in Auckland. — [2]—. The move comes at an opportune moment for both Ms. Haas and City Wheels. Ms. Haas had worked for Gear Good in Wellington since the company was founded five years ago but was yearning to return to Auckland, where she grew up. City Wheels was looking for a new leader to oversee its planned expansion from 50 to 75 bike stations in Auckland. —[3] —. “I’m thrilled to join a company that’s important to residents and tourists alike,” Ms. Haas said. The City Wheels system is simple and affordable for occasional use. —[4] —. The first thirty minutes of biking are free, and after that, the cost is $4 per hour or $20 per day.

        "transcript": "Airport Expansion Continues26 May – A major airport expansion project is under way in Onalia City. The project is estimated to cost $1,6 billion, and a new terminal is scheduled to open for international service in approximately one year. The airport, however, sits on a confined piece of land, which presents significant challenges to increasing the number of takeoffs and landings. If the airport remains limited to its current two runways, the capacity to handle air traffic could be reached within three years. To address the problem, officials overseeing the Onalia City Airport project have contracted a group of engineers from Wilford Engineering to explore the possibility of extending a third runway over the Pacific Ocean. The engineering firm will survey the area for six months before presenting their findings and recommending a plan of action. Runways that extend over water are not unprecedented. This type of runway exists in places such as Gibraltar and Japan, which have faced similar challenges.",

One area where we can realize savings is in printing and copying documents. Many of us have been making color copies of basic documents, such as meeting minutes, product documentation drafts, and budget sheets. -[l]-, While multicolor documents are more attractive and attention-grabbing than black-and-white ones, color ink cartridges are very expensive. Purchasing frequent replacements ultimately leaves us with less money to spend on things like business travel and social events. -[2]- Rather than instituting a system wherein all jobs must first be approved by the department supervisors, I would prefer that employees make their own decisions about printing and copying.  -[3]-. Please reserve the use of color for only those cases where visual appeal is a relevant factor. -[4]-. Thank you for your attention to this matter.",

The Expo will take place at the Sao Paulo Event Center from June 3 to June 5. More than 2,000 small-business entrepreneurs will attend workshops and showcase their businesses at booths, where visitors can collect information and ask questions. According to an SPSBE press release, Mr. Azevedo will highlight many of the ideas from his best-selling book Keys to Startup Success, published just last year. Mr. Azevedo believes that there are several  key decisions that must be made before launching into any new business scheme. “You can’t go into it with the idea of creating a product you want to sell”，Mr. Azevedo writes in his book. “You have to create a product people want to buy. This is rule number one. And it is absolutely essential to get this right if you want your business to succeed.’’ Mr. Azevedo is the owner of several successful businesses in Los Angeles, where he has lived for the past ten years. “I’m originally from Sao Paulo,” Mr. Azevedo said. “So I wanted to help the community where I got my start in any way I could, which is why I accepted the invitation to participate in the Expo. There’s an outstanding opportunity there for small- business owners. Following these simple but important guidelines has worked well for me and for many other successful small- business owners,” < Tickets to the Expo are RSI00. They can be purchased through the Expo’s Web site at www.saopauloexpo.com/br.",

Wayne Preston [9:44 A.M.]This happened to me last time. Try pushing the gray reset button.  Anna Mertz [9:44 A.M.] Wasn’t everything supposed to be set up by 9:30 this morning? I hope we'll be able to get everything ready before the new hires start arriving. Leon Barkov [9:48 A.M.] Carol Heinz was supposed to do it, but there was another meeting in the room and it ran late. She couldn't wait, so she asked me to set up once the room was free. Leon Barkov [9:49 A.M.] No, that doesn't work. Wayne, can you come down here? Wayne Preston [9:50 A.M.] On my way. Anna Mertz [9:51 A.M.] Are you all set otherwise? Leon Barkov [9:52 A.M.] Yes. The slides are ready to go. I ran them by a few colleagues to make sure everything is clear. I’ve made hard copies of the presentation and all the forms that the new hires will need to fill out. Anna Mertz [9:51 A.M.] Good. I’ll be there at noon to take everyone to lunch and then to the security office to pick up their badges. I’ll collect the forms then too, so please make sure they’re completed before then. I’ll bring the group back at 1:30 for the rest of the orientation session. Leon Barkov [9:52 A.M.] Thanks. The projector’s working fine now. Wayne attached a different power cord.",

The speed of social media, as well as its relative inexpensiveness, make it an attractive option for small companies that can't rely on television or magazine advertising to reach new customers. And most sites can be managed without the help of a technology expert. For reaching larger, more general audiences, — [1]— .\r\n     But even though social media offers many opportunities, you should not try to promote your business on as many outlets as possible. Managing information on several networks can quickly become a full-time job and can make it harder, not easier, to control your message. — [2]—. Therefore, it is important that you learn the benefits and limitations of each social media platform, and then decide which one or two are best suited to your target customers. — [3]— .\r\n       Different platforms focus on different kinds of content, like photos, videos, short messages, or blogs. Some platforms need to be updated frequently, with customers expecting you to post new material every day. — [4]—. Certain platforms are better for reaching larger, more general audiences, while some allow you to focus on a specific group of customers. So before you set up accounts on every available platform, think about your business needs and your customer base.",

The new chain will be managed from Metro-Edibles' Hong Kong headquarters, and the multinational corporation hopes to eventually introduce 200 Soup and Salad Central locations throughout Asia and Europe.  “The convenience food sector has shown worldwide growth over the last decade,\" remarked Louis Merkey, industry analyst at Businesstrend.com. “Metro-Edibles is wisely taking advantage of this trend.” A survey conducted by Metro-Edibles over the last year revealed that consumers are choosing to purchase more wholesome foods when eating out. Neha Ramisetty, Metro-Edibles' top executive, noted that the industry in general is placing less emphasis on fried foods and focusing more on fresh ingredients and nutritional value. “We are offering this approach too, at an average price of US $7.50 for a lunch or dinner, with cheaper options for breakfast and snacks,\" said Ms. Ramisetty. “Furthermore, we will cater mostly to urban residents with faster-paced lifestyles. So we think that they will appreciate the convenience that our menu will offer.” Metro-Edibles Corp. is optimistic that Soup and Salad Central, its newest subsidiary, will start to turn profits by its second year of operations. The corporation still carries some long-term debt from money it borrowed to start current enterprises.",

We are pleased to welcome her as our first-ever intern reporter at the paper. Ms. Chandra recently moved to Jakarta after studying English and journalism in the United States. For her first assignment, she has researched the challenges currently faced by our country's textile industry from an international perspective. her initial article on this topic appears in this issue. The addition of internships is just one more way we fulfill our educational mission. For the past year a half, the Karimum Post has been sustained primarily by funding from local academic institutions. The paper is now focused not only on keeping the local community informed but also on serving career-development purposes. A bonus of this new direction for the paper is the number of students who now contribute to the publication in multiple ways. The editor would like to take this opportunity to thank the many students who volunteer their time each month - including those who deliver the print version of the newspaper to the doorsteps of our subscribers on time every week",

Viruses can be carried on hands, linger on work surfaces such as countertops and cutting boards, and find their way onto utensils and plates. Therefore, all employees who work with food must wash their hands before handling any food or utensils used in the preparation or delivery of food. Instructions on the proper method for washing your hands are posted at the entrance to the kitchen, in the restrooms, and in the meeting room next to the lobby. Please follow them diligently.

The new desks are due to arrive on 20 October. --- [1] ---. I have requested that the delivery occur early in the morning before office hours so it does not interrupt our work. --- [2] ---. To make the transition go faster, please move the contents of your current desk, including personal items, into a cardboard box on the 19th. You can read more about the model we've ordered at wilsonofficefurniture.com/hybrid56. --- [3] ---. My research showed this one to be the most user-friendly option. The height of the desk can be changed by simply flipping a latch and pushing a button. Many of you have been requesting hybrid desks for some time now, so I am glad we are able to make this happen. This is only one of the changes management plans to implement this year in our efforts to make Holmana a healthier and happier workplace. --- [4] ---.Best regards, Robin Ruiz",

Congreve Advertising is now offering another way for you to reach your customers: automated text messages. We're combining our eye-catching lawn advertisements withe the latest mobile phone technology to create a quick, easy method of increasing your customer base. We're already helped many property rental agents in your area, and we're giving free trials to new users. Our automated text-messaging service involves just a few simple steps. 1. Go to our Web site, congreveads,co,au. Click on the Registration page and select New User. You will be guided through our quick and easy registration process, which will allow you to set up an account. 2. Once your account is set up, you can start entering the automated responses that you want interested renters to receive. Include the details about each property. You can also add images, audio, and videos, as well as links to Web sites. 3. Select a unique keyword for each property. This is what prospective renters will text in order to receive more information about rental. The keyword shouldn't be too long or difficult to spell, and it should be easy for customers to remember. 4. Then wait. Apartment seekers will pass by the property and see the keyword. When they text it, they will instantly receive the message you programmed! As part of your free trial, we'll print new rental signs for one of your properties so that your advertisements include the keyword. And, if you contact me by Friday, I'll add two more properties to the order. So, in addition to a month of our text-messaging service, you'll get updated signs for three rental units, all at no cost to you. After the trial period, you can choose from six reasonably priced packages, which include the option of sending daily updates to preferred customers. I look forward to hearing from you! Owen Clement",

The restaurant, Salty Sea, still stands, but the familiar wooden doors with their porthole windows are closed. All of the interior furniture was auctioned off in November, and the place is set to be demolished next month. --- [2] ---.All is not as it seems, however. Salty Sea manager Nishit Kapoor has come to a hard-won agreement with the property owner, PG Realty, to rebuild the restaurant where it stands. --- [3] ---. According to Mr. Kapoor, PG Realty had decided to have the building torn down because the structure itself would have required massive repairs. --- [4] ---. Any new structure built on the property will follow the original concept but have a more modern appearance. This comes at the insistence of PG Realty over the objections of Mr. Kapoor.",

        "transcript": "To: Satff From: Joan Finkel Date: Octorber 22Re: PhotocopyingDear Staff, To ensure that we conserve company resources and protect the environment, we ask that you adhere to company policies when using the photocopy machine. As you know, making hard copies requires the use of paper, toner, and other materials that impact the environment. It can also be expensive. Currently, departments are charged 5 cents per page, which can add up quickly. To minimize these environmental and financial impacts, consider accessing materials electronically whenever possible. When hard copies are truly necessary, please limit your use of the copy machine to 25 copies per batch. This machine is intended for light use, and printing large batches could result in excessive wear and added maintenance and replacement costs. If a higher number of copies is needed, please submit a request to the Printing Center, located on the fourth floor. We have discontinued the paper printing request form and now only process orders from our electronic form on the employee resources Web page. Please contact your department secretary if you need assistance with this procedure. Thank you for your cooperation. Regards, Joan FrinkelOperations Supervisor",

        "transcript": "It is no secret that Xiaoyu Li's latest book, Daring to Succeed in Business (276 pages, Finn Business Publishing, $26.95), was written specifically for recent university graduates. The book is heavily marketed to young people, and much of the book's introductory material is geared toward them. However, the concepts elucidated by Ms. Li are reflected in the experiences of many an established business executive. --- [1] ---. The basic premise of the book is that in order to fulfill one's true potential, a person must be willing to take calculated risks. As founder and CEO of a large advertising firm, I can attest to this idea. Taking risks was not something I learned to do overnight. --- [2] ---. In fact, I spent the early years of my career firmly in my comfort zone, avoiding any major decisions that did not have a predictable outcome. What I eventually realized is that by doing this, I was effectively preventing my business from growing to its true potential. --- [3] ---. It was not until I started pursuing new opportunities strategically and stopped worrying about the occasional mistake that my company developed into the multimillion-dollar firm it is today. It was a change in mindset that make all the difference, but it took me years to figure out. For this reason, I am particularly pleased that Ms. Li is presenting this idea to those who may become the business leaders of tomorrow. --- [4] ---. In twelve clear and engaging chapters, Ms. Li narrates the experiences of several of today's big names in business. Each chapter choses with exercises designed to help readers assess their own level of risk aversion. The book concludes with a thought-provoking chapter on approaching risk responsibly that will be as helpful to people well along in their careers as it will be for those who are just starting out. For me, it was a welcome reminder of what I have learned over the years. - Karsten Ward",

I drove by the store on my way home from the post office around 6:30, and the lights were off.  Filiz Budak, 8:37 A.M. OK. Since this has happened the last three mornings, there's definitely a problem with the timer.  Jae Woo Han, 8:38 A.M. I left with Luke at 5 and saw him set the timer.  Luke Ciccone, 8:42 A.M. I agree. The lights are turning on before they are scheduled to. I'll call a repair service when I get to work for my shift. Rex Repair is always reliable.  Filiz Budak, 8:48 A.M. Contact the company that did the installation. The paperwork should be in one of the filing cabinets. And until the timer can be fixed, the last person on duty will have to turn off each light before closing.  Jae Woo Han, 8:50 A.M. Yes, I remember filling their invoice at the time of the installation.  Luke Ciccone, 8:51 A.M.  Will do.",

We are also considering hiring a catering company to provide coffee, pastries, and fruit for the event.

City officials are discussing a number of solutions, such as creating a new underground motorway or widening Highway 92 to accommodate more lanes of traffic. No decisions have been finalized, however. \"We simply don't have the infrastructure to support all these cars, and it is clear that something needs to be done,\" said Carla Radwanski, spokesperson for the highway commission. --- [1] ---.\"Any major construction project will take years to complete, so whatever we decide will just add to road congestion in the short term,\" Ms. Radwanski added. \"That's the main reason we haven't committed to anything yet. The more time we spend developing a solid plan, the better managed the project will hopefully be once we begin.\" While the city is considering its options, office workers are becoming increasingly agitated.              --- [2] ---.\"My commute to work is becoming unbearable,\" said Paul Kodgkin, a lawyer who works downtown. \"The distance from my house to the office is only about kilometers, but it takes me over an hour.         --- [3] ---.\"To help alleviate traffic issues in the meantime, office managers are starting to take matters into their own hands. Some are encouraging employees to ride together or are offering incentives to employees who ride bicycles to work. --- [4] ---.",

Now we just need approval from Ms. Feld to be here after hours.  Mateus Ribero (10:22 A.M.) Let's check with her now. Ms. Feld, we would like to have a conference call with our partners in Perth tomorrow. Is it all right if we stay late to show them the new designs? We will be using room 2C since it has the audiovisual equipment.  Janice Feld (10:24 A.M.) Yes, that's fine. I'll tell security so they won't lock the building until you've finished.

To help ensure success in the next quarter, let me give you some updates about adjustments to personnel that have been instituted recently. I am pleased to announce that Christine Moreau has been promoted to accounting supervisor. I have asked Xun Wong and his team to ensure that the responsibilities of Ms. Moreau's previous role as our budget specialist are covered while we work with human resources to recruit a permanent replacement. As you know, Samir Abbas retired a few weeks ago after more than twenty years with the company. Taking his place as credit analyst is Claudia Sandoval. Ms. Sandoval has more than seven years of experience with New Zealand Credit Bank and should have no trouble acclimating to her new position here at Anbaum. Please take a moment to stop by her office in room 128 and introduce yourself. Sincerely,Sophie Jang, Finance ManagerAubaum Company",

As we discussed in our telephone conversation, Certain Seal is well suited to the needs of a mid-to-large-scale food processing company. It is designed to handle large volumes and can be customized for almost any size or shape of food product. Certain Seal also lengthens the shelf life of your products. As you know, one of the biggest causes of food spoilage is excess air left in vacuum- sealed packages. Our system is especially effective in eliminating this threat. In the September issue of Industry World magazine, comparison testing indicated that Certain Seal removed excess air more efficiently than similar vacuum packaging systems (such as the Sigillare 100 produced by TYT Industries). Food quality is ensured further by the packaging material itself. For the Certain Seal system, we use an especially durable plastic that protects foods throughout the freezing, shipping, and reheating processes. This is just an overview of some of the benefits of our technology. I will go into greater detail in my October 28 presentation at your office. In order to tailor the presentation to your needs, I would like to know more about Home Country’s production requirements. Please contact me at our main offices in Oakland at (510) 555-0116 between 9 A.M. and 6 P.M. Sincerely, Julie Chan Sales Director",

        "transcript": "Engineering Firm to Expand  February 15 — Aucoin-Braud, the French engineering firm best known for its energy-efficient power generators, unveiled today its plans for expansion. Speaking in a press conference in Paris, Aucoin-Braud President Simone Roux announced plans for the construction of a new global headquarters there. Construction projects are also slated for the firm’s foreign subsidiaries, Tecnología, in Genoa, Italy, and Nonpareil, Inc., in Brussels, Belgium. At both companies, additional production facilities will be built and staff sizes increased. In order to focus on alternative energy sources such as ocean power, Aucoin-Braud will establish an additional subsidiary in another international market. When pressed by reporters to specify which, Roux declined to say, stating only that “Northern Europe has much potential in this respect and is important to our long-term goals.” For industry analyst Dieter Veidt, this comes as no surprise. “Aucoin-Braud has invested heavily in ocean power technology, so Northern European nations like Denmark or Finland are perfect venues for the firm’s expansion.” Roux’s final comment at the press conference will undoubtedly fuel speculation on this point. When asked what her short-term goals were, she replied that she is “planning a seaside vacation in Denmark.”",

The hotel’s Jade Restaurant has hired a new executive chef, cooking expert and chef extraordinaire Mei-Yi Gan. Gan, who took over the restaurant last month, has already made her mark by adding some of her signature dishes to the menu. Gan has most recently worked as head chef at Hong Kong’s four-star restaurant Room at the Top but is best known for her previous work as editor of East and West, a cooking magazine with an impressive international circulation. Gan studied under Master Chef Chun-Yuen Li, who praised Gan for being “a culinarily gifted student” and possessing “excellent instincts.” So far, the Palais Hotel has been aptly nicknamed. Staying in one of the luxurious rooms, or dining at the sophisticated Jade Restaurant, one gets a sense of experiencing something special, something still undiscovered. Based on the meals that Gan has produced there so far, we predict that the addition of this exceptional chef will serve to bring the hidden jewel out of hiding.",

Ashland Foods was the highest bidder in a two-month¬long bidding war in which Belltown Foods was the other major contender. Hugh Tran, CEO of Addison May, said in a statement to Business Daily, “We are confident in the vision Ashland Foods has for our company and are sure that the integrity of our products will remain intact.” Ashland Foods CEO Anna Baum said that “with the acquisition of Addison May, Ashland Foods expects to become an even' bigger global competitor in emerging markets such as Latin America and China.” Addison May was founded 75 years ago. In the past 5 years, it has undergone two restructurings and has downsized its product line to 18 core products. The company is known for its Meals for Two line of frozen dinners, as well as for its Bakery Delights line of frozen pastries. Because of its strong brand recognition, the Addison May name and logo will still appear on the front of its packaging. On the back, the labels will read “Produced and distributed by Ashland Foods.” The acquisition is set to take place on May 1. There has been no statement regarding the impact the acquisition will have on Addison May’s 17,000 employees worldwide. In response to the news of the acquisition, Ashland Foods’ stock rose 5 percent yesterday.",

        "transcript": "Theater Comes Back to Life  (September 1 marks the beginning of the twentieth theatrical season at Shoreline Playhouse in Meadow Lakes, an event that just one year ago few thought would ever take place. Over the past three years the Playhouse has seen its share of troubles. The opening of Field Theater in nearby Mooreland City meant that Shoreline Playhouse was no longer the only destination for area theatergoers. In addition, the generous grants given to Field Theater by the Walters Foundation meant larger-scale productions there that had a broader appeal. Shoreline Playhouse found itself operating at a loss, with little idea of what the future would hold. Proud of its long theater heritage, the town of Meadow Lakes decided it would not be outdone by Mooreland City. The town stepped in and purchased the Lake Drive property on which the Playhouse stands. The town leased the property back to the Playhouse for the next 25 years as a hands-off landlord. In addition, town residents raised  a significant amount of money in donations through their Save Our Playhouse campaign. These efforts have paid off enormously. Milton Shaffer, executive director of Shoreline Playhouse, says that “because of what the town has done for us, we are now able to offer our best season yet, We have big names in theater who will grace our stage this season, including actors William Farr, Eva Johnson, and Clyde Wells, and musical theater luminaries Mary Noda and Henry Formann.” Shaffer goes on to add, “We have a great lineup of theatrical productions with broad intergenerational appeal, such as Angela DiFalco’s classic play Two Floors Down, Beth Heard’s Windswept Lane, Blanca Flores’ Far Away Home, and Anthony Ward’s new musical Stepping Out of Time, which will make its debut here at Shoreline Playhouse.” The sigh of relief around Meadow Lakes is almost audible. The Shoreline Playhouse can now concentrate on what it does best, enriching the area with firstclass theater productions. As resident May Gramercy puts it, “Art, whether it’s visual art, music, or theater, is necessary for a good life. We’d never let our town be without it.”",

This airline, a long-time favorite of the budget traveler, offers discounted, round- trip airfares to popular destinations like Madrid, Amsterdam, Paris, and Rome. But we especially like the great deals to Germany. These are the lowest available fares on the market at hundreds of dollars less than other advertised fall airline prices. Flier’s Choice offers these fares between September 23 and November 30, but you must make a reservation by August 5 to receive these low prices.

First of all, please welcome Laurie Kingsolver as our new office manager. Laurie comes to us by way of the accounting division, her home for the last twelve years. Laurie and I worked together there during my early days in the company, shortly after she joined the accounting area. She is an energetic colleague and a highly competent manager. Laurie's first day with us here in the quality control and packaging department will be July 29. We are very happy that Alfred Chen has agreed to continue to serve in an interim capacity as assistant coordinator of packaging until we are able to find a replacement for Lydia Parry. Alfred has helped the packaging department immensely this summer by preparing schedules, responding to e-mails, and entering material into the database in Lydia's place. We would have been lost without him. In the meantime, colleagues in the human resources division are working to fill Lydia's position. I will send out an update as soon as an offer is accepted. Finally, please join me in congratulating Karl Wilson on his recent appointment as coordinator of quality control. I look forward to working with Karl in his new role. Thanks, David BriggsSenior Vice PresidentQuality Control and Packaging",

You should read this part of the manual even if you have used a cash register before. The following is the basic setup procedure; more detailed information is provided in the succeeding sections beginning on page 13.  1.UNPACK THE CASH REGISTER. Remove the machine from its box and makes sure that all of the parts and accessories are included. A full inventory of accessories and attachments is provided on page 4.2.REMOVE THE PROTECTIVE PACKAGING. Carefully remove the tape holding the parts of the cash register in place. Then remove the small plastic bag taped to the printer compartment. This is where you will find the keys for adjusting the printer settings. 3.INSTALL THE MEMORY BACKUP BATTERIES. Remove the lid from the printer compartment on the top of the machine (Diagram C). Remove the battery compartment cover by sliding the cover toward you and then pulling up. Note the (+) and (-) markings in the battery compartment. Load the enclosed set of three new UM-3 batteries so that their positive (+) and negative (-) ends are facing as indicated by the markings. Replace the battery compartment cover. NOTE; These batteries protect transaction information stored in your register’s memory when there is a power failure or when you unplug the power adaptor. Be sure to install these batteries before using the machine.4.INSTALL RECEIPT PAPER. Remove the printer lid. Open the platen arm. Lower the roll into the space behind the printer, ensuring that the paper is being fed from the bottom of the roll (see Diagram D.) Put the leading end of the paper over the printer. Close the platen arm slowly until it locks securely. Replace the printer cover, passing the leading end of the paper through the cutter slot. Tear off the excess paper and then close the printer lid. NOTE: When all provided paper rolls have been used, you can order a replacement pack from an approved supplier. A full list of outside suppliers of receipt paper is provided on page 46. -page5-",

        "transcript": "Office Supply Monthly   Desktop copiers are popular among small business owners and telecommuters because they offer the convenience of on-site copying at a reasonably low cost. Our team of reviewers took a look at two popular desktop copiers to determine which one would best meet the needs of a typical small business.The Jet AL-1400 copier is a good choice for consumers on a budget. Its print quality is good, and it performs at a reasonable 22-page-per-minute pace. However, with a maximum use limit of 3,600 pages per month. It is not a machine that can withstand heavy use. While it is suitable for a home office, the Jet AL-1400 does not necessarily perform well enough for a busy office that needs to produce a large number of copies.Clearmark’s 4000 desktop copier is slightly more expensive than the Jet AL-1400. it is 50 square centimeters larger and about 8 kilograms heavier. The larger size allows the Cleamnark 4000 to handle more work; it can reproduce as many as 7,000 pages per month at speeds of up to 35 pages per minute.Both copiers produce high-quality prints that rival some high-end machines, but for businesses looking for a relatively inexpensive copier that is stable and substantial, the Clearmark 4000 is definitely the way to go.",

        "transcript": "Swansea Art and Music Festival Welcomes Back Leader  Wednesday, March 12  —Event organizers announced yesterday that Meg Inoue will once again take on coordination of the Swansea Art and Music Festival this year. During Ms. Inoue’s original eight-year tenure as executive director, the festival became a financial success and achieved international recognition. But interest in the festival has decreased and attendance has dwindled since she stepped down three years ago to take a position as president of the Edinburgh Choir Association.Ms. Inoue was bora in Tokyo but grew up in London, where she earned a degree in business. Her interest in the arts eventually led her to the Swansea festival, where she displayed a talent for selecting visual and performing artists who appealed to critics and the general public alike. And while she brought some well-known artists and performers to the festival, she also sought out and promoted new ones.Avani. Mitra is one of many who believe this festival was a stepping-stone to a successful career. “I had only played at small, local events before this festival,” Ms. Mitra explained. “Then suddenly I was performing before a large—and very appreciative—crowd. It was wonderful. That experience led to a recording contract.” Many in Swansea were shocked by Ms. Inoue’s decision to leave for Edinburgh to help that city’s Choir Association increase its profile. City leaders and festival sponsors hope that her return will bring renewed vitality to the Swansea event and again make it a springboard for new talents in the arts. Michael Brannigan, chief executive officer of festival sponsor Clearview Bank, believes that if anyone can accomplish this goal, it is Ms. Inoue. “She has an instinct that leads her to terrific new performers,” he said. “I’m very glad she’s back.”",

        "transcript": "----------------- Samuels Ltd. announced on Monday that it will spend $1 billion to build nylon production and processing facilities in Singapore to serve the Asia Pacific region. Construction of the 45,000-square-meter plant will take two years. When the factory is complete, it will employ over 500 workers and have an estimated annual production of 60,000 tons of nylon and nylon components. According to company spokesperson Michael Tan, the plant will be equipped with the same advanced technology used in Samuels plants in India and Canada, enabling the company to price its nylon competitively. The nylon products will be sold to companies throughout the region for use in various industrial textile applications. The Asia Pacific market for nylon has remained strong over the last decade, with the majority of purchases coming from the automobile manufacturers. Samuels is hoping that the efficient production from the new factory will position it to become a leader in the market. It will face stiff competition from Haring Corporation, the current leader, and from several other large chemical companies that ship nylon products into the area from Europe and Africa.   -----------------",

        "transcript": "TECHNOLOGY NEWS:   The new Washwave ultrasonic home dishwasher developed by the Dowell Company is a great way to clean dishes and benefit the environment. The Washwave removes debris from dishes using ultrasonic waves in the same way that that can be used to clean jewelry. The dishwasher contains a 100-liter tank with two metal converters that release high-frequency sound waves under water. The waves generate high- temperature, high-pressure bubbles that clean dishes using very little detergent. These micro-scrubbing bubbles can reach into small cracks and crevices that sponges or brushes cannot reach. A conventional machine consumes 200 to 300 liters of fresh water per use. The Washwave filters the water in its tank for reuse after each cycle. The water in its tank only needs to be changed every other week. This can save the average household 250,000 to 500,000 liters of water annually. The shorter run time of the machine also saves on electricity. The Washwave cleaning cycle lasts only five minutes where a conventional machine usually takes twenty minutes or longer.The Washwave unit was introduced in Japan in September, and Dowell is planning to introduce it around the world over the next several years. Dowell is also able to customize dishwashers to meet the needs of commercial clients such as those in the healthcare and hospitality industries. For more information, visit www.dowell.com to see demonstration videos, order a brochure, or find a local retailer.",

I was delighted to have the opportunity to discuss my legal experience and qualifications with you, and I was very pleased when I learned from you yesterday that the firm had voted to offer me a position as an associate. However, I have decided to accept a previous offer from Chang & Associates, another firm that also specializes in patent law.As I mentioned last week, I am extremely impressed with the case work that has been done by you and your partners in the field, and I regret I will not be able to join your team. My decision to accept another offer was largely due to my desire to work in Newcastle, where I have lived for the last ten years. Had distance not been a factor, I would have been happy to accept your offer.Again, thank you for considering me for the position. I will be at both of the major patent policy conferences in Sydney and Auckland later this year, so I look forward to seeing you or your colleagues again in the near future.Sincerely, Ayesha Chandran",

Abigail Hurst, who opened the original Woodcraft Designs location on High Street five years ago, leads a small team of experienced, talented furniture makers whose unique creations will be displayed in both stores. Although Hurst’s pieces cover a range of styles and periods, the new store will showcase the company’s remarkable replicas of Victorian-style furniture made from fine quality cherry, oak, and mahogany woods.Hurst’s craftwork has earned her a reputation as a master artisan in her field. Her reconstruction of a nineteenth-century dressing table was the subject of a lengthy article in Classics of Woodwork on methods and techniques of precision woodcutting. In addition, photographs of some of her best pieces have appeared in Today’s Space, which features information about houses and buildings that are known for their impressive furnishings and decor. Ms. Hurst will divide her time between the old and new store locations.",

As you know, we consider it one of our highest priorities to keep our longtime customers up-to-date on all changes or improvements in the services we provide. For this reason, we are writing to inform you of some changes to our pricing policies that may affect your business.Beginning on February 20, the rate for international calls placed during regular business hours will increase from 14 cents per minute to 16 cents per minute. Also, the rate for all other international calls will be raised, from 9 cents per minute to 11 cents per minute.In addition, local calls during business hours will no longer cost 5 cents per minute. Instead, they will be 6 cents per minute. However, all other rates will remain the same. Please also note that regular business hours are defined as 8 A.M. to 6 P.M., Monday through Friday.We wish to assure you that these changes are necessary and that we are committed to providing the best possible service to all our customers. As one measure taken to ensure that our service remains of the highest quality, we recently refurbished several of our communications receivers, which has improved the clarity of telephone calls on the Valsen Lines network. Moreover, on March 15, we will set up a new customer service call center that will help reduce the amount of time customers have to wait to speak to a representative. These and other planned improvements over the next few months are our way of showing you that we at Valsen Line value your continued business.Sincerely,Rashna RichardsVice President, Customer Relations",

        "transcript": "Hinkle IndustriesHinkle Industries, one of the world’s leading food companies, is overhauling the manufacturing process it uses to produce its soft drinks. Sophisticated new equipment for bottling and labeling beverages will enable the company to produce soft drinks faster and more efficiently. The company also has invested in a new carbonation system that will significantly reduce the amount of waste material that is generated during production.Although the company has shown a willingness to embrace cutting edge technology, it has not done so lighdy. The quality assurance department conducted a series of rigorous trials using the new machines, and production was moved to the new' machines only after strict quality-control standards had been met. According to Inga Hochstein, the company’s assistant director of operations, care was taken to ensure that customers would not notice any difference in taste. “It’s all. very well if a new method is more efficient,” remarked Ms. Hochstein, “but it is hardly a good idea if it affects the customer’s enjoyment of the final product.”The changes at Hinkle are expected to bolster company growth over the next year. Although the European market still accounts for the biggest share (60 percent) of tire company’s sales, Hinkle has seen its markets in Asia and North America increase dramatically over the last two years. Moreover, with new markets expected to develop in South America and Africa over the next several years, industry analysts believe Hinkle Industries will match its stated goal of a 10 percent annual increase in worldwide sales.",

Turn the main faucet tightly until it has stopped dripping.  •Remember that your spare cartridge is enclosed in the package that came with the filter. New cartridges may be purchased anywhere Desna products are sold.Scalding hazard: Before you open the old filter for replacement, you may need to allow the water inside it to cool.

By contrast, subscriptions to our online edition have by far exceeded the company’s expectations. Over the last six months, we have seen a 40 percent increase in the number of Internet subscriptions, and we expect about 2,000 more by the end of the year.Jean pointed out, furthermore, that Cycler Monthly is increasingly appealing to a younger audience. Overwhelmingly, new subscribers are between the ages of 18 and 30.Given these data, I’d like you to start thinking about ways to promote Cycler Monthly’s online edition more heavily, and to target younger readers in particular. Additionally, we may want to consider phasing out the print version entirely since it is now a money - losing operation.I look forward to discussing these and other issues involving the magazine with you on Tuesday.Mina",

While the durability of PPE items varies from three months to two years, most items used by TBNC personnel remain in good condition for up to six months. TBNC routinely conducts inspections of every PPE item twice a year, but an item must be replaced as soon as it is torn or damaged, even if that occurs before one of the official inspections.Whenever you need to replace a PPE item, you should file a request for a new one with your supervisor. The supervisor will inquire about the nature of your work (nighttime work, repaving, maintenance work, etc.) to make sure you are being provided with the proper PPE item or items. Once you have received a replacement PPE item, you should dispose of the item that is being replaced in one of the specially designated bins. These are located in room 2B of the main office. Please do your part to maintain the company’s excellent safety record!",

        "transcript": "THE CLERMONT TRIBUNELocal News November 15Keito Tanaka, who for the past 12 years has been a violinist with the Clermont Symphony Orchestra, has many fond memories of the Woodlawn Theater. He attended many performances there, first with his parents, then with his friends as a young adult, and finally with his own children. But ten years have passed since a performance was last staged at the Wood lawn: in fact, until recently, the city council was considering tearing down the 75-year-old structure to make way for a department store.That is when Mr. Tanaka decided to buy the property. He began gathering the necessary funds to realize his goal by requesting donations from several area businesses. Additionally, he organized a variety of fundraising activities, the highlight of which was an open-air concert at South Clermont Park featuring local musicians, including himself. In the end, Mr. Tanaka managed to achieve his goal and for the past year he has lovingly overseen every aspect of the detailed renovation. He sought out volunteers to do carpentry work and painting; soon a number of craftspeople from the area were offering their services at no charge for this worthy cause.On Saturday, November 25, The Woodlawn Theater will once again open its doors to the public with the screening of the documentary “The Rise, Fall, and Rebirth of the Woodlawn Theater.” As the title suggests, the documentary captures the history of the Woodlawn Theater, prominently featuring the efforts of Mr. Tanaka to preserve the building. The event will take place at 6:00 P.M., with Mr. Tanaka having the honor of being the projectionist for the evening. After the screening, a reception will be held from 7:00 P.M. to 8:30 P.M.",

        "transcript": "LOCAL NEWS On Saturday, Chuan Kunchai observed with satisfaction the crowds of people who came to preview Meadowscape, a community of 60 two- and three-bedroom houses; in a way, this community brings his life full circle.When Kunchai was a teenager, he helped his father build the family’s home on East Elm Street, becoming involved in all aspects of the construction of the building. This experience eventually led to a job in the construction business, which in turn enabled Kunchai to pay for his architecture studies at Vanwick University. Soon after graduation, he joined the architecture firm, Morgan and Maynard, where he worked for eight years, mainly designing parks, playgrounds, and other public spaces. He next went on to teach architecture at the same university he graduated from.Kunchai stalled his own company, Great West Builders, five years ago. Says Kunchai, “Many people who currently rent accommodations in the area are expressing interest in homeownership, but they can’t afford much of what’s available in Westburg. Or if they do find something, it often requires a lot of expensive repairs. Obviously, these people need some assistance.”Notes Jamie Santana, a real estate agent with Acton Real Estate, Inc., “Mr. Kunchai is perhaps the only builder in the Acton area who is genuinely committed to addressing the needs of people who want affordable housing.”Buyers who attended the preview were able to save money by purchasing homes before Meadowscape’s grand opening in May. Sang Gyun Kim, Great West’s sales director, remarked “Preview attendees were able to buy homes at prices as much as 10 percent lower than the homes will later sell for. Also, since only a limited number of each house design will be built, buyers who purchase houses later might not get their first choice of design.”Evelyn Zhou was among the preview attendees on Saturday who decided to start the purchasing process that day. “I’ve been searching for an affordable home in Westburg for months,” said Ms. Zhou. “Thanks to Meadowscape, I’m about to realize a dream I’ve had for a long time.”",

The last day of the old schedule will be Friday, February 21, and the office will close at 5:00 P.M. on that day.Employees in the accounting department will not be affected by the change, since their schedule is determined by normal banking hours.",

The site houses the area's largest collection of seventeenth– and eighteenth-century paintings. The repair of the 300-year-old building began nearly a decade ago but had been put on hold because of a lack of financial support. Thanks to funds from the Czech Architectural Preservation Society and significant private donations to the museum, the project can now be completed. Architect Zbysck Dvorak, who is based in Prague, says, \"Since the museum's board first contacted me during the initial stages of the project, I have been committed to maintaining the building's original architectural elements.\" The museum will close during the months of April and May, but key parts of the museum will be reopened to the public in June, just as tourist season begins.",

I will also post the comment in the “What Customers Are Saying\" section of your company’s Web site. if that is OK with you. Here is my comment. “We are so happy we chose Manilo Masonry to install a flagstone patio, a walkway, and an outdoor fireplace at our home. The quality of the craftsmanship is top-notch, and the job was completed three days earlier than the estimated finish date. Mr. Manilo himself was present for every aspect of the project, from the planning stages to final inspection. I intend to use Manilo Masonry again in the future to repave our driveway.\"  Thanks again for doing such a great job.  Hannah Schubert",

        "transcript": "A History of Sports from Ancient Times to the PresentBy Rebecca Jean PorterIllustrated, 248 pp.Oakview Press, Westport, CT $32.95Rebecca Jean Porter, the author of Olympic Dreams, has attained another perfect score in this engaging and readable history. A History of Sports from Ancient Times to the Present covers everything from sporting events in ancient Rome to the origins of team sports in North America, and it includes a section on sports played on contemporary university campuses. I highly recommend the chapter with detailed instructions on how to play games that had previously been lost over time. Porter’s comprehensive introduction and bibliography, as well as the time line of dates and events, make this a reference work that should be purchased by all public libraries. An online companion volume will be published next year.- Andrew Huff",

Unfortunately, they are also often overpriced. Tourists are better off purchasing traditional Meledonian handcrafts from individual street vendors, who sell their goods from stalls that line the side streets of the town center. One can find items like hand-knitted sweaters with traditional Meledonian folk motifs, felted wool hats and coasters, carved wooden mugs, dark Meledonian chocolate, and hand-painted marzipan sweets. The quality of the goods is comparable to that of the goods found in the souvenir shops, and the vendors are willing to negotiate their prices. There is one shop, however, that is definitely worth a visit. The Halinga Boutique is located in Old Town Krolleen on the north side of the castle wall at 18 Videvika. This is the largest souvenir shop in the area, and it offers a broad selection of traditional items. The Halinga Boutique is a good option for the tourist who does not have time to browse the street stalls and prefers the convenience of one-stop shopping.",

The Scorpia Group, one of Europe's largest independent printing companies, has chosen a site on Compton Way for its new plant. This was the former Hartland Steelworks location.Local leaders are delighted at the prospect of hundreds of highly skilled jobs and training opportunities being created in the Reading area, Robert Andrews, chief executive of the Reading1 City Investment Initiatives said, “The scale and nature of this project will give a huge boost to the local economy”The printing plant will offer top-quality and fast color production of magazines, catalogs, and other publications. The Compton Way site is owned by Scorpia's development partner, which was asked to draw up plans for the site. The company has chosen the Compton Way site on the basis of its location, the financial grants that are available from the central government, and the local labor market.The chief executive of Scorpia said, “The location of our new plant, with access to the road network and rail freight links, and the reputation of the workforce in the region had a big impact on our decision-making process. In addition, the attitude and cooperation of local authorities in Reading is a positive example to the rest of the country of how to attract new investments”.",

I told him that we were more interested in durability than in saving a few dollars‘ Andrew said that you carried both brass and plastic valves, brass for $75 each and plastic for $50 each, both from reliable manufacturers. We knew that the brass are usually good for 6 years. Andrew assured us that the plastic would hold up as well, if not better.On Andrew’s recommendation our company purchased 48 plastic automatic sprinkler valves from you. Over the past 3 months the sleeve connecting the top of the valve to the main water pipe has burst or cracked on 12 of the valves. Last Sunday one-third of the lawn was flooded for a full day, since 2 valves broke while our small maintenance crew was out handling a problem in another building across town.The result is that besides repairing considerable damage to the lawn (estimates run about $1,000), we will need to replace the 12 valves.We are aware that our warranty expired a year ago. However, since the plastic valves were purchased on your recommendation, we think you should be willing to stand behind your work and provide the labor to install brass valves. We are willing to pay for the new valves themselves.Sincerely yours,Maria Palmer Maintenance supervisor",

More and more of them are being asked to wait a week or longer for service from a repair crew. It seems that our customer base has expanded more quickly than projected, and technical support requests have increased by about 30 percent. This means that the number of technicians available to assist customers is now insuffcient.The committee feels an expansion of the repair team is necessary to restore customer satisfaction. We are expecting even more customers to have our equipment installed in their homes, and with the present number of technical crews, we may not be able to handle their service needs. The committee has authorized you to recruit five more people who have the appropriate training.Best regards,Adelina Viera, Personnel Director E-last Internet, Inc.",

Potential customers received complimentary bottles of the drinks and 15% discount coupons for future purchases. They were then asked to complete feedback questionnaires. The program ran from July 15 to July 31, and the discount, which applies to our full range of products, will be good until October 1.The following briefly summarizes information gathered through the program:-  Three varieties were measured, listed here in descending order of customer popularity: Mango Mountain, Great Guava, and Yum Cocoplum- Analysis of the feedback questionnaires showed that customers felt Yum Cocoplum contained too much sugar. (This is a surprising finding because none of the brands are artificially flavored and they all preserve the natural taste of the fruit they are based on.)- Many customers rated the flavor combinations in Mango Mountain and Great Guava as “superb,”I would like to hold a meeting with you next week to discuss these points in more detail. Jess Bronsky is putting together the agenda for the meeting and will notify you soon of the time and place.",

Once it is installed on a tap with cold running water, it is ready for frequent use with minimum maintenance. Periodic replacement of the filtering cartridge is all that is necessary. On average, after four months of use, the cartridge will lose effectiveness and should be replaced (there are three spare cartridges in the package). In most cases, little visible deposit accumulates in the cartridge for up to two months.To extend the lifetime of a cartridge, the filter is equipped with a switch that changes the mode from “filtered” to “unfiltered.” When the water dispensed from the tap is to be used for purposes other than drinking, this switch allows the water to bypass the filter.",

Rd Olsenburg City, Wl 530030January 17Mr. Kenneth DamianOisenburg City Mayor City HallOisenburg City, Wl 23090 Dear Mr. Mayor:Iam writing on behalf of the Olsenburg Business Association to urge you to support legislation modifying the ban on overnight parking of large vehicles in our area. The number of tourists who travel in campers, motor homes, and other recreational vehicles (RVs) has increased significantly nationwide. While the proportion of visitors who arrive by RV is still small compared to more traditional tourists, I am sure you will agree that forcing RV tourists to leave every evening only compromises our efforts to promote tourism, which is connected to a substantial amount of income for our city. We are confident that making Olsenburg “RV friendly” will benefit the local tourism industry and its employees. Three nearby cities that have lifted similar bans have reported positive results. Tocasta Town, Gamma Village, and Arcoda City are evidence that welcoming RV tourists can promote tourism, generating more reverse for restaurants and local shops. Next month, Arcoda City will even begin adding special RV parking areas in its parks.As you know, the tourism and food service industries employ over 25 percent of our workforce. Currently, however, many of our visitors are here only during the daytime, so we are losing business to neighboring cities. RV tourism would not compete with hotel tourism. In fact, it would only increase the total number of visitors to our city.I look forward to seeing you at the meeting next Thursday, where the city council will address this important issue.Respectfully yours,Linda DefreySenior Vice President of  overnmental Affairs Olsenburg Business Association",

The best submissions for original recipes will be included in a special chapter entitled “Kitchen Table Renaissance”Bear in mind the following points as you prepare submissions for “Kitchen Table Renaissance”- The final book will include a serving guide of dishes that go well together. K your recipe is for a dessert, soup, or other item recommended as a side course, please make sure your submission includes suggestions for main dishes that it would complement.- We are looking for recipes characterized by unique flavors but also commonly available ingredients and methods of preparation familiar to the average amateur cooking enthusiast.- The cost of ingredients and nutritional variety are important, but dishes in this section need to be, above all, easily made by the average person at home in a minimum of time.-  Selected dishes will be photographed later by a professional, so there is no need to include pictures with your submissions.All submissions should be sent by e-mail to cookbook@renaissartcetable.com by the end of April. We expect the selection process to take a little over a month, and the authors of the winning recipes will be notified in June. In addition to inclusion in the final cookbook, winning submissions will also be rewarded with a small cash bonus. We expect to have the manuscript prepared by the end of July so that we can publish the collection in time for the restaurant’s anniversary in November.",

        "transcript": "Tips for Your Photographs  Maintaining the quality and integrity of photographs is important because photographs are our visual record of the past. By following a few important guidelines, you can ensure that your photographs last a lifetime. If photographs are to be displayed, make sure they are placed in frames that have ultraviolet-resistant glass. Exposure to the Sun’s ultraviolet rays can cause colors to fade and can cause black-and-white photographs to turn yellow. In addition, they should be placed in frames that allow space between the glass and the top surface of the photograph. The surface of the photograph can deteriorate if it is in constant contact with glass. When storing photographs in albums, make sure the albums contain acid-free paper. Colored paper or magnetic pages should never be used. To store photographs in boxes, use boxes made of metal or acid-free cardboard. Store albums and boxes in a dry environment, as humidity can quickly destroy photographs. Finally, be careful when handling photographs, especially historic ones. If you must touch a photograph, your hands should be clean. Skin naturally produces oil, which can be harmful to photographs. You should pick up photographs only by the edges  and should wear clean cotton gloves.",

Stony Cove Nature Center, which was first proposed two years ago and has been under construction for the past eleven months, was supposed to open in August. However, the quick construction schedule, coupled with funds from private donors, enabled the commission to unveil it several months earlier than they had planned.\"The Cedarport city council has been extremely helpful since the first day the center was proposed,” said Madeline Kittleson, head of the Parks Commission. “But we wouldn’t have been able to open our doors as soon as we did without the generosity of local residents and businesses who donated money toward the center.”The new 1,750-square-meter facility includes a number of permanent nature exhibits, space for a rotating exhibit, and several lecture rooms. Starting next Monday, the lecture rooms will be used both as a setting for public nature programs and as classrooms for selected environmental science classes from the University of Cedarport, which is located nearby.The exhibits will focus on the natural diversity of Stony Cove, including sections about the plants that grow in the cove’s seaside environment and the sea animals that live in and around the cove.Over the next few weeks, the Stony Cove Nature Center will be hosting a variety of events, including several educational programs for schoolchildren and a nature walk for members of a local club called Environmental Friends. The full schedule can be found on Stony Cove Nature Center’s Web site.",

        "transcript": "MEMOTo: New Products DepartmentFrom: Arianna Lee, Focus Group CoordinatorDate: October 12Subject: Focus group number 4829On October 10,1 conducted a formal taste test of the four new bottled iced tea drinks developed as summer specials. The flavors tested were Summer Raspberry, Fresh Mint, Fresh Mint with Lemon, and Hint of Peach. Several of you have been asking about the taste test, so I'd like to provide a brief summary.Two groups with twelve participants each from the local area were selected at random. They met during the day of October 10 at an off-site location. Participants in the first group were given a sample of each flavor and asked to rate each sample on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 signifying that the drink was not enjoyable at all and 10 signifying that the drink was highly enjoyable. Participants in the second group were given the same samples, but the samples were labeled by name. They were then asked to rate the samples on two scales from 1 to 10: how much they enjoyed the drink and how well it satisfied the expectation created by its name. The purpose of this test was to determine if the flavors of the drinks actually match the expectation created by the name of the product.Results of the group taste test are being processed and analyzed and will be available next week. As always, the results are confidential, so my assistant will hand deliver a paper copy of the report directly to your offices rather than sending it as an e-mail attachment. Remember, our competition is eager to find out the results. If you think you need to share any details with anyone outside our department, please check with me first.",

        "transcript": "Rice Crop Expected to Reach Near-Record LevelsThe National Department of Agriculture has reported that the nation’s farms are on pace to produce their second-largest annual rice crop and fourth - largest annual soybean crop ever. As a result, grain, prices are expected to drop across the nation over the next several months, according to the government’s economic advisory office.The forecast is based on actual field visits and fanner surveys conducted by the department. Because of higher-than-average rainfall during the early summer planting season, previous estimates had been much lower than normal. But cooler, ideal weather since then has helped many of the nation’s farmers recover from June’s heavy rains. The department forecasts that farmers will harvest 4.3 billion bushels of rice, up more than. 670 million bushels from last month’s estimate of 3.6 billion. The new estimate is only 3 percent lower than last year’s record crop of 4.5 billion bushels.That recovery is expected to lead to lower prices for rice and soybeans, two of the nation’s most important agricultural exports. That may provide some relief to meat producers who use rice and soybeans for feed, as well as for regular citizens who had expected to pay higher prices for rice and rice products at the supermarket. The department has lowered its estimate for soybeans slightly, to 2.97 billion bushels from 3 billion last month.The new estimate is welcome news for many other businesses as well. High rice prices had cut deeply into profits for restaurant chains, for instance, since they spend a significant portion of their budget on rice and rice products.",

        "transcript": "This month, we take a look at Purity Air’s Z320 100- centimeter Industrial Floor Fan. Our product reviewers found that the Z320 does a good job of eliminating stale air in machine shops, garages, factories, and construction areas. The unit is substantial, and at 28 kilograms, it is certainly not easy to lift. However, its steel frame does make it solid and durable for industrial use. The motor is completely enclosed, which allows the fan to run more quietly than many comparable products.   Our reviewers did, however, notice some things that could be improved. While the Z32Q’s HP motor and tapered aluminum blades allow for strong airflow, its three-speed setting is problematic. The three speeds are too similar; all of them make the unit seem like it is running on a high speed. Secondly, it comes with wall-mounting brackets, but our reviewers felt that a larger bracket with stronger anchors was needed to mount a unit of such weight properly and safely. Finally, the one- year warranty covers only a select number of replacement parts, whereas similar fans manufactured by other companies include a more comprehensive warranty. This is an important issue that may well cost Purity Air some sales.",

The new planes will enable the airline to expand its international routes as well as provide replacements for its aging fleet of jet planes. Star Airways and Skystream, in a joint announcement at the Brussels Air Show on Thursday, said that the order included seventeen of the new AWB850 aircraft. This will make Star Airways the first Indian carrier to fly the AWB850, an aim it has had since the powerful jets were first produced.",

        "transcript": "Plans Approved for Local AttractionTuesday, February 26After hearing recommendations proposed by the panel commissioned eight months ago to evaluate the Marsh Point Lighthouse, local officials announced on Monday that a major restoration of the lighthouse tower would begin in two months. To the untrained eye, the lighthouse appears to be in good shape. However, according to chief engineer Edward Sayer, the tower is in dire need of repair to replace loose bricks and address severe corrosion at the base of the structure. President of the Marsh Point Historical Society Glenda Lewis remarks, “For almost 200 years, the lighthouse has been an aid to navigation. Restoring the lighthouse now may extend its service for another two centuries.”The lighthouse is also important for cultural reasons. As Stephanie Landsbury of the city tourist board notes, ‘The Marsh Point Lighthouse is a local landmark. It has been featured on posters and signs and even plays a pivotal role in the movie classic A Clear Beam of Light.”Restoration of the structure will be done in phases over the next eighteen months, and will include work on the interior as well as the exterior of the lighthouse. Parts of the structure will remain open to the public while the work is being done, as will the museum and gift shop also on the premises. The completion of the project is expected to coincide with the building’s bicentennial. Donations to help support the cost of the restoration are being solicited from local individuals and corporate sponsors.",

        "transcript": "NEW TRENDS IN RETAILINGIn past years retailers in North America have sounded a consistent theme: Bigger is better. Superstores increased in number and spread rapidly, often at the expense of smaller, family-owned retail stores. Today these superstores are more than 50 percent larger than in the 1980’s and can be over 30,000 square meters in size.But small retail stores are now making a comeback. Many of the largest retailers have begun experimenting with small-store formats. Rather than operating the small stores as separate outlets, though, the companies are managing all the stores in an area together as a closely knit network. By distributing small outlets throughout an area, a retailer can guarantee that one of them will almost always be closer to a given shopper than the superstore at the edge of town. Moreover, small stores are often located within walking distance of public transportation, and, once inside, customers can easily find the products they are looking for.One advantage of the big stores has been the variety of products they are able to carry because they are so large. One way that has been found to increase variety in small stores is to use electronic kiosks for online shopping. Although the number of products in the stores is small, there are enough actual items to inform customers about the range and quality of products. Customers are then offered computer access to a Web site that provides the full product line. With regard to costs, small stores that are managed as networks have become as inexpensive to operate as superstores. By combining the orders of these stores, for instance, retailers can take advantage of the full-truckload delivery price rather than incur the higher cost of partial truckload deliveries.",

Now the cost is 50 dollars per month. Aside from this significant increase in cost, I have been dissatisfied with some of the services at the fitness center. There never seems to be enough equipment available for use at peak hours during the day. In addition, many of the new aerobics classes that I registered for were canceled due to low attendance.Sincerely,Amanda Palmer",

The second phase, reconstruction of the first-floor offices adjacent to the auditorium, could begin as early as August, with an intended completion date of late November.A project of this scope, in such a central location, will necessarily cause a certain degree of disruption to our community, and every effort will be made to minimize this disruption. Plans have already been made to provide alternative venues during renovation; for those of you who anticipate needing to schedule events for these alternative venues, inform Lidia Ibrahim(ext. 3372, librahim@m.galleries.com) as soon as possible.Should these time lines change in any way as this work progresses, we will keep the community informed.We greatly appreciate your patience as we continue to enhance our facilities.",

I need to clarify the charges for existing members. The cover letter that I enclosed with your conference booklet should have included the sentence, “If you are not AFC member, please submit 35 dollars for your membership.”As you have already paid this year’s membership dues, you do not need to send the 35 dollars listed on the conference registration form. Please forgive the mistake. When you return your registration form, please write “already a current member” on it. However, you will still need to enclose the 50 dollar conference fee and 275 dollars for your room and banquet meal no later than February 10.If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me. The best way is to e-mail me atjefihome@afincon.com, but if necessary, you may also leave me a message at 1-561-555-8286, extension 432, and I will get back to you as quickly as possible.Sincerely,Jeff HomeMembership Coordinator",

Accordingly, Melodia Music will close at 7:00 P.M. on Fridays, instead of at 6:00 P.M., and at 5:00 P.M. on Saturdays, instead of at 4:00 P.M. To accommodate the extra hour, the first shift of each day will be lengthened by half an hour, and the second shift will begin half an hour later than usual and end an hour later than usual. All affected employees will be compensated for the extra time. If you need to adjust your schedule because of this change, please see me as soon as possible.Thank you for your cooperation.",

        "transcript": "MILAN, Italy—Few industries change as rapidly as the fashion industry, in which designers are constantly trying to create innovative versions of traditional garments. Even so, last week's fashion show in Milan was particularly notable for the vast number of garments made partly or entirely out of silk. From eveningwear to sportswear, many designers featured colorful silks in their collections.The designers were likely responding to a market trend: a dramatically increased demand for colorful silk products. “Our sales of silk shirts and dresses have reached an all-time high,” said Christina Alvarez, a buyer for Gatsby’s in London. “Silk items have been flying off the racks.”Economic analysts were surprised by the trend, since they had predicted that the rise of dry-cleaning costs would take a toll on silk manufacturers. However, comfort may have been a greater factor than price, especially given the unusually hot weather this past summer. “Today’s silk garments,” said Ms. Alvarez, “are lighter and cooler than many other types of clothing.”",

We are very excited about the renovations to our office space and believe that they will enhance our work environment tremendously. However, during the construction period, we ask that employees make some basic changes to their office routines.First of all, please use only the back door until May 26, as the front door will be blocked. In addition, the kitchen on the fist floor will be inaccessible while it is being updated. Consequently, all employees must use the third-floor kitchen until the update is finalized on May 28. Since we will be sharing a much smaller kitchen space, please label the food items you keep in the refrigerator and minimize the time you spend on food preparation in the kitchen. Apart from some unavoidable noise and extra traffic, the second through fourth floors should not be affected by construction.If the construction crew is able to complete the work on schedule, the renovations will be finished on June 2. Thank you in advance for your patience.Sarwar Ahmed Facilities Manager",

The airport is intended to relieve overcrowding at Garas Regional Airport, and government officials hope that the new facility will further contribute to the growth of tourism on the island of Ponta Mira.In recent years, new hotels have appeared in Mona City, Ponta Mira’s capital, and the island has seen an increase in the number of tourists. However, the growth of tourism had been hampered by the fact that, because of its proximity to the water, Garas Regional Airport cannot be expanded to accommodate an increased volume of traffic.Additionally, long lines in crowded ticketing and baggage areas and lack of space in waiting areas of the terminal were noted by travelers as reasons to avoid the airport. While the island can be reached by ferry, this option is available only from the seaside cities of Port-de-Bastique and Reolas. Tourists have to fly to one of these destinations and then embark on a sea journey that takes at least 90 minutes.Lipali was chosen as the site for the new airport because it is away from the city, providing ample room for a spacious facility, complete with several eateries, comfortable waiting areas, expanded ticketing areas, and Internet access.Travelers using the new Alitas International Airport can easily get to and from the facility by bus or car. Moreover, to increase access, an express railway connection between Mona City and the new airport is under construction, with expectations that it will be fully functional before the end of the year.",

The goal of this program is to support local efforts to sustain a convenient and satisfying life in the countryside. The grants available this year are as follows:  Business Development Grant: 250,000 dollars  Community Development Grant: 150,000 dollars  Communications Development Grant: 200,000 dollars Educational Development Grant: 100,000 dollars  The institute will give priority to proposals that reflect a comprehensive approach to community development, promote community engagement, and make rural communities a better place to live and work. The grants will allow rural communities to take the first step toward a project or plan that can help improve the lives of rural community members. For the past decades, the grants have been used for a variety of purposes such as state-of- the-art farming equipment, road maintenance, communications infrastructure, educational facilities, and investments for young rural entrepreneurs. Download this application to apply for a grant. The deadline for submission is February 28.   ===========================     Village of Cranton Wins Funding  CRANTON, March 22—The Institute of Rural Service announced today that the village of Cranton is this year’s recipient of the Educational Development Grant. The grant will be used to fund the construction of a large playground that will provide recreational activities for children under 12. Since the opening of the new electronics factory last year, the number of families in the area has risen dramatically. As a result, children have been left with less and less space to play in. The new playground will allow children to play and enjoy themselves when they are not at school.  Cranton is proud to be the recipient of this grant and plans to apply for more grants in the future to improve the living conditions of the town and attract more residents",

Previously, he was the chief financial officer at the technology investment firm Esta Resources in San Francisco, California. He assumed the position of CEO at the company—based in Dallas, Texas—just this Monday. Stockholders voted unanimously for the appointment, hoping the new CEO will bring renewed vitality and strength to the company. Mr. Cross has an impressive record as a business leader who makes smart decisions,\" commented Lynn Dyer, the director of human resources at Tech Life. \"We have faith that he will lead US in a new direction that will help develop new markets and optimize our company operations in general.\" Steve Cross graduated from Chester University in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, with a master's degree in business administration. He once served as head of the American League of Business Leaders and is a dedicated family man. ===========================To:Steve CrossFrom:Lynn Dyer Subject: Welcome! Date:April 15Dear Mr. Cross, It has been almost two years since we met. I am so glad to be collaborating with you again after we worked in the same department at Esta Resources. I felt we cooperated very well at that time, and I had been hoping to work with you again. You will find that we have very dedicated and hard-working teams here. If there is anything I can do to help you make the transition, please don’t hesitate to ask. Additionally, Tech Life has recently added five new managers to our company. If you have time, please visit them when they will all be attending a mandatory training session at 3:00 RM. this afternoon in Room 403. Sincerely, Lynn DyerDirector of Human Resources Tech Life",

Sincerely, Kevin DraperLoan SpecialistFive Star Financial Bank===========================Listed below are the various home loans available to members of Five Star Financial Bank. Learning about different kinds of loans will help you make an informed decision. Review the loan choices below and decide which loan is right for your situation.   Fixed-Rate Mortgage Loan - This loan ensures that your interest rate and monthly principal repayment remain the same during the entire period of your loan. This loan protects you from rising interest rates and may be a good choice if you plan to live in your home for a long time.   Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Loan   - Your interest rate remains fixed for the initial 5 years, and then is adjusted annually. Typically, this loan has a lower initial interest rate than on a fixed- rate mortgage.   Interest-Only Mortgage Loan   - During the initial 5 years of the loan, you are required to make payments on interest only. This option is suitable for those with fluctuating incomes. When your finances are tight, you can make the interest-only payment. And when your earnings increase, you can make payments on principal.    Home Opportunity Loan   -This special loan is designed for first-time home buyers. You do not need a large down payment and a perfect credit rating in order to qualify for this loan.",

Your new student is Jane Meyers and she will bring the $100 registration fee with her to the first class on Monday. Also, on Monday, please give Ms. Meyers and any other new members the form they will need to fill out. I have attached the necessary paperwork to this e-mail.

I bought the Blackbeard’s Pirate Ship model to put together with my son, and I am having a problem. After carefully reading the instruction manual, I noticed that a few essential parts have been left out of the box. Specifically, some parts that make up the mast and sail seem to be absent from the kit. I have bought many models from Mega Hobby for years and have always been happy with the products I received. Has anyone else had the same problem with this kit? My son and I were planning to submit our finished model to a local model building contest at the end of the month, and we are very disappointed with this setback. If anyone else has any experience with this problem and solved it, I would greatly appreciate your advice.  ==============================< h4 align =\"center\">Mesa Hobby Models Community ForumIssue with the Blackbeard’s Pirate Ship ModelAugust 3, 10:55 A.M.Post by John TaylorHi John, I also recently purchased the Blackboard’s Pirate Ship model from the Mega Hobby online store for my son and had the same problem that you did. At first, I thought I must have been mistaken, but after checking the list of all parts in the instruction manual, I determined that several parts must have been missing from the kit at the time of sale. I took the kit back to my local Mega Hobby store and a staff member confirmed my suspicion. The Mega Hobby employee was nice enough to exchange my model kit for one that had all of the parts. With the new kit, my son and I were able to put together the model exactly like the picture on the box. I suggest that you go to the Mega Hobby store closest to your home and ask them to exchange your defective product. Be sure to make a note of the order number when you go there.",

Kimberly Lee, host of the My Home Cooking television show and owner of her own restaurant chain, seems to know all the secrets. Her show has been on the air for over two years, and now she has a devoted group of followers around the country. When she sat down for an interview with us, she said that fresh vegetables and local produce are the key to cooking healthy and tasty food. Ms. Lee is scheduled to publish her very first cookbook near the end of the month. The book is entitled Kimberly Lee’s My Home Cooking, and it provides easy-to- follow recipes that can be made in less than 30 minutes. Over 40,000 copies have already been pre-ordered so far. Ms. Lee says that the final page of the book will include a detachable fan club membership form. Those who fill the form out and send it in to the provided address will receive a monthly newsletter and exclusive recipes available only to those in the fan club. Fan club members will also receive a password that allows access to a fan club website. ===========================To: Kimberly LeeFrom: Suzie Sanders Date: October 12Subject: UpdateDear Ms. Lee, Great news! I’m happy to report that not only has your book been selling well, but the number of new members joining the fan club has been increasing drastically since it was published. I’m certain that the article in the newspaper helped generate considerable publicity for your book. Also, we have received a lot of feedback from new members expressing a desire for more recipes for cakes, cookies, and candies to be featured in next month’s newsletter. I think it would be a good idea to meet their needs this time. Sincerely, Suzie Sanders Publicity Coordinator",

This year we have updated our conference room with new projectors and more comfortable seating. We will be providing shuttle busses from the airport and a premium buffet in the dining hall as well as an Internet café where guests can use computers or print documents at no cost. For your convenience, we will also be providing useful supplies such as flip charts, 10-foot whiteboards, and projector screens. Once you decide on a date, we ask that you please make a down payment of $1,000 after we see if it is available. The remaining balance should be paid upon your arrival. Also, we ask that as the organizer of the event, you arrive at the conference center a day before the conference begins. This way, any unforeseen circumstances can be taken care of beforehand. We appreciate your business with the Titus Conference Center again. We are looking forward to providing you with the best service possible. Stacey Watkins, Director===========================From:Ann Rose To: Stacey Watkins Subject: RE: Conference of Bank Managers Date: February 16Dear Mr. Watkins, I am also pleased to be working with you again this year. We would like to reserve your conference space for the weekend of August 15 to 16. Additionally, the down payment will be handled by our financial department. I will have one of the employees contact you soon. There is one thing that I would like to tell you. Actually, last year, some of our attendees were disappointed because the dining hall didn’t offer a variety of vegetarian options. I hope this inconvenience will be dealt with in advance this year. Thank you, Ann RoseOrganizer, Annual Conference of Bank Managers",

Thank you for inviting me down to take part in these business negotiations. Please let me know what time I should arrive. Will the meeting begin after lunchtime like it did last time? You won’t need to pick up me up, as I have arranged for a cab to pick me up at the Santa Fe Bus Terminal. Fortunately, a new bus line was established between where I live and your offices. It has made transit in the Southwestern region considerably convenient. There are routes that now travel to Denver and Phoenix as well. Also, thanks to some lucky circumstances, I will be able to buy my ticket to Santa Fe at half the original price. I can’t wait to see you and your co-workers again soon. Dan Gregory",

I see we were charged $95 dollars for each time you serviced our offices. This is what we had initially agreed upon and have been paying for your services since last year at this time. However, Rod Sanford told me we’d be receiving a $5 discount each time you visited us because we have arranged for you to clean our other location just off 1 of Hwy. 26. He said that this new price would be starting in February. I have included a copy of the e-mail Rod Sanford sent me. Could you please adjust the price to reflect the new agreement and send us a new bill? I’d appreciate it. We look forward to seeing you  again. Thank you for your assistance, Patricia CollinsManager Randall Auto Body",

First, though, I would like some clarification about the online advertisement. I reviewed the specifications on your Web site but am still uncertain about the location of the advertisement. Where exactly would the 4\" x 5\" advertisement appear on your Web site? As soon as I hear from you, I can provide an electronic file of the advertisement together with payment details. Thanks, James WicklerOwner, Seed Delight Company",

No matter what the event, we can help you design the perfect ticket. Step 1: Create your ticketBrowse our collection of template designs by selecting a category. You can then easily modify the text each template to include your event information. If you want more control over the color scheme, font, images, and other design features, simply download our Ticket Stack Design Application. This free software gives customers the freedom to go beyond the standard templates and modify the appearance of their ticket. Step 2: Choose a quantityWith Ticket Stack, you can order as few as 50 ticket or as more as you need. The more you order, the lower the price!    Quantity   Price per item    50-500   30 cents    501-1,000 20 cents   1,001-2,500 10 cents   2,501 or more 8 cents Step 3: Add an invisible verification stampFor an additional 2 cents per item, you can choose to have the back of your tickets printed with ultraviolet ink, visible only under a black light. This feature ensures the authenticity of your tickets. Step 4: Place your orderOrders generally require three business days to process, but large orders may take longer. Be sure to place your order well in advance of your event. --------------------------------------------------- Welcome to Ticket Stack☆☆☆☆☆ I’m so thankful I found Ticket Stack!I work for an independent local theater Dewley Theater. We recently ordered 2,500 tickets from Ticket Stack. We decided against securing the tickets with the invisible verification stamp but did download the free software so that we would have more flexibility with the design and could include the theater’s logo. The tickets came out great! A number of patrons complimented us on the new design, and we were especially pleased with the prompt delivery! By contrast, last year we ordered tickets from a small company based here in Albany and were disappointed with the service. That order took four  weeks to arrive. This year, even though Ticket Stack is based on the opposite side of the country, we received our tickets within just five business days! - Ned Collier",

I believe this completes the necessary paperwork for my loan application. If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to receiving your official approval of my application. Sincerely, Stefania Floras------------------------------------------- Revised Business Plan: Sole Assortment Section 1. PurposeRaleigh Street has become a vibrant district of eateries, shops, and entertainment venues. My business, Sole Assortment, will fill a very significant gap among the existing apparel shops and department stores. Sole Assortment will focus on women’s shoes and accessories. We are committed to offering high-quality footwear at affordable prices in a relaxing, customer-centered environment.  Section 2. Target MarketSole Assortment wilt serve women who work in the surrounding area. Because many office buildings are within walking distance, customers from the target market are likely to frequent the store during mid-day breaks and at the end of the business day. Weekend customers are those who come to the area for shopping, dining, and entertainment.  Section 3. Estimated TimelineThe grand opening is scheduled for May 10. The anticipated deadlines for each stage of the timeline are: February 2:  Sign lease and obtain business permit March 31:  Renovate space and install displays April 30: Post job announcements, complete interviews, and hire staff May 7:  Load inventory and prepare for opening   Section 4.

We feel that this merger will benefit both companies. Like us, Estefen specializes in commercial construction, and this merger will solidify our position at the forefront of the ever-growing Lexington City building trade. In addition, the creation of Trubridge Estefen will enable us to take on more complex development projects such as the Faust Center and the Hull Street Mall expansion. Members of each department will meet during the week of October 20 to discuss some of the logistical details of the merger, as well as the planned expansion and renovation of the Trubridge offices so they can effectively accommodate Estefens 113 employees. If you have questions you would like to see addressed during the meetings, please feel free to e-mail the meeting chairpersons in advance.

I am following up on our initial meeting about speakers and presenters. I get the impression that Timothy Primus, our first choice, may be out of our price range. However, I’ve been pursuing some funding in the form of government grants. If these resources come through, I'll try to secure Mr. Primus; otherwise, Laura Tambie may be a good option. In the meantime, I hope your efforts to recruit the other six panelists for the “Meet and Learn” session will be successful.

I plan to rent a 4-door vehicle, because I will be traveling with three colleagues and want to be mindful of their comfort At the same time, I am on a limited budget, so I intend to book the least expensive vehicle of this type. Before finalizing the booking, though, there are two pieces of information I would like to have, both of which 1 was unable to locate on your site. First, if I pick up the car at your branch m San Juan and drop it off at either  your Ponce or Aguadilla branch at the end of the rental period, will I be charged a drop-off fee? Second, I am unfamiliar with the roads and  the traffic on the island, so I would like to add navigation system to my order. Would that be possible? If so, how much would the weekly rate be? Thank you for your assistance. Magdalena Gutierrez",

Buckley CH7 2PLDear Ms. Whitfield: The Buckley Parks and Recreation Commission is once again planning the Brighter Buckley 10K Road Race, scheduled for 17 June. Your company's support last year helped us raise £25,000, which we applied to improving the roadways in our city. We hope you will help us reach this year's goal of £28,000. We will be using the proceeds to add playground areas to Buckley's parks. We have four sponsorship levels, or tiers, available. Tier 1 involves a contribution of £250 and gets your company logo on the back of every race T-shirt. The tier 2 sponsorship level is £500. For this we will also place your company name on the banners at the start and finish lines. For £1,000 (or tier 3), your logo will be displayed on all our flyers and local publication ads. And lastly, for £2,000 (tier 4), your company will get all three benefits noted previously plus a promotional tent at Coolidge Park, where the race begins. Please contact me by 15 February to indicate tier preference. For additional information on the event, visit www.buckley.gov.uk/parks/brighterbuckley. We thank you in advance for your continued support of Buckley community. Sincerely, Stephen L. Sciandra------------------------------------------------To: Ann O’ConnorFrom” Stephen SciandraDate: 13 FebruarySubject: Race updateAttachment: Allman Tinplate logo.jpgDear Ann, I just got a response from Allman Tinplate. Please add the attached image of its logo to our         T-shirt printing template. Also, Ms. Whitfield asked about the dimensions of the tent her company will have at Coolidge Park. I'm nearly certain Mr. Patel has that information. Can you find out for me? We've heard from most of the other sponsors. I will send you the final list on 16 February. In the meantime, could you request quotes from a few printing companies? We'll need approximately ten 2-by-4 metre banners, twenty B1-sized colour posters, 200 A4-sized black-and-white flyers. Thanks, Stephen",

The survey contains approximately twenty questions pertaining to employee satisfaction, including work atmosphere, benefits, facilities, and opportunities for advancement. Please take a few minutes to answer the attached questions and provide your honest feedback. Workstream Dynamics will not identify your responses by name, and your managers will not be able to view individual survey results. Please note, however, that the optional written comments on the final page of the survey will be collected in a single document and included in our report to Vimatrek management. If you wish to make a comment and would like to remain anonymous, please do not write anything that will identify you as an individual. Also, please do not forward the survey e-mail to a colleague, as each e-mail has a unique code to prevent multiple responses from a single person. If you have any questions or concerns, you can reply to this e-mail.

Yesterday, The Groveburry Gazette published a list entitled \"Top Places to Work in Groverburry,\" and Vimatrek was number 6 on the list! Two hundred companies were evaluated by a local company that looked at many businesses, and ten have been selected for the award. We are honored to be recognized - especially since these evaluations were based on an employee survey you completed several months ago. It's great to know that you enjoy working here, and we thank all of you for making Vimatrek such a great place to work. As you know, we will be launching an extensive recruiting campaign in the next quarter, so the award couldn't have come at a better time. With this recognition, we should have no problem hiring new staff members by the year's end. Amar KarimVimatrek Director of Marketing",

Normally, I try to resolve minor service issues within a day or two of receiving an e-mail request. I am sorry it has taken me so long to reply to you. I was busy all day yesterday because of a broken water pipe on the third floor. If you would like, I will have my electrician come by and repair your light and dishwasher this week. I can schedule him to visit on October 12 between the hours of 3 P.M. and 5 P.M., or on October 13 between the hours of 9 A.M. and 11 A.M. Please let me know as soon as possible which of these times is most convenient for you.

As it turns out, I managed to replace the lightbulb in the hallway on the same day I put in my request, and the light is working fine now.  The dishwasher still needs to be repaired, however. I would prefer that the electrician come on Thursday, October 12, since I am planning to fly to Vancouver for a conference the next day and wish to be present during the repair work. Thursday is quite convenient for me, as I will be working from home that day. Please let me know if the electrician is still available that afternoon. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Chef Julian Heeley from Forest Inn Restaurant is no longer able to attend and provide cooking demonstrations at the event. I have been asked to take his place. Yukiko and Adam will come along as my assistants. Ricardo has graciously volunteered to cover my shifts here at the restaurant next week. and Ravi will be filling in for Yukiko. Meiying has volunteered to work in place of Adam on Wednesday, June 5. However, Adam's shifts on Thursday and Friday are still not covered. Would someone be able to help out with this? Please let me know as soon as possible. We are excited about participating in the festival this year. It will give us a chance to show the expected thousands of attendees what Village Bistro has to offer. It will be a busy week for all of us, but it will be well worth the effortMany thanksMelanie",

Her appointment is effective October 1. The conference center, which completed its expansion and renovation in August, can accommodate much larger groups, and projects a significant increase in its bookings for the coming year. Ms. Bertelli has had extensive experience working with conference groups in the hospitality industry; she has been general manager of the Star Regency Hotel on Front Street for the past five years, and previously she served as the director of sales at the Kirkwood Expo Center in Brighton. --------------------------------  E-MAIL  To: Silvia Bertelli From: Chidi Okello Subject: Good news! Date: October 5Dear Ms. Bertelli: I was so pleased to learn of your recent appointment — it could not be better deserved. I had been meaning to contact you for some time now to thank you for your help when we needed last-minute hotel accommodations for some of our exhibitors. I am sure you will be just as dedicated in your new position. I am looking forward to seeing the expanded facilities at the conference center. Although our exhibit was a success, we were a bit cramped at the last Electronics Trade Show, and it was difficult to get around with the construction going on. I can’t believe everything was completed that same month! Our next show will be held at the conference center in April, and I hope I will see you then. With best wishes, Chidi OkelloPresident, Bryotech Corporation",

As you may also know, April is Contemporary Irish Writers Month. In honor of that, I’d like to create a display on the east wall of our store that showcases our staff’s  recommendations for books by Irish writers. I’d like each of you to choose a book you enjoyed reading and write a paragraph which gives a synopsis of the book and describes why you recommend it. Recommendations can be written on a form that is available in my office. The book you recommend should have been written by a writer who is currently living and writing here in Ireland. The book can be fiction or nonfiction and must have been published within the past five years. Your recommendation will be displayed next to copies of the book.  I know that all of you are avid readers. I’m looking forward to seeing our customers’ reactions to this display and to your knowledge and expertise. Please have recommendations written by 25 March.  Thank you.  JAMES  -------------------------------     Monahan Books Employee: Moira Dunn Recommended book: Home Fires Burning Author: Noel Black First-time novelist Noel Black brings us the story of Gabriel Moore, a successful Irish physician living in London, who returns to his native County Clare, Ireland, to care for his ailing father. Upon Gabriel's arrival, his father reveals something that could bring the already difficult relationship between father and son to its breaking point. Black explores family dynamics with a poignant reality unmatched by most contemporary writers. An added bonus is Black's cast of village characters who add charm and humor to a serious subject. The reader is also treated to beautiful descriptions of the lush landscapes that make County Clare unique. Home Fires Burning   is an entertaining read and is money well spent.",

It had been working very well up until last week, but now the coffee is much weaker than usual. I consulted the manual that came with the coffeemaker and followed the suggestions. First, I followed the directions on page 6 to confirm that the filter basket was inserted properly. Then, I checked that the strength setting was correct and that there was an appropriate quantity of coffee beans in the coffee-bean holder. However, the coffee still is not as strong as it should be. Is there anything else you can recommend before I send the machine in for repair? I have purchased several Brew Master coffeemakers over the years, and they have always lasted much longer than a year.Thank you.Lester Ang --------------------------------- E-mail  From: Technical  To: Lester Ang  Subject: Brew Master 400A  Date: July 13  Mr Ang,  Thank you for your detailed e-mail. It is helpful to know that you have already explored potential problem areas. Since you did not locate the source, I suspect that the chute for the ground coffee is dogged. This is the area that connects the grinder to the filter and is the part through which the freshly ground coffee beans enter the filter basket. To rectify the problem, you will need to remove the coffee-bean holder. Lift the cover from the chute and clean out any coffee grounds that might be stuck in there. Replace the chute cover and the coffee-bean holder, and your machine should be ready to brew coffee to the desired strength. It is helpful to clean the chute every six months. As a reminder, the warranty you purchased on this machine has almost expired. You have the option to extend  the warranty for another six months. You can do this online at www.brewmaster.com/warranty. Thank you for using a Brew Master coffeemaker. Timothy McNeilBrew Master Technical Service",

The following summary may provide useful information. • Red Ripe Tomatoes was the most highly rated in terms of taste, with 88% of respondents reporting that it was the best. We recommend pushing ahead with the development to expedite this product's launch. • Hillside Spices was by far the least favorite, with 77% of our respondents giving it a low rating. We recommend suspending development. • A majority of respondents reported being familiar with the Green Yard Foods brand. • Some respondents remarked that the labels on our new products are unattractive.

        "transcript": "Agri-Amb Fair Agri-Amb Fair is an agricultural trade show held every year for more than twenty years in Villars. Hundreds of exhibitors and thousands of visitors come to Villars to see the latest in agricultural technology, products, and services. Large indoor spaces inside four pavilions will again be open to exhibitors and visitors this year, with the fair running from August 20 through August 23. While the fair is not among the largest agricultural fairs in the area, it has the reputation of being a favorite among small and medium-sized businesses looking to showcase their products at reasonable expense. For many companies, being present here is a relatively modest investment with high returns in the form of contracts for future orders.Participation fees are competitive, considering the infrastructure provided at the venue. Forklift operators are available on site to carry the exhibitors' products around the pavilions at no charge. Heavy' equipment that does not fit onto a forklift can, for a small fee, be transported by a crane. Each exhibitor is guaranteed free power and water to each booth inside every pavilion. Also, this year, the organizers have introduced a loyalty discount for exhibitors who have showcased their products and services in the past. Returning exhibitors attending Agri-Amb will pay 15 percent less for their exposition space.    ------------------     From:organizer@agriambfair.org To:lijster@mariposti.comSubject:ConfirmationDate:April 17Dear Ms. Lijster, I am happy to confirm the booking of a booth for Mariposti Company at this year's Agri-Amb Fair, which will take place from August 20 to 23.

        "transcript": "MEMO From:Carmen Ortiz, BenefitsCoordinator To:All Employees Date:Wednesday, December 17 Subject:Work Leave Policy Starting with this year, employees who have been at the company for at least one year will be able to convert any leave days unused at the end of the year into a one-time cash payment. Previously, any unused leave was automatically applied to the next year. If you wish to have your leave days rolled over as before, you need to do nothing. If you wish to receive a cash payment, you will have to fill out a Leave Conversion form. Payments for unused leave days will be determined based on your salary. For example, if you have 5 days of unused leave at the end of the year, you will receive 2 percent of your annual salary; if you have 10 days of unused leave, you will receive 4 percent, and so on. Employees may convert a maximum of 15 days of unused leave; any days exceeding that amount will be rolled over to the next year as before. Please note that the policy allowing a maximum of 30 accumulated leave days is still in place.Only full-time, salaried employees are eligible to convert unused leave days. To apply for the benefit, please pick up a form from the benefits office. Completed forms must be received no later than Friday, January 5, Payments will be processed during the week of January 22. If you have any questions about the policy, please e-mail or call me at ext. 578.   ------------------     To:Carmen Ortiz From:Carlos Garcia Date:Tuesday, January 2 9:15 A.M.Subject:Converting Unused LeaveHi Carmen,I would like to take advantage of the new leave policy and convert my unused leave. I ended the year with 10 leave days for which I would like to receive a cash payment rather than keeping the time for this year. However, I’m working on a client site in Buffalo all week, and so I’m unable to come into the office before the end of the week. Could you please fax me the necessary materials at 716-555-0191 sometime today? I will fill them out as required and return them to you by the deadline at the end of the week. Thank you for your help.Thank you,Carlos Garcia",

        "transcript": "What's New in Vancouver this Week?ArtsVancouver’s Samburg Museum will feature a special exhibit of oil paintings by internationally acclaimed Swedish painter Oskar Hakala. Hakala, whose early work featured large-scale, scenic renderings of Swedish beaches, completed work last year on a collection entitled \"Mind’s Eye’’ that features uncharacteristic small canvases. Nature is still a theme, but the 25 works in “Mind’s Eye” take on that subject on a much smaller scale: the curve of a single stone, the algae collected in a battered piece of driftwood, or the ripples on a section of sand after a wave. Hakala says that his departure from larger works is a natural progression: “My recent work is not just about being an observer of nature. Instead, I want to show how we are all a small part of it.”The exhibit runs from August 12-22 in the Samburg Museum's North Gallery, 432 Caroline Avenue, Vancouver. Tickets are 10.00 dollars. Complimentary tickets are available to museum members. Call the museum at 604-555-0112 for more details.----------------BC Arts Focus August 15Hakala’s Latest Efforts UninspiredThat Oskar Hakala is a masterful painter is undeniable. I have spent many enjoyable hours studying his early work. Those paintings have a life of their own, and evolve into something new each time I see them. But with \"Mind's Eye,\" Hakala misses the mark. His characteristic wide, sure strokes of the brush are missing. The new works have a much lighter touch, giving the impression that he is not sure of himself as he ventures into new territory. More troubling is that this collection of work shows almost no difference in terms of theme from Anna Vestrom's paintings. Vestrom depicts the small elements in nature, but in a much truer fashion than Hakala does in his recent work. As a great fan of Hakala, I can only hope to see something more bold and sure from the artist the next time around.By Soren Lindgren",

Candidates for the award are selected from among companies that attract international tourists to Alaska.Okenobe's founder, Robin Paulino, notes that last year people from as far away as China and South Africa came to experience Okenobe's spectacular rafting trips down the rivers of Alaska. In its five years of operation, the company has built a growing base of satisfied customers looking for active vacations involving rafting, hiking and camping.Paulino has extensive experience as a guide, having worked for 16 years at Trivexa, a Juneau-based travel company and itself a one-time winner of the Best Travel Company Prize. Speaking about his previous job, Paulino notes: “Many people told me that the hiking trips I was guiding would be even more exciting if they involved travel on Alaska’s rivers and lakes.” Upon realizing that there is demand for this sort of travel, but that it is offered by only a few tour operators, Paulino decided to start his own company that would include water travel as part of all of its tours.Although Okenobe Adventure's signature offerings are trips with outdoor lodging at campsites scattered along the trip routes, the company has recently added a new program offering comfortable indoor lodging. “This way we’re offering the experience of rafting to people who may not necessarily want to spend cold nights in a tent,\" Paulino says.-----------------Experience the beauty of Alaska through the following trip programs offered by Okenobe Adventures:Glacier Trek is a seven-day vacation that featuers hiking through Alaska’s majestic wilderness, camping in tents, rafting in the Gulf of Alaska, and hiking up glaciers.Discovery Adventure is an eight-day trip with unforgettable wilderness experiences including hiking, rafting, boating and wildlife viewing. This trip features overnight lodging in charmingly furnished log cabins, each of which accommodates up to six people.Ultimate Expedition combines some of the activities offered in our Glacier Trek and Discovery Adventure programs into a two week-long adventure. Additionally, participants will hike through a mountain valley accessible only by bush plane, and stay in tents at a remote mountainside campground.Amazing Cruise offers four days of boating on the rivers and lakes of Alaska, salmon fishing, and enjoying fresh-caught fish around a campfire for dinner. On this trip, participants travel by boat only, and stay in tents set up alongside the rivers and lakes.",

The pavilion is located at the festival entrance on Doyle Road. The €5 registration fee required of all entrants will be donated to the Crennon Animal Care Society.  ------------------------- 6 JUNE - Julie Nam returned home on Saturday night doubly decorated. A native of Medford, she not only won a Crennon Day Festival race as a runner with no formal training but became the only person to win on a first attempt.Ms. Nam claims she is as surprised as anyone else. “I entered because my friends in Crennon encouraged me to, and because I thought it would be fim,” she said. “I certainly wasn’t expecting to win.”Ms. Nam defeated 73 competitors in a race that spanned eight kilometers, starting on Hopkins Street and ending with two full laps around Lake Mue. She attributes her success to a love of running fostered from a young age. 1[My siblings and I would always be racing each other when we were young,” Ms. Nam said. “Before we knew  it, we were running longer and longer distances in shorter and shorter times, and we’ve just kept with it ever since.”At the awards ceremony immediately following the event, Crennon  mayor Joseph Reilly recognized Ms. Nam for her double achievement.“One of the race organizers apparently realized the milestone and told Mayor Reilly just before the presentation of the awards,” Ms. Nam said. “I actually had no idea until he announced it, but I’m honored that he did.”",

        "transcript": "STEREO REVIEWSMALL WONDER MAKES BIG SOUNDby William Franklin After 30 years at Superior Sound Labs (SSL), legendary audio engineer John Anderson has left and started an independent firm, Anderson Associates, to sell his latest creation. The A2000 radio is only 5 centimeters talL but despite its small dimensions, it delivers excellent sound and usually gets very good reception. Mr, Anderson is best known as one of the engineers who invented the RX3 noise-reduction system.From the outside, the design of his new product is breathtakingly simple, The A2000 radio consists of two knobs and a speaker - the large knob is the tuning dial and the small one controls the volume. The A2000 sounds far better than anything else in its modest price range, i tested it against an expensive stereo system I own and was very surprised at how well its performance compared. My only complaints are that the radio comes only in white and that I had a little trouble picking up one of my favorite stations on the tuner. ----------------------- To: Editors of Stereo ReviewThank you for your positive review of our new product. I feel that the A2000 is designed for people who care more about how a radio sounds than how it looks. However, my business partners have convinced me that not everyone feels the way I do. Consequently, I would like to inform your readers that we will be releasing the A2000 in four decorator colors in time for the holidays this year.To improve FM reception, try moving the radio closer to a window or outside wall, plugging it into a different outlet, or moving around the power cord (which also functions as an antenna wire).By the way, your review contains one inaccuracy that l would like to take this opportunity to correct. I was an engineer employed by SSL at the time that RX3 was developed, but l was not involved with that project in any way.Sincerely,John AndersonPresident, Ariderson Associates",

Both Andrew Stevenson and I have experience with designing computer interfaces that allow users to browse articles on a CD. Using articles from the last three years, we have put together a small-scale sample presentation of what a World of Science archive could look like. If the idea is approved, we would be happy to create a comprehensive graphic interface for a large-scale version that includes all issues, starting from the first one put out nine years ago.Janet Tobin Graphic Division---------------From: dgerard@wosmag.com To: jtobin@wosmag.com Date: May 13Subject:  Re: Cumulative edition of World of Science Dear Ms. Tobin,This sounds like a good idea that is definitely worth implementing. You will be happy to learn that our editor in chief had been suggesting exactly the same thing and would be interested to see what you and Andrew have designed. I suggest we all meet tomorrow at 10:00 A.M. in room 12 so you can show us how it would work.In the meantime, do you think another year of World of Science would fit on the one CD? Next year, on Januaiy 12, we'll be celebrating ten years of our existence, and that would be an excellent opportunity to offer a larger archive to our subscribers.Warm regards,Dennis GerardAssistant to Editor in Chief",

The story of a young flight attendant who travels the world looking for a new city to call home, Flying High is based on the critically acclaimed novel written by Jee-Soo Chin.Flying High opened last year on November 15, starring theater legend Dolores Luna. The show has received excellent reviews over its six-month run, and there has been some debate over whether replacing Ms. Luna would affect the show’s popularity. Ms. Luna left the show last month to prepare to take the lead role in the upcoming production of Forget.Ms.James is best known for her role on the popular television show The Becker Family and for her role in the film Lighthouse, for which she received the Winston Actors Award last year for Best Leading Actress.In a recent interview with a reporter from Carter City Magazine, Ms. James spoke in detail about her adjustment to the theater world. “So far this has been a great learning experience for me,” said Ms. James, “It’s certainly very different from what I’m used to, and it took some time to get adjusted to performing in front of a live audience instead of a camera; if s something I would certainly like to pursue further.”Last night, the Flying High audience was packed with a crowd of celebrities, including many of Ms. James5 television and film costars.Flying High is scheduled to run until December 30.

I’m happy to say that the unit is still available for the dates in July that you have requested.As I said in the advertisement that you saw in last week’s Province News Times, the rental costs $ 1,000 per week. Therefore, it would be $2;000 for the two-week period that you proposed. I also require a $400 security deposit to cover any potential damage to the property during your stay. This amount will be returned to you after your vacation as long as everything in the apartment remains in good condition.Just to clarify, this furnished unit has an updated kitchen with all necessary appliances and equipment to meet your cooking needs. Per your request, I have also attached a number of photographs to this e-mail so that you can get a better sense of the available amenities.Please send me an e-mail by tomorrow at 12 noon to confirm that you would like to rent the apartment. Then, please write a check to my name for the full amount ($2,400) and send it to: 601 Beach Walk Avenue, Carlton City, VA 06698.Sincerely, Charles Roberts---------------To: Charles RobertsFrom:  Thomas WhitmanDate:August 3Re: Thank youDear Mr. Roberts,I just wanted to thank you again for the use of your apartment and to let you know that I just received your note and the enclosed check. I’m glad you found everything in the apartment to be in good condition. I really appreciate that you returned my deposit so quickly.My family and I had a wonderful time and are fortunate to have found such a wonderful rental on such short notice. It was great to have the beach located so close. The views from the balcony were superb. We had never traveled to Carlton City before, and were impressed by how many restaurants and shops were all within walking distance.In fact, we enjoyed our stay so much that we are already trying to plan a return trip to Carlton City. Please let me know if you are renting the unit again next summer. If so, we’d love to go ahead and reserve it for three weeks.Kind regards,Thomas Whitman",

        "transcript": "Desparte Systems to Open New Data Centersby Cheryl WittenauerMONTREAL-Desparte Systems, a diversified manufacturing and distributing company, has announced plans to build a 2,800-square-meter data center in Montreal as part of its effort to reorganize its global business operations, In addition, other data centers will be built in Dallas, Brussels, and Bangalore. Currently, Desparte1 s two largest data centers are in London and Chicago, in facilities owned by other companies. Desparte plans to close smaller centers in Seattle and Mumbai.Desparte vice president for operations Elena Fontaine said the changes will enhance business efficiency and improve productivity. She stressed that Desparte personnel will face minimal job loss as a result of the changes because the data centers, which are essentially large rooms customized to house computer servers, employ relatively few people. Fontaine said that the new centers will be more secure and also more energy- efficient. The transition is expected to take place over the next two years.The new Montreal site will serve as the central location for the company’s operations. The Montreal and Dallas centers will be built first at a combined cost of approximately C$35 million. The company will lease a facility in Montreal next year while construction of the permanent center takes place.----------------Desparte Systems December 2Simon Stevens, Editor Global Business Magazine 1500 Weston Ave.Dallas, TX 75208Deal Mr. Stevens:I am writing in regard to Cheryl Wittenauer's article on Desparte Systems in the November 30 issue of Global Business Magazine. While I appreciate the coverage we received by your magazine, I want to call your attention to a few inaccuracies. First, we will only be closing one of our active data centers.

According to a Jupiter Corporation spokesperson, sales of other cars produced by Jupiter Corporation are also at an all-time high. Jupiter expects the new factory will be able to meet consumer demand without any difficulty. The plant is anticipated to be in operation by late June, and the grand opening celebration is scheduled for July 5,---------------To: Ja-Hoon Lee (ihlee @ iupiterco.com)From: Robin Bertolli (rbertolli@iupiterco,com)Date: March 17Subject: Press releaseDear Ja-Hoon,I just read the press release, and I wanted to let you know that you’re doing an excellent job as spokesperson for the company.We’re almost ready to start our advertising campaign in South America. The tentative schedule for the campaign hasn't changed very much, but I would like to brief you on the plan before your next press conference. I’ll send you the documents later this week. Also, I’ll be in Rio de Janeiro for the next few months, so e-mail is probably the fastest way for us to communicate with each other after I get there. I look forward to seeing you in Daejeon for the grand opening.Sincerely,Robin",

I am usually satisfied with the accommodations and services. However, this particular time I was charged three times for poolside snacks that I did not order. In fact, I did not eat at the hotel at all during my stay; I only ate at Bai Makrut and Cafe Galanga, which are both restaurants outside of the hotel. Ipointed this out to the desk clerk, and the situation was quickly resolved.As for my voucher, Iwould like to ask if the coupon will be valid at your future location.

I was traveling from Milan to Gatwick Airport on Jetline flight JT23 on May 14, and on picking up my suitcase from the baggage claim at Gatwick, I found that the latch was badly damaged and the handle had become detached from the suitcase on one side. I reported this to the Jetline office at Gatwick and completed a property-irregularity form.I have had the suitcase looked at by a local luggage retailer, Simpsons Limited, to see if they could repair it. They feel that they can only partially repair it (enclosed is a copy of their estimate), and they would suggest a replacement. I would therefore be pleased if you could reimburse me for the cost of a new suitcase as indicated in Simpsons1 estimate. Due to the amount of damage to the suitcase, I was unable to travel from the airport by public transport as planned and had to take a taxi. I would also ask you to reimburse me for the taxi fare, which was £45.00.Yours sincerely,Richard Turner------------------- Simpsons Limited: Retailers of Quality Luggage43 High Street, Ayresford W48RTTel: 01203 431796Estimate of Repair Date; May 17Item to be repaired: Large dark green cloth suitcase manufactured by Crossleys, Ltd. Nature of repair: Replace damaged latch, reattach handle Estimated cost: £20.00 (but see note below)Notes: Although the latch can be replaced, it will not be possible to reattach the handle securely (damage to handle attachment on suitcase body). The cost to replace it with a similar model is £105.00 (Dixons executive suitcase, model X23).",

Toss together celery, apple, and dressing.Total preparation time: 5 minutes Serves 8 as a side dish.--------------To: Editors of Eat Right MagazineAs a long-time subscriber to Eat Right Magazine, I have frequently sampled your recipes and must credit you with some excellent results. Your recent April-May issue was, as always, packed with healthy, delicious meals, many of which I have already prepared at home.Several days ago, however, I attempted to make the apple and celery salad from the recipe on page 57 of the magazine in the Healthy, Quick, and Easy section. While the salad was flavorful, I was not satisfied with the recipe for two reasons. First, it should be noted that a salad containing 100ml of mayonnaise, to be divided among eight servings, is not particularly healthy. I was surprised to find a recipe with so much mayonnaise in an Eat Right recipe. Second, while the directions suggested that five minutes' preparation time was sufficient, I found the time to be underestimated by quite a bit. Finely slicing so much celery and so many apples was quite time consuming and certainly took longer than five minutes. You might adjust this assessment when you publish this recipe in the future.I look forward to receiving the next issue of Eat Right Magazine, and I hope that it will contain more of the simple, nutritious recipes that I have come to expect.Sincerely,Francesca Bertolini.",

After trying it on, T realized that the shirt is too large for me, so I would like to exchange it for a size medium shirt. However, my work requires that T move abroad for an extended period of time; I am scheduled to leave on the evening of February 27.1 sent the shirt to you by regular mail today. Will my exchange be processed in time for me to receive the new shirt at my current address? If not, would I be required to pay additional charges for having the shirt sent to my new location in Paris, France? In that case, I would like to request a refund.Thank you for your help.Alain Bisset",

According to the results of factory testing, the rubber used in the tires with which this batch was fitted is subject to premature  wear . This in turn may cause tires to leak air. Grand Vista bicycles produced in batch 34199 qualify for free tire replacement, to be performed at the dealer where the purchase was made. The majority of bicycles from batch 34199 were sold at Ellenbroek Sports locations, with a few hundred being sold through other dealers. To determine whether a Grand Vista is eligible under this recall, simply look for the batch number imprinted on the underside of the frame near the seat. Customers should contact the dealer immediately to schedule the replacement. For further information on the recall program, contact the Zorynth Cycle hotline at 1 (800) 555-0181 or visit the company Web site at www.20rynthcyde.com.  ----------------------------------------------------  @PS@/kstoeic/images/8992710_1485065638384.png@PE@",

My confirmation number is 341A7T. I need to make a few revisions to my order, and I’m hoping is it not too late to do so. Unfortunately, I mixed up the quantities for items 103 and 104. I should have requested 20 wide paintbrushes and 30 narrow paintbrushes. Finally, I’d like to order an additional five packs of item 164. I was originally planning to pick up my order my tomorrow. April 8, however I realize that you probably need time to correct my order. Would I be able to pick up the morning of April 9 instead? I am scheduled to start a large job that the same day,  and I will need the sandpaper and the painting tape in order to begin. If for  any reason the whole order is not available that soon, perhaps I could at least pick up those two items. I appreciate your assistance.  John Mellon",

Date: September 25Attention all managers: Thank you for your diligent efforts in tracking the travel expenses of the employees you supervise. As you know, we only began this practice in the last year. The decision was made as the company began to expand beyond a size where reimbursement could be managed informally. We are implementing the following changes and ask that you communicate them to your department. First, it has come to our attention that many employees do not feel that the current daily amount allowed for food expenses is enough. We are going to increase this allowance to $50 a day beginning on October 1. Second, we wish to trim expenses by requiring that employees make advance copies here at the office of any paperwork they will need while on business trips. When employees use commercial vendors to make copies, it tends to cost the company more than is necessary. As of November 1, we ask that you not approve any such expenses. Thank you for your assistance in this matter. Lance ShellyVice President, Accounting. -----------------------------------@PS@/kstoeic/images/3838662_1485065641106.png@PE@",

This would be on August 31 at 2:00 P.M. at the Hotel Danube, where the conference will be held. The Preservation Society is impressed by your leadership in the recent restoration of the Opera Towers in your city. Your commitment to preserving the architectural elements of such an important landmark is a shining example of the best efforts preservationists strive to put forth. I am certain that conference attendees from around the world will be very interested in the processes and methods you used to bring the towers back to their original seventeenth-century splendor. We hope you will consider speaking at the conference. Please contact me at +43-8664¬42332 or by e-mail at jbaumgarten@goetzuniversity.ac.at. Sincerely, Jutta Baumtgarten --------------------------------- E-mail Message  From: Adriana Novakova To: Jutta Baumgarten Subject: Your letter Date: February 5Dear Dr. Baumgarten, 1 was thrilled to receive your letter and to hear that my work is well regarded, especially by such an esteemed organization as yours. Of course, 1 would be honored to be a part of the conference and will be happy to talk about a subject that is so important to me, the restoration of the Opera Towers. I do have a conflict, however, on day one of the conference. I have an important appointment with a grant-giving foundation that afternoon, which is of great importance to my next project, the restoration of a historic school building in Potsdam. Would it be possible for me to speak some time during the second or third day of the conference? Perhaps I could give the closing address. I’d very much like to participate. Please let me know if this would work. Sincerely, Adriana Novakova",

The apartment is on the 3rd floor of a large complex located near a hike and bike trail, the South Congress business district, and Zilker Park. It will be available from mid-March, and my current lease runs through the end of June. You will lease directly from the apartment management company. If you decide to stay in the apartment after June, you will be required to sign another year’s contract. If you decide to move, you will need to give the management company a month’s notice. I am currently paying $807 per month, so this rate is locked in until the end of June, after which it might change. Please e-mail me at the address below if you are interested. Mike Kelley mkelley@litmil.com  -------------------To: mkelley@limit.com  From: mtomita@renmac.com  Date: February 3  Subject: Austin apartment  Dear Mr. Kelley  I  have recently accepted a Job in Austin. and 1 may be interested in leasing your apartment. I currently live in Dallas, but I’ll be visiting Austin this weekend and am wondering whether I could see the apartment on Saturday or Sunday. Also, would you be able to recommend nearby hotels that have weekly rates? I will be moving at the end of February and may need a place to stay for a few weeks before I move in. Your apartment sounds like it would suit my needs well. I am familiar with Austin and especially like the area in which the apartment is located. It is also close to my new office.   Thank you. I look forward to hearing from you.  Mariko Tomita",

For the last year I have been a graphic designer for a local accounting firm, where I am responsible for designing the company's Web site and for producing online and paper advertisements. Before that I was employed for three years as a staff photographer at one of the region's top newspapers, Coastal News. I believe that my experience with visual media and communications makes me well suited for the advertised job developing logos and drawings targeted at specific consumer groups.I have enclosed a copy of my resume, which includes links to Web sites that display advertisements I have designed. I would be happy to provide you with a list of references as well. It has long been my wish to work in the advertising industry, so I hope you will give my application every consideration.Sincerely,Riyo Mori    ------------------   August 20Riyo Mori 65 Plymouth Road Stamford, CTDear Ms. Mori:Thank you for your interest in working for our company. The selection committee read your application with great interest, and we were very impressed with the look and artistry of your company’s Web site. Unfortunately, we are looking for someone with at least three years’ experience in graphic design, and so we cannot consider you for the job you applied for. However, we were particularly interested in the work that you had done previously with Coastal News, and we think you might be an excellent fit for a job in our media department that we expect will start within the next six months. If you have any examples of your work from your time from that earlier period . Please mail them to me sometime next week and I will contact you to discuss a possible interview at our offices.Jeremiah Bradley Director of Human Resources",

Would it be possible for me to switch assignments with Daniel Newman? I used to work in the marketing department at Frampton Clothes, and I feel that my experience would allow me to make a unique contribution to their project. I thought switching with Daniel might be feasible because, as you know, we both work in the same two languages.Let me know what you think. If you would like to speak with me in person, I will be available between 2:00 P.M. and 4:00 P.M. today.Thank you,Marie",

        "transcript": "STEREO REVIEWSMALL WONDER MAKES BIG SOUNDby William Franklin After 30 years at Superior Sound Labs (SSL), legendary audio engineer John Anderson has left and started an independent firm, Anderson Associates, to sell his latest creation. The A2000 radio is only 5 centimeters talL but despite its small dimensions, it delivers excellent sound and usually gets very good reception. Mr, Anderson is best known as one of the engineers who invented the RX3 noise-reduction system.From the outside, the design of his new product is breathtakingly simple, The A2000 radio consists of two knobs and a speaker - the large knob is the tuning dial and the small one controls the volume. The A2000 sounds far better than anything else in its modest price range, i tested it against an expensive stereo system I own and was very surprised at how well its performance compared. My only complaints are that the radio comes only in white and that I had a little trouble picking up one of my favorite stations on the tuner. ----------------------- To: Editors of Stereo ReviewThank you for your positive review of our new product. I feel that the A2000 is designed for people who care more about how a radio sounds than how it looks. However, my business partners have convinced me that not everyone feels the way I do. Consequently, I would like to inform your readers that we will be releasing the A2000 in four decorator colors in time for the holidays this year.To improve FM reception, try moving the radio closer to a window or outside wall, plugging it into a different outlet, or moving around the power cord (which also functions as an antenna wire).By the way, your review contains one inaccuracy that l would like to take this opportunity to correct. I was an engineer employed by SSL at the time that RX3 was developed, but l was not involved with that project in any way.Sincerely,John AndersonPresident, Ariderson Associates",

Currently, Desparte1 s two largest data centers are in London and Chicago, in facilities owned by other companies. Desparte plans to close smaller centers in Seattle and Mumbai.Desparte vice president for operations Elena Fontaine said the changes will enhance business efficiency and improve productivity. She stressed that Desparte personnel will face minimal job loss as a result of the changes because the data centers, which are essentially large rooms customized to house computer servers, employ relatively few people. Fontaine said that the new centers will be more secure and also more energy- efficient. The transition is expected to take place over the next two years.The new Montreal site will serve as the central location for the company’s operations. The Montreal and Dallas centers will be built first at a combined cost of approximately C$35 million. The company will lease a facility in Montreal next year while construction of the permanent center takes place.----------------Desparte Systems December 2Simon Stevens, Editor Global Business Magazine 1500 Weston Ave.Dallas, TX 75208Deal Mr. Stevens:I am writing in regard to Cheryl Wittenauer's article on Desparte Systems in the November 30 issue of Global Business Magazine. While I appreciate the coverage we received by your magazine, I want to call your attention to a few inaccuracies. First, we will only be closing one of our active data centers. The Mumbai center will remain open and will focus on running quality-control checks. Second, the centers in Montreal and Bangalore will be built first; the site in Dallas has not yet been officially scheduled for construction.I would appreciate it if you would print these corrections in an upcoming issue of your magazine. If you have any questions, please call me directly at 450-555-0054.Sincerely,Martin Gervais, Director of Public Relations Desparte Systems",

        "transcript": "Note: This is an abridged version of a survey report commissioned by Hesky Foods Company on June 15.The purpose of this survey was to find out the reasons behind the purchasing decisions concerning four selected Hesky products- The study was conducted on July 2 in twelve supermarkets from the Fontes, BuyWay, KTS? and MaxiDome chains. This report summarizes the results obtained during the initial survey; the study will be repeated on August 2 (results analysis due August 4).The appended table shows the percentages of purchase reasons given by customers who had just purchased the products in question. For example, 42% of those who bought Portalegre iced coffee did so for reasons of quality.Results and SuggestionsGenerally, the results show that Hesky Foods products are recognized for their quality, as attested by ratings consistently above 40%. Only one product (the fruit juice) scored 10% in this respect, but as a newly launched item, its reputation among customers is not yet established.Only 3% of subjects indicated the TV commercial as a reason for buying Icy Waterfalls mineral water； this figure is reasonable for a product whose TV commercial was last aired more than five months ago. However, it must be strewed that this figure is based only on Fontes, BuyWay, and MaxiDome customers because KTS is not currently carrying this brand.Although 20% were satisfied with the price of Alpinissimo at die supermarkets and 46% considered the quality to be very high, many other customers felt they were being overcharged- It seems sales of this product will not improve much unless the price is lowered, which would be preferable to designing new advertising.  ----------------------------  @PS@/kstoeic/images/3185496_1484793095552.png@PE@",

We may not be able to access it if there is no one at your home to let us in. Weather conditions sometimes make it unsafe for meter readers to do their job. And meters do occasionally malfunction, making an accurate reading impossible.When your meter is not actually read, you will receive an estimated bill. The estimate is based on weather trends and how much energy you have used in the past. When we are unable to get an actual meter reading, you will see the word “estimated” printed next to the meter reading on your bill.Estimates can be avoided if you send us a reading that you have taken yourself. Here are two ways to help prevent an estimated bill.Call us with your meter reading at 1-800-555-1991. The best time to call is one day before your scheduled meter-reading day. (Your meter-reading date appears on page one of your Newtown Gas Company bill.)Go to our Web site at www.newtowngasco.com/meter to send us your meter reading. Send your reading at least one day before your scheduled meter-reading day.If you use either of these two methods to provide us with your reading, you will see the words “customer reading\" next to the reading on your bill. If your meter readings have been estimated for four straight months, you must call us with your meter reading.@PS@/kstoeic/images/3376229_1484793092713.png@PE@",

Chairman of the Board of Randolph Chemical, said? \"We are delighted to have found someone of Michelle’s caliber to lead our organization.”Michelle Brown brings to the table a reputation as a strict cost cutter. Prior to joining Randolph, Dr. Brown was CEO of Popovich Materials 7 where she reduced expenses by almost a third in her four-year tenure- Dr. Brown has a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Wyler College and a Pb.D. in analytical chemistry from Porter University.Industry analysts remain skeptical that she can turn around the company’s ailing fortunes. After her selection was announced^ company stock dropped 1.2 percent in one afternoon.Randolph Chemical is a global technology-based company that manufactures and distributes plastics, chemicals, and agricultural products. Their search, which took eleven months 7 was conducted with the aid of Darren Consulting.------------------ Memorandum from:  Michelle Brown TO:  All Randolph Chemical employeesAs you have probably heard, I will be assuming responsibility for \"leading Randolph Chemical effective Monday morning. I want to take a moment to reaffirm the commitment of Randolph Chemical and of myself as its new head to treating every single employee with the fairness and dignity that he or she deserves.In the months to come I will be initiating steps to sell off those portions of our business In which we do not have the potential to become Industry leaders, leaving us to focus on what we do best. Due to time constraints, we will not be commissioning a new study of all of our holdings. Instead, we will base decisions on current in- house performance figures derived from our ongoing review process.This Is the beginning of a long journey for al1 of us, one I am proud to say we wi11 make together. I hope to meet as many of you as possible personally, and I urge you to become fully engaged In the process and to contribute your own ideas.",

I am contacting you because I am interested in receiving regular shipments of fresh, organic vegetables to my restaurant weekly. My restaurant is just starting, so I do not need a large quantity of goods. After looking into different farms in the area, I chose to contact Bountiful Harvest because of your promise to deliver certified organic food. Therefore, I would like to receive a price estimate for the cost of having fresh vegetables delivered directly to our restaurant on a weekly basis.

Indira Singh===========================To: Bountiful Harvest From: Emily Hall  Date: June 5Subject: Harvest ScheduleDear Ms. Singh, Thank you for responding so promptly to my email. I appreciate the offer of the complimentary delivery, but I think I would like to just go ahead and set up regular deliveries. I may be interested in setting up a year’s worth of deliveries, but I would first like to get a list of the range of produce that you will be offering through the different seasons. As I own a vegetarian restaurant, I will need to have an idea of the types of produce that will be delivered so I can prepare my menus accordingly. Thank you so much for your consideration, and I look forward to working with Bountiful Harvest! Kind regards, Emily Hall",

Restaurant Owner: Greg Kluck Inspector: Melissa Tenner===========================  MEMOTo:All Employees From:Greg Kluck Subject:Inspection ResultsDate: January 25Dear employees, The results from our recent inspection on January 22 indicate that there are a few problems that we need to address. First, it was brought to my attention that fire exit signs need to be installed again. The most serious violation concerned the improper storage and labeling of food. All ingredients stored for later use must be labeled with an exact date and detailed contents. If we do not label containers properly, spoiled food could accidently be served to customers. We received relatively low grades for employee hygiene and the cleanliness of our facilities. All employees are required to wear their uniform and hairnet at all times and wash their hands after every bathroom visit. We also need to mop floors more often and keep them dry. In order to correct these poor situations, I will be posting a checklist that all employees will be required to complete every morning. It will include necessary preparations to ensure that we are not breaking any regulations. This measure will go into effect on January 29. If you have any questions about these changes, please bring them up at the staff meeting tomorrow. ===========================  NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEESThe checklist below must be signed by every employee on every day that they have a shift  at Polito’s Pizza. Only sign the task once it has been completed or checked. Failure to fill out the checklist with the date, time, and signature will be treated as a violation of Polito’s  new health standards.POLITO’S CHECKLIST      Polito’s     Sun    Mon    Tue    Wen    Thu    Fri    Sat     Rotate Food   K.P.

I noticed that the library recently built the Media Lab with funds raised by library patrons. I was hoping to change classrooms in order to use my new educational resources by integrating computers into my English conversation class. Could you please reschedule my class to be provided in the same classroom as Never Too Late to Learn instead of the Education Center? I think my students will appreciate the practical English skills they can learn on computers. Also, could you please send an e-mail to all of the students who have signed up for the class? They will need to be informed about the room change. Thank you in advance for your assistance, Linda Carter===========================To: Linda Carter    From: Richard White  Date: April 2 Subject: Room ChangeDear Ms. Carter,  I would be happy to move your Beginners English Conversation course to the classroom with the updated media lab; for your reference, this is room 3A. Unfortunately, I do not have the emails for all of the students who signed up for your course. Many students only provided their names. I could post a sign at the entrance to the library advertising your course and make a note of the room change, if that would be acceptable for you. Please let me know if you would like me to do this. Thank you and all the best, Richard WhiteLibrary Projects Coordinator",

Because we went over budget last year on employee appreciation events, I think it would be wise to find more affordable recreational activities. Attached is a breakdown of projected expenses for summer events that I have planned. July 6: Anchorage Flower FestivalJuly 22: Art in the Park at Lawrence ParkAugust 6: Bicycle Tours of the Anchorage CountrysideAugust 19: Horseback Riding at Sweet Meadow RanchI have scheduled fewer outdoor activities this year compared to last year. This year I would like to take advantage of a new outdoor recreational opportunity that I read about on the Anchorage Reporter website. You can read the article by clicking on this link:  www.anchoragereporter.com/new_trails. Please let me know your opinion, Suzie MasonHuman Resources Manager===========================Anchorage ReporterBike Tours of the Anchorage Countryside to Start August 6 May 2—The Anchorage Bike Club will be hosting an annual bike riding event this summer, beginning on August 6 and running through August 7. The event will start at 10:00 A.M. on both days at the Anchorage Community Center. If you are driving a vehicle to the starting point, it would be better to use the parking lot behind the community center. Anchorage Bike Club President Jean Frost stated, “The rides will range from 5 to 20 miles and will take bikers through scenic areas in Anchorage. Overall, the bike tours will go ahead at a leisurely pace so that bikers of all skill levels can participate. However, local bikers with ample experience might lead a faster-paced group.” Bikers in the tours will learn about riding techniques, bicycle maintenance, and proper nutrition half an hour before the event starts. All participants must have biking helmets on. They are also encouraged to bring their own water to prevent dehydration while biking. ========================== BICYCLE TOUR SIGN-UP SHEET  If you intend to participate in the August 6 bicycle tour, please write down your name, department, and level of experience or fitness. If we have enough people sign up as advanced, we can coordinate two separate tours. If there are not enough for two tours, we would like to encourage all riders to stay together so that everyone can join in the team building exercises we have planned. Thank you for your participation and we look forward to seeing everyone at the event!

However, I would like to inquire about extending my stay for an extra night. I recently heard that there will be a local food festival held on October 16 and I would like to attend it. Therefore, I would like to stay at your hotel until October 15. Please let me know a revised room fee so that I can make the correct payment as soon as possible. Jake Baldwin ===================================To: Jake Baldwin From:Amy Lee Date: September 24Subject: The 15th  Dear Mr. Baldwin, You are right to be excited about the food festival that will be held on the October 16th. Unfortunately, this event has become so popular that the city fills up for that weekend. I regret to inform you that there is no vacancy at the Dream Oasis Hotel for the night of the 15th. I went ahead and looked into some of our partner hotels in the area, but those properties also are at full occupancy I do hope you are able to find someplace to stay in the city so you can enjoy the festival while you are in town; I just wish it could have been with us. You could try the Executive Inn in Fairview; it is a large hotel and they do have vacancies. Sincere apologies, Amy LeeCustomer Service Manager Dream Oasis Hotel",

I am currently scouting for a warehouse in the Pittsburg area. As you know, having an effective distribution strategy is critical for every company in today’s fast-paced business world. Therefore, I am looking for a warehouse located in the outskirts of Pittsburg. The warehouse needs to be located close to the highway. We are shipping a high volume of products, so we would prefer a dedicated warehouse to be used exclusively for Turner Electronics operations. A warehouse with a spacious loading bay for large trucks is necessary. Additionally, a warehouse that also has office space would be ideal. Because of the valuable nature of our products, we would like a warehouse that provides precautions against theft and damage. I look forward to hearing your response soon. Steven Mason Turner Electronics============================To: Steven Mason From: Kevin Scott Date: February 3Subject:  Re: A warehouseDear Mr. Mason, It seems that as your company expands, you would like to improve the operations of your distribution network and deliver products to sellers more quickly. We have a variety of warehouse options, and I trust one of them will fit your company’s needs. All locations have a state-of-the-art security system as well as experienced staff. Location 1 —$3,499 per month for a 10,000-square-foot warehouse space shared by multiple businesses. Because this location is a shared operations site, we offer it at a discounted price. Location 2—$5,500 per month for an older warehouse located in downtown Pittsburg. This warehouse is currently empty, and therefore can be used by your company exclusively. It also features a walk-in freezer. Location 3—$6,500 per month for a very spacious warehouse located a few miles outside of Pittsburg. Although currently used by two other businesses as a storage space, it can be converted into a warehouse only for your company. Location 4—$2,600 per month for a medium-size warehouse. This warehouse is provided at a discounted price because it has no area for trucks to unload cargo conveniently. It is best for smaller-sized operations. These are the locations currently available for use. If you have any questions or would like to visit a location in person, please contact me. Kevin Scott===========================To: Kevin Scott From: Steven Mason  Date: February 3 Subject: Location 3Dear Mr. Scott, Thank you so much for responding to my inquiry so quickly. Although none of the warehouses is exactly what I was looking for, I think the best option for our business will be Location 3. This, of course, is contingent on the other two businesses moving their storage into another warehouse. Our operations, as I noted in my first e-mail, are expanding, and I want to make sure that we have ample room to grow. I am delighted that there is security at your warehouses as well. I have some time early next week if it would be possible to take a walk through Location 3. I think once I get a feel for the space, I will be able to make a firm decision. Please contact me by phone at your convenience so we can set up a time. You can reach me at (351) 546-9899. All the best, Steve Mason Turner Electronics",

        "transcript": "Mr. John Morris 1423 Bernard Avenue Millville, CA 90117Dear Mr. Morris, 24/7 Fitness is the most successful workout facility in the United States. With over 3 million members nationwide, our franchise has become known as a reputable and trustworthy brand. Our success is a result of great relationships between US the franchiser and our franchisees. You are receiving this mailing because you expressed interest in partnering with 24/7 Fitness in order to open a new location in your town. According to our preliminary research, your town has a large population of young, single people working in the professional field. This is our target demographic, and it means the business outlook for your 24/7 Fitness location is positive in your town. If you would like more information about the specific terms and regulations when partnering with 24/7 Fitness, please don't hesitate to call me at 347-555-3363. Additionally, if you would like to talk to another franchise owner, that information can be supplied by one of our associates. Sincerely, Lori SwansonChief Operating Officer==========================To: Zack Carter From: John Morris Subject:  24/7 FitnessDate: March 6Dear Mr. Carter, My name is John Morris and I am a small business owner living in the Millville area. I am currently in negotiations with 24/7 Fitness to open my own location here in Millville. As someone who works with 24/7 Fitness, you would help me a lot by sharing your opinions. I am interested in how you assess 24/7 Fitness as a franchiser. I operated several franchises in the past, and I always found that trust and honesty are the most important factors in a successful relationship. More importantly, I was also wondering what kind of support is provided by the parent company. Before opening your location, did you receive adequate training to allow you to smoothly begin operating your business? Any advice you can give me would be much appreciated. Sincerely, John Morris===========================To: John Morris From: Zack Carter Subject: 24/7 FitnessDate: March 7Dear Mr. Morris, I am happy to provide some insight into the operation of a 24/7 Fitness franchise. I have been working with 24/7 Fitness as a franchise owner for 10 years now. I actually run three different branches now. I completely agree with you that trust and honesty are the two most important aspects of any business relationship. On that count, I believe the fact that I own three franchises is testament to my faith in the franchiser. Let me put your mind at ease. First off, 24/7 Fitness has a very specific way that they want their brand to develop no matter who owns the branch. The parent company will not only provide training, but they insist on controlling the actual layout of the facilities from the locker rooms to the free weights. They want any of their 3 million members to be able to walk into any one of their gyms and feel at home. Until you have been operating for one full year, you must make monthly reports to corporate headquarters detailing all aspects of sales, membership, and a flow chart describing the usage of the facilities. It really is hands on until they have confidence you can represent the brand. I hope this helps you decide to join the 24/7 Fitness team! All the best, Zack Carter",

        "transcript": "April 5—Clearwater Hospital in downtown Scranton has launched a new pen pal letter-writing program between terminally ill hospital patients and adult volunteers. Hospital Director Zack Chambers, who was recently presented with an Outstanding Leader Award from the National Health Care Alliance, started the program to create stronger connections between the hospital and the community. Mr. Chambers encourages adults of all types and occupations to apply even if they don’t feel completely qualified. Simply visit the Clearwater Hospital website and become a member of the hospital free of charge. “I hope through this program, volunteers can form close relationships with patients to help them get through these difficult times in their lives,” said Mr. Chambers. He also hopes that the program will lead to more people visiting terminally ill patients in person. ==========================Clearwater HospitalMay 4Monica Greene4100 Washington RoadScranton, Wisconsin 54481Dear Ms. Greene, I was delighted to receive your letter. I am very excited to have been paired with you as pen pals. I hope we can learn a lot from each other and build a lasting friendship. As you know, I live in California, which is a long way from Wisconsin. I hope that in the coming months I can find some time off work and visit you. Please let me know when the most convenient time would be for me to meet you. I look forward to hearing from you, Jessica Wright===========================Dear Jessica, You don’t know how much I appreciate your kind words. Although the staff at Clearwater are very kind, I feel the need to connect with people who are not part of the staff. My surviving family also live a great distance away, in Florida, and so most of the time I am just communicating with the paid staff or the other patients. I would welcome a visit, if you truly wanted to come, and the best time would be for our meeting is the Thanksgiving holiday party here at the center I suppose. My own family might be here as well. If it is too much for you, or if you can’t get the time off of work, don’t worry about it too much. I do hope that we can continue to communicate through our letters. All the best, Monica Greene",

Subject:First Quarter BudgetAttachment: Q1_BudgetDear Ms. Ross, I have attached the current draft for the company’s budget for the first quarter of next year. As you will notice, all of the profits made from this year’s back-to-school sale are planned to be spent on billboard advertisements on the main highways. I will call a design team later this afternoon and ask them to create eye-catching images for the advertisement. At our last meeting, you mentioned that you would like to review the budget before it is finalized. I have already included employee raises in the first quarter’s expenses, but if you can think of anything else, please let me know. I would like to have the budget finalized before next week’s planning meeting.

Just prior to receiving your e-mail, I received an estimate for our planned website development. It looks like it is going to be more expensive than I had anticipated. Although the final bill of $32,000 is not due immediately, we will have to find an extra $3,200 in next year’s first quarter budget if we want to proceed with JM Solutions’ proposal. If you have any questions regarding this matter, please just come to my office and we can go over where we can make the tough cuts to come up with this funding.",

It turned out that the manufacturers made an error in the production process. Fortunately, this problem can easily be fixed by one of our technicians. Currently, our technicians are available Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday next week. Please specify what day and what time works for you. Additionally, if your refrigerator is under warranty, this repair will be absolutely free. Please let us know your warranty number so we can verify this before sending a technician to your house.

Actually, next week I will be away on a business trip in Arkansas and I won’t return until Saturday. However, I have a housekeeper who comes to clean on Monday and Friday. If your technician visits on either day, she can let him or her in. My warranty number is A344F56J and is still valid. I will leave this document with my housekeeper in case you need to see it during your visit. Dana Kerry===========================From:customerservice@thomsonapp.comTo:dkerry@coolmail.comDate:July 7Subject: Repair TimeDear Ms. Kerry, Our technician will be able to come by your house on Monday. You will need to be sure to leave the warranty documents so the technician can scan them into our system. This is necessary for us to be reimbursed by the manufacturers. Our technician will come by in the morning and try to be gone by lunch; even though you have a housekeeper, they will try not to leave a mess. Safe travels and we appreciate your patience.

Therefore, you will be charged an overdraft fee of $30.00. This may have resulted from an accumulation of account withdrawals that were in process at the time you withdrew money from the ATM. We regret to have to make this charge whenever a member’s debit card transactions exceed his or her funds. In the future, this mistake can be avoided by signing up for our stark Bank mobile banking service. This service only costs $2 a month. Using your smartphone, you can access your accounts no matter where you are. You can check the amount of money in your accounts, your history of deposits and withdrawals, and most importantly, pending transactions. To sign up, please e-mail US at customerservice@starkbank.com or call us at 904-555-4514.   ===========================To:Customer Service From:Suzie Summers Subject: Overdraft Fee Date:June 5I am concerned that someone may have illegally accessed my account and made a withdrawal. I lost my debit card on June 2, and upon noticing the next day, I immediately froze all of my accounts. Considering these unfortunate circumstances, I politely ask that the bank refrain from charging the fee for this unforeseen overdraft. I would like to sign up for the banking service you recommended. It sounds like a useful service that can help me manage my finances in a more efficient manner. Thank you for your assistance. Suzie Summers===========================To:Suzie Summers From:Customer ServiceSubject:Overdraft ReviewDate:June 6Dear Ms. Summers, I am sorry to hear of your misfortunes. According to our account data, we see that you did contact us and freeze your accounts, though it looks like it was too late to prevent the withdrawal and subsequent overdraft of your account. It is a little bit unusual that the transaction that caused the overdraft was at an ATM machine a day after you say that you lost your card. Have you given your access pin to anybody recently? I would be happy to pass your request for overdraft relief on to our fraud department, but you will need to file a police report and then send us the case number that the investigating officer gives you. Once we receive this number, we can proceed with our review of your case. Thank you and good day, Laura Massey, Customer Service Specialist, Stark Bank",

Your monthly membership fees help US to obtain new books, computers, journal subscriptions, and other resources that are useful to the entire community. We would like to inform you of some special upcoming events this month you may be interested in attending. First, famous children's book author and storyteller Ebert Butler will be visiting our library. He will be reading from his new book, The Mysterious Cat, and signing autographs. His book was recently nominated for the Children's Book of the Year Award. Kathy Butler, Mr. Butler's wife, will also be in attendance at this event. She has drawn the pictures in most of Mr. Butler's books, including The Mysterious Cat. This event costs $10 but is provided free for library members. Later in the month, renowned wildlife photographer Nina Brooks will be holding an exhibition on the main floor of the library. Ms. Brooks recently returned from a trip to Kenya, where she photographed cheetahs, giraffes, elephants, and other animals. Her photographs capture the vividness of the wildlife and the majesty of nature. In addition to these two featured events, there will be a variety of workshops, games nights, and other events this month. Check the attached calendar for details. All events, including Movie Night, are free unless noted otherwise.

However, after just six months, fine zipper became jammed and no longer opens or doses. Because this is a manufacturing defect, Ĩ assume it will be covered by the warranty.

I certify that this product was purchased at an official Red Rock Leather Goods store and that I am the original purchaser of this product. Signature: Melisa PerkinsDate: February 28Note: It may take some time for your product to be returned to you. If you have any questions, please call US at 812-555-8541. =========================== Dear Melisa Perkins, Thank you for submitting your request for repairs to your Red Rock Leather Goods Coco TX Handbag.

First, we have a group of ten golfers. Now I know most courses generally limit a group to four players to keep up the pace of play, but I was really hoping you could make an exception for us and allow two groups of five. We will even rent golf carts to ensure that we don’t cause a delay. As for the $5 gift cards to the pro shop, I was wondering if they could be pooled together for one large purchase. It is my son’s birthday and I would like to buy him a new putter and they are awfully expensive these days. $50 bucks could go a long way to giving him a great gift! We would like to tee off around 11:30 A.M. on Saturday, July 20th, and then have dinner there at about 6:00 P.M. Please write back to confirm our tee time and answer my queries. Thank you for your time! Have a great day,  Logan Mankins",

We are planning on expanding our telemarketing department next month, but we don’t have enough properly trained employees to fill these new positions. Therefore, we will be transferring some employees from the customer service department to the telemarketing department to solve this problem. As our products are mainly targeted towards children, we are hoping to increase our profits as much as possible for this Christmas season. Please let me know the maximum number of students that you can accommodate at one time.

Come down to Dreamspace Bed Emporium and treat yourself to a comfortable bed catered to your exact needs. Customers are welcome to lie on any bed in the store.   First Floor: Beds (single, double, queen, king, etc.)Second Floor: Bedding (sheets, pillows, blankets, cushions, etc.)Third Floor: Furniture (chairs, sofas, tables, etc.)In response to customer suggestions, our store now stays open two hours later to accommodate those who may work irregular shifts.Do you need express delivery for a bed? Simply ask one of our staff members at the checkout and it can be easily arranged.If you have any comments or suggestions for our store, a comment box can be found inside the main entrance.=========================== Comment and Suggestion Form   Dreamspace Bed Emporium Customer name: Willy M. King Date: August 9Contact number: 456-555-6123Comment: Last week, I came into your store to shop for a new pillow, sheet, and blanket set for my bed at home. However, when Ĩ went to that section, I couldn't find any available staff members to assist me. I waited for about half an hour, but no one came to me. I needed help determining what sheet and blanket set would fit the dimensions of my bed but ended up just leaving the store frustrated. Ĩ hope you can provide better service to customers so something like this doesn't happen again in the future. X have been a loyal customer of yours for years. If you don't explain why no one helped me, Ĩ may have to start shopping at one of your competitors' stores.=========================== Hello everybody, I have called this meeting to talk about some of the problems that our new store policy of staying open later has caused. At first, this seemed like a great idea to help customers who worked all day. I know it can be hard to find time to do chores and your shopping when you work from 9 to 5. Unfortunately, this means that we have had to spread our staff too thin until we have hired and trained enough people. As a result, we have been neglecting some of our customers lately. The photocopied Comment and Suggestion Form I have passed out to you all from Willy King sums up our shortcomings better than I ever could. Please give it a read and think about ways we can be made aware of a customer in need, even in a store as large as ours. I understand that with our thin staff, we have to cover more space than we used to, so this meeting isn’t about punishment or blame, it's just about solutions. Please do some brainstorming on this and drop in on me in my office if you think you have an idea; I have to go call Wily King.",

The 88-year-old company has been Denmark's leading skincare brand and the top selling cream, Xtreme 7, has been Europe's most popular facial cream for over 10 years. Though Americans may not have had access to these creams before, the brand is already generating much excitement. Dermatologist Dr. Francis Keenan explains, \"Tests have shown that Xtreme 7 dramatically reduces the fine lines around the eye area and laugh lines after only 30 days of use, but the price of the cream is only a fraction of what department store brands sell for. I'll definitely recommend this cream to my clients.\" \"People have been asking about Xtreme 7 but the products haven't even arrived yet!\" added Susan Chan, an employee at a beauty counter. \"People are already calling in to pre-order.\" A spokesperson for the company explained that Brand-X is making moves to expand into the North American and Asian markets. For now, only the best-selling line will be available sometime next month, outside of Europe, but within a year, more products will be available========================== Brand-X Positions at American Headquarters in Westminster, CaliforniaDon’t miss your chance to work in an exciting career in skincare and beauty with Brand-X. 80 administrative and customer service positions will be available regardless of experience. Applicants need to have good communication skills, bilingual ability in both English and Spanish is preferred but not necessary, and knowledge in computer use is a must. Applicants with experience in cosmetics, dermatology, or marketing will get a chance to work in several management positions for Brand-X. Please visit our website at www.brandx.com/jobs for more information. You can fill out the application forms and send them in before March 20th. Interviews will take place at Hillway Building on 143 Garden Road. Be sure to bring your resumes and reference letters. ===========================To: Professor David MillsFrom: Jacqueline O’HareDate: March 28Subject:  JobDear Professor Mills, Thank you so much for the reference letter you supplied me with. I was recently hired by Brand-X and I begin my orientations next week Wednesday at 10:00 A.M. However, we have our statistics test at that time. Is there any way that I can take a make-up test at a different time or hand in another assignment as a replacement for the test? I would hate to miss the orientations which are mandatory and I don't want to disappoint my new employers. The job should not have any other impact on my school work otherwise. I kindly appreciate your consideration in this. Sincerely, Jacqueline O’Hare",

I am interested in hearing more about the motivational speaking that you do. Specifically, could you tell me if your speeches are religious in nature? We have a diverse staff and I am looking for something that is secular. Please write me back with an overview of what you do and what your rates are for a presentation. Laurie Wheeler, Managing Director, Competitive Excellence==========================To: Laurie Wheeler From:  Bill Johnson Date: October 13 Subject: Reservation InfoDear Ms. Wheeler, Thank you so much for your interest in Action. I am happy to answer your questions and provide you with a full breakdown of what we can do for you, your team, and your company. To begin with, all of our talks are secular, though not necessarily free from the concept of spirituality. Our professional speakers seek to motivate people to look internally to find their own spirit and help it rise. Morale, after all, is an intangible but essential aspect of an effective team.

I am majoring in industrial engineering here, and my liquid dynamics professor, Dr. Alcobar, recommended Master stroke Industries as a possible internship opportunity. Your company is recognized as a leader in flow research. If you would be willing to accept an intern for the coming spring semester, I could give you up to 15 hours per week of work, provided that you are able to write some performance evaluations that I could turn in to Dr. Alcobar for credit. Thank you for your consideration, and if you would like to see my transcript, I would be happy to forward it to you.

We have not accepted a lot of interns in the past, but I know Dr. Alcobar personally, and if he recommended that you contact US, he must have faith in your ability. I think we should set up an interview at our headquarters downtown on Holly street. We can get to know each other a bit over some coffee and I will show you around our facilities. Don't worry about your transcripts; like I said, if Dr. Alcobar thinks you’ll be a good fit, I’ll trust his judgment. How about this coming Friday at 10 A.M.? Look forward to meeting you Carl, John MastersonCEO, Master stroke Industries========================== Memorandum To Master stroke Industry Employees This spring, at Master stroke Industries, we will have an intern assisting US with everything from making coffee to solving complex equations. Carl Ennens is a student here at the University and has kindly offered his services in exchange for a piece of our operational knowledge. Please treat him with respect and don’t be afraid to use him for an extra pair of hands, eyes, or opinion should you need it. And I did hear he makes a good cup of coffee!",

        "transcript": "Respite for Commuters A new ride-sharing app in gaining in popularity as bus and taxi fees continue to rise and commuters continue to look for more efficient routers. Jordan Mills, a small business owner who commutes into downtown from his home in Brentwood has to transfer buses twice, then, take the subway to get to his workplace. Not only did he find the commute quite costly and uncomfortable in the rush-hour crowds, he found it time- consuming. But with the availability of the new app Freewheel, he found that he saved time and money with a quick ride available within 5 minutes of flagging for a ride from any location he was at. “This is definitely the future of transportation,” said Jordan. “I can’t get to work and back any other way now”.  Jordan Mills isn't the only commuter who feels this way. An estimated 2000 new commuters in the city of Sherwood alone are expected to use the ride-sharing app within the next year and almost 500 new drivers have signed up to the program. Freewheel is available for download at the Freewheel website and at Miniapp.com and Amacom.com. ===========================  www.freewheel.com/history  The idea for Freewheel began when Michael Owens and his co-workers first started a carpooling program at the company they worked at. Owens had to transfer the subway three times and the bus twice to get to work and although he could drive, the parking was limited. Fie managed the group by assigning different drivers and mapped out routes to each co-worker’s homes. Fie created an app that everyone could connect and communicate through so that the designated drivers and passengers could easily find each other. Five years later, Freewheel is now a major company with tens of thousands of users, both drivers and commuters around the country. Freewheel is dedicated to keeping the cost of commuting down and the efficiency up. In time, it hopes to bring its services to people around the world.   ===============================    Technology Initiatives   is proud to present the   New Innovation Award to:   Michael Owens, CEO of Freewheel This award recognizes the innovation and creativity of new talent in the technology industry. It also acknowledges the effort to help consumers through the use of technology with a novel idea that has transformed the transportation community.

I know this was an area of stress for you in the fourth quarter of last year, so I wanted to give you plenty of advanced warning. You will need to bring your numbers up significantly if you want to pass the review. As you know, we have been struggling to make our sales goals over the past several years, and I am afraid Mr. Jones is determined to trim the staff if things don't change. I have far exceeded my target numbers, so I have included an attachment with some possible leads for sales. Give them a shot. Good luck, James===========================To: James Holt From: Aaron Donald Date: Jan. 12Subject: First Quarter Performance ReviewJames, Thank you so much for the leads. I will get on them right away. I don't know why my sales are slumping so much lately in the technologies division. It seems like every sales technique I learned in school isn't working anymore. I am thinking about changing industries if I don't pass our review when it comes out in March. My sister is opening a beauty parlor and she was asking me to become a barber. Imagine that! Anyway, thank you again for the notice about the possible layoffs coming up. I will try to get my numbers up to standards, but I think that Mr. Jones may have already decided to let me go.

Looking at the most recent draft of the conference schedule, however, I noticed that the time slot assigned to Mr. Kekana conflicts with mine. Kindly assist me in resolving this dilemma. Thank youSincerely  -----------------------------------------  Program Registration  Sponsorships Comments   At the recent ACIC symposium I gave a presentation on the intricacies of buying automated machinery. Not only was my lecture well attended，during the subsequent question-and-answer session I was compelled to cover material that I had deliberately omitted from the presentation, fearing it would be too complicated. Clearly the audience was far more competent than I had anticipated. Additionally, in my capacity as a recruiter, I interviewed a dozen candidates for a critical position at my company. This initial experience with the ACIC symposium was utterly gratifying and I’m looking forward to the next edition. Avanish Gupta",

I am contacting you because I am interested in receiving regular shipments of fresh, organic vegetables to my restaurant weekly. My restaurant is just starting, so I do not need a large quantity of goods. After looking into different farms in the area, I chose to contact Bountiful Harvest because of your promise to deliver certified organic food. Therefore, I would like to receive a price estimate for the cost of having fresh vegetables delivered directly to our restaurant on a weekly basis.

Indira Singh--------------------------------------------------------To: Bountiful Harvest From: Emily Hall  Date: June 5Subject: Harvest ScheduleDear Ms. Singh, Thank you for responding so promptly to my email. I appreciate the offer of the complimentary delivery, but I think I would like to just go ahead and set up regular deliveries. I may be interested in setting up a year’s worth of deliveries, but I would first like to get a list of the range of produce that you will be offering through the different seasons. As I own a vegetarian restaurant, I will need to have an idea of the types of produce that will be delivered so I can prepare my menus accordingly. Thank you so much for your consideration, and I look forward to working with Bountiful Harvest! Kind regards, Emily Hall",

While costly restoration options are being considered, several factors make demolition a more likely outcome. “It’s a tough decision and one we don’t  intend to make hastily” said city planner Colin Barnwell. So far, it seems that replacing the bridge makes the most financial sense.” Price isn’t the only consideration, however. According to structural engineer Steve Pachenco, traffic flow is another important factor. \"Highway 49 will soon be broadened from two lanes to four. Then, Lowell Street Bridge will no longer be able to accommodate the increase in vehicles,’’ he said. “The way I see it, a wider, more modern bridge is inevitable.\" For residents who want to share their opinions and ideas, the city council will he holding a public input session at Helman Square next Thursday at 11:00 A.M. ----------------------------------------------- Letters to the EditorMay 7 - I’m writing in response to yesterday’s article about Lowell Street Bridge. This bridge is an invaluable part of Cordova's cultural identity and it is in the city’s best interest to keep it intact. Considering the tremendous amount of income the cultural-heritage-tourism industry brings to the city annually, I would argue that the short-term costs of restoring this historic landmark would be economically worthwhile. - Maria Cantu, member of the Cordova Preservation Society (CPS) -----------------------------------------------To: members@cordovaps.orgFrom: leo_contreras@cordovaps.orgDate: May 19Subject: Lowell Street Bridge UpdateDear CPS Members, Congratulations! Thanks to our strong community presence at the city council event, and after countless phone calls to city council members, it looks like Lowell Street Bridge will not be demolished after all! The Cordova Times published an article today stating that the city is now planning to relocate the bridge to the Eastside cultural district, where it will be used for foot traffic rather than motor vehicles. This decision is surely due in part to the fact that each of you voiced your opinions last Thursday. Thanks again, Leo Contreras, Cordova Preservation Society Community Organizer",

Since his review will be published in the city newspaper, let’s be sure that our selections reflect the very best of The Plum Room. To get input on the menu we’ll be serving him, I’ve decided we should hold a special menu-tasting event on Saturday of next week. I have a few suggestions for what we could serve at the menu tasting. How about preparing a hearty meatless entree that can really hold its own? That way we can highlight our vegetarian-friendly offerings. Perhaps our steamed shellfish dish would be a good option too. I do insist, however, on offering the new specialty pizzas we’re planning to introduce on our regular menu. That is, of course, assuming construction on the brick oven is completed by then. Also, I think we could serve at least one of our fruit desserts—they are always popular. But do know that I have full confidence in you, as Head Chef, to finalize the menu selections. Lastly, I’d like to offer our menu-tasting patrons a chance to tour the kitchen while they are here. Let me know how you feel about this and how best to arrange it. Thanks, Jethro Li----------------------------------------------   The Plum Room Tasting Menu  Saturday, October 1Smoked salmon canapes Baked halibut in butter sauce Eggplant steak with lemon tomato sauce Steamed mussels and shrimp in a coconut broth Roasted Tuscan chicken with white beans and wilted Peach cake with glazed almonds----------------------------------------------- Tasting Comment CardName:  Elianne Aude  Please comment on your tasting experience at The Plum Room.I was pleasantly surprised by the sweetness of the eggplant dish, the sauce was a little acidic for my taste though. The halibut, on the other hand, exceeded all my expectations. The Tuscan chicken was tender, but overall it lacked flavor. Regarding the cake, it was fairly tasty though a bit overcooked. I was quite impressed with the efficient design of your kitchen. I look forward to sampling the new brick-oven pizzas when they’re introduced it’s a shame you weren’t able to offer them today",

Though we’ve never purchased from them before, they provided references that gave glowing recommendations. I think we should choose a larger desk type for our main work area (twelve desks), with matching filing cabinets and bookshelves. For the support staff and interns who work upstairs, I suggest a simpler desk style. If you approve these suggestions, I’m hoping to phee the order quickly so that the items would be delivered while most of our staff are away at the conference in Bloemfontein. Unfortunately, our work areas will appear quite messy as we clear out the old furniture and await the arrival of the new items. Please let me know what you think of the plan I have outlined above.

As part of your student internship responsibilities you will need to arrange his lodging here at the university for March 25-27 and have the necessary paperwork completed and approved so (hat Mr. Nomura can receive his honorarium. Please reserve a room for his presentation as well. I recommend McAneny Auditorium since it can accommodate the most people, but any of the presentation rooms in the business building would be fine. Also, once Mr. Nomura provides his abstract, you will need to design a flyer and post it in the usual locations throughout the building. I trust you will be able to divide the work among the four of you without any issues. Thanks!

Trosdal Room In the past few years, many financial institutions have restricted lending to reduce their risk. This practice, however, contributes to unfavorable market conditions. How can banks minimize risk while still providing suitable funding opportunities to entrepreneurs? One possible solution that is alternative finance. I will provide an overview of alternative finance share some compelling data collected jointly by researchers at Kyoto Financial Group and Dunn School of Business，and discuss how  this global banking innovation can revive our industry. ------------------------------------------------ From: Dennis Carter  To: Mia ReyesReceived: March 12. 6:00 P.M.

I thorough  enjoyed our work luncheon at Motano Grill last Monday. As a fellow Silen Consultants employee, I am thrilled to be part of the  team headed to Edmonton to open our first branch there. At the meeting. I sensed our shared eagerness to land our first clients and begin advising firms in Edmonton on how best to use information technology in achieving their goals. I appreciated the thoughts shared about the kind of office space that would be ideal. I have searched morbushrealty.ca for suites that meet our basic criteria and budget a d have come up with a short list of possibilities for everyone to look over.

It sounds like last Monday’s team planning  meeting was very productive. I had hoped to be there, but my last – minute trip to Toronto couldn’t be helped. Also, it looks like I am the last to comment on this e-mail discussion, so thank you for your patience. Rosana, I appreciate the desire to locate in a spacious executive style office, but I really feel we shouldn’t compromise on the priority of being right in the heart of downtown. Is anyone familiar with Edmonton’s public transit system? It would help to know if using it to commute would be a possibility. I also agree with Tom’s idea that we should have a presence at the technology fair in Edmonton. I will try to look into it next weekend when my wife and I go up to view some housing options. Also, I will be having lunch with an Edmonton executive who used to work for Silen Consultants, thanks to a connection made by Rosana. I will report any new insights learned.

        "transcript": "To: Ben GreenidgeFrom: Nirmala DeokaranSubject: RequestDate: 13 JanuaryDear Mr, Greenidge. I kindly  request that management consider entering our company in the CASATO Virtual Business Tournament. The competition, organized by the Caribbean & South American Trade Organization (CASATO), requires participants to develop and implement business strategies that ensure the long-term stability and continuity or an imaginary company. Participation in this event could be highly beneficial to our company. Though many tournament participants occupy non-decision-making positions in their organization, the contest demands that they apply a broad range of leadership practices. In the process, most become more appreciative of the day-to-day realities and complexities of managing an actual company. Moreover, they tend to apply the skills acquired or refined during the competition — such as collaboration, analysis, and problem-solving — in actual work situations. Additionally, participation in the event may increase our company’s profile, opening up new markets for our products. Roughly six months after last year’s tournament, about one-third of the 70 companies that had taken part in that event reported an increase in regional business activities. Details about the tournament are available at wwwxasato.org/events/tournament_information. Sincerely, Nirmala Deokaran Flight Dispatcher Omicron Air Cargo----------------------------------------------  CASATO   CASATO VIRTUAL TOURNAMENTEntry informationRegistration for this years tournament is open from 1 March to 1 April, t while the tournament starts on 8 Jun. No more than two teams per  company can be registered.

Desmond Xueling, Asia Enterprise Monthly------------------------------------------------- New Equipment a Boon for LTL  7 January By Desmond XuclingTucked into a busy industrial area in Singapore, the LTL manufacturing facility is small, gray, and unassuming. But the \" building’s nondescript exterior masks an abundance of color and activity inside. Early on a sunny December morning, two enormous new textile-printing machines were already churning out the largest swaths of fabric ever processed by the factory. “Each machine is well over three meters wide,” said LTL’s Felicity Tong, who accompanied us on a tour of the factory floor. “Our machine operators are still learning to use the machines effectively, as you can see from this pile of rejected pieces, Ms. Tong remarked. “The machines are efficient, but mastering them is posing some challenges for our work crews. The machines come with the potential for big profits. Company CEO Ravinder Kapur commented that the demand for his company’s fabrics has grown in recent years. “These machines will allow us to print on vinyl and other materials that we had lacked the resources to work with,”  he said. “We’re very pleased to be able to satisfy client demand”.",

We tried to reserve a room, but the site kept crashing. We almost gave up, but decided to call the hotel and were able to make the arrangements that we wanted. The owner was very nice and gave us directions to her place. We suggested she look into a software tool that we recently bought and have had a lot of success with. Works great for us!\r\nAnna and Mark, July 11\r\nHow can I make a reservation for this hotel? Their Web site is very difficult to use-it says every room is “unavailable.\" I'm trying to stay there in December, so I feel there's something wrong with the site.\r\nMeiying, August 3\n\n\n\n\nHotel Reservation Management Simplified\nThe hospitality business is a multimillion dollar competitive industry that relies on effective and efficient ways for consumers to access hotel Web sites and make reservations.\r\n“We're often approached by hotels that are losing business to competitors with better Web sites,\" says Reserva developer Dmitri Kellerman. “A number of hospitality software developers provide Web-design services, but then expect the hoteliers to be able to program their own applications to stay competitive. This is beyond the skills of most small-business owners.”    Francine Malloy couldn't agree more. “I looked into purchasing Reserva after one of our guests recommended it. I was so relieved to finally find a solution to our Web site problems. The Reserva software is very easy to use and intuitive. Even more, with the help of the tools provided, we were able to update the site information ourselves. Our guests, and particularly our return guests, are very impressed with our new Web site. All parties involved are very satisfied. Within twenty-four hours of launch, the first reservation came in and online bookings have been arriving so quickly that in just ten days, the site had fully paid for the cost of the upgrade.\"",

From the moment it opened, the pavilion featuring the Brazilian chocolatier Amo-Te has been overrun with enthusiastic visitors.\r\n\"We didn't expect to be so popular,\" remarked company Marketing Manager Andreas Gomes, who arrived at the expo just in time to see his company's artisanal confectioners explain the chocolate-making process to eager crowds. “We drew so many visitors that I had to fly in five more employees from our headquarters in Brazil to staff our busy display area.”\r\nVintage products that Amo-Te no longer distributes to retailers have been released in limited quantities. One exclusively available at the Expo is the once-popular bar made from dried fruit and covered with dark chocolate. The company has reproduced this old favorite in a classic, retro-style wrapper.\r\n“We were confident that our appeal to chocolate-lovers' sense of nostalgia would be welcome,” said Mr. Gomes, “but we never expected this kind of success!”",

The much loved Waking Up chronicled the ups and downs Mendoza experienced as he moved from job to job as a youth, working as everything from dock worker and fisherman, to hotel clerk and tennis\r\ninstructor. Life Lessons in Advertising picks up where the previous book left off, with Mendoza having just arrived in New York City. We follow his rise from mailroom clerk to the head of M&D Creative, a highly successful advertising agency.\r\nWritten in the humorous, informal style that has made Mendoza's ads so successful over the years, the book shares stories of client case histories and reveals how he developed his most successful advertisements. The book is now available online and in bookstores everywhere.",

        "transcript": "Norview City Observer\nTo the Editor:\r\nA poll conducted last week by the Centre for Civic Engagement has shown that 19 percent of respondents approve of the RIR. Critics of the IRI are most concerned that it will be paid for by raising local taxes. This will leave residents like me with less money for food, clothing, and toiletries, which, in turn, will mean less revenue for businesses in the area. It may also encourage high-income earners to leave Norview City or spend their disposable income elsewhere. Any gains made by higher taxation would be offset by corresponding losses. The city government should look into other options to fund the project.\r\n................................................................\nHappy Days for Norview City Council\n \r\n(22 July) - This week brought some welcome news for the Norview City Council. Just a few months ago, the council's proposed Infrastructure Redevelopment Initiative seemed unlikely to succeed; a poll released on 14 April by the Centre for Civic Engagement (CCE) revealed that just 19 percent of respondents backed the plan, since then, the council has held a series of public hearings, and a number of adjustments have been made to the proposal.\r\nA CCE poll released earlier this week shows that now 52 percent of respondents are willing to fund the programme by paying 0.5 percent more in taxes. Two more public hearings on the IRI have been scheduled.\r\nThe first will be held next Wednesday, 27 July, at 7:00 P.M. at the Norview City Community Centre\r\nManami Ishada, Norview City.",

        "transcript": "Attention Loyal Green Brew Customer! Green Brew Cafe is redesigning our loyalty program - it's not just for coffee anymore! As a frequent customer, you're invited to participate in testing the new program. Interested? Go to greenbrew.com to read more and download the new Green Brew app. Then start accumulating points by enjoying our sandwiches, smoothies, and salads in addition to your favorite coffee drinks. When you post a review on our Web site, you will receive twenty extra points as a thank-you gift! ==========================FinnD188 (8 July): Why is Green Brew changing its loyalty program? With the new program, the points system has changed. I have to buy twice as many coffee drinks to get a free one now. I like using the mobile app to pay, but I don't like the points. I think the program needs some rethinking before its official launch. Alannah08 (14 July): Berthe's Beanery still has a punch card to earn free drinks - much simpler than this new system Green Brew is testing. I'll keep going to Green Brew as long as I can keep using my punch card, but when the new program replaces the old one completely, I'll probably go to Bertha's more often. CoffeeBea (29 July): I was excited about the app, and it does make paying for purchases very easy. But it's much easier to earn drinks at other nearby cafe, and that's more important to me. I think Green Brew needs to make some changes before introducing the new system. ==========================A lesson in LoyaltyBy Hudson Aird27 AugustMaintaing customer loyalty can be difficult. Just ask Green Brew Cafe owner Taylah Carver. She recently began experimenting with a change to the cafe loyalty program to reward her regular customers. Instead of the old punch-card system, which rewarded customers for coffee purchases only, the new program allows customers to earn points for buying food items as well. The points are tracked through the Green Brew app, which customers download to their mobile devices. The app can also be used to pay for orders.The program was originally scheduled to be introduced to the general public in September, but after nearly 60 customers tried out the app for a month, Carver decided to defer the launch. Most users liked the fact that the app allows them to pay using their mobile devices, but there were many complaints about the new points system. It now takes twice as many purchases before customers accumulate enough points to be eligible for a free coffee drink, and that was too much, reviewers said. The lesson, says Ms. Carver: know your customers",

Data on student addresses indicate that our effort to extend marketing reach to a broader geographical area has paid off. Over 35 percent of new students live 20 or more miles from campus. That's a 15 percent increase from last year. - On the recreational cooking side, enrollments have declined over the last several months. Natasha is developing an electronic survey to send to past participants. Once we understand how these students' interests have changed, we will be able to update our course offerings to suit them. Our next team meeting is scheduled for 2:00 P.M. next Monday.

This handy buyer's guild describing our four most popular products will help you choose the one that best meets your needs. • Q15-Extra soft. Very comfortable, but will flatten and change shape a bit over time. Best for infrequent use. • Q15-Soft. Cost-effective, but not as long-lasting as the firmer products. Will become even softer over time. • Q35-Medium firm. Our bestseller. Slightly costlier than the other options, but comfortable, durable, and holds up to years of heavy use. • Q45-Extra firm. Best for dining chairs and other seating that requires stiffer padding. Warning: These polyurethane products will burn if exposed to a flame of any kind. Special shapes: All foam comes in standard-sized sheets. However, cutting sheets to your own specifications is easy to master. Please view the how-to video on our \"Project Tips\" tab. ------------------------------------------------ Customer Inquiry Form Name: Alexa TelkesE-mail: a_telkes@bitweb.netPhone: 973-555-0183Message: I am restoring an old couch and need new foam to replace the cushions. I need to help deciding which kind of foam to purchase. I don't want the cushions to be too hard, but I don't want them to be too soft, either. Something in the middle would be perfect. Price is not a huge issue. Since I plan to use the couch a lot, the most important thing to me is that my cushions last as long as possible. Could you please advise me on what to choose? Thank you! -----------------------------------------\"I'll be going to Woodbury from now on.\" ★★★★★I recommend Woodbury Upholstery Supply to anyone looking for high-quality foam for couch cushions. As a novice seamstress, I was unsure what type of padding to use for my project. Woodbury's staff was quick to assist me and very knowledgeable in addressing my questions. The couch I needed foam for was unusually shaped, but the resources on their Web sire guided me through the challenging parts of the project. Just expect to do your own foam cutting, as Woodbury doesn't accommodate requests for custom-sized pieces. I only shop for this kind of product occasionally, but I'll be going to Woodbury from now on. Alexa Telkes (Chatham)",

We had talked about two potential sessions, one on regulations for pipeline engineers regarding land use and one on the impact of pipelines on the environment. I would really like to make this happen when you are in Alberta for the fall conference. The Krestarr Group Web site states that your company's consulting fees are 500 dollars for sessions with up to 10 participants, 750 dollars for sessions with up to 15 participants, 1,000 dollars for sessions with up to 20 participants, and 1,250 dollars for sessions with more than 20 participants. Is this information correct? I am looking forward to your prompt reply. Sincerely, Alton Gilman--------------------------------------From: Myeong KwanTo: Alton GilmanDate: July 22Subject: Re: Follow upDear Mr. GilmanI would be happy to give a session on land-use regulations to your team. My colleague, Aisha Wright, who handles environmental-impact training for our consulting firm, is also available. We will be at the conference on September 27 and 28. There's no guarantee that conference sessions would end early enough for us to give an evening workshop on those days. So it would probably be easiest for us to arrange for a session either right before or immediately after the conference. I am available to give the training on the 26th, or Ms. Wright, who is staying in Alberta for a few days after I leave, could present her training session on the 29th. The training fees listed in your e-mail are correct. in the future you may be interested in additional seminars we offer on other topics of interest to environmental engineers, such as maintaining environmental sustainability and how to construct buildings that are energy efficient. Please confirm which date and training session would be best for your company. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

The lease on our current building expires this year, so we will need to begin moving into the Walden Street location as soon as the construction is completed. Although our budget for this project is extremely tight, we are committed to an aesthetically pleasing design. Also, the local community board needs assurance that this project will be contained in terms of construction dirt and noise, which could be disruptive to those who live and work in the neighborhood. Our team was impressed with the work they saw on the tour of LKO Design's past projects in the city, and we hope we will be able to come to an agreement. Sincerely, MarjorirGreer, PresidentPermia Systems-----------------------------------------------January 12MEETING NOTESAttendingLKO Design: Antonio Lippert, Bjarte NielsenPermia Systems: Marjorie Greer, Lisa MingPurposeDetermine next steps for Walden Street construction projectDecisionsLKO will evaluate whether it is possible to build onto the existing structure and will draw up an initial budget. If the project is determined to be too expensive to undertake, Permia Systems will pay for the assessment; ------------------------------------------Amazing Transformation(November 28) - Those who remember the vacant Quinn Office Services building on Walden Street may find it hard to believe that most of that squat, dull building still stands. That's because the old building is hidden beneath the stunning new national headquarters of Permia Systems, which is now nearly complete. LKO Design was able to use the old building's foundation and some of its existing structure. “This was important because the client wanted to avoid disturbance to the community by minimizing the noise and dust,\" said Bjarte Nielsen, design engineer for LKO Design. \"The first thing we did was access the structure.
