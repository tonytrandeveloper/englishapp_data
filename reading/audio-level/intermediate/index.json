        "content": "Meryl was a little embarrassed to admit it. She was 37 years old, and didn't know how to drive. When she lived in Queens, it wasn't such a big deal. Everything that she needed was close by. The supermarket was one block away. She would take her shopping cart and get what she needed for the week easily. When she didn't feel like dragging the shopping cart, the supermarket even delivered for free. All she had to do was tip the driver. She would use that same shopping cart to take clothes to and from the laundromat, which was only a block away. While Meryl's job was not a block away, the subway station was. Every day she would walk the block to catch a 45-minute underground train ride to work. She repeated the journey in reverse to return home in the evenings.\nAlhambra sure was different, though. The walk from Meryl's house to the supermarket was nearly a mile. She didn't feel like walking that long a distance while pushing shopping cart full of a week's worth of food. The laundromat was a mile in the other direction. She wasn't going to push her dirty clothes through that many streets. There were no trains nearby to take her to work, just buses. The buses always took a long time to come. For the first few weeks, Meryl was always late everywhere. Sometimes when she had an urgent appointment, Meryl would ask friends to give her a ride somewhere. Almost all of her friends had cars and knew how to drive. Most of them learned it when they were in high school.\nAfter a while, her friends were tired of giving Meryl rides everywhere. \"You need to learn how to drive, Meryl,\" they told her. She knew they were right, but Meryl was scared."

Santa Monica beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in California. There are more scenic views on the coastline up and down the state, but many are inaccessible to beachgoers. Santa Monica has a very large beach area that features white sand and lots of room to play. Carol liked to toss a Frisbee around with her friends and to play volleyball.\n\"Do you want to play volleyball, Laura,\" Carol asked when they got there. \"Sure,\" said Laura, \"but who are we going to play with? It takes more than two people to play.\" Carol thought about it, and said that they should start playing and others will join in, so the two girls started playing alone. Just as Carol said, more kids came over and wanted to play with them. Soon they had more than enough people for a game, and they played for hours.\nAfter the game, the girls wanted to cool off, so they decided to jump into the ocean for a little relief. The water was crowded, but that just added to the fun. It was cool and wet, and the waves were just right. Some people were surfing both on surfboards and body boards, while others were swimming out to the buoys. On the coastline, two girls were digging for sea shells and one man was using his metal detector to find hidden treasure. Carol ran up to the man and asked him what he was looking for. He said: \"Anything I can find, young lady.' Carol laughed and asked him if she could try. \"Sure. Why not?\" said the man. So Carol started scanning the beach and soon found a necklace, whcih the man let her keep. \"Why not,\" said the man. \"You found it.\" Carol was very happy and ran to tell Laura."

        "content": "Once a person gets the job he or she wants, it then becomes important to be a good employee to the organization. The new employee should be a valuable addition to the team. There are many ways a person can be considered a good employee. Being prompt is a very important aspect of any job. If a person's working hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., for instance, it would be wise to be on time or a few minutes earlier. Allowing extra time for your trip to the office is always a good idea. Unexpected delays such as traffic accidents or foul weather can all cause you to be late. Commuter buses and trains could be delayed, too.\nBeing late is never a good idea, but it is also important to be at work and ready to perform your duties every day. Most jobs still adhere to a five-day schedule from Monday through Friday. There are many exceptions depending on the type of position you hold, but again, most people work a standard five-day work week. Some other things a worker can do to be a good employee is to have a positive attitude about your job. An enthusiastic employee is a great asset to the employer. Dressing properly, being trustworthy, following the organization's rules all help you become a good employee.\nOne of the best things a person can have is to find a job that he or she really enjoys. There is an old saying that reads, \"If you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.\" Loving your job will be rewarding, satisfying, and it will give you a great attitude."

Those parts are the University of California system, the California State University system, the community college system, and private institutions.\nThe UC system has more than 230,000 students at its 10 Campuses. It is considered the more prestigious system in the state. It includes top universities like UC Berkeley, and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Both schools rank in the top 25 universities in the country, with Berkeley in the top 10. A degree from the UC system is highly sought, and the academic standards are higher than the other systems. They are also more expensive.\nThe California State Universities counts 23 universities in its system. It is a diversified system that includes two polytechnic universities, and a maritime university. These schools offer vocational and maritime education, but also offer traditional, academic programs. The systems enrollment is approximately 450,000 students, with about 45,000 faculty members.\nThe California Community Colleges system is the largest systems of higher education in the state, and the world. It boasts 112 campuses, and serves approximately 2.4 million students. It offers transfer degrees, vocational training, and associates degree programs.\nCalifornia is also home to a large number of privately owned and operated schools.

King, a minister, became known for non-violently protesting the treatment of African-Americans in the United States and laws that discriminated against Blacks. Specifically, King protested segregation that separated blacks and whites in public restrooms, public pools, public schools, on buses, and at restaurants. King led many marches in the United States, especially in the South where segregation was especially practiced and enforced, and in Washington D.C. His march on Washington D.C. was perhaps his most famous one, where he gave the \"I have a Dream\" speech.\nOn Martin Luther King Jr. Day, federal, state, and local offices are closed, including public schools and post offices. On the holiday many people participate in marches and vigils remembering Dr. King. Others use the day as a day of service and volunteer in their community by cleaning up garbage in a local park or serving food to the homeless. However, the holiday was controversial. Some states didn't want to honor Dr. King and tried to  rename the holiday or combine the day with another holiday.\nOnly two other people have a U.S. national holiday, Christopher Columbus and George Washington. Martin Luther King Jr. Day  became a holiday in 1983 after pressure from civil rights activists and marches, similar to the ones King used to lead. Efforts to create a King holiday began the same year King was killed. The first state to recognize King Day as a holiday was Illinois. The last state to recognize the holiday was Arizona."

These boroughs are Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Bronx. Manhattan has the most people of all the boroughs, about 1.5 million, even though it is the smallest borough by size. If you send a letter to someone who lives on Manhattan, don't write Manhattan on the envelope. You should write \"New York, New York\", like the famous  Frank Sinatra song.\nBecause the island is so small, most people live and work in tall buildings. Some of these buildings are called skyscrapers because it looks like they are touching the sky. Some famous skyscrapers in Manhattan are Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, 70 Pine Street, Trump Building, GE Building, and Citigroup Center. Manhattan is connected to the other boroughs by a series of bridges and tunnels. The most famous bridge may be the Brooklyn Bridge because of its brick arches. The New York City subway, a massive mass transit system that mostly runs underground, also connects the island to the rest of the boroughs.\nManhattan, like the other boroughs, has many different neighborhoods, many of which are named for the ethnic communities that first lived there. Some of these neighborhoods include Little Italy, Little Germany, Little Brazil, Chinatown, and Koreatown. One of the most famous parts of Manhattan is Times Square. Times Square is called the crossroads of the world. Every year millions of people gather there on New Year's Eve to watch an illuminated crystal ball drop. There are many theaters around Times Square. Most of these theaters are on Broadway, a famous street considered the home of the American theater industry. Another famous Manhattan street is Fifth Avenue. A part of the avenue features expensive designer stores like Tiffany's. Fifth Avenue is also famous for its Museum Mile."

It was a secret between Jane and Diana.\nJane and Diana would play together every day. Sometimes they would play within the doll house. They liked watching movies, playing hide and seek, and painting. They also liked playing outside with toy cars and drawing with chalk on the ground. Since Diana was far too big and Jane far too small, they could not play hide and seek and run over long distances. Instead they enjoyed playing their own version of hide and seek. When they played, it would have to be inside a small room. Jane was always the one to hide since it was easy for her to do so.\nOne day, it was Diana's birthday, and she had several of classmates from school come over to celebrate. Jane stayed hidden from plain sight in Diana's room. At one point, things became rowdy among some of the boys and girls, and they began to chase each other around the house. Then a few of them entered Diana's room and began invading her things. One of the boys got a hold of Jane who was in her doll house and started to toss and play catch with her among the boys. Then Diana came into the room and took notice of what was happening to Jane and immediately yelled for them to stop. They put Jane back down. Jane was so frightened but relieved to be saved.\n150%\"> \"Get out!\" Diana screamed. After everybody left, Diana lifted up Jane and asked her if she was okay. Diana was happy to see that Jane was in one piece. It would be the last time that Diana would bring anyone over to play. This secret was too great to risk its discovery.

        "content": "There is perhaps no greater mystery in the annals of American history as that of the Amelia Earhart story. Earhart's story is one of controversy, and intriguing. She was an accomplished aviator, the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo. She accomplished this during a time when women were not highly regarded in the United States. American women during the 1930s did not have the same advantages men had. There were few employment opportunities. Educated women were a scarcity. Women who did find employment during this era were working as grade-school teachers, nannies, and maids for the most part. Amelia Earhart did a lot to change that perception.\nAlthough Earhart was born into a family that did see financial success, but that success was fleeting. There were times in her life when her family struggled to make ends meet because of poor money management. Earhart was home schooled for most of her life, and she gained her pilots license at an early age. In December of 1920, Earhart's father took Amelia to an airshow in Long Beach, California. This is where she first became interested in flying. After earning her aviator's license, she accomplished a feat that only a few men had ever done: flying solo across the Atlantic. She earned national fame for this and was soon a household name.\nTragically, Earhart was lost in an attempt to fly around the world in 1937. She was never found. The theories about how she met her end are countless. Many think she fell victim to the Japanese prior to the start of World War II. This thinking was rooted in the idea that Earhart was a spy. Other outlandish theories include alien kidnapping, but most likely she had mechanical difficulties flying over the Pacific Ocean. Earhart was either killed instantly, or survived, according to one popular theory, and lived out her days on a deserted island."

Most of the city at the time was built of wood. This, combined with the famous Chicago winds and a drought, made the city burn down quickly. The fire lasted for three days. 100,000 people were left homeless, and at least 300 were killed. What was amazing was how quickly the city was rebuilt, eventually becoming the third most populous city in the United States.\nThe Great Boston Fire of 1872 created a property damage of $73.5 million,  more than any other fire in the U.S. history. Most of Downtown Boston and the financial district burned down in the fire that began in a warehouse basement. 30 people died, and thousands lost their jobs and their homes. However, the city was rebuilt in two years. It began enforcing building regulations because of the fire.\nThe 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City caused the fourth highest loss of life from an industrial accident in the U.S. history. 123 women and 23 men, all garment workers and mostly poor immigrants, died from the fire, smoke inhalation, or falling or jumping to their deaths. Child labor was not uncommon. The youngest victims were two 14-year-old girls who worked  in the factory. So many people died because the owners of the factory locked the doors to the stairs and exits. This was to prevent the workers from taking breaks and stealing. As a result of the fire and huge loss of life, many people began protesting poor working conditions. The U.S. Congress passed laws improving factory safety conditions. Women workers also formed a union to fight for better working conditions."

It was considered impossible to build and fly an airplane that could exceed this speed, but that was before the world was introduced to Chuck Yeager. Yeager was already an accomplished fighter pilot in World War II, but his greatest achievement was after the war when he served as a test pilot for the United States Air Force. It was thought impossible to fly faster than sound during that period, and no one knew if a pilot could survive flying at that speed, or how it would affect him if he did survive. That did not deter Yeager, though.\nYeager was born on February 13, 1923 in Myra, West Virginia. He served during World War II as a fighter pilot. He did not start out as a pilot, though. Yeager enlisted as a private who worked as an aircraft mechanic in the old Army Air Forces, where Yeager enrolled into a special program that trained enlisted men to become pilots. Yeager benefited greatly from having superior eyesight. He was considered a natural pilot early in his flight career.\nAs a fighter pilot in the European Theater, Yeager was shot down in France by German fighter planes. He avoided capture, and helped a fellow pilot to safety after that pilot had lost his leg in the crash. Yeager was awarded a medal for his actions. He demonstrated exceptional talent as a pilot and once shot down five enemy fighters in a single day. After the war, Yeager began a new career as a test pilot, where he flew the experimental aircraft Bell X-1 into aviation history.\nOn October 14, 1947, Yeager flew his X-1 faster than the speed of sound. He became the first human being to fly faster than sound, and he went on to break more records during his 60-year flight history. Yeager retired from the army with the rank of Brigadier General, and has won many honors for his contributions to aviation."

After her shower, she prepares a simple breakfast. Grabbing a clean bowl from the dishwasher, she empties into it a packet of instant oatmeal. She pours in a cup of milk, stirs and heats the mixture in the microwave. While waiting for her oatmeal to cook, she dresses for the day, mindful of the weather.\nFully dressed now, she removes her oatmeal from the microwave, which has now cooled just enough to suit her taste. It is her favorite flavor, apple cinnamon. As she savors each bite, she is reminded of her mother, who always made sure Sandy ate a warm breakfast before leaving the house in the morning.\nChecking the time on her phone, she hurriedly swallows the last few mouthful of oatmeal before heading out. As she steps into the street, a gust of wind blows back her hair. She covers her head with the hood of her coat, tightens the scarf around her neck, and braces for her walk to the train station.\nAfter settling into her seat on the train, memories of her mother stir again. She takes out her phone and texts: \"Hey mom, thanks for the scarf you knit me. It came in real handy this morning. Love always.\""

It is truly a melting pot of diversity. All these cultures have come together to create a new culture - an American culture. Many of the traditions, customs, religions, and celebrations of these cultures have been adopted into American culture, including funeral traditions.\nTraditional American funerals are basic. They usually include some sort of religious ritual, followed by a procession to the burial grounds, and a small ceremony at the grave site, but these vary depending on the culture. At most American funerals, the deceased person's family sends out a death announcement called an obituary. These obits normally serve to pass information to others about the deceased, and the time and day of the funeral event. At the church service, the deceased is usually eulogized by friends and family. This is where a person goes up to the front of the crowd to say a few things about the deceased, and how he or she affected their life. The procession usually takes the form of a caravan of private cars, and trucks that follow the hearse, which contains the deceased's coffin, and remains.\nAt the gravesite, another small ritual takes place where the deceased is given a blessing from a member of the clergy. Friends and family are then allowed to say goodbye to the deceased. There is an American tradition of picking up a handful of soil, and tossing it on the coffin as a way of saying farewell to the deceased. The family then gathers at a home, or restaurant with some of the attendees to have a meal, and to exchange stories before going on their way. Most cultures in the U.S. have adopted this traditional American funeral ritual, but many include features that are unique to their individual culture."

The last time we went to the park, we were playing catch and also hitting some baseballs with our bats. Some guys came up to us because they wanted to play a game of baseball. They needed two more players, so they asked us to play with them.\nJames asked me if I wanted to play, and I said yes. The guy's name was Christian, and he introduced us to all the guys. James introduced me and gave the guy our names. I asked Christian if I could play catcher. I always liked playing catcher at school. He said that I could and James got first base. During the game, James got a homerun and I was excited for him. I got on the base twice, but I got out all the time. I was sad, but James told me not to worry and that it happens.\nAfter the game, Christian and the guys told James if he wanted to go grab a drink with them. I thought James was going to go because he likes to drink, but he told them that he was going to take me out to eat. We thanked them for the game and Christian asked James for his phone number just in case they ever needed more players for a game. James gave it to him and then we went to go eat at Jim's Burgers.\nI asked James why he didn't go to drink with the guys. He told me that he knew his responsibilities.

His presidency spanned from March 4, 1932 to April 12, 1945. When Roosevelt first took office, the country was in a deep, economic depression called the Great Depression. During his first 100 days in office, Roosevelt passed several economic stimulus bills that were designed to improve the American economy by putting people back to work. His economic strategy was called the New Deal, and the economy improved steadily for four years until 1937 when the U.S. fell into a recession.\nRoosevelt presided over the country during one of the darkest periods in American history - World War II. In the years prior to American involvement in the war, Roosevelt was determined to keep the United States neutral in the great war. Roosevelt offered economic and diplomatic support for its allies such as Great Britain, and China, but all that changed on December 7, 1941. That was the day when the Imperial Japanese Army attacked the U.S. naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The attack was devastating, and the U.S. had no choice but to join its allies in the war against Nazi Germany, Japan, and Italy. Roosevelt's address to the nation following the sneak attack is considered one of the greatest presidential addresses of all time.\nRoosevelt served as president until his death in 1945. He had suffered from illnesses during his lifetime, and succumbed to a cerebral hemorrhage during a stay at a hospital. His legacy is firmly in place as the man who took a country with more than 13,000,000 unemployed. By the time he left office, less the 2 percent of the workforce was unemployed. He will always be known as the great leader that guided the country through its darkest hours in history."

There are many different types of private schools and many different reasons why parents send their kids there. Some private schools are military type and yet others are boarding schools where students live on campus. Some private schools are affiliated with a certain religion. These schools teach a specific faith's  beliefs and traditions as well as the regular academic subjects. There are schools run by Catholics, Protestants, Jewish people, Muslims, and Orthodox Christians. There are also private schools that specialize in teaching disabled students.\nSome parents choose private schools because they feel that they offer a better education than public schools; others choose private schools because they offer a different type of curriculum. Waldorf Schools, for example, only let children play and use items made of natural materials.\nPrivate schools are also called independent schools or non-state schools because they are not run by local, state, or national governments. They can pick what students to go to their schools. They do this through admission examinations and interviews. There is often an admissions application. Some private schools accept anyone who can pay tuition to send their children there. Some schools charge up to $45,000 a year. Private schools charge tuition because they do not get any money collected from local, state, and national taxes. Some private schools offer a limited number of scholarships to help pay for school. Many of these scholarships are need-based, meaning for students who can't afford the tuition. Other scholarships are offered for students with very good grades or for students that have a talent in a sport or art."

Most landlords are not individuals anymore, but rather are companies that own a number of properties. You and the landlord will set a date to view the place you are interested in renting.\nOn that date you can see the apartment and ask questions. Some landlords will require you to fill out an application. The application will ask questions about your job, salary, and how many people are going to live with you in the apartment. The landlord wants to make sure they have responsible tenants who will pay rent on time. Some landlords will even ask for references, the names and telephone numbers of people who can verify that you have a job and are a responsible person. Most landlords will also run a credit check. A credit check is your history of paying bills on time. If your potential landlord sees that you owe a lot of money to different companies and don't pay your bills on time, they may not want you as a tenant. If you have bad credit or an unstable work history, you may be required to get a co-signer, that is another financially responsible adult to sign the lease, a rental contract, with you. This co-signer is legally responsible for paying the rent if you stop paying.\nIf you cannot afford a full apartment, another option is to rent a room in someone's home. The process to rent a room is like renting an apartment except you only have a room and usually have to share the bathroom and the kitchen. Most apartments and rooms in the U.S. are unfurnished. You are expected to bring your own furniture, including a bed, a dresser, a sofa, and anything else you need."

He played for the New York Knicks for most of his career after being drafted by the team in 1967. He was a top reserve player for the Knicks team that won the NBA Championship in 1973. Because of a spinal injury, he did not continue to play for the team. Jackson was an average player, who found some success in the NBA, but his phenomenal success in the league came as a coach.\nAs coach of the Chicago Bulls, Jackson's teams won six titles in nine years. He was hired in 1987 by the Bulls as an assistant coach, and took over the head coaching job in 1989. Helping him win the titles was Michael Jordan. Jordan is one of the most successful athletes ever to play the game of basketball. Many people claim that Jackson was able to win his six titles because of Jordan, while others point out that Jordan preceded Jackson without ever winning a title. In any event, the duo worked, and the rest is NBA history.\nJackson join the Los Angeles Lakers as coach in 2000. The Lakers were in a similar situation as the Bulls during that time. The team had plenty of talent, but lacked leadership. Jackson, once again, provided that. During his time with the Lakers, Jackson's teams won five NBA titles, nearly matching the Bulls run. Jackson also benefited from having Kobe Bryant and other talented players on his roster, but his success was now firmly cemented in basketball lore.

His landmark show \"Cosmos\" was one of the first science shows to gain acceptance by the general public in the United States. Sagan challenged Americans to think about their place in the universe like no other person before him. Using the scientific method, Sagan challenged long-held beliefs about the genesis of life on earth. This he has done to the enlightened scientific community, and to the anger of the religious community. Many of Sagan's teachings contradict the creationist belief of the beginning of life. He was also interested in the search for life beyond the planet earth, and participated in the only human message sent into space intended for an alien race.\nSagan was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 9, 1934. His interest in science began at an early age. He wrote and co-wrote 20 books, and had more than 600 scientific research papers published. His most popular work was \"Contact\", which tells the story of first contact with an intelligent alien species. The book was made into a movie in 1997 starring Jodie Foster. The book and movie angered many religious groups because of its message that human beings are not alone in the universe.\nSagan earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in physics from the University of Chicago in the 1950s. His scientific curiosity led him into developing the television series \"Cosmos\". It was one of the most watched science series, and has been recreated and is currently on the air. His work on the Galileo project lives on today. The spacecraft is speeding its way through infinite space today with his message of greeting to whatever race of beings finds it.

This measure of a student's academic performance is an important factor when he or she decides to apply to a university. It is, however, not the only consideration. One of the most important factors universities look at is the student's extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are simply the work students do outside his or her academic studies. These activities can include joining campus groups or clubs; community involvement, organizing or participating in social or politically-themed events, or fundraising for a cause important to that student. Extracurricular activities take many forms, and are important to achieving the student's academic goals.\nOne of the easiest ways to get involved in extracurricular activities is to simply join a campus club. There are many clubs on campus that might interest students. To find a list of the clubs your high school or college has to offer, go to the Associated Student Union, a student government organization, to ask for a list. Additionally, nearly every department has a club associated with it. For instance, the Psychology Department probably has a psychology club. The Engineering Department will also have a club or two. The same goes for Math and English Departments, but there are many more available to choose from.\nCommunity involvement is another good way to show university officials your extracurricular activities. There are countless volunteer opportunities students can engage in, which help both the community and the student. Working with the homeless, or disabled residents of the community looks good on a college application. Getting politically involved with a cause or a specific political candidate can also show university officials your commitment to improving your life, and the lives of others. The more a student is involved in extracurricular activities, the better."

In Los Angeles alone, it can sometimes feel like there is one on every other corner when you're driving around. As if this didn't already make it hard enough for parents to avoid, McDonald's targets their famous \"Happy Meals\" to children so that every time they drive by the giant golden arches, children demand to go inside to get a new toy with their meal.\nAlthough it may be very hard for parents to have healthier meal options for their children, doing so is a necessity that this country can no longer ignore. Constantly consuming fast food is becoming a norm in American society and is resulting in millions of people suffering from obesity and diabetes for the rest of their lives. Instead of teaching children that it is okay to give in to the temptation of a quick greasy meal, parents should get their children into the habit of healthy eating everywhere they go.

The recreation center was decorated with fake spider webs and filled with artificial fog. \"We're going to egg some houses,\" Joe told her. She didn't know that throwing eggs was illegal. She just thought it was another Halloween tradition.\nA few hours later, the landlady opened the door and found Laura accompanied by police. \"Trick or treat?\" Laura asked, looking embarrassed."

She would go once in the summer and once during the Christmas holiday. Traveling cross-country was expensive though. She needed to find a way to save money on her travel. She decided to try and use an airline loyalty program to see if that would help.\nThere was one airline that Carla preferred to travel on. Every time she used that airline, there were hardly any delays and the trip was always comfortable. That airline featured in-seat DIRECTV, so she could watch her favorite television shows while traveling. She could also order food and beverages right from her seat. An extra perk was that each seat had an electric outlet. This made it easy for Carla to plug in her computer and do work on her trip.\nOn her last trip, Carla decided to sign up for that airline's loyalty program. She would earn points for every trip she made. Those points could be used towards air travel. The airline worker informed Carla that she could earn even more points if she signed up for the airline sponsored credit card. The card had a low interest rate and no annual fee. For every dollar Carla spent, she would earn one point to use towards travel. Carla signed up for the credit card. She had good credit, so she was approved. Carla used that credit card to pay for a round-trip ticket to Boston.\nAfter only one trip, Carla had earned enough points for a free one-way ticket. That saved her almost $500. It felt like traveling for free. Carla decided to stay loyal to this airline."

That was a real disappointment. I had been looking forward to seeing her latest Halloween creation. Audrey is a fine seamstress, and every year she makes the best costumes for the Halloween parties we try to attend. On the other hand, I usually just put some old rags on and go as a hobo or a pirate, or something lame like that, but not Audrey. She goes all out. Last year, she went as a beautiful witch complete with the pointy hat and witch's broom. She looked beautiful.\nThe Halloween tradition is very old in the United States. No one really knows how it was first celebrated, but it did come from somewhere in Europe. It was originally called \"All Hallows Eve\", and celebrated on last day of October. It precedes \"All Hallows Day\", which is a day to honor dead relatives. Today, it means parties for the adults and \"Trick or treating\" for the kids. \"Trick or treating\" is where kids also dress up in costumes and go door to door to get candy treats. It's a whole lot of fun.\nSome people say Halloween is a Welsh, or Celtic tradition, while others say its roots are Christian, but it doesn't really matter anymore. We just like to get dressed up like fools, go to parties, and eat lots of candy! Audrey finally showed up at my door. She was strikingly beautiful. She was dressed as a fairy princess and was glowing in her white gown. \"You look amazing,\" I told her. She just laughed and said, \"I know,\" and tapped me with her wand."

People can tune in to their local broadcast television station and see it happening in real time. These car chases are often captured with the help of a news channel's helicopter. The helicopter follows and films the chase through the streets, reporting what streets the cars are passing through.\nPeople like watching car chases for many reasons. They are intense, and filled with drama. A viewer never knows what will happen next. Will the driver give up easily? Does the driver have a weapon? Will the driver get into an accident? Will someone crossing the street get hit? Tune in to find out! Many channels see their ratings soar when they air car chases. They are just giving the people what they want.\nPolice are not always happy with the media covering car chases live on the air. Police worry that people trying to escape enjoy the attention. Police feel that broadcasting car chases encourages people to escape. Police also worry that the attention brings innocent bystanders to the street. Someone could get hurt. The media insists they have the right to show car chases. They feel they are informing the public.\nCar chases happen for many reasons. Sometimes police will chase someone who stole a car. Other times the police may try to do a routine traffic stop. However, the driver with the broken taillight may have a warrant for arrest, so off he drives."

        "content": "During the early part of the 20th Century, polio was considered one of the greatest health threats in the United States of America. Polio was a vicious disease that took its victim's lives, or left them with major disabilities. In 1952, the U.S. suffered one of its harshest epidemics of polio in its history. More than 58,000 cases of polio were reported that year, and 3,145 people lost their lives. Additionally, more than 21,000 people suffered some form of paralysis that ranged from mild paralysis to extreme cases where people became disabled. Dr. Jonas Salk is responsible for ending that plague.\nBorn in New York City on October 28, 1914, Jonas Salk grew up in modest surroundings. His parents were not wealthy, but they were able to put food on the table, and maintain a roof over their children's head. Salk demonstrated great academic success from childhood. By the age of 13, he was enrolled into a school for gifted children. He was considered a perfectionist by his peers, and succeeded academically in a very competitive environment. In college, Salk opted to go into medical school even though his mother wanted him to become an attorney. After graduating from medical school, Salk began his research on polio, which was considered a scourge of western society.\nPolio had baffled medical science since its discovery in the mid-19th Century. When Salk turned his attention to the disease, there was little hope that anyone could find an adequate cure. Salk developed his vaccine in the early 1950s, and in April of 1955, his accomplishment was heralded in newspapers across the country. Salk became a national hero. His vaccine effectively ended the polio epidemic in the United States and many countries around the world."

One story says that a famous brothel owner named Eve gave the city its name. Another version of history claims the name has its roots in show business with performers calling New York the \"Big Apple\" since it was the best place to get noticed. There is one legend that says the city got its name because of the large number of unemployed selling apples on the streets of New York City during the Great Depression.\nThe term more likely has its roots in horse racing from the 1920's. Prizes were called \"apples\" and a newspaper reporter when writing about races often would call the big prize the big apple. In fact, the \"big apple\" soon was used to mean any big city. In the late 1920s through the 1940s, \"The Big Apple\" was not just a nickname for New York, it was also the name of a song, a dance, and a place to dance and sing. New York City was the heart of the jazz music scene in the 1930's and 1940s. In Harlem, uptown Manhattan, there was a club called \"The Big Apple\". There was also a 1938 short film of the same name featuring black jazz  musicians and dancers.\nIn the 1970s, the city tourism agency began using the term the \"Big Apple\" on purpose. There is even a street corner in Manhattan called \"Big Apple Corner\". One New York City baseball team, the New York Mets, have a big red apple that pops out whenever the Mets hit a home run in their stadium Citifield. While the origins of the \"Big Apple\" nickname are unclear, it seems to be here to stay."

Going from one home to another is a difficult task, but it can be manageable if it's done properly. The best thing to do is to create a checklist for all the different things that must be taken care of when you move from one place to another. Utility bills, which include gas, light, and water, must be transferred from your old place to the new one. Additionally, cable and Internet service companies should be notified if you choose to continue your service with the same company. The U.S. Postal Service should also be notified of your new address so that your mail can be forwarded to your new address without much interruption of service.\nIn addition to getting all your services transferred to your new home, you should shop for the best possible price from a moving company. Moving company rates vary greatly and it could become very expensive to move from one home to another. Some of the factors moving companies use to establish your costs are distance to the new home and the amount of goods that are being transported. Another option would be to rent a moving vehicle and doing the work yourself. This will certainly cut down your costs, but it is a lot of heavy work.\nThe last thing you need to do when moving to a new place is to inform your family and friends of your new address. This is a courtesy for the most part, but it could help you in the long run. Be sure to change the locks on your new apartment or house. You never want to keep the same locks because you never want strangers to have access to your new home."

His show is described as a tabloid talk show because of the controversial subjects covered, and because of the people who appear on the show. Springer does not invite celebrities to his show. Instead, he opts to showcase regular Americans from all walks of life. He is a former politician who served one term as mayor of the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, in the 1970s.\nHis show debuted in 1991 as a politically themed talk show, where he invited celebrities such as Oliver North, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson. The show was designed to mimic another popular daytime talk show, the Phil Donahue show. The show found moderate success, but in 1994, in order to boost ratings, the show transitioned to a more sensational format. In this new format, everyday people were confronted by family members, and friends, about controversial subjects.\nThe show has been highly-rated for decades now, but has also come under fire from many groups who claim the subjects are not appropriate for daytime television. Springer does not shy away from any subject. Guests are confronted about subjects such as adultery, prostitution, homosexuality, and hate group membership. Often, these confrontations become violent, where guests engaged in physical confrontations. The Springer show has spawned numerous copycat shows over the years, but it still out-rates every other show of its kind.\nIn May of 2000, controversy hit the show when a female guest on the Springer show was murdered by her ex-husband after viewing the episode. Springer, his producer, and the network were sued by the woman's children. The suit alleged that the controversial nature of the show led to the murder, eventually though, the suit was dropped."

Although the parade went by without a problem, the LAPD's Public Information Officer said that there was an increase in alcohol related arrests than when the Kings won the Stanley Cup in 2012.\nAccording to Christopher Harris, who attended the parade with his family, a lot of people who attended the parade had gone to the bars surrounding the Staples Center, and had gotten drunk before attending the parade. \"I saw one person throw up on the street in front of a policeman. They put him in the back of the police car,\" Harris said. The cheers from the crowd started getting louder and louder as the players from the Kings started passing by.\nRobert Lopez, who attended the parade even though he was rooting for the New York Rangers, said that the Kings fans started getting really annoying. He was pretty sure it was because of the alcohol; everyone seemed pretty drunk. Lopez said that he was glad that he didn't bring his New York Rangers jersey, as he originally planned on, because he said people would have definitely thrown stuff at him.\nA public relations worker for Los Angeles Kings issued a statement for the hockey organization saying that they do not condone people to drink before going to attend the parade. He went on to say that they took the precaution of having the parade start earlier than it did in 2012 so that people didn't have a chance to go get a drink. It seems as if it still failed."

Nixon ran for president for the first time in 1960, losing to the very charismatic and young Democrat, John F. Kennedy. The 1960 election was one of the closest elections in history. Kennedy went on to become one of the most popular presidents ever.\nDespite his loss to Kennedy in 1960, Nixon bounced back in the 1968 election when he defeated Democrat, Hubert Humphrey in a landslide victory. The country was in turmoil during the 60s. The conflict in Vietnam was raging, the country was reeling from the assassinations of John F.

Among his accomplishments was to open trade with China, and his promise to end the conflict in Vietnam. However, Nixon would end up resigning from office just a year after his victory.\nIt was discovered that the Republican Party, with Nixon's knowledge, had secretly recorded the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C. during the weeks leading up to the election. Nixon tried to cover up the scandal, but the pressure was too great.

Some people register a list of items they want or need for their new home at a local store or stores. Some common items people will put on a gift registry include kitchen tools like knives and items like curtains. Even if there isn't a registry, a good housewarming gift is something to decorate the new house with like a piece of art or a plant. You can also bring food or drinks to share with the other guests. This is often appreciated since at a housewarming there isn't a lot of food served, usually just appetizers or sandwiches. There are usually no planned activities like games at a house warming party. The host or hostess of the party will, however, probably give all the guests a tour of their new home. Sometimes, because a housewarming party happens shortly after a person moves into their new home, people may be asked to help unpack boxes. This isn't usual though.\nHousewarming parties get their name from the fact that a long time ago people would actually bring firewood to a new home as a gift. This was so that the person could keep their home warm for the winter. Now most homes have central heating and don't use fires to keep warm."

Two years had passed since then, and Johnny had no intention of cutting it anytime soon.\nJohnny loved his long hair, and took good care of it. Every day he would wash it and brush it fifty times. Johnny felt so cool with his long hair. It made him look like a rock star. While in high school, Johnny always had short hair. Although it did not look unappealing, he was not too fond of his short hair, and desired to grow it out one day. He made a promise to himself to do so after graduation. Johnny had gone through with his promise.\nJohnny's hair received plenty of attention. As he walked down the street, he often heard \"Nice hair kid,\" from strangers. \"Thank you very much,\" Johnny would reply, feeling flattered. Once, Johnny passed by a group of girls who giggled and looked at him. \"I like your hair,\" one of them said to Johnny as he walked away. Being the cool cat that he now was, Johnny loved every minute of having long hair.\nJohnny wondered why he didn't decide to let his hair grow sooner. It was the best decision he had ever made, and nothing in the world could make him cut it."

        "content": "Memorial Day is a United States holiday to remember the men and women who have died while serving in the armed forces. The armed forces include all branches of the U.S. military. Those branches are Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard. Memorial Day is a federal holiday, which means government offices, banks, post offices, and schools are closed. Memorial Day is always observed on the last Monday of May. Memorial Day has its roots in the U.S. Civil War when a holiday, Decoration Day, was established to honor both Union and Confederate soldiers who died. On Decoration Day people used to \"decorate\" the graves of deceased soldiers with flags and flowers. The name Memorial Day became more widely used after World War II in the late 1940s. However, the holiday wasn't officially called Memorial Day until 1967.\nMemorial Day is commemorated by ceremonies in cemeteries across the country. The most well-known one is held in Arlington National Cemetery near Washington D.C. Arlington is a military cemetery, meaning only military personnel are buried there. Volunteers place U.S. flags on military graves at Arlington and other national cemeteries. There are also parades in honor of fallen service people held in different towns and cities. Another Memorial Day tradition is flying the U.S. flag at half staff until noon, meaning it is flown at half its normal height. This is considered a sign of mourning. The flag is raised to its full height after noon as a sign that the military will rise up despite the loss. There is also a national Memorial Day concert that takes place on the lawn of the U.S. Capital.\nMemorial Day is also known as the unofficial start of the summer season. Many beaches and pools open up for Memorial Day weekend. Many people also host barbecues on Memorial Day weekend."

He wrote two of the most significant novels, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which provided the settings for his novels.\nClemens held a variety of odd jobs as a young man. He was a journalist, miner, printer's apprentice, and typesetter, but journalism was what he liked doing best. His writing style earned him praise from critics worldwide. William Faulkner, another great American author, called him \"The Father of American Literature.\"\nTwain was already a very successful writer when he wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. The main character Tom Sawyer was based on his own experiences as a child. His best friends were also based on real-life friends Twain grew up with. Huckleberry Finn, the main character of his finest work, was also based on a childhood friend.\nTwain was a prolific writer who penned several books, and other publications. Most of his writing was taken from his life in the western part of the United States while traveling with his brother Orion. He was born Christian, but later in life questioned his faith, and developed negative feelings toward organized religion. He was once quoted as saying, \"If Christ were here, now there is one thing he would not be - Christian.\" Twain died in 1910 from a heart attack at the age of 74."

        "content": "One of the world's greatest tragedies was the sinking of the luxury liner Titanic. Although it was a British ship, many Americans were on board during that terrible night of April 15, 1912. The ship was on its maiden voyage on that night when it struck an iceberg in the deep waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. The ship was in route to New York City from Southampton, UK when it hit the iceberg, killing more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers. The ship was the largest ship ever built to that date, and was thought to be unsinkable.\nThe ship's passengers varied from some of the richest people in the world at the time, to thousands of immigrant workers who were trying to find work in the United States. The Titanic was equipped with technological safety features like remote control watertight doors, and watertight compartments, but it did not carry enough lifeboats for all passengers. Because of the immense size of the ship, it was thought to be unsinkable, a fact that contributed to the small number of lifeboats carried on the ship. Additionally, many of the lifeboats were not filled to capacity when they were launched, causing more loss of life.\nMost of those killed that night were men. The protocol followed by the ship's officers required \"women and children first,\" when loading lifeboats. The accident was met by international shock and grief. Many of today's maritime rules were put into place because of this disaster. Only 705 passengers floating on lifeboats were saved that night. The ship broke into two parts before it went under. It remains more than a mile deep in the North Atlantic. The sinking of the Titanic has been documented in film and literature over the years."

Living in Southern California without a car is not a good idea. The region is so spread out that it could take hours getting from one part of town to another if you use public transportation. You are not anyone in Los Angeles if you don't have a car, or at least that is what some people say.\nBefore that, Mario had never owned or bought a car in his life. His father warned him about the sales people. \"Don't ever pay the asking price, son,\" he said. Mario looked at him with disbelief. \"What do you take me for, dad? I am not an idiot. I know not to pay the first offer,\" he screamed back. His dad offered to go with him to the car dealer, but Mario wanted to go alone. It was his money and his car, and he was determined to do this alone.\nWhen Mario got to the car dealer, a nice man came up to him and asked if he wanted to take the car he was looking at for a test drive. Mario said, \"Yes, of course.\" So they went for a drive. Mario fell in love with the car and the salesman knew immediately that he was going to make some money. It turns out that you should never let a salesman know you're interested in anything you want to purchase. Mario didn't know how to negotiate and wound up paying too much for the car. He really didn't care, though. He owned his first car. When he told his dad what he paid for it, he thought his dad was going to be mad, but he just said, \"That's okay, son. That same dealer ripped me off when I bought my first car, too.\""

        "content": "Getting into a new place to live is a very exciting time. This is especially true if the person looking for a new home or apartment is a first-time renter. Having a place to call your own gives you a great feeling of independence. The question that arises when looking for an apartment or home to live in is, \"Is it better to rent or lease.\" Both options have advantages and disadvantages. The best way to go about making this decision is to base it on your own personal situation.\nRenting is a simple process that usually does not require the person to stay in that space for a specific length of time. In California, and in most states, this is called a month-to-month rental agreement. A landlord will generally require the new renter to pay two months of rent in advance. The property owner is also likely to ask for a security or cleaning deposit, or both. The advantage of a month-to-month rental is that the renter can get out of the agreement by simply giving the owner a one-month notice to vacate. The same applies to the owner. If the owner asks the renter to leave, all he or she has to do is to ask the renter to vacate in 30 days.\nA lease works a bit differently. It's usually signed for one year, so both the renter and the landlord agree to a pre-determined length of time the renter will occupy the unit. The renter signs a contract agreeing not to move out of the home for the one-year period. After that, it works much like renting. There are consequences on the part of both parties if the lease is terminated early though, so it is better to wait your lease out than to terminate it early."

        "content": "Unlike many countries in the world, the United States traffic flows on the right-hand side of the road. This may cause some confusion for persons who come from a country that drives on the left. The tradition of driving on the right goes back to before the advent of the automobile. The first law enacted to require people to drive on the right was passed in the city of Philadelphia in 1792. Cities throughout the country soon followed, and the tradition became common.\nIn addition to driving on the right, most Americans use various lights installed into vehicles to signal other drivers of their intentions. The most used lights on a car are the headlights, high beams, turn signals, emergency flashers, and backup lights. Headlights and high beams are used in night driving. It is illegal to drive with high beams constantly on because they can blind drivers driving in the opposite direction, but headlights are required at all times after dark. Turn signals let other drivers know you are about to make a turn to either the right or the left. These signals should be used every time a vehicle is about to make a turn.\nEmergency flashers are continuously blinking yellow lights that drivers use when their vehicle is disabled, or they are experiencing an emergency. Backup lights are white lights that come on whenever the car's transmission is put into the reverse mode. These lights help the driver see what's behind them when backing up. All of these signal lights are important for the safe operation of a motor vehicle. By using these tools properly, a driver can make driving for all people a safe and enjoyable experience."

Most of the city at the time was built of wood. This, combined with the famous Chicago winds and a drought, made the city burn down quickly. The fire lasted for three days. 100,000 people were left homeless, and at least 300 were killed. What was amazing was how quickly the city was rebuilt, eventually becoming the third most populous city in the United States.\nThe Great Boston Fire of 1872 created a property damage of $73.5 million,  more than any other fire in the U.S. history. Most of Downtown Boston and the financial district burned down in the fire that began in a warehouse basement. 30 people died, and thousands lost their jobs and their homes. However, the city was rebuilt in two years. It began enforcing building regulations because of the fire.\nThe 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City caused the fourth highest loss of life from an industrial accident in the U.S. history. 123 women and 23 men, all garment workers and mostly poor immigrants, died from the fire, smoke inhalation, or falling or jumping to their deaths. Child labor was not uncommon. The youngest victims were two 14-year-old girls who worked  in the factory. So many people died because the owners of the factory locked the doors to the stairs and exits. This was to prevent the workers from taking breaks and stealing. As a result of the fire and huge loss of life, many people began protesting poor working conditions. The U.S. Congress passed laws improving factory safety conditions. Women workers also formed a union to fight for better working conditions."

Woodstock was designed to show how the young generation can coexist with the older generation of Americans by living in harmony with one another.\nAlthough the event did not occur in the town of Woodstock, New York, the city has become synonymous with the celebration. More than 400,000 young people gathered at the dairy farm in the small town of White Lake, New York to witness music history in the making. Rolling Stone Magazine listed the event as one of \"the 50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock n' Roll.\" Some of the biggest names in rock history performed at the three-day event, including The Who, the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, and Jimi Hendrix. In all, 32 acts performed at the outdoor festival, and it was free of charge to all.\nTwo soundtracks were released in the following two years.

Sometimes superstores are also called big box stores. Many times they are chain stores owned by one company.\nThe flyers all had different messages about the superstore opening. One set of flyers invited him and others to apply for jobs at the store. The jobs paid well and even offered some benefits. Mark thought this was a good thing since he knew many people were looking for work. Another set of flyers included coupons to be used on opening day. The store had many bargains for common items like paper towels, but also for big screen televisions. Mark thought this too was a good thing. It seemed like a good idea to be able to get a variety of things in one place instead of going from one store to another. It would save time and money. Superstores could sell groceries and clothes under one roof.\nAnother set of flyers contradicted the positive messages about the superstore though. Some local residents were organizing a protest of the superstore. The flyers said that the superstore was bad for the community because it threatened the business of smaller stores in the area. Mark thought about Mr. Hernandez who owned a small grocery store down the block. That was where Mark bought staple food items like eggs and milk.

        "content": "It was a bright and sunny day in the city of Pasadena. The wind made the trees sway back and forth outside the happy couple's apartment. The neighborhood where they lived was peaceful. Mike and Maria were enjoying a Sunday afternoon in the comfort of their cozy, one-bedroom apartment. Despite having two months living there, Mike and Maria had yet to meet any of their neighbors.\nMaria once brought up the issue to Mike one night. Mike simply brushed the matter aside. He was content being left alone with Maria. He did not feel the need to interact with any strangers. Maria felt otherwise. She suggested the idea of going to their neighbor's house one day and knocking on their front door. Mike thought this was a terrible idea. He did not want to intrude on anybody's time. Maria tried convincing him that a friendly greeting is not intrusive.\nAfter much effort, Mike finally budged. He agreed to go meet the neighbors one day. It was that sunny afternoon on a Sunday that Maria remembered Mike's promise. She reminded Mike of the promise he had made. Since they were not doing anything that day, she told him now would be a good time to go meet the neighbors.\nMike had completely forgotten about the conversation and let out a reluctant groan. \"Do we have to, Maria? How about we do it next week?\" he said. \"No, we could do it today, right now,\" she replied. Maria went to the bedroom to quickly put on her shoes. She came back with Mike's shoes as well and threw them in front of him. He reluctantly put them on. Maria pulled Mike off the couch and dragged him all the way to their neighbor's front door. She rang the doorbell. A man answered the door."

        "title": "Attachment Parenting",
        "content": "Having your kid physically attached to you probably doesn't sound like fun, but an American pediatrician, William Sears, promotes a style of parenting that keeps small children as physically attached as possible. This is called attachment parenting.\nThe idea behind attachment parenting is that if a small baby feels protected and safe by physical contact with their parent, especially their mother, that child will grow up to be a more independent adult. One way parents are encouraged to be close to their babies is by using a sling or a wrap to carry the baby around instead of putting the baby in a carriage. This is often called \"wearing\" your baby. Parents are also encouraged to sleep with their babies. Parents are too big to fit in a crib, so instead parents are told to bring the baby into the adult bed. This is supposed to teach the baby about sleep regulation as well since the baby will learn to mimic adult sleep patterns. This co-sleeping is controversial though. There are concerns that babies sleeping with adults could suffocate, accidentally get crushed, or fall off the bed. There is also concern about sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, where babies just suddenly stop breathing.\nAnother marker of attachment parenting is not worrying about spoiling a baby. Many times parents feel that paying attention to a baby's every cry makes them too needy or spoiled. Attachment parenting feels that every baby's cry should be responded to and that the baby should never be left to \"cry it out.\" Instead, the baby should be comforted and crying should be taken as a signal that the baby needs something. Most attachment parents also breastfeed on demand, feeling that not only is this physically healthier, but also promotes a bond between mother and child."

        "content": "Once a child finishes 5th or 6th grade in elementary school, they graduate and go on to middle school or junior high school. This school is a separate building or set of buildings. Most students in middle school are between the ages of 10 and 14. The grade system continues in middle school. Middle school usually starts with 6th or 7th grade and ends with 8th grade. While they are less common, some elementary schools go from kindergarten to 8th grade.\nMost students are assigned a middle school based on where they live. However, there are charter, private, and specialized public middle schools that have an application process. The purpose of middle school is to provide a transition period between elementary school and high school. Middle school prepares students for high school life. In middle school students don't stay in one classroom all day with one teacher. Students change classrooms for different subjects and have different teachers for each subject. In middle school some students may even be able to choose some of their own classes, called electives. There is a set of core classes that all students have to take. These include English, math, science, and social studies or history classes. Gym or physical education classes are also required.\nA common feature of middle school is a homeroom, which is a classroom students visit at a scheduled time once a day or once a week. A homeroom teacher takes attendance and makes announcements of things students need to know. The homeroom also helps students feel like there is one common place and one common teacher they see regularly. This is to help with the transition from elementary school to secondary school. Once a student finishes middle school, they have a graduation ceremony and go to a high school assigned to them or a high school they picked."

She wanted to see if they still had the televisions. Janice saw that they didn't. People started looking at her, because her hair was a mess. She felt embarrassed and went back to get her stuff.\nWhile she was going back home, she noticed another store that was open. She decided to go in, and was surprised to see that they had the television she wanted. It was $500, instead of $300. She bought the television and asked one of the workers if they could take it out to her truck. She went home and asked her brother to help her move the television.

The two boys were Joey and Bob, and they were trying to see who could ride their bikes faster. On one race, Bobby got out to a big lead, but Joey was getting closer. Bobby was getting tired and Joey was able to pass him. Suzie was having fun watching them when her mother came outside and asked her what she was doing. Im watching the boys ride their bicycles, Mommy, she said. Then Suzie asked her mom if she could teach her how to ride. Her mom thought about it for a while. She was thinking that Suzie might be too young to learn how to ride, but in the end, she thought it was time for her to learn.\nSuzie was only four years old at the time. She was a little scared at first, but she loved the bike her mother had bought her and was very excited. Her mom held onto the bike as Suzie slowly started to peddle. She gained speed and was having fun when she fell on the sidewalk scraping her knee. Suzie began to cry from the pain, but her mom told her she was okay. After a few minutes, Suzie stopped crying and got back on her bike and started peddling again. She fell a few more times, but didnt cry much after that. She just kept getting up and tried again and again. Suzie was learning how to keep her balance and was riding along when she noticed that her mother wasnt holding the bike anymore. She got scared, but soon realized she could ride a bike all by herself. Suzie was very happy."

        "content": "The exact birth date of the American inventor, educator, and scientist, George Washington Carver, is unknown. This is because Carver was born into a state of slavery, and many slave owners did not record the dates their slaves were born. Carver's claim to fame was the development of alternative crops for southern farmers, whose main cash crop was cotton. Cotton farming is hard on the land. It depletes the soil of its richness from over-farming, and leaves the farmland useless after multiple uses. Carver recognized this, and began working on other crops that were more soil friendly.\nHe conducted extensive research, and promoted such crops as peanuts, soybean, and sweet potatoes for small farms in an attempt to improve the farmer's quality of life. By growing these crops instead of cotton, the soil would remain nutritious, and as an added bonus, the crops could be consumed by the farmers to help sustain a healthier diet.\nBorn in either 1864, or 1865, Carver was one of 11 children born to his slave parents in Diamond, Missouri. Tragedy hit his family hard. All 10 of Carver's brothers and sisters died at a young age. When he was just one-week old, Carver, and his mother, and a sister were kidnapped, and sold in Kentucky. The family was aided by anti-slavery sympathizers, and the family was reunited in Missouri. Shortly after that, slavery was abolished, and Carver was encouraged to continue his education. He tried enrolling into a public school in Missouri, but was turned away because he was black.\nEven though slavery was abolished, blacks were still discriminated against. Carver was forced to attend a sub-standard school for blacks only. Carver's struggles in education continued throughout his academic career, but that did not deter him. He graduated from the Tuskegee Institute, and began his crop research shortly after graduation."

America is a society on the move; so many people do not take the time to eat properly. What happens in a typical day is that Americans turn to fast food restaurants whenever they are in a rush. Some of the more popular fast food restaurants are McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box, Carl's Jr., and White Castle. All these places offer a quick bite to eat at an economical price. However, the quality of the food has been suspected for years.\nThe fitness craze began as early as the 1970s, when people became aware that the fast food giants were serving food that promoted obesity. Coupled with beverage industry companies like Coca Cola, Pepsi, and 7UP, Americans were consuming too much salt in their food, and too much sugar in their beverages. Having realized the problem, Americans began making healthier eating choices. Those companies have also made major adjustments in the food they offer. Today, along with the old menu items such as hamburgers, fries, and sodas, the fast food restaurants now offer grilled chicken sandwiches and salads, too.\nMore Americans exercise on a regular basis these days, which helps promote a healthy metabolism and improve stamina. It also helps control blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Because of the healthy eating and exercise trends going on in America today, death rate has been reduced significantly. Most Americans grew up on fried, greasy food, but more and more people are making the right food choices. Americans are adaptable people."

While Memorial Day remembers those who have died while serving in any of the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces -- Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard, Veterans Day honors all members of the armed forces, especially the living. As a U.S. federal holiday, government offices and schools are closed, and most people have the day off from work. Banks are also closed. If November 11th falls on a Sunday, then the holiday is observed on the following Monday.\nThe holiday was first observed after World War I, which ended On November 11 1918. It was called Armistice Day then and was more about celebrating the absence of war and honoring those that served in that one war. It didn't become known as Veterans Day until 1954 after World War II and the Korean War, when there were many more members of the armed forces.\nMany restaurants offer free meals to veterans on the date. There is always a special ceremony at Arlington National Military Cemetery in Washington D.C. This ceremony involves a wreath being placed over the grave of The Unknown Soldier. Many major cities also hold parades on this date. The U.S. flag is usually flown at half-mast as a remembrance to those soldiers who have died and many ceremonies observe a moment of silence for the same reason. In Canada the holiday is called Remembrance Day. One symbol of the day is the poppy flower. The red poppy flower is said to represent or be a symbol of the blood of soldiers. Many people wear or give out poppy flowers on the day."

King was the leader of the African-American Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 60s. His use of non-violent protest to affect social change was based on his Christian beliefs. King was born Michael King, but his father changed his name in honor of the German reformer, Martin Luther.\nKing lived during the most divisive era in American history. The white and the southern culture in the United States wanted nothing to do with social change during the 60s. Segregation laws were in place that prohibited black Americans from eating at the same restaurants as whites, or to ride in the same section on public buses with white Americans. King led the famous 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott in reaction to Rosa Park's refusal to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger as was required by law in Montgomery, Alabama at the time.\nKing started his activism while serving as a Baptist minister for the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. He believed strongly in the Christian belief that loving thy neighbor as yourself, which was a philosophy he used throughout his civil rights years. He was also a great speaker. His \"I Have a Dream\" speech is regarded as one of the most famous oratory in American history. In it, he speaks of how his dream is for white and black Americans to walk together hand in hand as brothers. The speech also declared how it was his dream for all Americans to be judged, not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\nOn October 14, 1964, King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his involvement in combating racial inequality in the United States. He was assassinated in April, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee at the age of 39."

Only to David, summer vacation meant work, work, and more work! His dad was a workaholic. He had two jobs most of the time. He had one job during the day and the other at night, but sometimes he worked on weekends, too. The man had more energy than any persons alive. When he wasn't working on weekends at his third job, he worked at home and that was why David hated summer vacation.\nHis dad was always building something, or tearing something down. If he wasn't tearing down a wall, or adding a new room to the house, he was putting in a new driveway or garage. It was living hell for a 13-year-old kid. While all of David's friends were off playing baseball or riding their bicycles, he was usually hauling bricks or mixing cement. That's what he remembers about his childhood.\nDavid always knew he was in trouble whenever he heard \"Where's David!\" His dad's voice seemed to carry down the street. That phrase could only mean it was time to get to work. Of course David learned throughout the years how to make himself disappear at just the right times, but his dad usually found him anyway. \"But dad,I want to go to the park to play with my friends,\" David would say. \"You can waste time with your buddies some other time. It's time to get to work now,\" his dad would respond. It got so bad that David would intentionally fail classes so he would have to go to summer school. Summer school was for students who didn't do well during the regular school year, but he didn't care. It meant less work. It meant freedom!"

        "content": "Making an appointment to see the dentist is usually one of the smartest decisions a person could make for his or her health. However, for Marek, booking his dentist appointment ended up being one of the worst mistakes in his life. This was because of the fact that the dentist Marek chose to visit was his ex-girlfriend whom he had recently broken up with to be with another woman. This silly mistake resulted in Marek walking out of the dentist's office with all the 32 teeth missing.\n\"I didn't have any reason to doubt her,\" says Marek. \"I mean I thought she was a professional\". Quite on the contrary, his ex-girlfriend decided that this was the perfect chance to get her revenge for having been heart-broken. She gave him a heavy dose of anesthesia, pulled out all of his teeth, and bandaged his whole face up with gauze so that her work wouldn't be noticed until the bandages were all pulled off. \"The bandages are to protect your gums,\" she told Marek, who then left the office, still heavily numbed by the effects of the anesthesia.\nAs the anesthesia wore off on his way home, he could tell something was terribly wrong because he couldn't feel any teeth. One can only imagine the panic he must have felt after uncovering his ex's work under all the gauze. After reporting the event to the police, his ex is now facing the possibility of three years in prison for a doctor's malpractice suit. On the bright side for her, she might be spending those three years behind bars pleased at knowing that her shocking stunt was very effective in terms of getting even with Marek. After seeing that he no longer had any teeth, his new girlfriend broke up with him."

When his mom gave him the present, she told him that she would take him to a paintball range with some of his friends.  The range was in an open field and the company that owned the range provided safety equipment like padding and facemasks. Getting hit by a paintball hurt and could cause serious injury. The paintball range was 20 miles away, and Scott had to wait till the weekend to try out his new equipment. He didn't want to wait that long. He wanted to play with his new toy now.\nWhen his mom was taking a nap, he texted a friend who lived down the block to meet him in front of his house. \"I want to show you what I got for my birthday,\" Scott told his friend. He loaded up the paintball gun with the colored balls filled with brightly colored paint.  He started shooting it at the trashcans that were on the curb. Just then a police patrol car was driving down the street. Scott missed the trashcans and ended up shooting a paintball right at the police car. The police thought they were under attack. Scott knew he had done something wrong and ran inside the house with his friend. Soon a police helicopter was flying overhead, and Scott could hear police sirens approaching his house.\nThe sounds of the helicopter and the sirens woke up Scott's mother. She looked out her window and saw a spotlight right on her house, and three police cars arrived. \"What is going on?\" she wondered aloud. She went to the living room and turned on the local news to see if there was any information about what was happening in her neighborhood."

The parade takes place in the center of the city on Colorado Blvd, and features numerous floats, marching bands, equestrian teams, celebrities, and honorees. It is the most popular parade in the country. It has spawned several other  New Year's Day parades throughout the country. In Miami, it's the Orange Bowl Parade; in New Orleans, it is the Sugar Bowl Parade; in Arizona, it's called the Fiesta Bowl Parade. However, the Rose Parade is the oldest and best parade. Many people like to camp out in tents or in sleeping bags the night before to get the best locations to view the Rose Parade.\nTo brave the cold weather, some people bring portable heaters to keep them warm. It can get into the low 40s at night in Pasadena during the winter, so many people dress warm for the occasion. Food is another big feature at the pre-parade celebration on New Year's Eve. People bring their portable grills to cook their favorite outdoor meals right on the sidewalk. The rich aroma of the grilling food fills the night air, and most people are willing to share their food with other overnight campers. It is fun to sample different dishes from other grillers.\nAs night turns into morning, there is still electricity in the air. People are excited about the start of the parade, which begins at 8 a.m. sharp. The floats are beautifully decorated in flowers, while the dancers and other performers dress in colorful costumes, some of which are made just for the parade. The marching bands come from nearby cities, high schools, and colleges. It is considered a great honor to participate in the Rose Parade."

It was a nice, black car with four doors, leather seats, and a stick shift for changing gears. Mike was cautious about who he allowed to drive his car. In fact, he hardly let his own fiance, Maria, drive it.\nOne day, as Mike was lounging in the living room, Maria asked to borrow his car. \"Mike, I need to use your car because mine is out of gas, she asked, sweetly. Mike, cautious as he was, was reluctant to lend out his car. He questioned Maria in hopes that she would take back her request. \"Your car has absolutely no gas?\" he said, sounding mildly irritated. Maria assured him that the car had completely run out of gas, and that she needed to go buy a gallon of gas from the gas station.\nMike thought for a few seconds and proposed an alternative solution to his soon-to-be wife. \"Why don't I just go to the station to buy the gas, saving you the trouble of going yourself?\" he said. Maria did not mind this solution and was happy to let her soon-to-be husband go to the gas station for her. She thanked Mike and kissed him goodbye before he stepped out the door. \"Drive safely, Mike,\" she said from the door as he got inside his car. \"You know I always do, honey,\" he cheerfully replied with a smirk showing his confidence.\nMike pulled out of the driveway and made his way to the gas station. He returned thirty minutes later with the gas can in hand. On the drive back, Mike had noticed a noise hed never heard his car make before. Out of concern, he decided to take the car to his mechanic that afternoon. \"Maria, I'll be back. I'm going to the mechanic to see what's wrong with my car,\" he said after handing her the can of gas. Maria, knowing how much Mike loved his car, tried to console him."

His brother told him to try looking on Craigslist.\nAdrian looked on Craigslist for people who were selling records of his favorite bands. He had to look for sellers in the nearest city, and found one. His brother went into the city every week. Adrian asked his brother if he could go with him next time. His brother said yes. The person he found was selling his whole record collection for $200. Adrian was excited and took out the money he had been saving. Adrian's brother told him he had read about bad stuff happening to people over Craigslist.\nThey emailed the guy that was selling the records and told him to meet at a Starbucks. When Adrian and his brother got there, they saw the guy outside of the Starbucks drinking a coffee. He had a box of records with him. The guy told him that it actually wasn't his collection; it belonged to his brother who had passed away. He wanted to sell it to someone who would appreciate them and listen to them every day, like his brother once had. Adrian said that he would play one record a day.\nWhen Adrian got into his brother's car, he started looking through the records. He saw a copy of \"Abbey Road,\" by The Beatles and was happy. When he took the record out, he couldn't believe what he saw. It was autographed by all four members of the band."

        "content": "These days many people attend community colleges with plans to transfer to a four-year college or university to get a bachelor's degree. It's kind of like a stepping-stone. There are many reasons why people do this. One reason is that some community colleges have transfer agreements with private and state colleges and universities that guarantee admission. Even if a community college doesn't have that agreement of a guaranteed spot in a four-year college, it has articulation agreements with four-year schools. These agreements tell you exactly what classes a student in a community college needs to take in order to be able to transfer. These agreements make sure that students don't waste time taking classes that won't transfer. Most of these classes one needs to take before transferring are general education classes, like math and English.\nAnother reason why many students start their undergraduate degree at a community college is a financial one. A four-year college or university is much more expensive than a two-year college. This is especially true for immigrant students, who don't qualify for financial aid, loans or scholarships. Also community colleges tend to offer more evening classes so they can accommodate people who have to work while attending school. They are also a good option for older students with families, who need a more flexible schedule while taking care of children. Community colleges also tend to be commuter schools, meaning people don't have to live on campus in dorms. Attending a community college means you can still live at home with your parents, which can save the family a huge amount of money.\nIf a student didn't do well in high school, a community college would provide him or her with another opportunity to enter a four-year university. Community colleges offer many classes to help students develop their math and writing skills. When you attend a four-year college, you are expected to have those skills already. Community college will prepare students to successfully graduate from a four-year school."

Licensed stores sell numbered tickets, or people can pay to choose their own numbers. When you let a machine pick your numbers, it is usually called a Quick Pick. Many people play lucky numbers, numbers associated with birthdates or other important numbers to them. The money earned from selling lottery tickets goes to pay for schools, roads, bridges, and other public services. Once a week or more, a drawing is held where the numbers are randomly picked. If your ticket has those numbers, you could win a cash prize.\nThere are different types of lotteries, such as Powerball, Mega Millions, and Lotto. Powerball and Mega Millions are known for their large payouts. There are also instant lottery tickets that are scratch-off cards. The winnings tend to be less money, but they are extremely popular.\nIn the United States, you can play the lottery, or buy a ticket if you are 18 years or older. If you win, usually you have the option of being paid the entire amount in one lump sum or of being paid smaller amounts over a number of years. Lottery winnings are taxable, meaning the amount you actually get is smaller than the jackpot number. People can buy lottery tickets or play the lottery at many convenience stores. Lotteries are also very popular since they advertise. There are many television commercials, radio commercials, and billboards urging people to play.\nLotteries have been controversial since they are essentially a form of legalized gambling. There is concern that it can lead to people becoming addicted to gambling. There are also illegal lottery games, usually run by some forms of organized crime."

The tar pits are located on Wilshire Blvd in the heart of the city, and offer a snapshot into life in the city of L.A. 10,000 years ago. The George C. Page museum was built around the tar pits specifically to research the ancient attraction.\nLocated in the Hancock Park district of L.A., the tar pits are a continuous flow from deep inside the earth's crust that frequently uncovers prehistoric animals that were caught in the tar. Many of these animals' remains are on exhibit at the Page Museum, and excavation of new fossils is an ongoing process. The site is registered as a National Natural Landmark by the U.S. government.\nIn 2009, the Page Museum, which is part of L.A.'s Natural History Museum, announced the discovery of 16 fossil deposits in 2006 unearthed during the construction of an underground parking garage. A saber-toothed cat, six dire wolves, a bison, horses, giant sloth, and an American lion were among the animals discovered. A nearly complete mammoth was also unearthed at that time. The artifacts are now part of the Page Museum exhibit, and museum officials are certain there are more fossils to be found under the streets of L.A.\nThe museum is a major attraction to visitors to L.A., and is a primary science attraction for schools, clubs and other organizations interested in the past. It is a piece of living history that is in a constant state of change because of new discoveries. It is a good place to spend a leisurely afternoon in the City of Angels, which is open all year round."

        "content": "Father's Day is a holiday observed in the United States to honor fathers, fatherhood, and other paternal figures like grandfathers, stepfathers, and uncles. It is observed on the third Sunday in June.\nIn the early 20th century there was a mining accident in West Virginia that killed almost 400 men. A push for a day to remember the men killed, who were mostly husbands and fathers, was the start of a push for a national holiday. This was in 1908. It wasn't until 1972, however, that Father's Day was recognized by law as a national holiday. This is due in part to the fact that people were resistant to what they saw as another overly invented holiday meant to just make people spend money. It wasn't seen as a way to remember the dead or to honor living fathers and father figures. People weren't entirely wrong. Organizations representing men's clothing manufacturers put in a lot of money for the holiday to become popular.\nLike Mother's Day, it indeed is a holiday that has become highly commercialized. There are greeting cards to mark the day, and stores advertise gifts for Dad. These gifts traditionally include electronics, ties, and tools. In schools, children often make cards and other gifts. Father's Day is not a federal holiday even though it is widely celebrated. Some of the ways Father's Day is celebrated is with meals, especially barbecues since the holiday falls at the beginning of the summer."

It is a little more than 275 miles from the city of Los Angeles, which is where most of its visitors come from. Driving from Los Angeles is about four hours. Las Vegas, which means the Meadows in Spanish, was established by the Mexicans in the mid-1800s. Much of what is now the southwestern part of the United States was then part of the Mexican Empire. The city was a railroad town established in 1905, and the first legal casino appeared in 1931.\nLas Vegas is now a gambling town, where people from all over the United States come to vacation. Its population is under 2,000,000, making it the 30th largest city in the country. Its original population in 1905 was only 5,000. Much of the city's growth is due to the gambling industry. Many states have since legalized gambling, including New Jersey, and California, but Las Vegas remains the No. 1 tourist city for gamblers in the U.S. Today some of its largest and most beautiful hotels include Bellagio, Flamingo, Caesars Palace, Treasure Island, Mandalay Bay, and Wynn. These hotels are on Las Vegas Boulevard, which is commonly called \"The Strip.\" With its nearly year-round sunshine, beautiful casinos, and variety of gaming options, Las Vegas remains the best location for gambling in the U.S."

Sometimes it seems like the birthday parties are about showing off and entertaining the parents of kids in addition to children.\nMost children's birthday parties are held in the home of the birthday boy or girl. It used to be that children's parties were just for children. Parents would drop their kids off and come back when the party was over to bring them home. Now it is more common for the parents of guests to stay for the party as well. This gives the adults time and space to socialize while the kids play games. Kids and adults don't always have the same tastes in food. So when adults are invited to stay for a child's birthday party, there is usually fancier food for the adults like cheese, crackers, and fruit platters. Meanwhile the kids eat hot dogs and potato chips. While the children drink punch, juice, or soda, the parents may be sipping cocktails, beer, or wine.\nEntertainment for a party of mixed adults and children also goes beyond the usual clown or magician. Sometimes there will be a DJ, and the adults  will dance. Party games are not just for the kids, either. While the children play traditional games like pin the tail on the donkey, the adults may play casino-type games like blackjack or poker.\nNot everyone likes this trend of adults and children partying together. Some feel that the parties should be kept separate. Some people worry about adults getting drunk in front of the kids. Others worry about kids getting abused by adults they don't know. For others, it is just about allowing a kid to have their special day. There is also a concern that these mixed parties encourage a sense of competition among parents in a community."

It is a historic stadium, and arguably the most famous outdoor sports arena in the country. Los Angeles was picked by the International Olympic Committee to host the 1932 Olympics. The city leaders realized the stadium was too small, and began a major renovation. It is the only stadium to have hosted two modern Olympic games in the world, but it is much more than that.\nThe coliseum has also played host to other major league sporting events. It was the site of the 1959 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago White Sox. It played host to the original Super Bowl game in 1967 between the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs. The game was not called the Super Bowl at the time. It was known as the First AFL-NFL World Championship Game. It started what is now the largest annual sporting event in the country, if not the world. Baseball was king during those years, and was, and is still called the Great American Pastime.\nThe stadium is home  to the University of Southern California Trojan football team, which is one of the most historic college teams in the history of the sport. It also was the home field of the UCLA Bruin football team for a number of years. In 1984, the city of Los Angeles and the Coliseum played host to the XXIII Olympic Games, becoming the only stadium to hold that honor.

Many people in the U.S. are really dependent on their cars to get to work and school. In fact most American workers spend an hour driving to work each day. In order to drive in the U.S., you have to go to your local Department of Motor Vehicles first, and take a written test to get your learner's permit. If you pass this test, you can practice driving so you can pass a road test and get your license. The Department of Motor Vehicles or DMV has free booklets you can go and get to study for your learner's permit. You can also access the information online and even take a practice written exam. To prepare for the road test, you can have a friend teach you to drive or pay to take classes at a driving school. You cannot, however, practice driving by yourself. If you are caught driving with only a learner's permit, you can get into trouble with the law.\nOnce you get your driver's license in one state, you can use it to drive in all of the United States. Wherever you drive, you will see signs posted along the road indicating the speed limit. These numbers are not a suggestion. Generally you can drive faster on a highway than on local streets. Local police use special equipment to detect your speed. If they detect you are speeding or driving over the speed limit, police can stop you and give you a ticket. You will have to pay a fine, and some of the fines are more than $100. The lines painted on the road are not just to keep cars in their lanes.  They send a message. For example, a double solid yellow line means that it is against the law to pass another car here.to pass another car here."

Her dad paused for a minute, smiled and said to her, \"Then choose two\". Jenny went home with a white cat and a black dog, which were the best birthday present she had ever received."

        "content": "Generally people's \"class\" is defined by how much money they make. In the U.S. generally there are three classes: poor, middle class, and rich. Some people also think there is another class in between poor and middle class called working class. United States culture is based on the idea that people can move up the economic ladder and become middle class or even rich if they were born poor. This is the idea of going from \"rags to riches\". Moving up the class ladder is not easy though. Higher education needed to get a good paying job is expensive.\nClass in the United States is more than just how much money a person makes though. Education, what job a person has, where they live, and the culture, all play a role in what class a person will be classified as. For example, a person with only a high school diploma and a low-paying service job may be considered poor or low class. While a person with a Ph.D., who owns their own company, would be considered high class or wealthy.  In a way this makes sense because high-paying jobs usually require a high-level education. But for some people, class is something you are born with. For example, the children of billionaire Donald Trump were born rich and upper class without having done anything to earn that status.\nGender plays a role too in how someone can move up the economic ladder. Women earn less than men do, so it is harder for them to accumulate wealth. Race also plays a role in how much people earn and their ability to move up the economic ladder. In the United States, most families require both the man and woman to work in order to support the household."

She thought it was a garbage can. \"We have a garbage can already. Why did you get another one?\" Debbie asked. She seemed annoyed.\nRon explained that it was not a garbage can. It was a compost bin. Ron explained that a compost bin was a place where they could put any organic waste, like fallen leaves, grass clippings, and fruit and vegetable peels. \"Why can't we just throw that in the trash?\" Debbie asked. She really didn't want extra work for herself.` Ron explained that it was good for the environment. About 30% of all the garbage in the United States is made up of waste from food and yards. Not only would they produce less garbage, they would also make compost, which was rich soil. It would help Debbie's flowers. She could have the beautiful garden she always dreamed of. Ron explained that little by little inside the bin, the food scraps and green waste would create a pile. The pile would naturally break down.\n\"Where are we keeping this pile?\" Debbie asked. Ron said the bin would go in the back yard. Debbie wasn't convinced. She was worried about rats and roaches. Ron explained that as long as they didn't put any meat scraps or oily items in the compost bin, then rats wouldn't be a problem. Roaches, however, were a natural part of the materials breaking down.\nRon was especially excited about what he bought to put in the compost bin. He pulled out a small box and gave it to Debbie. She opened it and screamed before dropping the box on the floor. The box was filled with worms."

Drive-in theaters were first opened in Southern California because of the car culture that exists here. People could go see a movie in the comfort and privacy of their own car. I remember the first time I went to a drive-in. I was 18 years old and was dating my future wife Caroline. We went on a double-date with my best friend Alfred and his girl Jeannie. The drive-in we visited that night was called the Starlight. It was close to home, and it had the best sound system of all the drive-ins. It also had a huge screen. We went to see \"Forrest Gump\" that night, mainly because Carol wanted to see it. \"I heard it is a great movie,\" she said. I really didn't know anything about the movie, but I did want to see something.\n\"Forrest Gump\" was indeed one of the best movies ever made. It had everything -- humor, drama, tragedy, and triumph. It is a great film. Watching it that night under the stars with Carol on my arm was the greatest night. \"I tell you babe, I was wrong about this movie. I really liked it,\" I said. She just smiled and gave me a hug. Alfred and Jeannie were busy kissing in the back seat, which is another advantage of going to a drive-in.\nThose old drive-ins were around for decades, but soon after \"Forrest Gump\" came out, many of them started closing. They closed because of the new multiplex theaters popping up all over the country. People had a choice of many films to watch at those theaters, and soon the drive-in was gone. In Los Angeles, there is only one remaining drive-in I know of -- the Vineland. There might be more, but I don't know where. It is sad to see them go, but the memories are still with me."

That's when Christopher Baker decided to go to the store. He bought 10 bags of balloons, and went to his house to fill them up with water.

Christopher gave the orders to his friends. He told Joseph to hide behind his dad's car; he told Patrick to hide behind his mom's car. They each took four water balloons with them. Christopher told them to wait for his signal, and then they could throw the balloons.\nChristopher knew where three of the boys were hiding, so he went running and attacked them with five water balloons. Christopher then ran back to the place where he was hiding, but the boys were coming after him. Christopher yelled out, \"Now!\" Joseph and Patrick came out of hiding and attacked the boys with their water balloons. The boys went back. Christopher and his friends started laughing."

Hitler was convinced that the white, Aryan male was part of the superior race, and promised his games would prove this superiority on the Olympic stage. American track and field athlete, James \"Jesse\" Owens, had a different idea.\nOwens was an excellent athlete at Ohio State University during the early 1930s. During one track meet in 1935, Owens set three world records, and tied another, in what has been called \"the greatest 45 minutes ever in sports.\" Although Owens found great success in his athletic career, he grew up during a time in America when black people were still highly discriminated against. Segregation laws were still in effect in many parts of the country, and Owens felt this prejudice directly. He was not able to stay in the same hotel rooms as his white teammates, nor was he allowed to eat at the same restaurants. Ironically, Owens was treated better during his time at the 36th Olympics in Germany.\nDuring the games, Hitler became annoyed that Owens was winning so many gold medals. Owens was proving Hitler's racist claims and rhetoric as untrue. Hitler didn't like it. Owens ended up winning four gold medals at these games. Hitler refused to shake his hand. One of the defining moments of the games is when Owens was befriended by German athlete Luz Long. Owens cherished his friendship with Long, especially because he knew that Long could fall out of favor with Hitler's brutal regime.\nMany German fans shook Owen's hands, even though Hitler did not, but when Owens returned to the United States, he found not much had changed in there."

In the United States, Darwin has become the symbol for atheists in the country as his theory of evolution smacks in the face of creationism. His theory claims that all of earths species have descended from their ancestors, and that they have adapted to their surroundings throughout history. It also claims that every species has a common ancestor. Darwin introduced his theory in his landmark book On the Origin of Species in 1859.\nHis book was met with suspicion from both the scientific community and the general public, but by the 1870s, his work was beginning to gain mass acceptance. One of his most significant studies came when he sailed with the HMS Beagle, a British sea vessel, to the Galapagos Islands. The islands have been long isolated from the South American mainland, and provided him with a unique insight on the process of evolution.\nWhile sailing from island to island, Darwin noticed similarities between island species and mainland species. Most were similar in many ways, but some had subtle differences. He also found that the same species had differences from island to island. To Darwin it was clear that the reason for the slight differences was the individual environment of each island. These islands showed Darwin the evolution process in the making.\nDarwin has many critics from religious circles. A very famous caricature of Darwin depicting him as a half-human monkey was published in 1871 in response to his theory that humans evolved from ape-like creatures. He spawned a movement of non-believers called Darwinism, which includes people who feel his theories are rooted in the scientific method as opposed to religious dogma."

The driver, whose name is not being released at the moment due to an investigation, along with the two students are being treated at Belmont Hospital. The parents were notified as soon as possible by school officials.\nAccording to John Pineda, who witnessed the accident, the school bus almost hit the car. \"The bus wasn't going that fast, but the other car was. If the bus had hit the car, those people inside would surely have been seriously injured, or worse,\" Pineda said. Pineda also said that the driver of the school bus took precaution to turn where people weren't walking. If he were to have made a right, rather than a left, he would have definitely hit people that were crossing the street.\nPeterson issued a statement saying that the students who were inside the bus could miss school the next day to make sure they were okay, and relax with their family. According to Peterson, the police provided him with a list of students that were involved in the accident. Police are looking for the driver of the car that passed the red light.

Armstrong enjoyed years of glory from adoring American public during his cycling career for nearly a decade. Between 1999 through 2005, Armstrong won the famous Tour de France road cycling event seven consecutive years. This is a feat that no other person in the history of the famed race has ever accomplished. He was an American hero who benefited greatly from his fame and fortune. During those years, no other athlete in the United States was more popular than Armstrong.\nArmstrong was born in 1971 in Plano, Texas. By the age of 12, he had been competing in swimming competitions with great success. At 16, Armstrong began competing in the grueling triathlon races, where contestants must cycle, swim, and run for several miles. His Tour de France records were superior to any other racer in the history of the annual event, which began in 1903. However, Armstrong had a dark side.\nAfter he retired from competition in 2011, allegations of drug use began to surface. The United States Anti-Doping Agency began investigating the cyclist, and eventually found he had used performance-enhancing drugs during his years competing in the Tour de France.\nArmstrong denied any wrongdoing, but the USADA stripped him of his titles. He was also barred from ever competing professionally again. This was followed by a lifetime ban from the Union Cycliste Internationale, an international racing organization. Armstrong did not admit to using drugs until January, 2013 on the Oprah Winfrey Show. He claimed that he was not the only athlete using drugs on the tour, and that he was being singled out because of his success. However, that did not matter; this American hero had fallen."

Major League Baseball traces its roots back to the 1880s, but the game had been enjoyed by Americans for decades before then. The origins of the game are in question. For many years a 19th Century American named Abner Doubleday was credited with creating the game, but this has been proven  inaccurate today.\nOne theory is that the game was brought across the Atlantic Ocean during the great European migration of the 18th Century, and that it is based on the British game of cricket. Cricket is a very popular sport in England, but it is played by mostly the upper-class members of that society, and it is unlikely that the poor immigrants from England played the game very much. However, it more closely resembles the game of rounders, which is another English sport that shares many common features as the American game of baseball.\nIn any event, the game became very popular in the United States. By the 20th Century, the American League, and the National League were taking the country by storm. The greatest single team in either league's history is the New York Yankees. The Yankees have won more World Series titles than any other team in history.\nThe World Series is a seven-game competition with the two top teams from either league. The first team to win four games is declared the World Series Champion. In 1903, The Boston Americans won the first World Series beating the Pittsburgh Pirates. This was the start of an annual series matchup between the two leagues. To date, the Yankees have won 27 championships in 40 appearances, with the team's most recent title coming in 2009.

It has been an official federal holiday since 1894, meaning that government offices including post offices and schools are closed.\nIt is also widely thought that Labor Day was created as an alternative holiday to May Day. May Day, especially in the 1800s, had become a protest day, when workers marched to demand better rights and working conditions. There were often strikes that ended in violence. At the time, the U.S. government was afraid that May Day was being led by communists and was having a bad influence on workers. Some people feel September was also chosen since there are no other holidays between Fourth of July and Thanksgiving in November.\nOn Labor Day there are usually parades in major cities around the country. Politicians and labor leaders make speeches and hold press conferences. Labor Day is also considered the unofficial end of summer. Many people celebrate Labor Day with trips to the beaches, picnics, and barbecues. Many towns and cities host fireworks on this day. Many people also take their last summer vacations around this time. Labor Day is also the beginning of the professional and college football season in the U.S.\nLabor Day has also become an important retail holiday.

She decided to try and use an airline loyalty program to see if that would help.\nThere was one airline that Carla preferred to travel on. Every time she used that airline, there were hardly any delays and the trip was always comfortable. That airline featured in-seat DIRECTV, so she could watch her favorite television shows while traveling. She could also order food and beverages right from her seat.

This made it easy for Carla to plug in her computer and do work on her trip.\nOn her last trip, Carla decided to sign up for that airline's loyalty program. She would earn points for every trip she made. Those points could be used towards air travel. The airline worker informed Carla that she could earn even more points if she signed up for the airline sponsored credit card. The card had a low interest rate and no annual fee. For every dollar Carla spent, she would earn one point to use towards travel. Carla signed up for the credit card. She had good credit, so she was approved. Carla used that credit card to pay for a round-trip ticket to Boston.\nAfter only one trip, Carla had earned enough points for a free one-way ticket. That saved her almost $500.

These young men and women are usually the first people who respond to medical emergencies suffered by citizens. Paramedics must complete a very extensive physical training program that is designed to weed out those who cannot make the cut. A paramedic must be in fit condition, and be mentally strong to perform his or her duties in the face of danger. Many of these heroes must endure life-threatening situations when responding to emergencies. Paramedics are usually attached to a county, or city fire department, but there are also some private paramedic organizations.\nIn Southern California, there are two primary schools for paramedic training. They are UCLA's Daniel Freeman Paramedic program and the Paramedic Training Institute. Both of these schools provide candidates for the Los Angeles County and City Fire Departments. To become a paramedic for a county or city organization, candidates must also pass a psychological screening and a physical training program.\nSome of the equipment paramedics carry is very specialized. They carry basic and advanced life support gear such as forcible entry tools so they can reach people in peril, saws to cut through obstacles, and other emergency equipment. Paramedics provide a valuable service to the communities they serve. They must be certified in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) techniques, and be trained to handle all situations.\nSome paramedics are trained to respond to what is called Mass Casualty Incidents (MCI). These emergencies occur whenever there is a tragic event such as the September 11, 2001 attacks on the country, and other emergencies like earthquakes, mudslides, or floods. Paramedics  can also be sent to emergency situations by citizens who call the 911 emergency phone number."

Working at a bookstore was a dream job for Joel. He couldn't believe he got hired on the day of his interview. Joel felt grateful to be working at where he was. He loved to brag all about his job to his friends and family.\nJoel loved reading books on his spare time. His favorite author was Mark Twain. Joel's most beloved book of his was \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\". Working at a bookstore not only gave Joel access to books, but allowed him to interact with other fellow book worms. Joel often would recommend books to customers, and customers would do the same for Joel. Every now and then, he would come across a classic book and take it for himself to read. Joel's manager allowed him one book for free once a week. It was difficult to decide which book to take sometimes.\nJoel was getting paid three hundred dollars every two weeks. Sometimes he would surpass this amount when he worked overtime. After a couple of months, Joel had saved up enough money to finally purchase his first car. Buying a car was the main reason Joel wanted to start working. He began shopping online for used vehicles.\nJoel already knew what kind of car he wanted. He had first seen a picture of it in a magazine, and since then, had dreamed of owning one of his very own. His dream car was 1984 BMW. Joel wanted a black one with two doors. He would search on the Internet until he finally found it. Joel could not believe when he discovered a seller with the car."

Andrea had health insurance trough her job. When she signed up for the health plan, she chose a primary care physician. That doctor would take care of Andrea's basic health needs. The primary care physician was not a dermatologist though. If Andrea wanted the health insurance to pay for the dermatologist, she first needed to make an appointment with her regular physician. Otherwise, Andrea would have to pay out of her own pocket to see a dermatologist.\nAndrea called her primary care provider. She had to wait a week for an appointment since her acne was not an emergency. When it was time for the appointment, she showed her doctor the acne problem. Her primary care physician was able to prescribe a skin cream for Andrea. Andrea used that skin cream for a week, but her acne did not get any better. She called her doctor back. The doctor couldn't do anything else for her. So the doctor gave her a referral to see a skin specialist, a dermatologist.\nAndrea called the dermatologist, but she had to wait another three weeks for an appointment. Her acne had gotten worse over these three weeks. When she finally saw the dermatologist, he ran a number of blood tests and allergy tests. The dermatologist told Andrea that the acne was actually an allergic reaction to fried foods. Andrea thought it was a lot of trouble to finally find out what was wrong. She was happy though now that she knew all she had to do was not to eat fried food, which was not good for her waistline or her skin."

It was billed as \"3 Days of Peace and Music,\" and was a defining event for the young generation of Americans of the time.\nThe 1960s was an impactful era in American history. Many of the events that took place during those controversial 10 years profoundly affect modern American society today. The war in Vietnam was raging in the 60s, and the popular president, John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. These are just two of the events that defined the decade. There were many more historic events during that era that deeply divided the country. Woodstock was designed to show how the young generation can coexist with the older generation of Americans by living in harmony with one another.\nAlthough the event did not occur in the town of Woodstock, New York, the city has become synonymous with the celebration. More than 400,000 young people gathered at the dairy farm in the small town of White Lake, New York to witness music history in the making. Rolling Stone Magazine listed the event as one of \"the 50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock n' Roll.\" Some of the biggest names in rock history performed at the three-day event, including The Who, the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, and Jimi Hendrix. In all, 32 acts performed at the outdoor festival, and it was free of charge to all.\nTwo soundtracks were released in the following two years. Both albums featured the live performances with introductions. The documentary film \"Woodstock\" was released in 1970, and received an Oscar in the Academy Award for Feature Documentary category. It was also deemed a Culturally Significant, by the United States, Library of Congress."

        "content": "Parenting is one of the difficult tasks people have to undertake if they have children. Parents are charged with raising children from birth until the child's 18th birthday. It is a challenging prospect these days for a variety of reasons. Each child is unique, so is the parent. In the best possible situation, a child, or children will grow up in a two-parent household. This traditionally means with a father and a mother, although today it could just mean a two-adult household. In any event, research has shown that children are better adapted to adulthood when there is a two-parent presence in the household they grew up in.\nThere are many theories on which style of parenting is best for children. Some may say that giving tough love is the best way to parent. Tough love is usually defined as letting your children learn about life through their own experiences, whether they are good experiences or not. Then there is the over-nurturing type of parenting. This is where the parents micro-manage their children's activities, and praise and encourage them regardless of their performances. Some would argue that this approach does not prepare children for the real world, others argue that it is the job of the parent to protect their children. The debate can last indefinitely.\nSome of the pitfalls of parenthood are mistreating their children, and committing child abuse. The definition of child abuse has changed greatly over the years. It used to be accepted behavior to hit a child when that child acted in an improper manner, but that is largely frowned upon today. The best thing to do is to do a little research. You can find a parenting group in your neighborhood, and look for resources  online. There is help out there. It is just a matter of finding it."

King was the leader of the African-American Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 60s. His use of non-violent protest to affect social change was based on his Christian beliefs. King was born Michael King, but his father changed his name in honor of the German reformer, Martin Luther.\nThe white and the southern culture in the United States wanted nothing to do with social change during the 60s. Segregation laws were in place that prohibited black Americans from eating at the same restaurants as whites, or to ride in the same section on public buses with white Americans. King led the famous 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott in reaction to Rosa Park's refusal to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger as was required by law in Montgomery, Alabama at the time.\nKing started his activism while serving as a Baptist minister for the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. He believed strongly in the Christian belief that loving thy neighbor as yourself, which was a philosophy he used throughout his civil rights years. He was also a great speaker. His \"I Have a Dream\" speech is regarded as one of the most famous oratory in American history. In it, he speaks of how his dream is for white and black Americans to walk together hand in hand as brothers. The speech also declared how it was his dream for all Americans to be judged, not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\nOn October 14, 1964, King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his involvement in combating racial inequality in the United States. He was assassinated in April, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee at the age of 39."

She couldn't stay up late on weeknights or sleep in. She had to be on the bus at least an hour before class started or else she would be late.

It is a little more than 275 miles from the city of Los Angeles, which is where most of its visitors come from. Driving from Los Angeles is about four hours. Las Vegas, which means the Meadows in Spanish, was established by the Mexicans in the mid-1800s. Much of what is now the southwestern part of the United States was then part of the Mexican Empire. The city was a railroad town established in 1905, and the first legal casino appeared in 1931.\nLas Vegas is now a gambling town, where people from all over the United States come to vacation. Its population is under 2,000,000, making it the 30th largest city in the country. Its original population in 1905 was only 5,000. Much of the city's growth is due to the gambling industry. Many states have since legalized gambling, including New Jersey, and California, but Las Vegas remains the No. 1 tourist city for gamblers in the U.S. Today some of its largest and most beautiful hotels include Bellagio, Flamingo, Caesars Palace, Treasure Island, Mandalay Bay, and Wynn. These hotels are on Las Vegas Boulevard, which is commonly called \"The Strip.\" With its nearly year-round sunshine, beautiful casinos, and variety of gaming options, Las Vegas remains the best location for gambling in the U.S."

A selfie is a self-portrait usually taken with a cell phone.\nSince the pictures are usually taken on a cell phone, many people tend to share these photographs with friends and even strangers on different social networking websites. Some of the popular social networking platforms people use to share selfies include Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook.\nPeople usually take selfies when they are engaged in normal day-to-day activities. They take selfies of their commutes to work or school. People take selfies of themselves eating. Other people take selfies to show what they are wearing or whom they are hanging out with.\nThe most common way to take a selfie is by holding a cell phone at arm's length. Some people take selfies by taking a picture of their reflection in a mirror. In these pictures, you can usually see the phone the person is taking a picture with. Selfies taken using a mirror often are taken in a bathroom, which some people think is offensive. The bathroom is a very private place, not a place to take pictures.\nSome people think that selfies are a sign that people are becoming vain or superficial. It is not often that people take pictures of themselves that make them look bad. When people take pictures of themselves, they usually are trying to present themselves in the best light. However, some people use selfies to show what they really look like. Some people are trying to challenge stereotypes of what makes someone attractive."

You will get used to it,\" he said. The trip to the waters off Catalina Island took about an hour. Chris marveled at how quickly she lost sight of the mainland. It was a bit scary when she thought about how alone they were in this great ocean. Soon, it was time to collect squid for bait. The small boat stopped in the water, and the crew turned the bright light into the ocean to attract the squid.

That was before the great Jackie Robinson broke what was called the color line in baseball. Prior to April 15, 1947, Major League Baseball was an exclusive \"whites only\" organization that barred black players from participation. Black Americans could only play in the Negro Leagues that existed roughly between 1920 through 1948. Robinson, and the Brooklyn Dodgers, put an end to segregation in baseball that year, and began a movement for racial equality in the United States.\nRobinson was born in Cairo, Georgia on January 31, 1919, but grew up in Pasadena, California, near Los Angeles. He was an outstanding athlete who played baseball and football for Pasadena City College, then at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). During his time with the Dodgers, the team won one championship, and appeared in the World Series six times. From 1949 to 1954, Robinson was named to the All-Star Team, and he won the National League Most Valuable Player Award. He was also named the Baseball Rookie of the Year in 1947, the first year the award was given.\nToday, Robinson is honored by every team in both the National and American Leagues on Jackie Robinson Day. On that day, all MLB players wear the number 42 in honor of Robinson. That number, used to be worn by Robinson, was retired universally by all baseball teams, making it the first time any league has retired a number. No player on any MLB team can ever wear that number again. Robinson was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1962. He died on October 24, 1972, and was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal for his part in changing American society."

Before 1776, much of the southern and western states, such as Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and California were part of Mexico. Following the war between the U.S. and Mexico in the 1800s, these states became part of the United States, but there still remained a very large Mexican population.\nThe Latino population is the largest, single ethnic group in the country. It accounts for 17 percent of the nation's population, and 63 percent of those Latinos are of Mexican origins. The Cinco de Mayo is a large celebration in the country's southwest region. It celebrates the Mexican victory in the Battle of Puebla, against France on May 5, 1862. Curiously, the day is celebrated more in the United States than it is in Mexico itself.\nIn Los Angeles, the city celebrates the event with the Fiesta Broadway, which is the largest Cinco de Mayo celebration in the world. More than half a million people come to downtown L.A. to participate in the street fair that covers 24 square blocks. The celebration takes place on the last Sunday of April. There are rides, games, and especially food at this celebration and it is growing every year. Los Angeles is not the only Southland city to host Cinco de Mayo celebrations. The cities of Corona, West Los Angeles, and Commerce also have events, and the famous Olvera Street celebration in downtown L.A. is also very popular.\nOne of the most unique Cinco de Mayo events takes place in the Hancock Park district of Los Angeles. It is called the Single de Mayo. This celebration is an annual charity event that began in 1999. It is a private party that benefits the homeless by providing shelter and support. Cinco de Mayo is a truly American celebration."

        "content": "Chris knew exactly where she was on January 28, 1986. As a matter of fact, nearly all Americans can recall what they were doing at the moment the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded. It is one of the most tragic moments in the history of the country, and it is one that will not be forgotten. Chris was working as a clerk at a clothing manufacturing plant in Commerce, California, which is about three miles from downtown Los Angeles.\nOn that morning she was filing some documents when one of her coworkers came through the door into a large work area that contained about 20 employees. \"The shuttle just blew up,\" he shouted. Most employees were taken aback. They had no idea what he was talking about. Once again he blurted out, \"The space shuttle just blew up in Florida.\" Chris knew at that time something went very wrong.\nThe space shuttle program began in the early 80s, and continued to this day. The fleet consists of various shuttles that are designed to go into space, establish an orbit, and do a variety of tasks. It was heralded as a new era in space exploration. In the past, space exploration vehicles were used once, and then discarded. The shuttle program revolutionized the way space travel was done.\nChris couldn't believe her ears. Soon almost all employees huddled around the lunch room TV set watching in horror the events taking place. It was a sad day for the United States, but it was also the beginning of a new era in space travel. The country rebounded from this disaster and restarted its program after a couple of years. There have been other accidents in the program, and most notably the Columbia, which disintegrated upon reentry in February 2003, but the U.S. will not be deterred. Space travel is dangerous, but the spirit of the American people will not be contained."

He starred in films such as Splash, Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Apollo 13, Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, and Big.\nBorn in Concord, California in 1956, Hanks began his career in television in the popular TV show Bosom Buddies, where he plays a man living in a women's dormitory. In order to live among the women, he and his roommate must dress in women's clothing during the evening hours after arriving from work. This series ran for three years and made Hanks a legitimate star.\nHanks reached film stardom in Splash, which was a very popular love story involving Hanks as a frustrated bachelor, and a mermaid.

In 1993, Hanks won an Academy Award for his portrayal as a displaced worker who gets fired from his job because he contracts AIDS in the film Philadelphia.

Marriage and dating someone can mean a very different experience in Los Angeles, as compared to Salt Lake City, Utah, for example. In some places, dating and marriage are personal decisions made by the persons in the relationship, while in other places around the country, families are more involved. Who or when someone is allowed to date can mean more to some families than to others. However, there are some traditional values that cross most the geographic lines in the country.\nSome of the more common traits people look for in a potential mate are common interests, spirituality, commitment, kindness, trust, and communication. These are some of the traits, or qualities most people seek when entering a dating relationship, or when considering marriage. Common interests matter because it shows that the couple enjoys engaging in similar activities. If a person likes to ride horses, for example, then meeting and dating a person who also enjoys riding can be very attractive.\nSpirituality is also important to a large number of people in the United States. Many families frown upon their children dating a person from another religion, while others allow their children to make their own decisions. Commitment is also a big factor, especially if the relationship is moving toward marriage. Kindness, trust, and communication are related traits that dating couples look for in a partner. Being kind to your mate is very important, and so is trust. You must trust the person you are dating in order to develop a healthy relationship, and communication is the best way to develop trust in each other."

The thrill of renting or buying a new place can be wonderful. However, having your own place to live comes with responsibilities. Rent or mortgage payments, utilities, food, entertainment, and other bills must be paid in order to maintain a household. It is what adults do every day. However, there is another important thing, which is to get along with your new neighbors.\nIf you are moving into a new home, it is important to get along with your new neighbors. Your neighbors will probably be strangers, but it does not have to stay like that. Since you will be seeing your new neighbors nearly every day, it might be smart to get to know them. Getting along with your neighbors can bring great advantages. Your neighbors can look after your home when you are away, and you can do the same for them. If you report suspicious people approaching their homes, they will return the favor. Getting along also means behaving in a civil manner. Remember, they can live very close to you, so it is good to be not too loud. Do not play music loudly. It's always a good idea to respect other's property. This is even more true if you are living in an apartment complex.\nApartment living is more intimate than living in a home. Living in a home that has space between houses allows a bit more privacy, but living in an apartment usually means sharing a common wall. Sounds come through the walls at all hours of the day or night. The best approach you can use is to act in a way you would like your neighbors to act. No one likes neighbors who do not respect people's privacy. Be a good neighbor, and your neighbors will be good to you."

Ruth told her children that it was okay, and that they would bump into him later on.\nThey enjoyed their day at Disneyland until it was time for the park to close. Ruth and her children were looking at the fireworks that they put on every night at Disneyland. She hugged her children and told them she loved them. They hugged her back and continued to watch the show. When they were leaving the park, her children noticed that Donald was taking photos with some other people, and their mom hadn't noticed him yet.

While she was waiting for Carol to come back from the restroom, Ruth felt someone poke her on her shoulder. It was Donald Duck with Carol! Ruth began tearing up a bit, and hugged both of them.

One story says that a famous brothel owner named Eve gave the city its name. Another version of history claims the name has its roots in show business with performers calling New York the \"Big Apple\" since it was the best place to get noticed. There is one legend that says the city got its name because of the large number of unemployed selling apples on the streets of New York City during the Great Depression.\nThe term more likely has its roots in horse racing from the 1920's. Prizes were called \"apples\" and a newspaper reporter when writing about races often would call the big prize the big apple. In fact, the \"big apple\" soon was used to mean any big city. In the late 1920s through the 1940s, \"The Big Apple\" was not just a nickname for New York, it was also the name of a song, a dance, and a place to dance and sing. New York City was the heart of the jazz music scene in the 1930's and 1940s. In Harlem, uptown Manhattan, there was a club called \"The Big Apple\". There was also a 1938 short film of the same name featuring black jazz  musicians and dancers.\nIn the 1970s, the city tourism agency began using the term the \"Big Apple\" on purpose. There is even a street corner in Manhattan called \"Big Apple Corner\". One New York City baseball team, the New York Mets, have a big red apple that pops out whenever the Mets hit a home run in their stadium Citifield. While the origins of the \"Big Apple\" nickname are unclear, it seems to be here to stay."

She knew that time-outs were called in sports whenever a player was injured but she wasn't sure how that would be used in a kindergarten classroom. Mildred was sure though that her son grabbing a toy from a classmate was not correct. The next day when Mildred took Bill to school, she stopped the teacher. She asked the teacher to explain what a time-out was. Mildred told the teacher that Bill was very upset about the time-out he had the day before.  The teacher explained that time-out was a discipline tool she used in the classroom. When she saw Bill grab the toy from Mary, she told him to go into time-out. Time-out is a chair next to the teacher's desk where a student has to sit quietly when they do something wrong.\n\"They aren't kicked out of the classroom, just taken out of the immediate situation so they can reflect on what they did wrong,\" the teacher explained. Mildred thought it was an interesting way to teach self-control to little kids. \"Can I use this at home?\" Mildred asked the teacher. \"Of course!\" the teacher said.\nLater that night, Mildred got into an argument with her husband for something. In the middle of the argument she slammed her hand on the kitchen counter. \"Mommy, you need a time-out,\" Bill said."

Mandela served as president of South Africa from 1994 through 1999, but his story began decades earlier. His lifes work was to bring South Africa into mainstream 20th Century thinking by ending Apartheid.\nApartheid was a system of South African government that was based on racial segregation between the minority white population and black South Africans. It was a controversial form of government that was in effect from 1948 to 1994, and caused great social turmoil. The system was put into place following World War II, but racial segregation began much earlier in the country. Apartheid separated South Africans by race by placing people into four classifications: white, black, coloured, and Indian. Each group had different levels of privilege, with white South Africans being the most favored.\nFrom 1960 to 1983, 3.5 million black South Africans were forcibly removed from their homes; in 1970, all non-white politicians were removed from government. Mandelas move to end Apartheid began in 1949 when he supported, and organized non-violent boycotts, strikes, and civil disobedience. He was arrested, and charged with treason in 1956 for his role in the social uprising, and was eventually jailed for 27 years. During this time, most of the countries in the world called for his release, and placed trade embargos against the white regime.\nThe country finally gave in to international pressure, and released Mandela. He became an international symbol for peaceful demonstration, and for his humanitarian work and perseverance. He was elected President of South Africa in 1994, serving for six years. Mandela died in December, 2013."

Back in that time, California was known for offering many job opportunities in farming, and many young men were hopping on trains from all over the country to arrive in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, many of those men often ended up finding themselves without a job, a place to stay, or even food to eat. To help these people, many churches began to establish shelters in the area of Los Angeles that would eventually become Downtown. Even as the farm landscape changed to a big city environment, these shelters remained a refuge for many individuals that found themselves homeless\nNowadays, the homeless population of Los Angeles is made up of much more than just young men looking for work. Many economic and social changes have resulted in both men and women of all ages turning to the streets of Los Angeles. Some of them are there as a result of substance abuse that has left them moneyless and jobless. Others are veterans from various wars that cannot find the resources to get back to their normal lives. Additionally, many of these people suffer from mental disabilities that limit them from finding a job or being accepted in the rest of society.\nSince there are a lot of different causes that lead to homelessness, it is easy to see why finding solutions to helping all of the homeless people is so difficult. Although there are many programs that focus on providing the homeless food daily, it is much harder to find programs that try to assist the homeless in finding jobs, and stable housing. In order to finally find a solution that will effectively help decrease the number of homeless people in the city, a lot more individualized attention must be placed on individuals based on their physical and mental health, and circumstance."

Some high schools offer specialized skills so that students can find work after graduation without going to college. Those are called vocational high schools. In high school, some students have the opportunity to take Advanced Placement (AP) classes. These are college level classes. If the students pass an exam after taking AP classes, they can get college credit. In high school, students move from class to class throughout the school day."

Museum Mile begins at 85th Street and Fifth Avenue with the massive Metropolitan Museum of Art. Inside is thousands of years worth of art and artifacts. A visitor can visit an entire Egyptian tomb, sit in a Japanese style garden, view Renaissance paintings, and ancient Greek and Roman sculptures. There is even a gallery featuring musical instruments. In the summer, there is a rooftop garden where there are spectacular views of the city, especially of Central Park.\nThe Guggenheim, on 88th Street and Fifth Avenue, looks a little bit like a snail's shell from the outside. When it opened in the 1950's, the swirling architecture, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, was thought to be ugly by many. This museum focuses on modern art, but sometimes features special exhibits like one they had a few years ago of ancient Mexican ruins. The National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts on 91st Street and Fifth Avenue is the city's oldest art school, dating back to 1825. The Jewish Museum on 93rd Street and Fifth Avenue, tells 4,000 years worth of Jewish History. Up ten blocks on 103rd Street and Fifth Avenue is the Museum of the City of New York, showcasing the history of the Big Apple from its colonial start.\nOne block up on 104th Street and Fifth Avenue is El Museo del Barrio. This museum started as a space to reflect the city's large Puerto Rican migrant community. Now it features exhibits focusing on art from all over Latin America. Across the avenue is the Central Park Conservatory Garden, with a fountain that has a sculpture of three dancing life-size women."

Sam had spent seven years smoking, he was 21 when he decided to quit.\nSam decided to quit after discovering he had been coughing blood. He would get tired quickly, and he noticed his teeth were getting really yellow. Whenever Sam would hang out with his friends that smoked, he would always want a cigarette really badly, but was always strong and said no when they offered him one. Before Sam quit, he would go through a pack of cigarettes a week. The pack of cigarettes usually cost him $5.25.\nAs a way to encourage himself to stop smoking, Sam decided to save his money every week. After two years, Sam took out all his money he had saved from not smoking, and saw that he had saved $504. He decided to buy a bicycle so he could ride it for fun and for exercise. As he started riding his bike more frequently, he noticed that he didn't think about smoking anymore. He didn't want a cigarette when he would hang out with his friends that smoked.\nSam would ride his bike in the morning because he loved getting a breath of fresh air. In the past when he smoked, the only time he got a breath of fresh air was when he went out for a cigarette.

        "content": "One of the first things immigrants in a new country need to do is to find a place to live. Most people have to rent an apartment or house the first time around. Renting a house can be challenging. The first thing a person should do is to find an affordable place. There are many options available to a renter when looking for a place to live. The popular website craigslist.com is a good place to start because it allows the renter to search for places by prices, neighborhoods, number of rooms, and so on. With these filters, renters can view only places that meet their needs.\nThere are, of course, other ways of finding a home. Newspapers also have a section that lists places to rent, or renters can go to a professional broker to find a place. There is also word-of-mouth, where renters hear about places for rent from friends, colleagues and family. Then there is just the old-fashioned way of driving through neighborhoods in search of \"For Rent\" signs.\nRenting a place to live can give a person a great feeling of independence, but renting a home comes with great responsibilities also. Renters must first pay for the first and last month's rent when first renting a place. Additionally, there is usually a deposit that must be paid. The amount of this deposit varies. It is up to the owner of the building to establish the amount for deposit, and even though renters are paying rent, the apartment or home still belongs to the owner, which means renters are expected to take care of the place by not damaging their new home. Treat the home like it belongs to you, and everyone will be happy."

        "content": "Having your own space is a sign of success in the United States. However, renting an apartment is not easy. There are a number of steps you need to take. First, you need to figure out how much you can pay per month.\nWhen you first move into a new place, most landlords, or property owners expect you, the tenant, to pay a security deposit. A security deposit is an amount of money you pay a landlord sort of as insurance that you won't destroy their property while you are living there. Usually the security deposit is equal to the amount of one-month rent. If when you move out, the apartment is in the same condition as when you moved in, the landlord will return your security deposit. If the apartment has any damage whatsoever, including holes in the walls because you hung up posters, the landlord can legally use that money to fix the apartment.\nOnce you know how much you can afford, you can begin looking for apartments for rent. You can look in the newspaper or online. Also walk around a neighborhood you want to live in and be on the lookout for \"For Rent\" signs.\nThere are two ways to rent an apartment. Most landlords rent out apartments on an annual basis. This means you will sign a document called a lease, which says you will stay in the property for one year and pay rent on a monthly basis. If you decide that you want to break the lease, or leave before your year is up, there are usually fines you will have to pay. Another way to rent an apartment is on a month-to-month basis. This means that you pay by month, and are not obligated to stay for more than a month at a time."

During his 60-year entertainment career, Hope starred in more than 70 films, along with television, and stage appearances.\nBorn in London on May 29, 1903, Hope enjoyed a long and profitable career. He lived to be 100 years old, dying in 2003. He is probably best known for his United Services Organization (USO) shows, where he entertained United States troops overseas. He made nearly 60 tours in a 50-year span from 1941 through 1991.\nHis Hollywood legacy begins with the popular Road movies, where Hope starred alongside Bing Crosby, and Dorothy LaMour. During his early years in the United Kingdom, Hope worked in many jobs, including street performing, where he would sing and dance to earn pocket money. He worked for a time as a butcher, and linesman before settling on an entertainment career. He first starred in the U.S. as a Broadway, Vaudeville actor in New York City, and in radio. In 1934, with the advent of TV, Hope made the switch from radio to television, and was one of the first major stars on TV.\nHis Hollywood career is one of the most prolific of any actor in the history of the American big screen.

Just a few years ago, most of the people in the United States did not own a personal computer. Computer usage was limited mostly to the workplace and libraries. However, all that has changed. Today, nearly every household in the country has a personal computer or a portable device. Additionally, the creation of the Internet has made using your personal computer more effective in ways that were not foreseen in the recent past.\nComputer technology has improved drastically since personal computers came into American homes years ago. The Internet has also improved dramatically. Along with the improved technology come new problems. Some people, who are technologically proficient, are using their talents to take advantage of unsuspecting individuals. Banking, credit card, and personal information all exists in cyberspace today, and there are thieves out there who know how to access it.\nIn order to keep your information safe, try following basic safety practices such as installing protective software, and creating strong passwords. Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to create a password that is easy for you to remember. Additionally, regular backups can protect you from the unexpected. Don't leave your computer in an unsecured area, unattended, or logged on, especially in public places. Ignore unsolicited emails, and be wary of attachments, links, and forms in emails that come from people you don't know, and avoid untrustworthy websites. Never give your passwords to other people.

Many Catholics go to midnight mass. In the United States, however, the holiday has a much more secular tone, and is celebrated throughout the country. Many people, regardless of their religion, put up and decorate a Christmas tree. The tree can be a real evergreen or it can be an artificial tree. Lights, strings, tinsel, and even popcorn can be used to decorate a Christmas tree. On the top of the tree is a star or an angel. The decorations are usually  red and green.\nThe purpose of a Christmas tree is to have a central location to place gifts. According to legend, a jolly fat man with a beard, named Santa Claus, leaves presents under the tree. Children in the U.S. often write lists of things they want Santa to bring them. Many parents bring their children to shopping malls across the country to tell a man dressed as Santa what they want. These children are often also  photographed with the mall Santa as a keepsake. On Christmas Eve many children leave milk and cookies for Santa. Of course it is the parents that buy the gifts from the wish lists, and even eat the cookies and drink the milk. On Christmas Day children usually wake up early and run to the tree so they can see what Santa brought them. Adults can also exchange gifts at this time.\nPeople don't just decorate a tree at Christmas. Many also elaborately decorate their homes with lights. Some of the displays are even synchronized to Christmas songs called carols. Originally these songs were religious, but now they are about the spirit of the season."

Having savings is a good way to start building your wealth, but not the only way. The best thing you can do is to have your money work for you. The most basic way this can be done is to put your savings into a high-yield account that pays the best interest. Shopping around at different financial institutions would be a good idea so that you get the best interest for the amount of money you have to invest. Additionally, new technology, in the form of investment applications, have made it easier, and more convenient to begin building your finances.\nWith new technology, all you need to start is an investment app, and a smartphone. These apps can help you get started investing, track and project your investments, and establish a goal. The more traditional ways to save are simple. Most investors suggest you first have six-months' worth of savings in your account before you begin investing. The best way to start saving is to put away a portion of your pay. If, for instance, you save just $10 per week, at the end of the year you will have saved more than $500. Another smart investment option is to enroll in your company's retirement plan. Many companies will match your investment dollars with their own. This can be a powerful way to invest in the future and have a nice retirement income when the time comes.\nMutual funds are also attractive to new investors. These funds are low-investment start-up programs that require between $500 to $5,000 initial contributions. These funds automatically invest your money based on market trends."

Golfers use a variety of clubs to play a round of golf, including a driver, an iron, and a putter. Each club has its own use. The object of the game is to put a golf ball into the hole in the least number of strokes.\nIn miniature golf, the course is much smaller. Golf arcades are usually contained within a one-block area, so the game differs greatly from golf. One club is all it takes to play miniature golf, but it is no less fun than playing real golf. A miniature golf course has many themes depending on which course a person visits. Unlike golf, miniature golf has obstacles placed in the path of the golf ball to make it difficult for a person to put the ball in the hole. Miniature golf is usually no more than nine holes.\nGolf arcades are not limited to playing miniature golf. Some arcades include mini-car racing on a small, professional-like race track. It is fun to test a person's skills against others in a mini-car race. If racing is not something of interest, there are other activities available. Video games and pinball are popular. The food is another attraction at golf arcades. Most golf arcades serve American favorites like hot dogs, hamburgers, and pizza with all the trimmings.

Many immigrants feel this poem speaks to them the reasons they came to America. One line of the poem is: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\". Lady Liberty was not always green.

The U.S. has an extensive network of colleges and universities spread out throughout the country. The common denominator every one of these schools has is the Grade Point Average (GPA). This statistic is used to help select students who apply to an institution of higher learning.\nA student's GPA is a strong indicator of how he or she will perform at the university level, but it is not the only thing universities measure. Many other factors come into play when a person applies for entrance to a university. Extracurricular activities, community involvement, and personal hardships are all considered in the application process. However, the first thing schools look at is the GPA.\nGPAs in the U.S. are a standardized method of measuring a student's academic performance. It is based on a 4.0 scale, and works together with the A to F grading system. Generally speaking, an A grade will earn the student a 4.0 GPA. If the student receives a B, then his or her GPA comes in at 3.0. C grades equal a 2.0, D 1.0 and an F grade is 0.0... If a student takes four classes, and receives two A's, one B and a C, his or her GPA would be 3.25, which is acceptable at many schools, but not all. The best thing to do is to try to get as many A grades as possible to increase your chances at getting into a highly-rated school. The top universities in the country require a GPA of at least 3.5, but it is best to get as close to 4.0 as possible. Most students who apply at top-rated universities have well over a 3.5 GPA."

America's first public school was founded in Boston in 1635. Boston Common, where British troops camped during the American Revolution and where early colonists hanged people, is the oldest public park in the United States. Boston is also home to the oldest subway system in the United States.\nLike many cities in the United States, immigrants played a large role in its development. Irish immigrants who settled in Boston, for example, played a large role in both local and national politics. Boston also has a large and active Puerto Rican community and Italian community. President John F. Kennedy and his family have ties to Boston.\nBoston is also well known for many colleges and universities that surround it. Some of the most famous are Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Boston attracts more than 350,000 college students from around the world."

Mike asked his son what his secret was. \"A magician never tells,\" Rob said while tapping his nose. Mike shrugged his shoulders. \"Guess, Daddy.

Mike gave up. \"It's in my nose, Dad!\" Rob proudly declared. Mike spit out his beer and rushed to look up his son's nose. He couldn't see anything up there. He went to the kitchen junk drawer and took out a small flashlight. Mike looked up his son's nose again. He still couldn't see the bright yellow Lego piece.  \"Are you sure it's up there?\" Mike asked his son. Rob nodded. \"Does it hurt?\" Mike asked. Rob shook his head.\nMike didn't want to stick anything up his son's nose to try and take out the mini toy brick out. He was scared he would push the Lego up higher and hurt his son. \"I guess we have to go to the hospital,\" Mike told his son. Rob looked scared. It was a short drive to the hospital emergency room. Mike felt like the most negligent dad in the world when he told the triage nurse the reason for the visit. \"My son has a Lego stuck up his left nostril,\" Mike said in a low voice."

Parks became famous for challenging a discriminatory policy in the city of Montgomery, Alabama. During the 1950s, Black Americans in the south were not allowed to ride in the front seats of public buses if a white person needed that seat. Blacks were expected to get out of their seats, and go to the back of the bus, which was designated as \"Colored Only.\"\nOn December 1, 1955, Parks refused to obey the bus drivers order to surrender her seat to a white passenger who had boarded the bus. Even though Parks was seated in the Colored Only section, the bus was filled, and she was required by law to give her seat to the white rider. Parks was arrested, and charged with civil disobedience. She later said  she had grown \"tired of giving in.\"\nHer arrest and subsequent trial made Parks a national symbol for the Civil Rights Movement. Her arrest also lead to the Montgomery Bus Boycott that was a political and social protest campaign against racial segregation. Although the boycott only lasted 21 days, it was instrumental in the Supreme Court decision to declare Alabama's practice of segregation unconstitutional.\nParks has remained a symbol for the Civil Rights Movement even after her death in 2005 at the age of 92. She has been called the \"First Lady of Civil Rights,\" by the United States Congress, and \"The Mother of the Freedom Movement.\" She has been honored by the U.S. government with prestigious awards such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Congressional Gold Medal. She has been honored with her own museum in Michigan, and has received several other civil rights awards both before and after her death."

Mike liked watching baseball on television from time to time. He had always wanted to go to a stadium to witness a game firsthand. He had heard from his co-workers that it was a lot fun going to the games. Although Maria did not like watching sports as much as Mike did, she was still excited about going to a stadium to watch a baseball game in person. She was curious about how much tickets cost, so she asked Mike the question.\n\"Are baseball tickets expensive, Mike?\" she asked. \"They're not cheap, unfortunately,\" Mike answered.

The movie was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant of American culture.\nThe boulevard makes its way through Hollywood and continues on through the streets of Beverly Hills, which is another world famous city.

It has a breath-taking view  that is very popular with both tourists and local residents. Sunset Blvd is also a late-night cruising spot. Young people like to take to Sunset Blvd on weekend nights to see the sights, or to meet new people. Along with all the shops, there are many nightclubs  that feature the latest music.\nJust north of Sunset Blvd lies Hollywood Blvd, which is a major tourist attraction.

Sometimes it seems like the birthday parties are about showing off and entertaining the parents of kids in addition to children.\nMost children's birthday parties are held in the home of the birthday boy or girl. It used to be that children's parties were just for children. Parents would drop their kids off and come back when the party was over to bring them home. Now it is more common for the parents of guests to stay for the party as well. This gives the adults time and space to socialize while the kids play games. Kids and adults don't always have the same tastes in food. So when adults are invited to stay for a child's birthday party, there is usually fancier food for the adults like cheese, crackers, and fruit platters. Meanwhile the kids eat hot dogs and potato chips. While the children drink punch, juice, or soda, the parents may be sipping cocktails, beer, or wine.\nEntertainment for a party of mixed adults and children also goes beyond the usual clown or magician. Sometimes there will be a DJ, and the adults  will dance. Party games are not just for the kids, either. While the children play traditional games like pin the tail on the donkey, the adults may play casino-type games like blackjack or poker.\nNot everyone likes this trend of adults and children partying together. Some feel that the parties should be kept separate. Some people worry about adults getting drunk in front of the kids. Others worry about kids getting abused by adults they don't know. For others, it is just about allowing a kid to have their special day. There is also a concern that these mixed parties encourage a sense of competition among parents in a community."

The show aired on the FOX Channel for 11 years, and many believe it was responsible for keeping the news station alive during the early years.\nIn 1987, commercial TV in the United States was dominated by the big three: the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and the Columbia Broadcasting Company (CBS). When the FOX Channel appeared on the scene, few people gave it much chance to survive in the face of its stiff competition, but Married with Children changed all that.\nThe show followed the exploits of a dysfunctional family that lived in a fictional suburb of Chicago. The main character was the father, Al Bundy, who was a lovable loser living with his self-centered wife, and bratty kids. Together, the family makes Al's life miserable as he stumbles, and fumbles his way through life. Al works as a shoe salesman that pays very little, and has little chance of promotion.\nAl is an endearing character who gained the adoration of the American public for many years. The actor Ed O'Neil, who played Al, said that people still approach him to this day calling him Al, or Mr. Bundy. O'Neil also said that playing the character for so many years made it difficult for him to find work once the series ended because people associated him with Al.\nOne of the things that made the show so popular is that no subject was off-limits to the writers. It was a controversial show  that dealt with controversial subjects. Many people boycotted the show because of its racy content, but FOX continued on. The show has cultivated a cult-like following that began in the 80s, and continues today."

Sagan challenged Americans to think about their place in the universe like no other person before him. Using the scientific method, Sagan challenged long-held beliefs about the genesis of life on earth. This he has done to the enlightened scientific community, and to the anger of the religious community. Many of Sagan's teachings contradict the creationist belief of the beginning of life. He was also interested in the search for life beyond the planet earth, and participated in the only human message sent into space intended for an alien race.\nSagan was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 9, 1934. His interest in science began at an early age. He wrote and co-wrote 20 books, and had more than 600 scientific research papers published. His most popular work was \"Contact\", which tells the story of first contact with an intelligent alien species. The book was made into a movie in 1997 starring Jodie Foster. The book and movie angered many religious groups because of its message that human beings are not alone in the universe.\nSagan earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in physics from the University of Chicago in the 1950s. His scientific curiosity led him into developing the television series \"Cosmos\". It was one of the most watched science series, and has been recreated and is currently on the air. His work on the Galileo project lives on today. The spacecraft is speeding its way through infinite space today with his message of greeting to whatever race of beings finds it.

Parents rely on what their children tell them about how they are doing and what they are learning. Generally schools will host parent-teacher conferences at least twice a year. Parent-teacher conferences are short meetings between parents and their children's teachers. Usually parent-teacher conferences are held when teachers give out a student's grades for the term. The parent-teacher conferences give teachers an opportunity to let parents know how their child is doing. A teacher will let a parent know the student's strengths and bring to the parent's attention any problems  with grades or behavior. The meetings also offer parents the opportunity to ask questions and see what their child is learning.\nWhen it is almost time for parent-teacher conferences, the school will send parents a note and usually give them an appointment time. There are appointments during the day and in the evening. Evening appointments are used for parents who work during the day. Parent-teacher conferences do not last very long. Normally they do not last longer than 10 minutes. This is why it is important for parents to make sure they arrive at their appointments on time and come prepared with questions. If a parent needs more than 10 minutes, he or she should try to schedule another meeting with the teacher. Keeping a teacher for more than 10 minutes when there are parents waiting is disrespectful.\nMost children do not go along with their parents to the meetings. This allows both the parent and teacher to talk honestly about the child's progress without making the child feel bad. Usually a teacher will offer advice to the parent on how to support their child's education."

There used to be 23 lines in use throughout the city connecting the diverse communities that make up San Francisco. The open-air cars are a major tourist attraction, and are still used by San Francisco commuters on a daily basis.\nThe simple reason cable cars were first used in the city was because of its landscape. San Francisco is very hilly, which makes it impossible for municipal buses to scale. The solution for this problem was the cable car. These cars are literally pulled by cable, up and down the steep hills of the city, making it easier for people to get from one end of the city to the other.\nThere are two types of cars in use today. Single-ended cars and double-ended cars. The single-ended cars have open-sided sections with seats that face outward to the street. The rear section of these cars is enclosed with seats facing the interior of the car. These cars seat 29 passengers. They travel in both directions by using a swivel-based turntable that turns the car at the end of the line. The double-ended cars are a bit larger, and can hold up to 68 passengers. It has 34 seats, and grips for an additional 34 standing passengers. The best feature of these cars is the pure fun they are to ride. People who ride the San Francisco cable cars are stepping into part of California's history."

Maria's favorite place to eat breakfast was at a well-known pancake house called IHOP. Mike also knew that Maria had not been to IHOP in a long time.\nHe therefore wanted to surprise her by taking her there. While Maria was still asleep, Mike was in the living room wrapping her gift. After Mike wrapped her gift, he grabbed the balloons he had bought and quietly entered the bedroom where Maria was sleeping. He set down the gift beside her, and gently woke her up."

During the country's infancy, most immigrants came from European countries such as England, Germany, Italy, and France, but that changed in the years that followed. Although many people still come from those countries into the U.S., many other countries are represented here. Immigrants from Latin America, Africa, and Asia have also relocated to the United States, and now call this country their home. With all the diverse cultures that exist in this country, it is important to recognize their differences and try to get along with everyone.\nAsian cultures differ greatly from Latin American cultures, or European cultures. Language, food, marriage, and interactions within their culture can be very different. What is acceptable behavior in one culture may not be in another, or may even be considered rude, or taboo. Japanese people, for example, usually greet each other with a slight nod of the head, and a bow from the waist. This is considered a formal method of greeting someone new in Japan. In American culture, people normally look directly into the other person's eyes and use their right hand to grasp the other person's right hand firmly. An up-and-down motion is then employed. This is called shaking hands. A firm handshake is considered a favorable way to meet someone new in America. Other cultures use other methods to greet each other, and there are countless cultures in the United States.\nTake advantage of the different cultures of the country. Learning a new language, or having a meal that is unique to another culture can be a great experience. Embrace the customs of your fellow Americans. You may find it much enjoyable."

Bush was the standing president on the infamous September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon. Bush's reaction to the news following the attacks on the World Trade Center continues to cause high emotions on the American public because of his blas stance.\nThe president was in Florida during the attacks visiting a school when told of the news. Instead of reacting with dispatch, Bush continued his activity seemingly unaffected by the terror unfolding in New York. He was criticized heavily for his apparent blas attitude. This was the first of several controversial moves Bush made while serving as president.\nBush was born on July 6, 1946 to a politically powerful family. His father George H.W. Bush served as the 41st U.S. president. George W. Bush also served as governor of the state of Texas from 1995 to 2000.\nHis father once said that the younger Bush \"faced the greatest challenge of any president since Abraham Lincoln.\" In reaction to 9/11, Bush deployed U.S. troops to Afghanistan to combat terrorism, and attacked Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq because of inaccurate intelligence that claimed the Muslim leader was developing weapons of mass destruction. Both decisions hurt his presidency greatly.\nBush's victories in both the 2000 and 2004 elections were also not without controversy, as both elections were contested. Many observers claimed improper tactics were used to gain the White House in both instances."

Public TV differs from the more common commercial television in that it is not funded by advertising revenue. Public Television is a network of television stations throughout the country that is dedicated to bringing alternative programming to the people of the United States.\nMr. Rogers' Neighborhood ran from February 1968 through August 2001, and was hosted by the show's namesake, Fred Rogers. It was a half-hour children's show that featured the popular Rogers as host. It is often referred to as the Mr. Rogers show.\nRogers began his show in 1953 on a PBS station in the northeast part of the country as the Children's Corner. He performed as a puppeteer, and it was aired on live television. There Rogers developed many of the characters that would become famous as his show progressed. In 1967, his show went on the national TV stage, and remained there until 2001.\nRogers' style and calm demeanor made him an instant celebrity who was well-liked by both children and adults. In his early life, Rogers studied to become a Presbyterian minister, but didn't like how children's programming was being presented. He began writing children's songs, and soon began his own local show on public television. During the next three decades, Rogers became a true American icon through his show. His great compassion, morality, and patience were possibly his most liked characteristics.\nRogers was not only a great TV personality, he was also a human rights advocate. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as well as the Peabody Award for meritorious public service. Rogers was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame, and has received approximately 40 honorary degrees."

In 1970, when the World Trade Center was built, that became the tallest building. Now, the Empire State Building is the fourth tallest building in the U.S. and the 23rd tallest in the world.

From the top there are beautiful views of New York City, especially at night. Most people take one of 73 elevators to the top. It takes less than one minute by elevator to get to the 80th floor. That is where there is a gift shop. Some people walk 1,860 steps to the top. Every year there is even a race, with people competing to see who can walk up to the top the fastest.\nThe landmark is not just famous because of its height. In 1945, a small plane crashed into it. More than 30 people have tried to kill themselves by jumping off the building. In 1933 it was featured in the movie King Kong, where a giant gorilla climbs to the top and falls to his death after being attacked by airplanes.

The New England city is called the Witch City because of an infamous set of trials that happened there in 1692 to 1693. At the time, the city was just a town in the British colony of Massachusetts. The Salem Witch Trials accused more than 200 people of being witches. People believed witchcraft was real and was criminal. Among the accused were women, men, and even children. Nineteen people were sentenced to death. They were all hanged. One of the accused was tortured with heavy rocks being placed on him until he was crushed underneath the weight. Seven others died in jail.\nThere was never any proof that those accused, and convicted were really witches. Historians think that people would accuse people because of family feuds. Other historians think that a domino effect occurred, with people becoming hysterical after one accusation. Fear of witches spread like a disease.\nThe Salem Witch Trials have become a part of the city's history. \"The Crucible\", a play about the trials by Arthur Miller, has been turned into a movie. The city is not ashamed of its past, but rather uses it to teach tolerance and earn some tourist dollars. There is a memorial dedicated to the innocent people who died because of the witch-hunts. There is a \"Witch Museum\" that tells the story of what happened. Many people visit Salem around Halloween. Salem police cars have witch logos. A local public school is known as the Witchcraft Heights Elementary School, and the Salem High School sports teams are named the Witches. Films and television shows featuring fictional witches have been filmed in Salem, including \"Hocus Pocus\" and \"Bewitched\"."

In the times before the invention of the personal computer, and the advent of the World Wide Web, social networking was done in person. People who had similar likes and interests  would gather together to share experiences, make new contacts, and promote themselves, or their businesses.\nOn the Internet, social networking websites made their first appearances during the late 1990s. The first major social networking website in the United States was MySpace. MySpace was a comprehensive, social networking site that allowed its users to exchange messages, share pictures, and make new friends in a way that was never thought of in the past. With MySpace, people who did not go out much could reach out to others from the comfort of their own homes.\nIn 2004, Facebook was created. It was originally a website created for use by Harvard University students, graduates, and faculty, but it soon expanded to include just about everyone. Facebook is an elaborate social networking site that has grown incredibly fast. It is now larger than some of the largest companies in the world. It is a website that is in constant change. New features are added regularly. Facebook has revolutionized the way people stay connected with each other and the rest of the world. The way it works is simple. Users can set up a new account easily. All a new user needs is an email address to start. Once a person has created an account, he, or she can invite friends by sending a request out to people they know who also have their own Facebook pages.

According to the legend, St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland. St. Patrick's Day has also become, especially in the United States, a day to celebrate Irish culture. In major cities across the country like in New York and Boston, there are parades and festivals. People wear green and decorate with shamrocks, a type of three-leaf clover. Some people wear buttons or tee shirts that say \"Kiss me, I'm Irish\". In the U.S. St. Patrick's Day is not a legal holiday, meaning government offices and schools are open.\nThe biggest and oldest parade takes place in New York City. It actually began about 250 years ago before the U.S. was even its own country. Every year thousands gather along to watch hundreds of Irish step dancers and bagpipe players march. Irish step dancing is done in groups or solo. Dancers perform complicated moves with their feet and legs while keeping their upper bodies stiff. The parade has also been a source of controversy because the parade is associated with the Catholic Church in New York City; gay and lesbian organizations have not been  allowed to march. Many people protest the parade or boycott it.\nSt. Patrick's Day has also become associated with the drinking of a lot of alcohol, specifically beer. One drink that is often seen around the holiday is \"Green Beer\". This is really  just regular beer with green food coloring. Many people feel like the holiday celebrates stereotypes about the Irish, like the myth that they all like to drink and get drunk. Others complain that the holiday has become too focused on drinking, with public drunkenness as a problem in major cities around the holiday."

There are also a number of smaller police agencies operating side by side with the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff's Department. Cities, such as Monterey Park, have their own police force, while smaller cities depend on the Sheriff's Department for their law enforcement needs. Because of the unique nature of the state, California created the California Highway Patrol.\nThe CHP, as it is usually called, is a police agency that is entrusted with patrolling the vast number of freeway miles that exist in California. The state was built during a time of great mobility after the advent of the personal vehicle. Because of this, the state has more freeway miles than any other states in the United States with the exception of Texas. However, California has the most licensed drivers, and by far, the most registered vehicles. This made it necessary to create a police force dedicated to its highways.\nCHP officers are endowed with the same powers other police officers have. However, they do not have a crime investigation team for any offense other than traffic-related crimes. Whenever the CHP first responds to a crime that is not traffic-related, its officers perform the same duties a regular officer does. It then turns investigations over to the LAPD, or Sheriff's office depending on the location of the crime. The CHP has a long, and storied history.

This was especially true in the summer when pretty girls would gather on the weekends, bonfires would line the shores at night, and vendors and artists would attract visitors to purchase their wares. There was never a dull moment while at the beach. But if it wasn't for the waters, Jeffrey and Chad would have no reason to go to the beach."

The last time we went to the park, we were playing catch and also hitting some baseballs with our bats. Some guys came up to us because they wanted to play a game of baseball. They needed two more players, so they asked us to play with them.\nJames asked me if I wanted to play, and I said yes. The guy's name was Christian, and he introduced us to all the guys. James introduced me and gave the guy our names. I asked Christian if I could play catcher. I always liked playing catcher at school. He said that I could and James got first base. During the game, James got a homerun and I was excited for him. I got on the base twice, but I got out all the time. I was sad, but James told me not to worry and that it happens.\nAfter the game, Christian and the guys told James if he wanted to go grab a drink with them. I thought James was going to go because he likes to drink, but he told them that he was going to take me out to eat. We thanked them for the game and Christian asked James for his phone number just in case they ever needed more players for a game. James gave it to him and then we went to go eat at Jim's Burgers.\nI asked James why he didn't go to drink with the guys. He told me that he knew his responsibilities. I didn't know what he meant, but I was glad he didn't go. Now, we could eat burgers and fries."

She wasn't sure if a pound was more or less than a kilogram. Kim decided to ask one of the grocery workers. The grocery worker was kind and explained that a pound was about half a kilogram.\n\"I wouldn't worry about it though. Just use the scale,\" the grocery worker. Kim went to the scale and was happy to see that the scales didn't use the metric system she was used to.  Kim weighed a pound of apples and put it in the shopping cart.\nThe next item on the list was a gallon of milk. Kim wasn't sure how much a gallon was. She was used to buying a liter of milk. There was also no way to weigh a liter of milk. She was glad that the milk containers were labeled.  She just wished the U.S. used the metric system."

Prior to the 1770s, the region was largely Indian country with the exception of 13 British colonies in the northeast part of the country. These colonies were known as the American Colonies, and were under British rule. The 13 colonies were a loosely connected group of individual states that were governed by the Continental Congress. The congress had been at odds against the British for several years, primarily because of the taxes that were being levied by their Parliament.\nIn 1775, after a year of war between the American colonies and England, the colonists decided it was time to become independent. The English Parliament had issued two unpopular taxes, which were imposed to help support the British after the end of the Seven Years War. The colonists asked Thomas Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence arguing that since the colonies had no voice in Parliament's matters, they should not be taxed.\nThe declaration was drafted by Jefferson on July 2, 1776, and was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th. Today, July 4th is celebrated in the United States as the day of independence from British rule. The declaration features what has been called the most famous sentence in the English language. It reads: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" These words were written to represent the moral and ethical standards the new country was meant to follow. It is a beautifully written document, and it stands for all that this country tries to be."

He also really wanted to go to Los Angeles to see where some of his favorite movie stars lived.\nOnce in New York City Gustav asked the hotel concierge if they could arrange some trips for him. The concierge was helpful and informed Gustav about the different Amtrak trains he could take to Philadelphia and Washington D.C.  \"What about the Grand Canyon and Hollywood?\" Gustav asked. \"What about them?\" the concierge asked, looking confused. \"What about trips there?\" Gustav asked. The concierge pulled out a map and showed Gustav how far Arizona and California are from New York. \"A train there will take you about a week.

People spend money on flowers, balloons, chocolate, stuffed animals, and jewelry. People also go out for expensive dinners. Valentine's Day is even celebrated by school children, who give thank-you cards to their teachers. Some high schools have Valentine's Day dances. Classmates give each other little cards. These cards can be purchased at any store with famous cartoon characters. It is considered much more thoughtful to have kids make handmade cards to give to friends and teachers.\nValentine's Day is also a great day to announce your love to someone like a secret crush. Some people even get married on Valentine's Day. However, you don't have to be in love to share in the festivities. You can say \"Happy Valentine's Day\" to friends and coworkers.\nValentine's Day is not an official holiday though in the U.S., meaning government offices and schools are open as usual. The date used to be the celebration of a Saint named Valentine who allegedly saved a young girl's life. It wasn't until the Middle Ages that romance somehow got mixed in with the date and lovers would send each other handwritten love notes. Back then you couldn't just go to the store and buy a card  the way you can now.\nYou know Valentine's Day is around the corner when stores begin to decorate with red and pink hearts and the symbol of Cupid, a winged ancient Roman god said to strike the hearts of people with his arrow. Now it seems Cupid goes straight after your wallet because you will also see many more jewelry ads as Valentine's Day approaches."

This practice will serve you well in both your academic and professional careers. Being punctual is possibly the single, most important thing for any job you may have. It is something that most employers expect from their employees, and it is also what many professors expect from their students.\nNothing disrupts a class more than a latecomer who habitually comes into the classroom late. Coming in 5 to 10 minutes late draws attention to the person coming in late, and interrupts the teacher who is trying to conduct a lesson. It also disturbs students who are concentrating on the professor's lecture. Being late is rude and looked down upon in American society. It also serves as a disadvantage to the person coming in late. If a student arrives 10 minutes late, he or she may miss an assignment, or roll call. Roll is called generally at the beginning of a class to see who is present and who is not. It also can indicate who comes in late to class. You don't want to get the bad reputation of always coming in late to class. So leave home a few minutes earlier to ensure you won't miss any class time. It is a good habit to get into because punctuality is important in the workforce.\nGenerally speaking, most employers set specific times for their employees to arrive to the workplace. Normally the workplace is in an office or factory, but sometimes could be at a remote location. Regardless of where your particular workplace is, it is important to arrive on time, or preferably a few minutes early. This shows your employer that you are a good employee who can be counted on to be at work. So be on time, and you will benefit greatly from this."

        "content": "Having your own space is a sign of success in the United States. However, renting an apartment is not easy. There are a number of steps you need to take. First, you need to figure out how much you can pay per month.\nWhen you first move into a new place, most landlords, or property owners expect you, the tenant, to pay a security deposit. A security deposit is an amount of money you pay a landlord sort of as insurance that you won't destroy their property while you are living there. Usually the security deposit is equal to the amount of one-month rent. If when you move out, the apartment is in the same condition as when you moved in, the landlord will return your security deposit. If the apartment has any damage whatsoever, including holes in the walls because you hung up posters, the landlord can legally use that money to fix the apartment.\nOnce you know how much you can afford, you can begin looking for apartments for rent. You can look in the newspaper or online. Also walk around a neighborhood you want to live in and be on the lookout for \"For Rent\" signs.\nThere are two ways to rent an apartment. Most landlords rent out apartments on an annual basis. This means you will sign a document called a lease, which says you will stay in the property for one year and pay rent on a monthly basis. If you decide that you want to break the lease, or leave before your year is up, there are usually fines you will have to pay. Another way to rent an apartment is on a month-to-month basis. This means that you pay by month, and are not obligated to stay for more than a month at a time."

Both of these police forces are some of the largest in the country. They handle a full-range of police duties ranging from traffic citations to murder, rape, and robbery cases. There are also a number of smaller police agencies operating side by side with the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff's Department. Cities, such as Monterey Park, have their own police force, while smaller cities depend on the Sheriff's Department for their law enforcement needs. Because of the unique nature of the state, California created the California Highway Patrol.\nThe CHP, as it is usually called, is a police agency that is entrusted with patrolling the vast number of freeway miles that exist in California. The state was built during a time of great mobility after the advent of the personal vehicle. Because of this, the state has more freeway miles than any other states in the United States with the exception of Texas. However, California has the most licensed drivers, and by far, the most registered vehicles. This made it necessary to create a police force dedicated to its highways.\nCHP officers are endowed with the same powers other police officers have. However, they do not have a crime investigation team for any offense other than traffic-related crimes. Whenever the CHP first responds to a crime that is not traffic-related, its officers perform the same duties a regular officer does. It then turns investigations over to the LAPD, or Sheriff's office depending on the location of the crime. The CHP has a long, and storied history. Many young Californians, both male and female, are attracted to the CHP, and enroll into its academy in Sacramento, the state's capital."

It is an energetic, loud, mockingbird that has decided to make the tree outside of Michael's window his new home.\nEach morning, the bird begins singing as loud as possible at exactly 5:55 a.m. and does not stop until late into the night. Most city birds begin the day with sweet, gentle chirps that can barely even be heard indoors, but the sounds of mockingbirds are very distinct and consist of various noises that the mockingbird hears and then imitates. This can include chirps from other birds, or even car alarms and school bells.\nAfter one week of losing sleep as a result of the bird noises, Michael decided to do something. \"Go away!\" he screamed out his window. When that didn't work, he started throwing things at the tree to try to scare the bird away. This only made the bird get even louder! As a final resort, Michael phoned his local Animal Control, and requested to get someone to remove the bird from the area. \"We can't do that,\" replied the Animal Control Specialist. \"Mockingbirds are a valued feature of North America's wildlife and are protected by many laws. You should consider yourself lucky to have one so close to home. Just enjoy the beautiful sounds of nature.\"\nFurious, Michael hung up the phone, and threw himself on the couch, dozing off into the deepest sleep he had ever experienced all week. Only five minutes later he awoke to a thunderous \"caw-caw!\" coming from outside."

        "content": "The parenting styles of parents in the United States are often criticized. One type of parenting that is criticized is a helicopter parent. This kind of parents hover over their children like helicopters, which means these parents are always on top of their children.\nWhile being an aware and involved parent is not a bad thing, helicopter parents take it to the extreme. The actions of helicopter parents actually hurt children, by not teaching them to be responsible for their actions. For example, a helicopter parents would call their adult college-age child to wake them up to go to class when part of college is learning to be responsible and learning to manage your own time. Helicopter parents are also overly worried about their kids getting hurt. This means helicopter parents hold back their child's natural curiosity. Part of growing up  means your kid has to get hurt, physically and emotionally. This is how lessons are learned. Instead, the kids of helicopter parents can grow up to be overly needy, dependent adults. Some people blame the rise of helicopter parenting on the rise of cell phones. Mobile phones make it easier for parents to track their kids all the time.\nThe opposite of the helicopter mom is the free-range mom. The free-range mom follows a slow parenting style, meaning she lets her kids explore the world at their own pace with little direction. The name free-range comes from the idea that kids should have the freedom to explore their world or range in a way that makes sense to them. This often means that free-range moms will not schedule activities like extra classes or play dates for their kids. Instead a free-range mom will just let her child play in a park. There is less of an emphasis on things like the latest toys."

Yet, in the middle of Manhattan Island is the most visited park in the United States, with 35 million visitors a year. Central Park, a National Historical Landmark, takes up 843 acres of land. It is a green space where people go to escape the noise and crowds of urban life. Before it opened in 1857, it wasn't an empty space. People lived on that land. They were mostly poor free blacks, Irish, and Italian immigrants. They were forced off the land to construct the park.\nOne section of the park is called Sheep Meadow. Now it's just a grassy area where people can lie in the sun, but actual sheep used to graze there from 1864 to 1934. The sheep from there were eventually moved to another park in the city. Many events take place in Central Park, especially in the warm spring and summer months. There is an outdoor theater, where Shakespeare's plays are performed. The plays are free, which causes such high demand that people line up for hours before performances to get inside. There are also free music concerts. Every summer a stage is set up. These Summer Stage concerts feature musicians from all over the world. Both the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera also host free performances in the park in the spring and summer. There are also two small zoos inside the park, and a number of small lakes in the park. One of the lakes rents out small mechanical sailboats. There is also a puppet theater and a carousel for kids.\nThe park is not dead in the winter. When it snows, families often go to sled or to go ice-skating in an outdoor rink owned by Donald Trump."

        "content": "Society in the United States is a complex matter. It is unique even among English-speaking countries. What is acceptable behavior or language in Australia, for example, may not be in the USA. Taboos are defined as socially unacceptable language, or behavior. There are simply some words and actions that society members cannot do in public. It is important to learn some of the taboos that exist in this country, especially for those who are new here. It will make the transition from your country of origin to the United States a little bit easier. The following are a few examples of American taboos.\nOne of the most common taboos in the U.S. is the use of profanity. Profanity, sometimes called cuss words, or swear words, is not considered proper conversation in some parts of the country. In large cities such as Los Angeles or New York, profanity is more common, but in much of the rural part of the country, it is considered vulgar and the person using profanity is considered of low quality. Another American taboo is speaking of the Christian God in a casual fashion. Religious beliefs run strong in the South and Midwest regions. Using the name of Jesus Christ or God will definitely be looked down upon in these areas.\nOther taboo subjects in the U.S. are sex, death, personal finances, and excretory functions. Excretory functions are body functions that involve waste materials. It is improper to speak of your personal bathroom visits, especially to the opposite sex. Personal finances are just that personal, and should never be discussed in social settings. It is no ones business how much money you make, or inquiring about how much money someone else makes. The same is true about sexual content. Lastly, it is considered in poor taste to speak badly about a deceased person."

The 1960s show is just one in a series of shows, plays, movies, and comic books that depict the \"Man of Steel.\" The most iconic actor portraying Superman was Christopher Reeve. Reeve starred in four movies during the late 1970s and 80s.\nIn the 1978 movie classic Superman, Reeve was cast as the legendary American hero based largely on his physical attributes, although he was an accomplished actor. Reeve had the classic Superman look. He was 6'4\" tall, weighed 215 lbs., with a square jaw, and other manly features that made him perfect for the role. The film won critical acclaim, and multiple awards, including a \"Special Achievement Award for Visual Effects.\" One of the selling points for the movie was that the special effects were so good that audience would believe that a man can fly after seeing this film.\nReeve went on to star in three sequels to the original movie, and had a very solid acting career in several movies after that. Tragically, Reeve and his family were hit with a devastating blow on May 27, 1995. Reeve was riding his horse through a steeplechase course jumping over obstacles. His horse suddenly stopped, throwing Reeve to the ground. Reeve suffered shattered vertebrae, and instantly lost the use of his arms and legs.\nReeve refused to give up. He spent the rest of his years advocating for spinal cord injury advancement in treatment and technology. He used his celebrity status to help the cause, but sadly, Reeve died at the age of 52 in 2004 due to complications from his injuries. He will always be remembered to his fans as the Man of Steel though."

It was a secret between Jane and Diana.\nJane and Diana would play together every day. Sometimes they would play within the doll house. They liked watching movies, playing hide and seek, and painting. They also liked playing outside with toy cars and drawing with chalk on the ground. Since Diana was far too big and Jane far too small, they could not play hide and seek and run over long distances. Instead they enjoyed playing their own version of hide and seek. When they played, it would have to be inside a small room. Jane was always the one to hide since it was easy for her to do so.\nOne day, it was Diana's birthday, and she had several of classmates from school come over to celebrate. Jane stayed hidden from plain sight in Diana's room. At one point, things became rowdy among some of the boys and girls, and they began to chase each other around the house. Then a few of them entered Diana's room and began invading her things. One of the boys got a hold of Jane who was in her doll house and started to toss and play catch with her among the boys. Then Diana came into the room and took notice of what was happening to Jane and immediately yelled for them to stop. They put Jane back down. Jane was so frightened but relieved to be saved.\n\"Get out!\" Diana screamed. After everybody left, Diana lifted up Jane and asked her if she was okay. Diana was happy to see that Jane was in one piece. It would be the last time that Diana would bring anyone over to play. This secret was too great to risk its discovery.

Prior to the 1770s, the region was largely Indian country with the exception of 13 British colonies in the northeast part of the country. These colonies were known as the American Colonies, and were under British rule. The 13 colonies were a loosely connected group of individual states that were governed by the Continental Congress. The congress had been at odds against the British for several years, primarily because of the taxes that were being levied by their Parliament.\nIn 1775, after a year of war between the American colonies and England, the colonists decided it was time to become independent. The English Parliament had issued two unpopular taxes, which were imposed to help support the British after the end of the Seven Years War. The colonists asked Thomas Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence arguing that since the colonies had no voice in Parliament's matters, they should not be taxed.\nThe declaration was drafted by Jefferson on July 2, 1776, and was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th. Today, July 4th is celebrated in the United States as the day of independence from British rule. The declaration features what has been called the most famous sentence in the English language. It reads: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" These words were written to represent the moral and ethical standards the new country was meant to follow. It is a beautifully written document, and it stands for all that this country tries to be."

He was also unanimously elected to a second term in 1793, the only president ever to garner 100 percent of the electoral votes. Washington was also the Commander-in-Chief of the First Continental Army that fought the British when the country was not yet established.\nHis epic \"Crossing of the Delaware\" river to recover New York City is still considered one of the greatest military moves in the history of warfare. At the time of the crossing, the British had taken Boston and New York. The Continental Army was on the run and disorganized, but Washington had a plan. He decided to take his troops across the Delaware River in the middle of winter. This was a move that many military minds thought impossible, but not Washington. The Americans were able to take New Jersey, and change the course of the war.\nAnother landmark moment for Washington was the winter at Valley Forge. In 1777, Washington led an army of more than 11,000 troops into Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, where the army suffered through a cold winter that claimed the lives of 3,000 men. When the spring arrived, instead of a demoralized, beaten group of soldiers, the army emerged battle ready, and able to continue the fight against the English in New York. The army was able to survive the fierce winter because of the training, and preparedness of Washington's officers. Washington earned the nickname, \"The Father of His Country,\" because of his military intelligence that led to the birth of the nation."

People give mothers gifts like flowers, cards, and jewelry to thank them for all their hard work. A popular symbol of the holiday is the carnation. This is because when the holiday first began in the U.S. people were encouraged to wear a red carnation if their mother was alive or a white carnation if their mother was dead. Many people take their mothers out for a special meal. In fact, Mother's Day is the most popular date in the U.S. for people to go out and eat and it is estimated that people spend billions on meals and gifts. Mother's Day is also the most popular day to make long distance calls in the U.S. It is the second most popular gift-giving day after Christmas.\nSince its establishment, Mother's Day has been criticized for becoming highly commercialized. In fact, the founder of the U.S. holiday, Anna Jarvis, began protesting the holiday and was even arrested for disturbing the peace for demonstrating. Jarvis's own mother started the campaign to establish a mother's holiday during the American Civil War.\nMothers are not the only people celebrated on this day. All mother figures including grandmothers, great-grandmothers, stepmothers, and foster mothers are honored on the holiday. In schools many students make special gifts, including handmade cards. While widely recognized, Mother's Day is not a federal holiday. Many other countries around the world have their own version of Mother's Day."

Last year, I got a DUI, which means Driving Under the Influence. If you get pulled over and you smell like alcohol, the police will ask you to take a breathalyzer test. When you do the test, you have to blow really hard into a machine, which will then tell you if you are over the limit to drive a vehicle. The limit is usually .08 blood alcohol volume. So, if you pass that, you are going to jail.\nEven though you won't go to jail for a long time, you will be suffering the consequences of your mistake for a long time. Here is a list of the things you will have to do if you get a DUI: go to court, go to alcohol education classes, go to Alcoholics Anonymous, pay a lot of money in fines. If you don't want to pay, you will have to do community service. I got my DUI almost two year ago, and I am still suffering the consequences. I still have 56 hours for community service.\nI have to update my insurance policy, and deal with the Department of Motor Vehicles. You waste a lot of time and money. It gets difficult to get a job, because you have to let your future employer know that you have been arrested. It's not worth it. If you are thinking about going out to celebrate and party with friends and family, do one of the following: get a designated driver, take the bus or train, or call a cab. It may cost you a little bit of money, but compared to how much money you will lose if you get a DUI, it's nothing. Don't drink and drive."

One tee-shirt people can buy even says, \"Our bodies of work speak for themselves\". They even sell beach towels with body outlines. The store is open five days a week. They also have a website and a paper catalog for those who are not close enough to visit. The Coroner's Office claims the purpose of the store is to tell people how fragile life is and to create awareness and responsibility toward one's actions.

It wasn't until Phil was about 12 years old that he began to realize that there were better things out there in the world. Phil and his best friend Albert would sit around and talk about getting out of this place to see the world. It was a fantasy, but it was a good fantasy. They really didn't know how they would do it, but they had a dream. Then one day Phil's cousin Ralphie came to visit.\nPhil didn't know Ralphie very well. Ralphie grew up in Texas and was about 8 years older than Phil. It had been years since Phil saw his cousin. That day Ralphie changed Phil's life. Ralphie walked into the house wearing his Marine Corp uniform, and Phil knew at that moment that he wanted to become a Marine.\nPhil and Ralphie talked all night long. Ralphie told him all about the Corp and Phil was fascinated. Ralphie was wearing his medals and awards, and his uniform was so neat and clean that Phil wanted to join at that moment. Five years later, Phil enlisted in the Marines. He was 17 and needed his mom's permission. His mom said \"Where do I sign?\"Of course she was joking, but she knew Phil was going to do this. It was his way out of this place, so she gave him her blessings. The day Phil left, he promised his mom he would be back. He kept his promise. He came back several times over the years, and helped his family as much as he could."

        "content": "Camping is a popular way for many people in the United States to spend their vacation. Camping involves people leaving the comfort of their home and driving to spend a few nights or more in the great outdoors.\nWhen people camp, they can sleep in a tent, a camper, or if they want to be fancier, they can sleep in a cabin. Some people like to really \"rough it\" and use no shelter except for a sleeping bag and sleep under the stars. Some people drive across the U.S. in what is known as a recreational vehicle or RV, which is a trailer. Inside there are beds, a tiny bathroom and a kitchen.\nThere are campgrounds all over the United States. These are places where campers gather together and usually pay a fee to pitch a tent or place a camper in a designated outdoor spot. Many of these campgrounds have water hoses and electric hookups so that people can wash dishes and themselves and plug in a radio or their computers.  Most campsites also have a fire ring or pit, which is a hole in the ground where people can safely make a fire for roasting marshmallows, a popular camping activity. There usually is also a picnic table for people to eat their meals. Many of these campgrounds also have shared bathrooms complete with showers. Some campgrounds have playgrounds, pools, and game rooms. Some also organize activities for people who like sing-alongs, where people will gather together and sing songs. Usually it is illegal to camp in a place not designated as an official campsite, meaning you can't just pitch a tent in a forest.\nWhen people go camping they often do other outdoor activities like fishing, canoeing, hiking, kayaking, swimming, horseback riding and mountain biking."

It was the most tragic day in the history of the country since December 7, 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. September 11th was the day Muslim extremists hijacked four commercial airliners in an attempt to destroy the American spirit by slamming those jets into four buildings. Three of the four jets reached their targets, while one was stopped by a group of everyday heroes who gave their lives for their country.\nIn the early morning hours on September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 slammed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. A few minutes later, Flight 175, also an American Airlines flight, struck the south tower. Both suicide attacks brought the towers down, but not immediately. It took time for the extreme heat from the burning jet fuel to weaken the towers to their eventual collapse. At about the same time, American Airlines, Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, which is a government building in the country's capitol, Washington D.C.\nThe fourth flight, United Airlines Flight 93, was also headed for the capitol city. Most people think its target was either the capitol building, or the White House, the president's home. A group of brave passengers, upon hearing the news of what was happening in the country, decided to take down the giant airplane even though they knew they would not survive. They stormed the cockpit and took the controls from the hijackers. The plane flew out of control, crashing into a field in the state of Pennsylvania, where all passengers were killed.\nIn all, about 3,000 Americans lost their lives on that day, but the American spirit was not suppressed. Those responsible for the attacks were quickly dealt with, and the country soon began its journey to recovery. September 11, 2001, a day America will never forget."

It could be a result of a traffic accident, or a dispute over ownership of an item. The court system tries to get people to resolve their problems without bringing those problems into Small Claims Court, but that is not always possible. When two, or more people have a conflict they cannot resolve on their own, Small Claims Court may be a good option to explore.\nSmall Claims Court is a special court where disputes are resolved quickly and inexpensively. In this court, the rules are simplified and the hearing is informal. Attorneys are generally not allowed. The person who files the claim is called the plaintiff; the person against whom the claim is filed is called the defendant. Additionally, you do not need to be a U.S. citizen to file a suit in this court.\nHere are some of the things individuals can file a suit for in Small Claims Court. If your former landlord refused to return a security deposit you paid, you can take him to Small Claims Court to get your money back. Another common suit is when a person causes a traffic accident and refuses to pay for the repair of the victim's car. In the U.S. the person who is at fault of the accident is almost always responsible to pay for the damages he or she caused. Another common Small Claims Court case comes when a person lends money to someone who refuses to pay it back. This is definitely something the court can help you with. These are just a few examples of what a person can sue for in Small Claims Court. For more information, visit the California Consumer Affairs website."

He learned that the Amber Alert system is an emergency broadcast system used to let people know when a child is abducted. It was named for a little girl named Amber Hagerman, who was kidnapped when riding her bike in Texas. Little Amber was found dead later.\nThe news made David feel sad and angry, but he also felt like now he could do something to help.

The main cause was Southern states feeling that the U.S. federal government in Washington D.C. should not have the power to tell them what to do. This was especially true about two issues, taxes and slavery. The Southern economy was based on agriculture while the Northern economy was based on manufacturing. Southern crops  like cotton were sold to factories and then Southerners had to pay taxes on the finished goods sold back to them like clothing. Many Southerners felt this was unfair. Additionally the agricultural economy in the south was reliant on the labor of enslaved Africans and their descendants. Many people, especially from the North, felt this was wrong and that slavery needed to be abolished. Southerners felt the abolitionists were threatening their way of life. Seven Southern slave states, banded together, declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America. The government in Washington D.C. and its army was known as the Union, since they were fighting to keep the country united.\nAbraham Lincoln was president of the United States during the Civil War. The President of the Confederate States was Jefferson Davis. The first battle was the Battle of Fort Sumter. During the war President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate States of America. This action was supposed to show that Lincoln was still in charge of the entire United States.\nThe Civil War was the bloodiest war fought inside the United States. 620,000 were killed and millions more were injured. One of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War was the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. 51,000 people from both sides died, more than in any other battle. The Civil War ended in 1865 when General Robert E. Lee of the Confederate Army surrendered."

He was just too young, and would call it \"Dizzyland\" as he couldn't pronounce it properly. His father had taken his older siblings to the park many times, but that was years ago. Anthony was much younger than his brothers and sisters.\nFor a long time, Anthony kept asking his parents to take him to Disneyland, but the feeling eventually wore off. He quit bugging his parents to take him. One day, when Anthony was about 8 years old, a classmate came to school bragging about his weekend at Disneyland. All of a sudden, Anthony wanted to go again. \"Please, mommy, take me to Disneyland,\" Anthony pleaded to his mom. His dad heard it, and immediately told him \"Okay, son, we're going this weekend for sure.\" Anthony's dad hadn't realized that his youngest child had never been there, and felt very bad about it.\nThe weekend came, and Anthony was so excited. He couldn't keep still. When they got into Disneyland, Anthony marveled at the castles and other attractions. He especially liked the life-sized characters that roamed the park. He grew up watching Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Now he was taking pictures with them. Anthony was \"in heaven.\"\nThe best part of the theme park is the rides. \"Can we go on the Captain Nemo Ride?\" That question was soon followed by \"Can we go on the Matterhorn?\" Soon Anthony had gone on just about every ride. He was overwhelmed by the place. Soon the family was back in their SUV heading back home with Anthony fast asleep. It was the greatest day of his young life.

Licensed stores sell numbered tickets, or people can pay to choose their own numbers. When you let a machine pick your numbers, it is usually called a Quick Pick. Many people play lucky numbers, numbers associated with birthdates or other important numbers to them. The money earned from selling lottery tickets goes to pay for schools, roads, bridges, and other public services. Once a week or more, a drawing is held where the numbers are randomly picked. If your ticket has those numbers, you could win a cash prize.\nThere are different types of lotteries, such as Powerball, Mega Millions, and Lotto. Powerball and Mega Millions are known for their large payouts. There are also instant lottery tickets that are scratch-off cards. The winnings tend to be less money, but they are extremely popular.\nIn the United States, you can play the lottery, or buy a ticket if you are 18 years or older. If you win, usually you have the option of being paid the entire amount in one lump sum or of being paid smaller amounts over a number of years. Lottery winnings are taxable, meaning the amount you actually get is smaller than the jackpot number. People can buy lottery tickets or play the lottery at many convenience stores. Lotteries are also very popular since they advertise. There are many television commercials, radio commercials, and billboards urging people to play.\nLotteries have been controversial since they are essentially a form of legalized gambling. There is concern that it can lead to people becoming addicted to gambling. There are also illegal lottery games, usually run by some forms of organized crime."

Mobile food trucks, or catering trucks, were formerly seen mostly at places of business. Some businesses that had a large number of employees contracted with these trucks to bring food to the company's site to provide breakfast and lunch. It was an alternative choice for many workers who preferred to stay close to work at lunch time.\nThe catering truck industry began getting very competitive as food truck operators became more commonplace. The way to ensure companies would continue doing business with their food trucks, caterers had to diversify their menu items to become more appealing to their customers. Soon catering trucks became specialized eateries offering foods ranging from tacos and burritos to hamburgers and hotdogs, and more exotic foods.\nOne of the most famous catering trucks is the Kogi truck. Los Angeles is home to hundreds of different cultures and the Kogi truck is a marriage of Mexican and Korean cuisine. People drive for miles to eat a Kogi Kimchi Quesadilla, or a famous spicy pork, or tofu taco. Kogi burritos are just as tasty and exotic. The short rib burrito is one of the favorite items on the menu. Kogi is just one example of the diversity in mobile dining available in Southern California.\nToday, the food truck industry is growing larger and larger. Many operators have their own websites so that their customers  can see beforehand where they will be parked for the day. The days when catering trucks served only businesses are now over, although they still do catering to businesses, an entire new branch of trucks has hit the streets of Los Angeles."

You are not anyone in Los Angeles if you don't have a car, or at least that is what some people say.\nBefore that, Mario had never owned or bought a car in his life. His father warned him about the sales people. \"Don't ever pay the asking price, son,\" he said. Mario looked at him with disbelief. \"What do you take me for, dad? I am not an idiot.

The actual potato is a lot more useful than a person who sits on their sofa watching television or playing video games. One of the reasons why obesity rates are going up in the country is because more and more entertainment is available on television. Now television is not just for watching shows, people can watch movies, play video games, and even surf the Internet. Potatoes and sofas have other things in common, too. When most people are on their couches interacting with television, they are also often eating snacks like potato chips. This is why so many people in the United States are overweight.\nBeing a couch potato can have other health risks besides weight gain. Because more and more people are sitting in front of a television screen or even a computer screen, they aren't engaging in other physical activities like exercising. This is one reason why heart disease is a leading cause of death in the country. Another problem caused by this lack of exercise and increased screen time is weakness in muscles. There is an impact on people's mental and emotional health, too. Sitting inside in front of a screen usually means a person is spending less time interacting with friends and loved ones. This can lead to isolation, depression, and anxiety.\nBeing a couch potato is not just for adults. More and more kids are being targeted by television and the Internet. This is why  more and more children have weight-associated health problems. This is why the White House has programs like Let's Move, encouraging kids to engage in physical activity."

It is traditionally celebrated in the spring and lasts about a week.\nAccording to the story in the Bible, God punished ancient Egypt with 10 plagues. The last plague killed Egyptian first-born males. Jewish people were told to mark their doors with lamb's blood so that God would know to pass over these houses and not kill any first-born males inside. This is where the name of the holiday, Passover, comes from. After this last plague the Egyptian king, known as the Pharaoh, agreed to release the ancient Jews from bondage. The Bible story also says that the Jewish people left their homes in such a rush after they were freed that they didn't have time to wait for the bread to rise. This is why at the commemorative Passover meal, Jewish people eat matzo, bread without yeast, also known as unleavened bread. The matzo and other foods are eaten at a special meal called a seder.\nThere are very specific rituals that happen at the Seder meal. These rituals are all in a book called the Haggadah. Inside the Haggadah is also the story of the Jewish exodus from Egypt. During the seder meal parts of the Haggadah are read aloud. The first part of the meal is a blessing over wine. The second part of the meal is the washing of hands. The third part of the meal is when someone dips some sort of vegetable in salt water and then eats the vegetable. The vegetable symbolizes the humble origins of the Jewish people. The water symbolizes their tears. The fourth part of the meal is when three pieces of matzo are broken."

The groups success has never been duplicated, and its music is as popular today as it was in the 1960s and 70s.\nLennon wrote, or co-wrote some of the most memorable tunes ever written in the Rock n Roll genre. He found great success as a member of the Beatles, which is the most commercially successful group in history, and as a solo artist. Lennon was also a political activist. His views on religion and politics caused a great deal of controversy in the United States. He was an outspoken critic of the countrys involvement in the Vietnam conflict. His popularity caused great concern with government officials because he had the attention of the young people in America at the time.\nLennon had been living in New York for several years, where he was being watched by the FBI in order to find grounds to deport him from the United States. He used flamboyant gimmicks to spread his word of peace. In this passive protest, Lennon and his wife Ono addressed the media from their beds claiming people should make love, not war. Lennon was killed on December 8, 1980 by a crazy gunman outside his home in New York City. A memorial plaque at the site of his death is one of the most visited sites in the country."

        "content": "Donald Sterling is an American businessman who gained much of his wealth during the real estate boom in California many years ago. He is also the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, a professional basketball team of the National Basketball Association. Sterling has owned the Clippers since buying the team in 1981. Although Sterling is a very successful and rich man, his team has seen very little success in the NBA over the years. In recent years, the Clippers have made some strides in the league, having made the playoffs every year since 2011.\nSterling was recently in the news for a very different reason, though. On April 25, 2014, a controversial news and entertainment show aired a recorded conversation between Sterling and a female friend, where Sterling is heard making racial comments about some of her black friends. Sterling is not kind in his description of these friends. He said he did not want her bringing any black people to his Clippers games because he did not want her to be seen publicly with them.\nSterling's rant gained international attention. The NBA is made up of more than 90 percent black players, so many people questioned how Sterling could feel this way about many of his own employees. His comments created an immediate backlash from the black community and from Americans as a whole. He was under pressure from the NBA to sell the team after many black people commented that they no longer would attend his games.\nThe NBA has issued a lifetime ban against Sterling, which effectively prohibits him from entering any arena to view a basketball game for the rest of his life. Sterling challenged the ban, and refused to sell the team."

I asked him what was wrong, if the baby was okay. He looked at me and said yes, but that the baby was actually a girl. My grandma looked at him, and smacked him in the head. She said, \"That's wonderful news. Don't look so depressed!\"\nMy dad laughed and said \"No, I'm not depressed, I'm just confused.\" For the first three months of her life, my sister looked like a boy. She wore nothing but boy's clothes, because that's all my parents had gotten for her. I took a lot of pictures, so I could tell her later that she was actually a boy, but an accident happened that changed her into a girl. My mom deleted all my photos because it was mean.\nI'll never forget the look on my dad's face when he came out of the delivery room. He looked like he was trying to solve a big math problem in his head. It was like he was trying to count from one to a million, luckily my grandma slapped it out of him."

She remembers turning to her aunt to say, \"I'm going on a ship like that one day, auntie.\"\nTrue to her words, Susan left Nebraska, and moved to Los Angeles, California. She wanted to live near the ocean, and was delighted to discover the Queen Mary was permanently docked in Long Beach. The grand ship, which has the same size of the Titanic, is now a museum and tourist attraction. She didn't hesitate to book a tour of the ship. \"This is wonderful,\" she thought to herself.\nUpon arriving on board, Susan was not disappointed. It was everything she hoped it would be. The ship was restored to its original state, which was very luxurious. The tour she took highlighted the ship's history and importance over the years. She ate at one of the three restaurants, and stayed the night in the ship's hotel. The Queen Mary was built in the 1930s in Great Britain, and enjoyed many years sailing across the Atlantic Ocean. It was host to many dignitaries such as Winston Churchill, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and many Hollywood celebrities. During World War II, the ship was assigned as a troop transport where it was used to transport up to 18,000 Allied soldiers per trip.\nAfter the war, it was restored to its original state, and began its transatlantic travels. In 1967, the city of Long Beach purchased the aging ocean liner, and it has been a popular attraction for the city ever since. \"It is living history,\" said Susan, after her visit."

Hampton is more than a pet. He helps me be self-sufficient and do the things that I need to do in the city,\" the woman explained. The woman also told Jose Luis that service animals had to go through special training so that they learn how to behave in public places and do not get distracted. \"People need to help too though, by not petting him,\" the woman added.\nThe woman continued to explain that service animals do not just help the blind. Some animals act as therapy animals. Therapy animals go into hospitals and nursing homes. These animals lower the stress levels of people who are very sick or who have just had operations.

For a long time it was observed on a specific date, October 12. It is named after Christopher Columbus, the Italian sailor who led three Spanish ships to claim new lands in 1492. There is even a child's poem remembering the date. It reads, \"In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue\". Some people say Columbus \"discovered\" North America, although not everyone agrees with this interpretation. For example, Columbus never landed on North America proper. He only got as far as to the islands in the Caribbean Sea.\nColumbus Day has been a federal holiday since 1937; government offices, schools, and post offices are closed. Many Italians take the day as a day to celebrate their own ethnic heritage since Columbus was born in Genoa, Italy. Columbus's explorations, however, were conducted in the name of Spain. Major cities, like New York City and San Francisco, host large parades. Some cities, like New York City, also hold a parade celebrating the Hispanic or Latino community.\nNot everyone thinks Christopher Columbus should be honored. Some states like South Dakota do not observe the holiday at all. Instead they call the day Native American Day or Indigenous Peoples Day. In Hawaii the holiday is also known as Landing Day or Discoverer's Day. This is because European arrival in North America meant the loss of land and lives for many Native people. Many people hold protests or vigils on this day to remember the Native Americans that were killed or enslaved as a result of the European arrival. Another name for the holiday is \"Dia de la Raza\" which translates into English as Day of the Race."

Very poor families, the elderly, and disabled people can get up to about 2,000 dollars a month to help pay rent in single-family homes and apartments. Families who qualify do not get a completely free ride though. In order to qualify, you must be able  to pay about 30 percent of the rent yourself. The rest of the rent is paid directly by the government to a landlord. Not all landlords accept Section 8. If you qualify for Section 8, it is your responsibility to find a landlord who accepts the program.\nEligibility for the program depends on your annual income and how many people are in your family. To qualify you have to be a U.S. citizen or a legal resident of the U.S. If you are undocumented or have a tourist visa, you cannot apply for this program. Like with all public housing programs, you will have to fill out an application to see if you qualify. On the application you will have to say how much money you make, how much money you have in the bank, and how many people are in your family. You will have to give proof of how much you make. The government will ask to speak to your boss, see your bank statements and proof that you pay taxes.\nIf you qualify, you will probably be put on a waiting list. Section 8, like other public housing programs, has many people applying for them. You could be waiting many years before you actually get a voucher, which is like a coupon that says how much rent the government is willing to pay for you. If a landlord accepts you and your Section 8 voucher, you still have to sign a lease, or rental contract."

One of the first instances where Maher questioned Catholicism was when his father stopped taking him and his sister when he was 13. He discovered his father was angry at the church because of their stance against birth control. His father has become an outspoken person against all organized religions ever since.\nMaher is currently the host of the HBO show \"Real Time with Bill Maher.\" It is a highly-rated, late night show that has received many Emmy nominations for excellence. It is a controversial show where emotions run high between Maher and his guests. Maher speaks his mind, and this has been a source of trouble over the years, but it has also earned him praise.\nIn 2001, Maher came under criticism for his comments about the terrorist attacks on the United States in September of that year. President George W. Bush had publicly called the attackers \"cowards,\" to which Maher took exception. Maher stated on his show that the real cowards were the Americans. \"We have been the cowards,\" said Maher. \"Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away; that's cowardly.\" He later said he was not criticizing the American military, but only pointing out that America plays a large role in Middle East politics.\nMaher has also made enemies among religious organizations. He says he dislikes religion, which he calls an unnecessary bureaucracy between people and God. He was once very liberal about every religion, but has changed his views on Islam saying he knows of no other religion that calls for the death of anyone who criticizes their religion.

A funeral parlor is a place where the preparation of the corpse for burial takes place. Part of the preparation can be dressing the deceased, doing their makeup, and placing them in a coffin for people to see. Some people do have a closed casket wake, where you can't see the dead person; some people are not even choosing coffins for their dearly departed loved ones.\nIn the United States, more and more families are choosing not to have traditional wakes. There is a recent trend of people having non-traditional wakes with the deceased person posed doing something they loved doing when they were alive. For example, a family in New Orleans had their dead loved one posed at a table with a cigarette between her fingers and a can of beer. One funeral home in Puerto Rico has become famous for its non-traditional wakes. It all started in 2008, when a family asked for their dead loved one to be propped up against the wall of their home for the wake. When a paramedic died, his family had his dead body in the driver's seat of an ambulance. Another family had a man propped up in a fake boxing ring for his wake. One dead man was posed on top of his motorcycle. Recently, a grandmother was posed sitting in her rocking chair.\nThese non-traditional wakes have their critics though. Some people think they are disrespectful. They think of death as a solemn and sad occasion, not a time to pose the dead as if they were toys. Fans feel it helps them remember the dead as they were when they were alive."

Once they got the fireworks, Nancy decided to split them with her brothers. She got the most, and her brothers got the rest.\nNancy's parents decided to go to the park to light the fireworks this year. Peter decided to light the first one. It exploded, and scared Nancy. Nancy decided to light one. It was a sparkler, which meant that it would only send sparks up into the sky, and would not explode. Nancy loved how it looked. She lit another one to see how it would look like. Peter had the idea to jump over the fireworks. Even though Nancy said no, Peter decided to jump over it.\nPeter got ready. He tied his shoes to make sure his shoe laces weren't hanging out of his shoes, and that he had enough distance to jump over the sparks. Peter started running and then jumped. When he landed on the other side, he started screaming in pain. A spark had gotten into Peter's eye. He fell to the ground and started asking for ice. Nancy brought him a bag of ice to cover his eye. During the next day, Peter had to get glasses because of the damage he had suffered in his eye. The doctor asked him, \"What's the important lesson here?\" Peter responded with, \"Don't jump over fireworks.\""

        "content": "Finding a job in California is not an easy task. One of the most important factors in finding a job is having completed a course of study in college. This is not as easy as it may sound. Many young people have not found their field of interest. Some go to college simply because their parents want them to.\nA degree from an institution of higher learning will definitely increase employment opportunities for most people. However, there are numerous professions available to people that do not have a degree. To help these people find jobs, the state of California has an Employment Development Department that is dedicated to helping people find jobs. The EDD has offices located throughout the state. Many of these offices have Work Source centers, where a person can visit, and use EDD computers to find jobs, and meet with employment representatives.\nOther resources available to job seekers are employment agencies. Employment agencies work closely with companies of all sizes to help fill the needs of these companies. The agencies serve as pre-screeners for these companies, some of which may not have the resources to handle new hires. Some of these agencies seek specific people to fill specific jobs, while others help anyone who comes into the office.\nInternships are another way for people to gain employment. Interns are not paid for their work, or are paid very little. The purpose of an internship is for the company to see first-hand how a person works before hiring them. By using this method, employers gain insight into the workers' character and work ethic. Interns gain valuable experience they can use for future jobs."

        "content": "One of the great American heroes during the darkest days in the country's history is General George S. Patton. Patton was a career army man who is best known as the head of the European Theater of Operations during World War II. Patton came from a military family. His ancestors can be traced back to involvement in several U.S. campaigns in the Revolutionary War, Mexican War, and the American Civil war. With this kind of background, Patton knew he wanted to be in the military from a young age. He was known as an eccentric field commander who was quick-tempered. He carried an ivory handled sidearm that he reportedly was quick to wield.\nPatton was born November 11, 1885 in San Gabriel, California. His first exposure to military life came from his family. He was first involved in combat during an excursion into Mexico in 1915. He was a big advocate of tank warfare, and convinced the government to build an effective tank force following Germany's incursion into Poland at the start of World War II. He called tanks the \"future of modern warfare.\" He was involved in creating tank training centers in the United States in preparation for U.S. involvement in the war. Patton was in North Africa when the U.S. entered the war following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. He was given command of the U.S. Seventh Army in Europe at that time.\nPatton was involved in the most significant campaigns the country fought in the great war. His defining moment may have been his command of American forces during the infamous Battle of the Bulge. This battle was Adolf Hitler's last ditch attempt to turn the fortunes of war toward the Germans after a series of defeats at the hands of the Allied forces. It was an epic tank battle won by the United States that sealed his legacy as a field commander."

Most children stay in elementary schools till they are about 11 years old. Elementary schools are divided by grades. The youngest children begin in kindergarten at 5, and then go to first grade, second grade and so on. Most elementary schools go up to fifth or sixth grade.\nThe focus of an elementary school is basic academic and socialization skills. Mostly children learn how to read, write, count, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Students also learn the rules of English grammar, spelling, and vocabulary. Children also learn basic social studies or history, science, art, and music skills, and participate in gym or physical education. In elementary schools children also learn how to follow directions, share, and work in groups. Students usually stay in one classroom all day with one teacher who stays with them throughout the year. Students may leave the classroom to visit the school library, the school gym, and attend special science, art, and music classes. Students also usually leave the classroom for lunch and recess. For lunch students sit at tables, separated by grade, in a large cafeteria. Recess is usually a half hour when children go out into a yard to play. The typical school day starts at about 8:00 in the morning and ends at about 3:00 p.m. Students go to school from Monday to Friday and have the weekends off.\nElementary school teachers are licensed by the state where they work. They have to graduate from college, or even graduate school taking special classes in Early Childhood and Elementary Education. Before teachers can be in a classroom with students, they have to pass a background check and take an exam."

Eddie liked the name as soon as he heard it.  From then on, the name of Eddie and Jake's band was Jetsam.\nEddie and Jake started learning how to play songs on their guitars together. Although they both listened to a variety of Rock groups, they focused primarily on learning the songs of their favorite ensemble -- The Beatles. Almost everybody loved The Beatles. Learning to sing and play their songs seemed like the best thing to do.\nAfter learning a handful of songs, Eddie and Jake both felt ready to perform in front of an audience. Eddie and Jake got their acoustic guitars and performed at an open music night at the local community center. The audience roared with thunderous applause after Jetsam's set ended.

She was an accomplished author, poet, and entertainer, who had a major impact on modern American culture. She was considered an international, renaissance woman for her life work that included civil rights activism. Angelou was born in St. Louis, Missouri on April 4, 1928. She experienced racial discrimination during her early years, but leaned on her upbringing and culture to get her through the dark times of her life.\nShe first became interested in the arts as a teenager. She won a dance and drama scholarship at San Francisco's Labor School. However, at the age of 14, she dropped out of the school, and took a job as the city's first African-American female cable car operator. She had a child at an early age, and supported her son by working as a waitress, and cook, but her love of the arts soon consumed her.\nDuring the mid-1950s, Angelou was involved in several theatrical performances, which prompted her move to New York City in 1958. In New York, she became an accomplished writer, but circumstances surrounding blacks in the next decade changed her focus. She began working tirelessly for the civil rights movement. The assassination of civil rights leader, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., on her birthday affected her deeply. After King's death, Angelou began concentrating on writing her life story. Her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings received critical acclaim. It chronicled her early years growing up as black in a predominantly white American culture. In all, Angelou wrote seven autobiographies, and her work is considered an integral part of American culture."

Children under a certain age or below a certain height sometimes can ride for free or for a lower fare; the elderly and disabled usually ride for a discounted price.\nMost mass transit buses accept cash fares; almost all buses accept coins. However, a passenger has to have exact change because bus drivers do not make change. Some buses accept tokens that you can buy at some bus depots or train stations. Across the country, more and more buses use a fare card system. These are cards loaded by passengers with a certain amount of money; it could be a day, week, month or annual pass. They are swiped, tapped, or scanned when riding. The fare is automatically deducted. What is good about a fare card is that they can be reloaded via the Internet or by phone, so a passenger doesn't need to go to a station to add money. Fare cards also make transferring from one bus line to another easier. Many cities even allow for free transfers from one bus line to another when using a fare card.\nLight rails, subways, and trains usually have a similar system of paying your fare. However, people cannot pay to ride using cash since there is no one there to collect the fare. Most rail-based mass transit systems require a token or a fare card. Many rail systems have turnstiles that are locked until you swipe or tap your fare card. Some people do not like fare cards because they worry about where they are going being tracked."

They take selfies of their commutes to work or school. People take selfies of themselves eating. Other people take selfies to show what they are wearing or whom they are hanging out with.\nThe most common way to take a selfie is by holding a cell phone at arm's length. Some people take selfies by taking a picture of their reflection in a mirror. In these pictures, you can usually see the phone the person is taking a picture with. Selfies taken using a mirror often are taken in a bathroom, which some people think is offensive. The bathroom is a very private place, not a place to take pictures.\nSome people think that selfies are a sign that people are becoming vain or superficial. It is not often that people take pictures of themselves that make them look bad. When people take pictures of themselves, they usually are trying to present themselves in the best light.

He was hired in 1987 by the Bulls as an assistant coach, and took over the head coaching job in 1989. Helping him win the titles was Michael Jordan. Jordan is one of the most successful athletes ever to play the game of basketball. Many people claim that Jackson was able to win his six titles because of Jordan, while others point out that Jordan preceded Jackson without ever winning a title. In any event, the duo worked, and the rest is NBA history.\nJackson join the Los Angeles Lakers as coach in 2000. The Lakers were in a similar situation as the Bulls during that time.

All public housing options are rental options, meaning you do not own the place where you live.\nEligibility for public housing is based on a number of factors. One factor is your annual gross income, meaning how much money you make in a year. Another factor is if you are elderly or have a disability. Another factor taken into consideration is your U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status. Most public housing options are only available to U.S. citizens or U.S. legal residents. Like with any rental, your references are checked to make sure you and your family will be good tenants. This means looking at your credit history and your criminal record. People with criminal records are usually banned or not allowed to use public housing options.\nTo find out if you are eligible for public housing, you need to visit a government housing assistance office close to you. You can find your local housing assistance office by checking the yellow pages or by looking online. You will have to fill out an application.

He didn't win his first competition, but he got valuable experience, and is looking forward to next year's event. \"I don't give up easily,\" Mark told his dad.\nDemolition derbies got their start in New York in 1947 when former stock car racer Larry Mendelsohn realized that many people liked watching crashes more than racing. He began staging his derbies and they soon became popular at fairs and festivals. There are few rules involved with driving in a derby. Drivers can use any part of their cars to ram into other vehicles to disable them. The only rule is drivers cannot hit the driver side door where the driver sits. Most competitors use the rear portion of their vehicles to ram others, so as not to disable their own motors. Demolition derbies are a true American creation."

        "content": "Columbus Day is observed on the second Monday of October in the United States, and in some other countries around the world. For a long time it was observed on a specific date, October 12. It is named after Christopher Columbus, the Italian sailor who led three Spanish ships to claim new lands in 1492. There is even a child's poem remembering the date. It reads, \"In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue\". Some people say Columbus \"discovered\" North America, although not everyone agrees with this interpretation. For example, Columbus never landed on North America proper. He only got as far as to the islands in the Caribbean Sea.\nColumbus Day has been a federal holiday since 1937; government offices, schools, and post offices are closed. Many Italians take the day as a day to celebrate their own ethnic heritage since Columbus was born in Genoa, Italy. Columbus's explorations, however, were conducted in the name of Spain. Major cities, like New York City and San Francisco, host large parades. Some cities, like New York City, also hold a parade celebrating the Hispanic or Latino community.\nNot everyone thinks Christopher Columbus should be honored. Some states like South Dakota do not observe the holiday at all. Instead they call the day Native American Day or Indigenous Peoples' Day. In Hawaii the holiday is also known as Landing Day or Discoverer's Day. This is because European arrival in North America meant the loss of land and lives for many Native people. Many people hold protests or vigils on this day to remember the Native Americans that were killed or enslaved as a result of the European arrival. Another name for the holiday is \"Dia de la Raza\" which translates into English as Day of the Race."

Most people continue partying well after midnight into the wee hours of the first day of the new year. In fact, many New Year's parties include breakfast or brunch. Sometimes at the stroke of midnight there will be fireworks and couples often kiss. One of the most famous New Year's celebrations takes place in New York City's Time Square, where a huge cut crystal ball drops at midnight in front of millions of people standing in the cold. Many more millions watch on television. Some groups, called Polar Bear Clubs, jump into the cold ocean water on New Year's Day as a literal way  to start the new year fresh.\nNew Year's Day, January 1, is a national holiday in the United States. This means that schools, banks, government offices, and post offices are closed. Given how much people tend to drink alcohol on New Year's Eve, many people wake up on New Year's Day with a hangover. The national holiday is a good day to recover.\nMany people go out partying with their friends on New Year's Eve; many people use New Year's Day to visit family members. New Year's Day is also when many people start on their New Year's resolutions. A resolution is a promise to change a lifestyle habit. The most common resolution is to lose weight. Many people also join gyms as part of their resolutions.\nOn New Year's Day there are also parades such as the famous Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, where all the floats are made of different colored roses and they compete for awards. Many people also watch college and professional football games, including the Rose Bowl, which is also held in Pasadena, California."

She pulled out her ideas to show to her friends. Her friends were impressed and excited to begin painting. They first started by outlining the images of the ideas onto both walls. Next, they mixed their colors and began to paint. Painting the mural was a lot faster to do when you have the help of your friends. They finished both murals within two days.\nThe new murals attracted the attention of local visitors to the library. The owner of the library was impressed and happy with the new look of his library.

He was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs. His father was a machinist who liked to spend time with his son taking electronic components apart, and reassembling them. This is when and where Jobs developed his interest in mechanical reconstruction. Jobs was not the best student in high school. He was known as a class clown, although he was very intelligent. It was in high school that he met Wozniak.\nBoth Jobs and Wozniak had a great interest in electronics, and the pair was known for making computer technology smaller, cheaper, and more accessible to average persons. Jobs got his start working as a video game designer for the Atari Corporation. Once Jobs got Apple going, he sold his first computers, which were called the Apple I, for $666.66 each. The Apple I earned Jobs nearly $800,000 its first year, and that was just the beginning. The Apple II earned the fledgling company nearly $140 million, and by 1980, the company was worth $1.2 billion.\nJobs branched out his financial kingdom venturing into other businesses such as Pixar Animation Studios, which was also very successful. He briefly left Apple to found the NeXT Corporation, which produced both software and hardware, but NeXT floundered, and Jobs went back to Apple to develop iPhone and iPad. Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, and eventually lost his battle with cancer in October, 2011."

It will cost a renter or homeowner very little money every month. The hope is that you will never need it. If that day ever comes, however, you will be very happy you have insurance. Insurance on your apartment or home can protect you from a large financial loss.\nLet's face it. Sometimes good people become victims of crime. Some criminals are very sophisticated. They will watch a home for weeks to learn when it is more likely that no one will be in the home. Most people have a regular work schedule, so thieves may know when you leave for work, and when you come home. Coming home to a burglarized house is an awful feeling. Beside the financial loss of having to replace all your hard-earned possessions, there comes a feeling of being vulnerable. You are just not as safe as you thought you were. Having insurance can help you overcome this.\nBeing a victim of a burglary is not the only thing that insurance can protect you from. You may suffer a house fire, or a flood may destroy your home. Living in Southern California brings its own unique problems with earthquakes. Having an insurance policy can help you get back on your feet if any of these situations arise. If you are renting an apartment unit, renter's insurance is available at a low cost. Like any other purchase, the best thing to do is to do a little shopping around. Insurance rates vary by company. Take a little time to research the company, and buy the policy that best fits your situation. You will not regret it."

This massive earthquake, which is the third strongest ever recorded in history, triggered various powerful tsunamis that reached over a dozen countries' shores. Nearly 230,000 people were killed by the catastrophe, and hundreds of thousands of others ended up injured or missing. In the midst of all the devastation caused by this disaster, many amazing and inspiring survival stories have emerged. One of the most extraordinary of these is the story of a young girl named Wati.\nThe tsunami struck her hometown of Aceh when she was only eight years old. Like so many others, the powerful waves separated her from her family, and she ended up being washed into an unknown town. After many years of searching for her, her family gave up and assumed she had died after being swept away. Miraculously, Wati was returned to her parents seven years later, at the age of 15!\nAccording to Wati, she had been \"adopted\" by a stranger who found her on the streets after the tsunami. Although the woman took her in to live with her, she forced Wati to beg on the streets and would often beat her if she did not make enough money. The girl had tried to find her family by asking for help from strangers, but did not remember the names of her parents and could only vaguely remember that she had a grandfather named Ibraham.\nFinally one day, a cab driver who heard Wati's story happened to know an old man with that name in a nearby town and decided to take her to him. Although the old man did not recognize her at first, he took Wati to see his daughter. \"When I saw my mother, I knew it was her,\" said the 15-year-old. \"I just knew.\" The parents were able to confirm that it really was their daughter based on a scar and birthmark on the girl's hip. This miraculous story is unfortunately one of the only confirmed reunions among families that were separated by the disaster."

He has directed such blockbusters as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan.\nBorn into a Jewish family on December 18, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, the young Spielberg showed an interest in filmmaking during his teen years. When he was 12 years old, Spielberg created a nine-minute film to earn his photography badge in the Boy Scouts. This was the first film he made. His parents divorced when he was 13, and Spielberg moved with his family to California. After graduating from high school, he applied to the University of Southern California (USC) to learn filmmaking, but did not graduate. Instead he attended Long Beach State, where he earned his degree in Film Production and Electronic Arts, 35 years after first attending college.\nHis early work was as a television writer, having written scripts for popular shows such as Night Gallery, Marcus Welby, M.D., and Columbo in the 70s. His breakthrough film in Hollywood was 1975's Jaws, which is one of the most popular, highest-grossing blockbuster in the history of the Silver Screen. He followed the success of Jaws with several films that have earned him a spot in Hollywood lore. His films have become household names.\nSpielberg shows no signs of slowing down. He is involved in several film projects as a director, and a producer. Spielberg has been married twice, and has six children.

Those living in the colonies were especially angry about taxes the British were forcing them to pay. People felt taxes were unfair because there was no colonial representation in the British parliament. One tax was the stamp tax, which taxed printed materials such as newspapers. The colonists called this \"taxation without representation\". Colonists who wanted freedom from English rule were known as Patriots. Those who supported British rule were known as Loyalists. Before full scale war broke out, there were many acts of protest by patriots, like the Boston Tea Party when Bostonians boarded British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into the harbor because of a tea tax. On April 19 the first shots were fired in Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts, which officially started the war.\nMany people were involved in the struggle for independence. Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams worked together to write the Declaration of Independence. On July 4, 1776, patriots declared themselves free. Most people know George Washington was the first president of the United States. Before that he was the commander-in-chief of the patriot army. Most of the battles in the American Revolution were fought in the northeast in places near Boston, and New York.\nThe British, known as redcoats because of their red uniform jackets, had help from German mercenary soldiers called Hessians. Patriots had support from other Europeans. France entered the American Revolution on the side of the colonists in 1778. This helped force the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1779. However, fighting would not formally end until 1783 with the Treaty of Paris when Great Britain recognized the United States as an independent nation."

His dad took him onto the field one day when the team was having a photo day. Johnny couldn't believe how big the field was. All his favorite Giants were there taking pictures with fans. \"Can I take a picture with Willie Mays' dad,\" Johnny asked gleefully. \"Of course, Johnny. Let's get in line,\" said his dad. Willie Mays was one of the greatest players to ever play the game, and he loved kids, too. That is why the line to take a picture with him was so long. Johnny didn't mind though. He was in baseball heaven.\nThe Giants played their archrival, the Los Angeles Dodgers, that day. There had always been a bit of bad blood between the two teams over the years. It started when both teams were based in New York. They were cross-town rivals at that time. After the teams moved to California in the late 1950s, the rivalry continued.\nThe Dodgers were always one of the better teams in the National League, and even though Johnny grew up a Giants fan, he really didn't hate the Dodgers. \"I think the rivalry was blown up, to tell the truth,\" Johnny said years later. Baseball fans are very fickle and stubborn though, and some play the rivalry up as much as they can. No true Dodger, or Giant fan would ever admit liking the other team in public, but Johnny suspects there is a mutual respect for each team in both cities."

        "content": "During the 1970s, one of the biggest movements occurring in the United States was the fight for equal rights. Many members of American society felt disenfranchised and discriminated against, especially in the workplace. Some American workers enjoyed a living wage complete with benefits and other advantages, while others struggled to earn enough to survive. One of the most oppressed groups of workers during this time period was California farm workers.\nThe farm workers were migrant workers who came into the country mostly without documentation to work in the fertile fields of California's Great Central Valley. This region in central California has often been described as the country's fruit basket because of its rich soil and high yields. Farm workers tended these fields during the day, and lived and slept on the farm at night. They earned less than the state's minimum wage, and had no fringe benefits other American workers enjoyed. Cesar Chavez changed all that.\nCesar Chavez, the Arizona-born civil-rights activist and labor leader, became the voice of these workers, and began a movement to bring basic rights to this group. Taking the lead from the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Chavez began a series of non-violent demonstrations protesting the deplorable conditions farm workers had to endure. Many of these workers worked much longer than eight hours a day, and received no overtime pay. Chavez, who was a farm worker himself in the 50s, led marches, and called for boycotts. These activities were very effective in changing the working conditions for farm workers and other oppressed workers.\nChavez was highly recognized during his lifetime, and his legacy increased after his death in 1993. He has reached iconic status among the Mexican-American community."

For example, some Islamic women wear a scarf called \"hijab\" to cover their head. It is disrespectful to ask a Muslim woman to take off her hijab or ask for her to show you what is under it. Male followers of an Indian religion called \"Sikhism\" usually wear cotton turbans. Again it is wrong to take a person's turban off or ask that they take it off. Male followers of Hasidism, a branch of Judaism, have long curls on the side of their heads. They wear a fringed prayer shawl. Other Jewish men may wear a small cap on their heads called a yarmulke.

It is traditionally celebrated in the spring and lasts about a week.\nAccording to the story in the Bible, God punished ancient Egypt with 10 plagues. The last plague killed Egyptian first-born males. Jewish people were told to mark their doors with lamb's blood so that God would know to pass over these houses and not kill any first-born males inside. This is where the name of the holiday, Passover, comes from. After this last plague the Egyptian king, known as the Pharaoh, agreed to release the ancient Jews from bondage. The Bible story also says that the Jewish people left their homes in such a rush after they were freed that they didn't have time to wait for the bread to rise. This is why at the commemorative Passover meal, Jewish people eat matzo, bread without yeast, also known as unleavened bread. The matzo and other foods are eaten at a special meal called a seder.\nThere are very specific rituals that happen at the Seder meal. These rituals are all in a book called the Haggadah. Inside the Haggadah is also the story of the Jewish exodus from Egypt. During the seder meal parts of the Haggadah are read aloud. The first part of the meal is a blessing over wine. The second part of the meal is the washing of hands. The third part of the meal is when someone dips some sort of vegetable in salt water and then eats the vegetable. The vegetable symbolizes the humble origins of the Jewish people. The water symbolizes their tears. The fourth part of the meal is when three pieces of matzo are broken."

Many African slaves did not have their birth dates recorded into official records during that time period because they did not have basic human rights. They were considered property owned by their white masters. It was a dark time in the country. Frederick Douglass helped change that.\nIt was illegal in the southern states to educate blacks at that time, but Douglass was fortunate enough to have been educated by the wife of his master, who began teaching Douglass the alphabet when he was 12 years old. He continued his education on his own after that. With his new reading skills, Douglass began teaching other black slaves the New Testament. He had a sympathetic owner, who did not see any harm in this activity, but his neighbors did not see eye to eye with him. It wasn't long before the lessons ended, after violent measures were taken by the white community members.\nDouglass eventually escaped slavery, and settled in the state of Massachusetts, where he began his struggle to end slavery. Douglass became one of the most influential people of his generation. He made powerful friends in the U.S. government. During one of his lecture tours in 1843, Douglass was nearly beaten to death by an angry mob, who did not agree with his message of abolition. He fled the country on a couple of occasions to avoid being put into a state of slavery again. While in Europe, Douglass spoke to enthusiastic crowds on the evils of slavery."

        "content": "One of the most important days of the year is April 15, which is the deadline for all the United States citizens to file income tax forms. Income tax is a tax placed on working individuals on the money they earned the previous year. Both the state and federal governments impose this tax, and in some cases, city and county also. For most individuals, the employer deducts your federal, and state taxes from each pay period. The amount they take from workers is based on a W-4 form that is filled out as part of the hiring process. Each company is required by law to hold income tax from their employees, with few exceptions. In order to gain legal employment in the U.S., a person must have a Social Security Number (SSN). This is the number individuals use to file their taxes each year.\nThe most common federal tax form used by individuals is the form 1040, followed by the 1040EZ. These federal tax forms are similar, but the form 1040 is more complex. The 1040EZ is a form that many new employees use especially if they do not earn much money.  The rate that a person is taxed is partially based on the number of dependents that person has. For instance, if an individual has a wife and three children, the husband can claim five dependents (including himself). This person will be taxed at a lower rate than a person who has only one, or two dependents. When filling out the employer's W-4 form, individuals must be honest about the number of dependents they claim.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the agency that collects income taxes for the federal government, and in California, it is the State Tax Franchise Board. Tax forms are available online at www.irs.gov for federal taxes and at www.ftb.ca.gov for California."

She was also spending a lot of time on Facebook. It took a lot of time and energy to keep up with everyone's status updates.\nKatherine started to think. She looked at the list of over 500 friends she had on Facebook and realized some of them were not really friends at all."

        "content": "Summer time in the United States generally means people have a lot more free time to enjoy the outdoors. The sun is out for longer, so there are more hours in the day to enjoy. Having more free time does not mean you need to spend a lot of money. There are plenty of ways to enjoy your city or town for little or no money.\nIn the summer, many parks offer free concerts. Sometimes these concerts feature bands and musicians that are well known. Other times the concerts are given by up and coming artists. Regardless of whether you know  the band playing or not, these free concerts in the park are a great way to enjoy music outdoors. If you arrive at the park early with your friends, you can even have a picnic.\nMany parks also offer free outdoor screenings of movies. It's always a good idea to arrive early to get a good viewing spot. Being too close to the movie screen is no fun; your neck will hurt. Sitting too far means you'll have to squint. These outdoor movie screenings are also great for picnics.\nIf theater is more of your thing, most major cities have some Shakespeare-in-the-park programs. These programs feature different works of Shakespeare performed live and outdoors. Many of these programs are free. Some of these Shakespeare-in-the-park programs are so popular that people line up for hours to get free tickets. Usually the tickets are first come, first serve. If all the tickets run out before you get to the front of the line, then you are out of luck. So get there early!\nIf you don't have air conditioning, many museums offer free admission days or hours. Besides the museums being cool temperature wise, they are also cool because you can see amazing works of art."

        "content": "The union system in the United States is very intricate and complex. Unions exist in just about every industry. They serve to represent employees in several ways. Some are more aggressive than others. They all gain strength from the number of workers in the union. The greater the number of workers is, the stronger the union is. Unions, sometimes called Labor Unions, represent more than 10 percent of the labor force in the country today.\nUnions collect monthly dues from each of their workers usually through payroll deductions. It is a good idea to learn whether or not a company you may want to work with has a union. Once you are a member of a union, you belong to an organization that will deal with the company's management in several different ways. The single most important thing unions do for their workers is to negotiate pay rates and benefits packages. The idea is that there is strength in numbers. Having a union representative negotiate a pay raise with a company is better than having to negotiate on your own. Once pay rates are established, every worker doing the same job gets the same pay.\nUnions also negotiate benefits packages, which include retirement. A strong union can protect workers from being taken advantage of by a company. Most union jobs are in the manufacturing industry and the jobs there are highly desirable. It is not easy to get into one of these jobs, but if you are fortunate enough to land a union job, you may like it.\nEven in the face of all this, unions are on the decline in the United States. A lower number of workers in the U.S. belong to unions today. There are many reasons for this, but mainly it is because the labor laws in the country protect workers much like unions did years ago."

Summer school isn't easy though. Gabi has to master the material in 6 weeks instead of the 20 she had during the regular school year.\nSummer school also meant that Gabi would be stuck in a hot classroom while most of her friends were at the beach or local amusement parks. Her friends passed algebra, so they had most of June, July, and August free from school work. Going to summer school also meant that Gabi's family had to change their summer vacation plans.\nGabi had to be in summer school from 9 a.m. to noon. She couldn't stay up late on weeknights or sleep in. She had to be on the bus at least an hour before class started or else she would be late. The classrooms were hot since the school building was old and did not have air conditioning. When Gabi came home from school, she couldn't do whatever she wanted. After Gabi took the bus home from school, she had homework to do.\nThis was the first time Gabi had to go to summer school. She wanted it to be the last time. Gabi made a promise to herself. In the fall, when regular classes begin again, she will try her hardest to pass. Sweating in a classroom while your friends are out having a good time is not fun.

The biggest one is usually the cost of a mortgage if you are fortunate enough to own a home. Rent can also be expensive depending on where you live. Then there are costs such as car payments, insurance, food, clothing, and miscellaneous items. To live better, it is best to acquire a high-paying job. The higher the job pays, the easier it is to meet your financial responsibilities, but there are exceptions to that rule. Some people want to enjoy the work they do, and pay is secondary.\nMany jobs use a time clock system to keep track of the hours their employees work. If a worker works a set number of hours, usually 40, time clocks are an efficient way to keep track. It not only tracks the number of hours employees work, but it can also show if the employees are coming in on time, and leaving after the work shift is over. You do not want your time clock to record too many late arrivals or absences. It is a good idea to come into work a few minutes early in case you are delayed on your trip. There are many ways an employee can be delayed on his or her trip to the workplace. If you drive your own car, there can be accidents or car failure. If you use public transportation, buses and trains can also be delayed, so give yourself a few extra minutes. It is always best to prepare for the unexpected."

German automaker, Karl Benz, is credited with inventing the first motor vehicle in the late 1880s, but Ford was the man who made it possible for everyday citizens to own one. Before Ford came up with his assembly line process, cars were built one at a time by hand, which was a very costly and inefficient method of production. Ford's assembly line revolutionized the way cars were built, and his methods are still in use today.\nIn 1886, Benz patented his Motorwagen, which was a four-wheel, two-passenger, self-powered motor coach that was designed to replace the horse and carriage. These vehicles were expertly crafted, but were available to only the wealthiest people of the time. Thanks to Ford, that all changed in 1906. His Ford Motor Company, the first automobile company to use assembly line techniques to build cars. transformed the automobile from an expensive curiosity to a practical tool that could be used to transport people and goods easily and efficiently. His first mass-produced product was the Model T. It remains one of the most sold vehicles ever, and was the first to reach 15 million sales.\nFord's impact on the 20th Century cannot be overstated. At one time it was estimated that nine out of 10 vehicles on American roads were Fords. His cars spurred the American economy like no other single factor. The country's roadways were built in response to the great number of vehicles Ford and subsequent American automakers produced. Additionally, Ford's vehicles created a network of support industries such as parts, repair, and maintenance services. It also caused a revolution in how goods were transported in the country. Henry Ford was a true American icon."

This central California region boasts more than 400,000 acres of natural beauty that is uniquely Californian. The park is known as the Land of the Giants because of its beautiful trees. The landscape features great mountains, foothills, deep canyons, a large cavern system, and, of course, the world's largest trees.\nThe park sits side by side with King's Canyon National Park in the stunning San Joaquin Valley. Sequoia National Park was officially established as a national park in the 1890s. It features 14 campsites that include picnic tables, fire rings for outdoor cooking, and food storage boxes. It is a great place for a family vacation with many of its campsites open year round. But the most popular attractions are its forests. The ancient trees are some of the oldest living organisms on earth, and draw millions of visitors worldwide. Redwood trees can reach heights of more than 375 feet. They are closely related to the Giant Sequoia trees, and are often mistaken for each other. They both are uniquely Californian, as they do not grow naturally in any other region in the world.\nRedwood trees live up to 2,000 years, and have branches that grow up to five feet in diameter. Its bark can grow up to 12 inches thick. The Giant Sequoia trees can live up to an astonishing 3,000 years, and have branches up to eight feet in diameter. Its bark can grow to an amazing thickness of three feet. Both trees have dark brown bark, and look very similar, but the Redwood thrives in coastal climate, while the Sequoia exists in more mountainous areas.

An urgent care center provides medical services to those that are in need of medical care that is not life-threatening. Life-threatening injuries or illnesses should always be treated at an ER. For example, if you are in an auto accident and suffer great injuries, or if you think you are having a heart attack, it is best to go directly to an emergency room, not an urgent care facility. Many times emergency medical personnel responding to your call will take you to an ER automatically.\nSome of the typical ailments that may be considered treatable by an urgent care facility include sprained ankles, muscle strains, breathing difficulties, fever or flu, severe sore throat, and skin irritations. Most of the time, these conditions do not require a visit to the ER and can be treated at an urgent care center. However, if a person goes to an urgent care facility and it is determined that his or her condition requires an ER visit, the professionals at these facilities will arrange transportation to an ER. Some conditions are not treatable at urgent care centers.\nAnother difference between the two is that emergency rooms are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, whereas urgent care facilities are open and available during the center's regular working hours. Most major medical facilities offer urgent care treatment and services. If you visit a particular medical center regularly, it would be a good idea to check to see if it provides urgent care to its patrons."

Sometimes guests are expected to dress according to the theme as well. For example, the Toga party is a type of theme party where guests are expected to dress in togas, really just white sheets. Toga parties used to be especially popular among college students. In a masquerade party, everyone wears a mask and has to guess who is behind it. The mystery is part of the fun. Speaking of mystery, there are murder mystery parties, where the guests have to solve a fake murder. Some adults throw parties based on seasons. A summer beach party, for example, might feature guests wearing their swimsuits. Another popular type of theme party is the game night party. In this type of party, people get together to play  various board games. A variation of the game night party is the casino party, where adults play games typically found in a casino-like blackjack or poker.\nAnother theme party could focus on a specific region or country. For example, a Mexican theme party might feature tacos, the colors of the Mexican flag and Mexican music. Guests should be careful when dressing up for these types of theme parties though. Dressing up like a certain ethnic or racial group is usually considered offensive. It's better to just enjoy the food, and not portray a stereotype."

Sometimes co-workers of a pregnant person will also throw a baby shower.\nThe baby shower is usually given when the mother-to-be is between 6 and 9 months pregnant.

A baby shower can be held in someone's home or outside, like in a restaurant or catering hall. Traditionally only women are invited to a baby shower. However, more and more baby showers are also including the father-to-be. Like with a bridal shower, a mother-to-be will often register a wish list of things she wants at one or several stores. This list usually consists of things the mother wants for her baby including clothes, diapers and even furniture like high chairs and cribs. This way friends and family members can go to the store and buy something from the list. Registering helps make sure that there aren't repeat items, like 30 bottles when a new mom only needed 15.\nSome baby showers also feature a paper mache wishing well. This is not just for decoration. People can  put cards inside with wishes for the new baby and mom. Most of these cards also contain money or gift cards to help the mom-to-be buy whatever else she needs for the baby. Sometimes there are games at a baby shower. In one game everyone guesses the due date of the baby. Another game has people taste  baby food and guess the flavor"

Most dictionaries define humor as \"the quality of being amusing or comic, especially as expressed in literature or speech.\" It is an important tool in communication and socialization between human beings, especially in the United States. Many tense moments between people are lightened by the use of humor. A person who possesses a good sense of humor is usually regarded as a friendly person who is fun to be around. Humor has been known to relieve stress also.\nHumor is everywhere. For example, laughter is one of the first things you do as a newborn, and, if all goes well, it will be one of the last things you do before you die. If you try going through a day without a laugh, you'll find that it's downright impossible. Humor is also not exclusively a human experience. Many creatures in the animal kingdom have been observed engaging in humor and laughter. Additionally, humor influences many of our daily decisions such as the websites, books, and magazines we read, the television shows and movies we watch, and the people we decide to talk to or not. The importance of humor cannot be understated.\nHumor has physical benefits, too. Laughter, especially a hearty laugh, has been shown to benefit your circulation, lungs, and muscles, especially muscles around the belly area. Humor also helps people deal with pain and physical adversity. It has been discovered that humor improves the overall makeup of the human psyche when used during times of grief such as a death in the family. Thinking about the fun times you may have had with a deceased person may seem inappropriate, but studies have shown it helps people cope with the grief to a great degree, so go ahead and have a good laugh once in a while."

It accounts for 17 percent of the nation's population, and 63 percent of those Latinos are of Mexican origins. The Cinco de Mayo is a large celebration in the country's southwest region.

Living on your own, or sharing a place with someone else, comes with financial responsibilities though. To be able to pay your share of rent and living expenses, it is a good idea to create a budget. A budget is the practice of gathering your income and expenses to help you keep track of your spending so that you won't fall short at the end of the month.\nAlong with your monthly rent are food, clothing, utilities, transportation, phones, and entertainment. There may be other expenses you have to pay monthly, but those depend on the individual's lifestyle. Only you can determine what expenses have the most priority in your life. Managing money can be a tricky thing. There often are unexpected expenses that come up from time to time, so it is a good idea to try to save a portion of your monthly income. Having some savings can be very helpful when an unexpected bill comes your way.\nAccounting for all your monthly expenses can also help you identify whether or not you are living within your budget. If you find that you have more expenses than income, a budget will help you see where you can cut corners. If, for instance, you are paying too much for your cell phone, you may want to get a cheaper plan. If you are paying too much rent, then it might be wise to move to a more affordable place, or take in a roommate. Whatever financial issue you may be having, a budget will help you figure it out."

Many people, regardless of their religion, put up and decorate a Christmas tree. The tree can be a real evergreen or it can be an artificial tree. Lights, strings, tinsel, and even popcorn can be used to decorate a Christmas tree. On the top of the tree is a star or an angel. The decorations are usually  red and green.\nThe purpose of a Christmas tree is to have a central location to place gifts. According to legend, a jolly fat man with a beard, named Santa Claus, leaves presents under the tree. Children in the U.S. often write lists of things they want Santa to bring them. Many parents bring their children to shopping malls across the country to tell a man dressed as Santa what they want. These children are often also  photographed with the mall Santa as a keepsake. On Christmas Eve many children leave milk and cookies for Santa. Of course it is the parents that buy the gifts from the wish lists, and even eat the cookies and drink the milk. On Christmas Day children usually wake up early and run to the tree so they can see what Santa brought them. Adults can also exchange gifts at this time.\nPeople don't just decorate a tree at Christmas. Many also elaborately decorate their homes with lights. Some of the displays are even synchronized to Christmas songs called carols. Originally these songs were religious, but now they are about the spirit of the season."

        "content": "In today's world, it is not unusual for people to board a plane, and be halfway around the world within hours. The jumbo jetliners in use today are commonplace in most developed countries, but there was a time, not long ago, before air travel was even possible. That was before Orville, and Wilbur Wright built and flew their first aircraft in the early 20th Century.\nOn December 17, 1903, the brothers made their historic flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, officially opening a new era in travel. Their contributions to the new science of aeronautics continued for at least 10 years after that historic day. What separated the Wright brothers from other aviation pioneers was that the brothers developed an effective mechanism to control their airplane. Their three-axis control system is still in use today, more than 100 years after its development.\nThe first flight was not a very long one. It totaled only 120 feet long, 10 feet high, and only 12 seconds in duration, but it was flight. Orville piloted the plane, as Wilbur ran alongside. There were only five eyewitnesses to the flight, but one photographer captured the image on film, and the rest was aviation history.\nThe brothers were very protective of their new invention, and made it difficult for reporters to chronicle their efforts. This led to widespread rumors that the entire thing was a hoax. For the next several years, the brothers worked to refine their flying machine in secret, leading to more doubt. However, in 1908, the brothers took their invention to Le Mans, France to put on an exhibition. Wilbur guided his aircraft making turns and other maneuvers, which amazed the crowd. Soon, the Wright Brothers were famous. They changed the way people travel."

Yet, in the middle of Manhattan Island is the most visited park in the United States, with 35 million visitors a year. Central Park, a National Historical Landmark, takes up 843 acres of land. It is a green space where people go to escape the noise and crowds of urban life. Before it opened in 1857, it wasn't an empty space. People lived on that land. They were mostly poor free blacks, Irish, and Italian immigrants. They were forced off the land to construct the park.\nOne section of the park is called Sheep Meadow. Now it's just a grassy area where people can lie in the sun, but actual sheep used to graze there from 1864 to 1934. The sheep from there were eventually moved to another park in the city. Many events take place in Central Park, especially in the warm spring and summer months. There is an outdoor theater, where Shakespeare's plays are performed. The plays are free, which causes such high demand that people line up for hours before performances to get inside. There are also free music concerts. Every summer a stage is set up. These Summer Stage concerts feature musicians from all over the world. Both the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera also host free performances in the park in the spring and summer. There are also two small zoos inside the park, and a number of small lakes in the park. One of the lakes rents out small mechanical sailboats. There is also a puppet theater and a carousel for kids.\nThe park is not dead in the winter. When it snows, families often go to sled or to go ice-skating in an outdoor rink owned by Donald Trump."

        "content": "Whenever a person is prescribed a medication, it is important for the person to read and understand the label that comes with the medication. Important information for dosage, frequency, and side-effects of the drug is contained in these labels. Prescribed medicines are drugs that cannot be purchased without a prescription, which means only a doctor can give you access to them. The reason for this is because most prescription drugs are more potent than the so-called over-the-counter drugs. Prescribed drugs are usually focused on a specific ailment, and come with side-effects that can cause other issues to the patient.\nLabels on prescribed medicines also contain other vital information such as the number of pills in the container, the date issued, the number of times you can reorder the prescription, the name of the drug along with the name of the pharmacy that issued the drug. This information is important because of the nature of most prescription drugs and their side effects. Some side effects could impair the patient severely. The drug could make you nauseous, or impair your vision. Some can also make you drowsy, which means the patient should not drive a car, or operate machinery. It could be dangerous to the patient, or to others that may be nearby.\nIt is good to know exactly what prescribed medicines you are taking. If you are ever in need of emergency medical treatment, this information is important to the medical personnel treating you. Some drugs do not interact well with others. So if you know what drugs you are taking, emergency medical professionals will know what not to give you. So know your drugs by reading the labels."

        "content": "One day you may be at a party, or at work, or may be just enjoying a movie, or doing a little shopping when something serious happens around you. Choking is no laughing matter. When a person is choking, his or her airway is obstructed and the person cannot breathe. Let's say you are at a restaurant when your guest, or maybe even a complete stranger, begins to gasp for air and clutches at his or her neck. This is a clear sign that something is very wrong, but what do you do? Your actions in the next few minutes can mean the life or death of a person right in front of you.\nChoking is the mechanical obstruction of the flow of air from the environment into the lungs. Choking prevents breathing, and can be partial or complete, with partial choking allowing some, although inadequate, flow of air into the lungs. Prolonged or complete choking results in asphyxia which leads to anoxia and is potentially fatal. Oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops, so you can see how important it is for you to act, and to act quickly.\nIf a person can still breathe and talk, coughing often does the trick. But when someone is truly choking, it means the food or object is completely blocking the airway and air cannot flow into and out of the lungs. When the person cannot cough the object out and cannot breathe, talk, or even make noise, it means choking is severe. You should begin by using the Heimlich maneuver, but it is important that you are trained in administering this treatment. If you are not trained in the Heimlich maneuver, find someone who is, or call the 911 emergency number immediately."

This massive earthquake, which is the third strongest ever recorded in history, triggered various powerful tsunamis that reached over a dozen countries' shores. Nearly 230,000 people were killed by the catastrophe, and hundreds of thousands of others ended up injured or missing. In the midst of all the devastation caused by this disaster, many amazing and inspiring survival stories have emerged. One of the most extraordinary of these is the story of a young girl named Wati.\nThe tsunami struck her hometown of Aceh when she was only eight years old. Like so many others, the powerful waves separated her from her family, and she ended up being washed into an unknown town. After many years of searching for her, her family gave up and assumed she had died after being swept away. Miraculously, Wati was returned to her parents seven years later, at the age of 15!\nAccording to Wati, she had been \"adopted\" by a stranger who found her on the streets after the tsunami. Although the woman took her in to live with her, she forced Wati to beg on the streets and would often beat her if she did not make enough money. The girl had tried to find her family by asking for help from strangers, but did not remember the names of her parents and could only vaguely remember that she had a grandfather named Ibraham.\nFinally one day, a cab driver who heard Wati's story happened to know an old man with that name in a nearby town and decided to take her to him. Although the old man did not recognize her at first, he took Wati to see his daughter. \"When I saw my mother, I knew it was her,\" said the 15-year-old. \"I just knew.\" The parents were able to confirm that it really was their daughter based on a scar and birthmark on the girl's hip. This miraculous story is unfortunately one of the only confirmed reunions among families that were separated by the disaster."

Many American military personnel were returning to civilian life after their service to the country. Some of these young people decided not to go to college after high school so that they could serve their country during that time of need. When they returned, many of them turned to the community college system in California to continue their education.\nThe United States government introduced the G.I. Bill at that time giving returning servicemen and women educational benefits to help them get back to school. Soon community colleges and new school districts began appearing throughout the country. Community colleges helped ease returning military personnel back into college life. It was a low cost, less stressful alternative to going back to a four-year university.\nToday, community colleges attract students from all parts of the world. In California, a large population of students comes from Asia and Latin America. These schools provide a second chance to international students who may have experienced difficulties attending college in their native countries. American students who may have not done well academically in high school, and did not enter a university, can turn to community college for a second chance, too.\nCommunity colleges provide a much-needed resource for all these students. Former military personnel, international students, and high school students alike, are all welcome. One of the best things about community colleges is that they accept anyone at anytime. This means people who have not found what they want to do in life can try more than one area of study. If they don't like one course of study, they can always try something else. That is the beauty of community colleges."

Right after the ceremony the newly married couple, the bridesmaids, and the groomsmen will go somewhere to have photographs taken. While this is happening, guests are usually treated to a cocktail hour at the reception site. During this time appetizers and drinks are served. This also gives guests a chance to socialize. After the cocktail hour, the main dining hall is opened. At a wedding reception the seating is usually prearranged. Each guest will receive a card telling him or her where they are expected to sit. Tables are arranged by numbers. In front of the reception hall, there is a special table for the bride and groom.\nOnce everyone is seated, waiters begin to serve salad or bread and drinks.

He excelled in acting, screenwriting, film producing, and comedy.\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois on July 21, 1951, Williams' family moved to California when he was 16. He got his start in the entertainment industry as a stand-up comedian performing in San Francisco, and Los Angeles. His high school classmates described Williams as quiet and funny leading to Williams being named \"Least Likely to Succeed\" in his senior year. He won this \"award\" even though he was elected class president. Williams' big break came when he appeared on the popular 70's TV show Happy Days. The show introduced Williams to the American public.\nHis guest appearance on happy Days led to the creation of his own TV series called Mork and Mindy, where he reprised his role as the wise-cracking alien. This was just the beginning for Williams, though. He went on to star in a number of Hollywood blockbusters including The World According to Garp, Popeye, Mrs. Doubtfire, Good Morning Vietnam, and The Dead Poet's Society.

It all began by going to a Christmas tree lot, where vendors sold freshly cut trees to the public. Families can walk through the lots to pick the tree that is right for them. Michelle loved going to shop for a tree because of the sweet aroma that would come from the trees. \"I like this one, daddy,\" Michelle said. \"It's perfect,\" her dad agreed and bought the tree. It was just the right size, with full, green branches.\nOnce the tree was brought home, Michelle helped her mother place the tree in the right spot, and began decorating it. Her brothers and sister would help, too. This was always a great family tradition. They put a string of flickering lights around the tree, along with pretty ornaments of different kinds.

Before e-commerce became a commonplace occurrence in the United States, Americans shopped the traditional way, which meant going out of their homes, getting in their cars, and visiting retail outlets in search of their goods. Bezos had a better way, though. The Princeton-educated business magnate and entrepreneur played a large role in developing online commerce as it is known today.\nBezos founded Amazon.com as a way to sell books. He sold novels, how-to books, and textbooks through Amazon, but that was just the beginning. He branched out to other retail products. Today Amazon is one of the largest online retailers in the world.\nBorn on January 12, 1964 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Bezos demonstrated mechanical proficiency at an early age. He attended high school in two states, Texas and Florida, and was class valedictorian. At Princeton, he studied computer science, winning several awards, and participating in several extracurricular activities.\nHe moved to Seattle, Washington in 1994 to start his new company, Amazon.com. He chose the state of Washington because of its small population. The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that online sales were required to pay sales tax in the state of operation. He moved to Washington because fewer of his customers would have to pay the sales taxes.\nToday, Amazon.com is the largest e-commerce retailer in the world with locations in several countries, including the United Kingdom, China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, and India. It has plans to expand to more countries, including Sri Lanka, Poland, and The Netherlands."

A basketball hit me in the head when I was talking to a girl. I was trying to climb the big rope in the gym and fell down in front of everyone, who started laughing. However, the worst thing was yet to happen.\nAt the end of a year, we always have a test to see how we have improved. We have to run a mile. The whole class does this at the same time. I wasn't the fastest runner, but I knew I could get a good score for this test. For this activity, we have to go into the locker room and change into our uniform. I left my uniform in my locker the other day since it was clean. When I opened my locker, I saw a note saying, \"Buy new uniform, loser.\" Someone had broken into my locker and took my clothes. I told the teacher, who went into his office and gave me an old uniform that had been left behind. \"Suit up and I'll see you out there,\" he said.\nI tried tying a rope around the shorts to make them fit, but they wouldn't. The bell rang, and I knew my teacher would be mad if I didn't get out there. I started running, and barely got there before he started calling names. After he finished with the roll call, we started the test. The whole class set off running. I was doing okay at the beginning. After a while, people started passing me. A lot of people laughed at my shorts. Then it happened. One guy pushed me out of his way, and I ended up falling. My shorts fell first, and then I fell to the ground. That was when all the girls started passing me. One of them shouted, \"Ew, he doesn't have clean underwear.\" I picked up my shorts, and walked the rest of the mile. It was the most embarrassing moment in my life."

They all seemed friendly, and some of them actually knew Anthony and Linda.\nAfter about an hour of waiting in line, the theater started letting people in. Anthony hugged Linda and started jumping up and down. Linda loved going to the theater with Anthony. He seemed like a little kid when he was there. It always put a smile on Linda's face. When they got inside, Anthony and Linda found their seats. They noticed everyone in the theater started singing a song that came out in the first movie, so Anthony got up and started clapping and singing along.

        "content": "One of the most divisive eras in American history is the Vietnam era. The Vietnam era for the United States ran roughly from 1960 through 1975. In the mid to late 60s, America's involvement became a huge issue. The conflict in Vietnam was divisive for many reasons, but mostly because of the public's perception that it was an immoral and illegal operation. The other major factor was that the U.S. was still engaged in drafting young men into the service of the country against their will.\nOne of Hollywood's major film stars of the time was Jane Fonda. Fonda came from Hollywood movie royalty, being the daughter of the great actor, Henry Fonda. She won two Oscars, seven Golden Globe awards, and an Emmy award through her long career. In the 60s she was a political activist who was against the war in Vietnam. She was very outspoken against the conflict, as many celebrities were at the time.\nIn 1970, Fonda made headlines for a very different reason. She and two fellow actors starred in an anti-war film that drew much controversy. In July of 1972, Fonda drew the wrath of many Americans when she was photographed sitting with North Vietnamese Army members on an anti-aircraft gun. That image soiled her reputation as an actress, and as a true American. Many called Fonda a traitor for interacting with the enemy. Years later, Fonda said that she was manipulated into taking that photo, but many Americans still have their doubts.\nDuring her trip to North Vietnam, which was at war with the U.S. backed South Vietnam, Fonda made a number of radio broadcasts denouncing America's involvement in the war. This further cemented her image as a traitor. However, there are many Americans who feel she was a true patriot because she refused to stand still and spoke out against the war."

However, her road to richness was not all completely smooth. Her story reminds us that in order to win the lottery, there are two crucial requirements. The first and most obvious necessity is a lot of luck. The second requirement is just as important, but much less often mentioned -- getting organized.\nAstrid's story began when getting in line for a lottery ticket at her local supermarket. The woman ahead of her decided to let her cut in front of her to pay. This woman was also planning on buying a lottery ticket. Had she not given Astrid her spot in the line, the lottery money would have been hers!\nOn the day that the winners were announced, Astrid realized she had won, she could not contain her excitement. She danced with joy all around her house and jumped on the phone to tell her closest relatives what had just happened. The next morning Astrid woke up and prepared to go claim her prize money, but suddenly realized that she could not remember where she had placed her ticket. Given that her memory was no longer as sharp as it used to be, she searched and searched around her messy house for hours to no avail. She had absolutely no recollection of where she might have stored or dropped the ticket.\nAstrid had been given thirty days to claim her prize, or else it would be canceled. For 27 days, her schedule was dedicated to searching every surface and square foot of her house for the missing ticket. With only three days left, she decided to finally call her daughters for help. She had been too embarrassed to call them from the beginning because her house was so messy, but now had no other choice. Figuring that helping their mother find the ticket would probably secure at least an extra million dollars to them, all three of Astrid's daughters immediately sped over to her house.\nWithin the first half hour of searching, the youngest of her daughters hollered, \"I found it!\" It turned out Astrid had left it in a dish cabinet. \"Oh, thank you, daughter!\" Astrid cried. \"I owe you so much!\" Her daughter's smile glistened with pride as her two sisters scowled at her from the next room."

        "content": "The stereotype is that Americans are lazy, but studies show that people in the U.S. get less vacation time than people in other parts of the world. A typical American worker gets two or three weeks off out of a whole year for vacation. Most U.S. workers cannot take those two or three weeks consecutively. They usually have to be spread out throughout the year. Even when U.S. workers are on vacation, they are often expected to be in communication with their boss. This means checking in via email and mobile phone. Most U.S. businesses do not encourage their employees to take all the vacation days they are entitled to. In fact, most U.S. companies discourage it.\nOther countries, especially countries in Europe, have much more vacation time. In Germany many people have six weeks of paid vacation. At least three of these weeks can be taken consecutively. Maybe this is why Europeans and other travelers vacation in far-off exotic places.  Most American families tend to stay closer to home, rarely leaving the country.\nThe difference in the amount of vacation time is legal. Most companies in countries outside the U.S. have to give paid time off to their employees or else pay hefty fines. However, in the U.S. there is no federal law requiring employers to give workers paid vacation. In fact the U.S. is the only developed country that doesn't guarantee yearly time off to workers. There have been efforts to pass laws giving U.S. workers one week of paid vacation by law, but so far those efforts have not been successful.\nEven when U.S. workers do have time off, many are afraid to take it because they worry they may be seen as non-productive workers and lose their job. Other workers worry about going on vacation and having a mountain of work when they return."

He was honored with every award available during his years in the army during World War II. He also won awards for heroism from two foreign governments, Belgium and France. His military record is impressive, as he fought successfully in some of the most dangerous, and historic battles during the great war. Murphy also found success after the war as an actor who appeared in several films.\nMurphy was born into a very large family in Hunt, Texas. He was one of 12 children, and grew up in abject poverty. His father deserted his family; his mother died at a young age, so Murphy dropped out of school to get work. Murphy held a series of odd jobs from an early age to help the family financially, but eventually realized that a military life was the best course to take.\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Murphy knew he needed to be in the military to defend his country, but he was not yet old enough to enlist legally. With the help of one of his older sisters, who helped provide him with false records, Murphy enlisted into the Army at the age of 17. It wasn't long before Murphy began making his name in the military. He first saw action in the invasion of Sicily, and was involved in the liberation of Rome. He became famous for leading his men into a battle while he was wounded, and out of ammunition. He won several awards for valor.\nAfter the war, he launched a successful Hollywood career. His most notable film was playing himself in the epic movie classic From Here to Eternity, which was based on his autobiography. Murphy starred in several western-themed films. He died at the age of 46 in a plane crash in the state of Virginia."

His dad took him onto the field one day when the team was having a photo day. Johnny couldn't believe how big the field was. All his favorite Giants were there taking pictures with fans. \"Can I take a picture with Willie Mays' dad,\" Johnny asked gleefully. \"Of course, Johnny. Let's get in line,\" said his dad. Willie Mays was one of the greatest players to ever play the game, and he loved kids, too. That is why the line to take a picture with him was so long. Johnny didn't mind though. He was in baseball heaven.\nThe Giants played their archrival, the Los Angeles Dodgers, that day. There had always been a bit of bad blood between the two teams over the years. It started when both teams were based in New York. They were cross-town rivals at that time. After the teams moved to California in the late 1950s, the rivalry continued.\nThe Dodgers were always one of the better teams in the National League, and even though Johnny grew up a Giants fan, he really didn't hate the Dodgers. \"I think the rivalry was blown up, to tell the truth,\" Johnny said years later. Baseball fans are very fickle and stubborn though, and some play the rivalry up as much as they can. No true Dodger, or Giant fan would ever admit liking the other team in public, but Johnny suspects there is a mutual respect for each team in both cities."

No matter what kind of party you are going to, it's a good idea to make sure you are actually invited. It's considered rude to just show up unless the host, the person giving the party, invited you. You will either get a paper, email or verbal invitation to a party. Alternately, you can also go as a guest of someone else invited, like as his or her date. Once invited, it is very important to let the host know if you are actually going to show up. Many times hosts have a party catered, which means other people prepare the food. They need to know how much food to have. Letting them know if you are  showing up or not helps the host and is considered polite.\nIt's also important to be relatively punctual for a party. Most parties in the U.S. never start exactly when they say they will. Many people like to be \"fashionably late\", that is, showing up about 30 minutes after the party is supposed to start. People like to do this to make a big entrance. Showing up more than 30 minutes before or after is considered rude though. If you show up too early, you are likely to interrupt valuable preparation time of the host. If you show up too late, you are just being rude.\nEven if it is not a birthday party, it is polite to bring a gift for the host. It doesn't need to be a fancy gift. A bottle of wine, or even flowers, is polite and will be appreciated."

They can also serve in the military and go fight in wars for the country. An 18-year old can also buy cigarettes and other tobacco products, but 18-year-olds cannot buy alcoholic beverages. People in the U.S. need to wait until they are 21 to be able to do that.\nAt the age of 18, people can legally live on their own, work, and get married. However, turning 18 doesn't mean everyone is ready to take on adult responsibilities. At the age of 18, most people are just graduating from high school. Many will go to college. Some young people choose to go to college far from their homes and live in dormitories. Others pick a college close to home and stay with their parents to save money. Yet others will choose to live on their own. Legally, a parent does not have to provide for their child when the child turns 18.\nSome parents in the U.S. take this very seriously and expect their children to move out as soon as they turn 18. Some parents will even forcibly kick their kids out when the kids turn 18. There tends to be some difference about this depending on if the kid is female or male. It is considered more acceptable for a female to stay living with her parents after her 18th birthday. Many females aren't expected to leave their parents' house until they get married. There is still an expectation for young men, however, to go out and live independent lives as soon as they can. With the economy of the U.S. struggling, some adult children are returning to their parents' home in their 20s and 30s. These are called boomerang kids, since like a boomerang, they return where they came from."

There is an old saying in the United States that reads, \"You are what you eat.\" It means that your overall health and appearance are greatly affected by what you eat. If you eat high calorie, fatty foods, then you may suffer from obesity at one time or another. If, however, you eat plenty of green vegetables and little to no fat, your chances of being fit are much better.\nMany people are limited in the types of exercise they can do, but almost everyone can walk. A daily walk can help you achieve your healthy living goals. You should plan on walking at least one mile per day. A good pace to walk in is about 18 to 20 minutes per mile. Of course, the more you walk, the better. It takes most people less than 40 minutes to walk two miles, but the benefits of this could last a lifetime. Walking can reduce stress levels, increase stamina, lower blood-sugar levels, and regulate blood pressure. Once you get started walking, you just may like it.\nAnother benefit of eating right and exercising is that it can lead to a positive outlook in life. Practicing these good habits can make you feel and look better. Your clothes will fit a bit better, and you will sleep better, which will lead to a healthy self-image. A positive self-image can give you more confidence in whatever you do, whether it is at work, in school, or at home. So eat right, exercise daily, and enjoy the benefits."

Occasionally the crowd would stop, and an organizer using a bullhorn would tell the story of a person who was killed. After the organizer told the story, there would be a prayer followed by a moment of silence. There were relatives of people who had been killed participating in the march. Some of these relatives would leave lit candles, balloons, or flowers in remembrance of the persons who died. One woman who died was found in the lake of Hollenbeck Park. Police suspect that her boyfriend killed her. She had a baby daughter. Her ex-husband participated in the march and asked that organizers include her in their prayers.\nThe march continued for 20 blocks, and ended at Wabash Park. While the march was somber, the mood inside the park was more celebratory. Different organizations had booths with information about local programs. There was a craft table for kids to draw picture about the kind of neighborhood they wanted to live in. Different bands played between speakers offering solutions to the neighborhood's problems.\nOn the same day there was another march at a nearby housing project.

They usually have to be spread out throughout the year. Even when U.S. workers are on vacation, they are often expected to be in communication with their boss. This means checking in via email and mobile phone. Most U.S. businesses do not encourage their employees to take all the vacation days they are entitled to. In fact, most U.S. companies discourage it.\nOther countries, especially countries in Europe, have much more vacation time. In Germany many people have six weeks of paid vacation. At least three of these weeks can be taken consecutively. Maybe this is why Europeans and other travelers vacation in far-off exotic places.  Most American families tend to stay closer to home, rarely leaving the country.\nThe difference in the amount of vacation time is legal. Most companies in countries outside the U.S. have to give paid time off to their employees or else pay hefty fines. However, in the U.S. there is no federal law requiring employers to give workers paid vacation. In fact the U.S. is the only developed country that doesn't guarantee yearly time off to workers. There have been efforts to pass laws giving U.S. workers one week of paid vacation by law, but so far those efforts have not been successful.\nEven when U.S. workers do have time off, many are afraid to take it because they worry they may be seen as non-productive workers and lose their job. Other workers worry about going on vacation and having a mountain of work when they return."

The pool was closed because they were building something new in it. They thought about what they could do to escape the heat, but they never could agree on doing the same thing. That's when Christopher Baker decided to go to the store. He bought 10 bags of balloons, and went to his house to fill them up with water. He invited his two best friends Joseph and Patrick to help him out. By the time they finished, they had five buckets of water balloons.\nThey went outside with the buckets, put them in the center of Joseph's lawn, and started throwing them to the children in the neighborhood. At first, the other children were surprised, but then they wanted to get wetter. They all went to the store and bought some balloons for themselves. Christopher and his friends went back into the house to make more balloons. When they get back outside, they got attacked with 10 different water balloons.\nChristopher and his friends started laughing when they realized where the other boys were. They decided to hide. Christopher gave the orders to his friends. He told Joseph to hide behind his dad's car; he told Patrick to hide behind his mom's car. They each took four water balloons with them. Christopher told them to wait for his signal, and then they could throw the balloons.\nChristopher knew where three of the boys were hiding, so he went running and attacked them with five water balloons. Christopher then ran back to the place where he was hiding, but the boys were coming after him. Christopher yelled out, \"Now!\" Joseph and Patrick came out of hiding and attacked the boys with their water balloons. The boys went back. Christopher and his friends started laughing."

        "content": "Not every parent looks forward to the day when their child goes off to school. In fact some parents are not sending their students to school at all. Instead they are choosing to teach their children at home. This is called homeschooling. Parents, caregivers, or private tutors educate children individually at home instead of sending them off to be formally educated in public or private schools. In the U.S. only about  three percent of children are homeschooled.\nThere are many reasons why some parents choose to homeschool. One reason is that some parents do not feel their children are safe in school because of bullying and a growing trend of police in school. Other parents want their child's education to be based on their religion or moral beliefs. Yet other parents feel like the education in school is not good enough. Homeschooling is also seen as a choice for families that live in rural areas, and families that travel, like actors.\nThere are many different ways to homeschool, and homeschooling allows parents to customize lessons based on their children's needs. Families can purchase textbooks to use or create their own materials. Some parents follow a philosophy called unschooling, which allows a child to determine when, and how they want to learn based on their natural curiosity. Some worry that homeschooling means students won't have opportunities to socialize. To answer this concern, some families have created cooperatives, where a group of homeschooled students will learn and play together and participate in activities that would normally happen in school like field trips and prom.\nBeing homeschooled doesn't mean a student cannot go to college. Most colleges accept homeschooled students. It is important, however, for parents and students to create a portfolio or proof of what has been learned."

        "content": "One of the favorite activities for some people in the United States is to visit a thrift store or find a garage sale. Thrift stores usually offer second-hand or used clothing and goods for sale at a greatly reduced price. These stores can be found in nearly every community in the country. Some people visit thrift stores out of necessity, because of the low prices, but others like to shop at thrift stores because of the hidden gems sometimes found there. Thrift stores depend on donations from private citizens to stock their stores. Many times a person will donate a piece of clothing, or an article from their home without realizing its real value. This is where some eagle-eyed thrift shop patrons pick up their hidden prizes.\nGarage sales work much the same as thrift shops do, but they are not usually in a fixed location. Many people hold garage sales in their private garages. These sales take place for several reasons. One is that people need to get their hands on a little extra cash, but a more important reason is that people have bulging houses. Their homes are too small to accommodate all their goods. A garage sale consists of items the owners no longer want or need. They want to rid themselves of unused or unwanted items, and pick up a few bucks in the process.\nMost cities require homeowners who are planning to host a garage sale to purchase a special permit. These permits make it legal to sell their goods for one day, or sometimes an entire weekend. The cost of the permit is nominal. It can cost as little as $5 to $10 to acquire a garage sale permit, and it might be well worth the expense."

Usually there is a little bit of time, about an hour, between the ceremony and the reception to give people enough time to travel from the ceremony location to the reception location. Most wedding receptions are held at a catering hall, which is a place that specializes in hosting big parties. However, wedding receptions can be held in restaurants, parks, and even in museums or zoos. A wedding reception is usually not held at the same place as the ceremony, but sometimes they do.\nWhen guests arrive at the reception, the bride and groom are usually not there to meet them. Right after the ceremony the newly married couple, the bridesmaids, and the groomsmen will go somewhere to have photographs taken. While this is happening, guests are usually treated to a cocktail hour at the reception site. During this time appetizers and drinks are served. This also gives guests a chance to socialize. After the cocktail hour, the main dining hall is opened. At a wedding reception the seating is usually prearranged. Each guest will receive a card telling him or her where they are expected to sit. Tables are arranged by numbers. In front of the reception hall, there is a special table for the bride and groom.\nOnce everyone is seated, waiters begin to serve salad or bread and drinks. Some receptions have an open bar, meaning the alcohol is free. Other receptions have a case bar, meaning non-alcoholic beverages are free; guests are expected to pay for their own alcoholic drinks."

He was a pathologist, euthanasia advocate, and author, who came into fame during the late 1990s. He died in 2011. Kevorkian was a firm believer in euthanasia for the terminally ill. He designed a suicide machine that helped 130 people end their lives. Kevorkian was persecuted throughout his career as a suicide facilitator, and was convicted in 1999 for his involvement in an assisted suicide. He served eight years in prison, and was released in 2007 after agreeing to no longer assist with anyone's suicide.\nKevorkian had a difficult time working as a pathologist at the University of Michigan, where he earned his doctorate degree. He did not see eye to eye with his employers, and chose to leave the hospital to pursue his own interests. In 1987, Kevorkian purchased advertising space in Detroit newspapers as a \"death consultant.\" His first known assisted suicide was for a 54-year-old woman who suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease. Kevorkian was not charged in the case because Michigan did not have a law in place regarding assisted suicide. The state did file murder charges initially, but those charges were dropped. The Michigan Medical Board, however, did strip Kevorkian of his medical practitioner's license.\nKevorkian defended himself at subsequent trials by claiming he took no action to assist in his patient's suicide. He had invented a machine that was designed to be operated by the patient using the machine. Therefore, Kevorkian argued he had no hand in causing the death of his patients. His patients had complete control of the suicide from start to finish. Kevorkian's role in the deaths was to simply help attach his patients to his machine. The rest was up to them. Some called Kevorkian a raging madman who lost his mind, while others called him an angel for helping to end the suffering of his patients."

That is the day President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas while riding in an open-air car. The president was visiting Texas for the first time since his inauguration in January, 1961. Kennedy was one of the most popular presidents in the history of the United States, and still remains so today. His death shocked the nation for several reasons, but mostly because it was televised on a live broadcast. Kennedy was the first president to appear on television at a time when most Americans owned a TV. He was not the first president to be televised, but previous presidents who appeared on TV did not reach the general public because before 1960, not many Americans owned a set.\nKennedy was warned not to ride in an open-air car that day by his bodyguards, but he wanted the public to see him live. He did not want to be hidden behind an armored car. According to the official government commission, Kennedy fell victim to a single assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, but many Americans dispute that finding to this date. Police say Oswald shot the president from a building while Kennedy rode in his car with his wife. The mood was festive at the time as the city of Dallas welcomed the president to Texas. Kennedy was a handsome, young president who was the youngest man ever to reach the presidency.\nOswald later killed a Dallas police officer during his escape from the crime scene, but was soon found hiding in a movie theater. He required police protection from an outraged public, and was held in protective custody. Oswald, who was a former member of the U.S. military, was unhappy with the president for his policies, but never admitted to being the assassin. Conspiracy theories involving rival political parties, the Cuban government, and organized crime have also been advanced as to who actually killed Kennedy."

The first time I brought a boy home to meet my parents, they asked him countless questions that no parent should ask. \"When did you lose your virginity? Do you believe in Jesus Christ? How many sexual partners have you had?\" Safe to say, that boy I brought home stopped talking to me after he met my parents. I stayed single throughout my time at high school. It was not that I didn't like anyone or that no one liked me. It was that my parents had a rule. They had to approve of whoever I would be dating. Sometimes I thought they had that rule specifically to embarrass me.\nI hate that I can't have normal parents. They are weird. They like collecting old books, and watching old movies. They listen to old records on an old record player. They say that it's better than listening to an iPod. I always let them know that at least I can listen to my iPod when I go out. The last day of high school had passed, and I didn't know what I wanted to do. I decided to take a year off and work. My parents didn't like it, but it was my decision to make.\nI got a job at a little restaurant called \"Baker's Cabin\". It was a nice restaurant where people could sit down and have a good steak dinner at a reasonable price. I liked working there. However, what I liked most was the bartender Paul. He had barely turned 21, and was already working behind the bar. We started talking. I think he really likes me, but I don't want things to get awkward when he meets my parents. One day, my friend Susan told Paul that the only way he could date me was to meet my parents. Paul went over that night with some records his dad had given him, and offered them to my parents. They went nuts, and invited him in. They started asking him questions, but not about his sex life or religious beliefs. The questions were all about music. They really liked him, and they were actually acting normal. I think Paul is the guy for me."

Unlike ground vehicle hijacking, which is done for financial gain for the most part, skyjacking is a darker, more dangerous, potentially life-threatening action. During the mid-1960s to the 1970s, about 160 aircraft were skyjacked worldwide. In the United States, many had taken control of aircraft, but no one had ever escaped the reach of law enforcement with one glaring exception, D.B. Cooper.\nD.B. Cooper's real name is Dan Cooper, but his legend began as D.B. Cooper because of a mistake by the media in 1971. On November 24, Cooper hijacked a Boeing 727 jetliner after purchasing a one-way ticket from Portland to Seattle, Washington. Cooper demanded $200,000, and four parachutes to be delivered upon arrival to Seattle. Authorities complied with his ransom request, and Cooper let all 36 passengers, and most of the crew off the plane at that time.\nOnce back in the air, Cooper directed the pilot to fly to Mexico, but the jet's fuel was not enough to make there without stopping to refuel. It was decided to land in Reno, Nevada for refueling. When the aircraft reached Reno, Cooper was not on board. It is thought that Cooper jumped out of the aircraft somewhere in the wooded forests of Oregon. He had ordered the plane to fly at the lowest possible speed, and to fly at only a 10,000 foot elevation. The legend of D.B. Cooper was born.\nTo this date, the Cooper skyjacking is the only case that is unresolved in the United States. Cooper was never found, nor was any evidence of the $200,000, and his parachute. Many believe Cooper could not survive a drop of such a great altitude, while others say the absence of any of the money, or any evidence of his death proves he survived. In any event, D.B. Cooper is a true American legend."

The country was in turmoil during the 60s. The conflict in Vietnam was raging, the country was reeling from the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, and his brother Senator Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. Nixon's victory indicated the country was ready for a conservative leadership during these tough times.\nNixon won the 1972 election over Democrat George McGovern in another landslide victory, which seemed to establish Nixon's legacy as a great president. Among his accomplishments was to open trade with China, and his promise to end the conflict in Vietnam. However, Nixon would end up resigning from office just a year after his victory.\nIt was discovered that the Republican Party, with Nixon's knowledge, had secretly recorded the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C. during the weeks leading up to the election.

It is truly a melting pot of diversity. All these cultures have come together to create a new culture - an American culture. Many of the traditions, customs, religions, and celebrations of these cultures have been adopted into American culture, including funeral traditions.\nTraditional American funerals are basic. They usually include some sort of religious ritual, followed by a procession to the burial grounds, and a small ceremony at the grave site, but these vary depending on the culture. At most American funerals, the deceased person's family sends out a death announcement called an obituary. These obits normally serve to pass information to others about the deceased, and the time and day of the funeral event. At the church service, the deceased is usually eulogized by friends and family. This is where a person goes up to the front of the crowd to say a few things about the deceased, and how he or she affected their life. The procession usually takes the form of a caravan of private cars, and trucks that follow the hearse, which contains the deceased's coffin, and remains.\nAt the gravesite, another small ritual takes place where the deceased is given a blessing from a member of the clergy. Friends and family are then allowed to say goodbye to the deceased. There is an American tradition of picking up a handful of soil, and tossing it on the coffin as a way of saying farewell to the deceased. The family then gathers at a home, or restaurant with some of the attendees to have a meal, and to exchange stories before going on their way. Most cultures in the U.S. have adopted this traditional American funeral ritual, but many include features that are unique to their individual culture."

The general rule is to eat as much plant-based food as you can, which includes vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains. The foods to avoid are fatty foods and processed foods that contain a lot of empty calories and little nutritional value. Your health depends on the foods you put into your body, so think twice before consuming something that is unhealthful.\nMost nutritionists agree that vegetables are a key to living a long, healthy life. Nearly all vegetables are low in fat and calories and are a major source of a variety of nutrients. Many vegetables provide potassium, dietary fiber, and vitamins A and C. Vegetables are so low in calories that it is nearly impossible to gain weight by overeating them. Of course, this only applies to non-battered vegetables. It does not apply to deep-fried vegetables, or vegetables that are used as part of a larger meal that may include cheese, or other fatty components. Generally speaking, the most popular vegetables contain only about 50 calories per cup, and they are very filling.\nEating lots of fruit can also be low-calorie alternative to fatty foods that consist of red meat such as hamburgers or sausages. Fruits contain natural sugar, which is healthier for the human body than processed sugar. Legumes and nuts are also healthy for the body, but contain more calories than fruits and vegetables, so be careful with how much you eat. The best thing to do is to educate yourself on the foods you eat. Knowing beforehand what you are putting into your body can help you make the correct food choices."

Most bridal shower gifts are items that a newly married couple needs to start their life together. These gifts include dishes, pots, pans, and even appliances like toasters and microwave ovens.  Many brides also look forward to receiving some money. Cash or checks are considered appropriate gifts for a bridal shower. The money comes in handy to help pay for an expensive wedding. Sometimes people bring tasteless gifts like lingerie to bridal showers. Some people think those gifts are good because they help the new couple \"spice up\" their married life.

A bridal shower can be small and intimate and held in someone's home. It can also be a larger affair held at a restaurant or a catering hall.

Between 1999 through 2005, Armstrong won the famous Tour de France road cycling event seven consecutive years. This is a feat that no other person in the history of the famed race has ever accomplished. He was an American hero who benefited greatly from his fame and fortune. During those years, no other athlete in the United States was more popular than Armstrong.\nArmstrong was born in 1971 in Plano, Texas. By the age of 12, he had been competing in swimming competitions with great success. At 16, Armstrong began competing in the grueling triathlon races, where contestants must cycle, swim, and run for several miles. His Tour de France records were superior to any other racer in the history of the annual event, which began in 1903. However, Armstrong had a dark side.\nAfter he retired from competition in 2011, allegations of drug use began to surface. The United States Anti-Doping Agency began investigating the cyclist, and eventually found he had used performance-enhancing drugs during his years competing in the Tour de France.\nArmstrong denied any wrongdoing, but the USADA stripped him of his titles. He was also barred from ever competing professionally again. This was followed by a lifetime ban from the Union Cycliste Internationale, an international racing organization. Armstrong did not admit to using drugs until January, 2013 on the Oprah Winfrey Show. He claimed that he was not the only athlete using drugs on the tour, and that he was being singled out because of his success. However, that did not matter; this American hero had fallen."

The British-born musician is a true international icon who influenced the world with his message of peace and love. In America, Lennon is one of the most loved people to ever call the United States home.\nLennon was one of the founding members of the international super group, the Beatles. He, along with Paul McCartney, formed the early creative brain trust of a group that changed music worldwide. The groups success has never been duplicated, and its music is as popular today as it was in the 1960s and 70s.\nLennon wrote, or co-wrote some of the most memorable tunes ever written in the Rock n Roll genre. He found great success as a member of the Beatles, which is the most commercially successful group in history, and as a solo artist. Lennon was also a political activist. His views on religion and politics caused a great deal of controversy in the United States. He was an outspoken critic of the countrys involvement in the Vietnam conflict. His popularity caused great concern with government officials because he had the attention of the young people in America at the time.\nLennon had been living in New York for several years, where he was being watched by the FBI in order to find grounds to deport him from the United States. He used flamboyant gimmicks to spread his word of peace. In this passive protest, Lennon and his wife Ono addressed the media from their beds claiming people should make love, not war. Lennon was killed on December 8, 1980 by a crazy gunman outside his home in New York City. A memorial plaque at the site of his death is one of the most visited sites in the country."

The first time I brought a boy home to meet my parents, they asked him countless questions that no parent should ask. \"When did you lose your virginity? Do you believe in Jesus Christ? How many sexual partners have you had?\" Safe to say, that boy I brought home stopped talking to me after he met my parents. I stayed single throughout my time at high school. It was not that I didn't like anyone or that no one liked me. It was that my parents had a rule. They had to approve of whoever I would be dating. Sometimes I thought they had that rule specifically to embarrass me.\nI hate that I can't have normal parents. They are weird. They like collecting old books, and watching old movies. They listen to old records on an old record player. They say that it's better than listening to an iPod. I always let them know that at least I can listen to my iPod when I go out. The last day of high school had passed, and I didn't know what I wanted to do. I decided to take a year off and work. My parents didn't like it, but it was my decision to make.\nI got a job at a little restaurant called \"Baker's Cabin\". It was a nice restaurant where people could sit down and have a good steak dinner at a reasonable price. I liked working there. However, what I liked most was the bartender Paul. He had barely turned 21, and was already working behind the bar. We started talking. I think he really likes me, but I don't want things to get awkward when he meets my parents. One day, my friend Susan told Paul that the only way he could date me was to meet my parents. Paul went over that night with some records his dad had given him, and offered them to my parents. They went nuts, and invited him in. They started asking him questions, but not about his sex life or religious beliefs. The questions were all about music. They really liked him, and they were actually acting normal. I think Paul is the guy for me."

        "content": "Not every parent looks forward to the day when their child goes off to school. In fact some parents are not sending their students to school at all. Instead they are choosing to teach their children at home. This is called homeschooling. Parents, caregivers, or private tutors educate children individually at home instead of sending them off to be formally educated in public or private schools. In the U.S. only about  three percent of children are homeschooled.\nThere are many reasons why some parents choose to homeschool. One reason is that some parents do not feel their children are safe in school because of bullying and a growing trend of police in school. Other parents want their child's education to be based on their religion or moral beliefs. Yet other parents feel like the education in school is not good enough. Homeschooling is also seen as a choice for families that live in rural areas, and families that travel, like actors.\nThere are many different ways to homeschool, and homeschooling allows parents to customize lessons based on their children's needs. Families can purchase textbooks to use or create their own materials. Some parents follow a philosophy called unschooling, which allows a child to determine when, and how they want to learn based on their natural curiosity. Some worry that homeschooling means students won't have opportunities to socialize. To answer this concern, some families have created cooperatives, where a group of homeschooled students will learn and play together and participate in activities that would normally happen in school like field trips and prom.\nBeing homeschooled doesn't mean a student cannot go to college. Most colleges accept homeschooled students. It is important, however, for parents and students to create a portfolio or proof of what has been learned."

Major League Baseball traces its roots back to the 1880s, but the game had been enjoyed by Americans for decades before then. The origins of the game are in question. For many years a 19th Century American named Abner Doubleday was credited with creating the game, but this has been proven  inaccurate today.\nOne theory is that the game was brought across the Atlantic Ocean during the great European migration of the 18th Century, and that it is based on the British game of cricket. Cricket is a very popular sport in England, but it is played by mostly the upper-class members of that society, and it is unlikely that the poor immigrants from England played the game very much. However, it more closely resembles the game of rounders, which is another English sport that shares many common features as the American game of baseball.\nIn any event, the game became very popular in the United States. By the 20th Century, the American League, and the National League were taking the country by storm. The greatest single team in either league's history is the New York Yankees. The Yankees have won more World Series titles than any other team in history.\nThe World Series is a seven-game competition with the two top teams from either league. The first team to win four games is declared the World Series Champion. In 1903, The Boston Americans won the first World Series beating the Pittsburgh Pirates. This was the start of an annual series matchup between the two leagues. To date, the Yankees have won 27 championships in 40 appearances, with the team's most recent title coming in 2009. The St. Louis Cardinals lead the National League with 11 titles in 19 appearances, with its last title coming in 2011."

Presley grew to be one of the most recognizable and famous American celebrities the country has ever known. He recorded countless records, starred on the big screen, and his songs were heard on the radio by more fans than any other artists in history.\nPresley received his first guitar at the age of 10, and soon began a musical career that would last more than 25 years. His first success was winning a high school talent contest in Memphis, Tennessee, while still in school. Shortly after graduation, Presley was discovered by Sam Phillips, a record company owner. His first commercial success came in 1954 with his hit single That's all Right. Much of Presley's success could be attributed to his unconventional dance, and live performance style. His hip movements and sexually-suggestive moves earned Presley much praise, and controversy.\nIn 1956, Presley recorded his first No. 1 hit Heartbreak Hotel, and his first No. 1 album, the self-titled Elvis Presley. He also signed a contract with Paramount Pictures Studios, which was, and is still, one of the biggest Hollywood studios in the industry. He went on to star in several movies with Paramount. In 1957, Presley was drafted into service by the United States Army, where he served overseas. His time in the military did not hurt his career. Soon after his service was over in 1960, Presley began recording music, and starring in films.\nPresley married in 1967, and had a daughter the following year. Sadly, his marriage ended in divorce in 1973. He fell into prescription drug abuse, and put on a great deal of weight. He died in August, 1977, resulting from complications of his drug abuse. He still remains one of the most profitable artists in the world today."

She had no idea it was also the name of a dance style. One dance style that Mary had yet to try was tango from Argentina.\nTango seemed so complicated to Mary. The footwork was very intricate. She imagined she would end up stepping on her partner's feet. Mary hadn't had a tango partner yet. She didn't have a dance partner in general. In classes, instructors always paired her up with fellow classmates. At dance clubs it was easy to find a dance partner. Tango classes were expensive though. Mary didn't even think there were any tango clubs.\nOne day Mary received an email from a friend with information about a tango night outside the city's music center. Musicians would be playing tango music and instructors would teach the basic steps. The best of all, the event was free and no partner was required\nOn the night of the tango event, Mary wore her high-heeled dancing shoes. There was a wooden dance floor in the middle of the music center plaza. A group of musicians played on a small stage in front of the dance floor. \"May I have this dance?\" a man asked Mary when she arrived. He wore a sticker with the words \"dance instructor\" on it. Mary accepted the invitation to dance. That night Mary learned that it did take two to tango."

It is known as the Festival of Lights, which celebrates the dedication of an ancient Jewish temple in Jerusalem thousands of years ago. According to the Hebrew, or Jewish Bible, a miracle took place then. A one-day supply of oil miraculously lasted eight days. The dates of Hanukkah always change, but usually occur anywhere in late November to Late December.\nThe main way people observe the holiday is by lighting a candle on a candelabra, a special candle holder with space for 9 candles on each of the 8 nights. This candelabra is called a menorah. Now there are also electric menorahs. Some people also use oil lamps. The 9th candle space is usually higher than the others and is lit on every night. This 9th candle is there so that people can see the other candles they are lighting. So, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on. Some families have the head of household light the candles. Other families share the responsibility. The menorah is supposed to be placed somewhere visible like in a window facing the street. The candles are supposed to stay lit for at least 30 minutes after it gets dark. There are also special prayers people say and holy songs sung when the candles are lit.\nSchools and government offices are open for Hanukkah since the observances happen at night. Some families exchange gifts on each night of the holiday. Some foods traditionally eaten on Hanukkah include latkes, fried potato pancakes, and doughnuts. These and other fried foods are eaten because they are cooked in oil and remind people of the oil that lasted for 8 nights. Children play with a special four-sided spinning top called a dreidel."

He had one job during the day and the other at night, but sometimes he worked on weekends, too. The man had more energy than any persons alive. When he wasn't working on weekends at his third job, he worked at home and that was why David hated summer vacation.\nHis dad was always building something, or tearing something down. If he wasn't tearing down a wall, or adding a new room to the house, he was putting in a new driveway or garage. It was living hell for a 13-year-old kid. While all of David's friends were off playing baseball or riding their bicycles, he was usually hauling bricks or mixing cement. That's what he remembers about his childhood.\nDavid always knew he was in trouble whenever he heard \"Where's David!\" His dad's voice seemed to carry down the street. That phrase could only mean it was time to get to work. Of course David learned throughout the years how to make himself disappear at just the right times, but his dad usually found him anyway. \"But dad,I want to go to the park to play with my friends,\" David would say. \"You can waste time with your buddies some other time. It's time to get to work now,\" his dad would respond. It got so bad that David would intentionally fail classes so he would have to go to summer school.

Michael gets home around 2:00 a.m. every night, and heads straight to bed to get as much sleep as possible until his classes start at 10:00 a.m. However, for the past week, Michael has had a new \"alarm clock\" that he unfortunately has no control of. It is an energetic, loud, mockingbird that has decided to make the tree outside of Michael's window his new home.\nEach morning, the bird begins singing as loud as possible at exactly 5:55 a.m. and does not stop until late into the night. Most city birds begin the day with sweet, gentle chirps that can barely even be heard indoors, but the sounds of mockingbirds are very distinct and consist of various noises that the mockingbird hears and then imitates. This can include chirps from other birds, or even car alarms and school bells.\nAfter one week of losing sleep as a result of the bird noises, Michael decided to do something. \"Go away!\" he screamed out his window. When that didn't work, he started throwing things at the tree to try to scare the bird away. This only made the bird get even louder! As a final resort, Michael phoned his local Animal Control, and requested to get someone to remove the bird from the area. \"We can't do that,\" replied the Animal Control Specialist. \"Mockingbirds are a valued feature of North America's wildlife and are protected by many laws. You should consider yourself lucky to have one so close to home. Just enjoy the beautiful sounds of nature.\"\nFurious, Michael hung up the phone, and threw himself on the couch, dozing off into the deepest sleep he had ever experienced all week.

People give mothers gifts like flowers, cards, and jewelry to thank them for all their hard work. A popular symbol of the holiday is the carnation. This is because when the holiday first began in the U.S. people were encouraged to wear a red carnation if their mother was alive or a white carnation if their mother was dead. Many people take their mothers out for a special meal. In fact, Mother's Day is the most popular date in the U.S. for people to go out and eat and it is estimated that people spend billions on meals and gifts. Mother's Day is also the most popular day to make long distance calls in the U.S. It is the second most popular gift-giving day after Christmas.\nSince its establishment, Mother's Day has been criticized for becoming highly commercialized. In fact, the founder of the U.S. holiday, Anna Jarvis, began protesting the holiday and was even arrested for disturbing the peace for demonstrating. Jarvis's own mother started the campaign to establish a mother's holiday during the American Civil War.\nMothers are not the only people celebrated on this day. All mother figures including grandmothers, great-grandmothers, stepmothers, and foster mothers are honored on the holiday. In schools many students make special gifts, including handmade cards.

        "content": "The public library system in the United States is a large network of facilities spread throughout the country. There are some fundamental characteristics shared by all public libraries. They are generally supported by taxes (usually local, though any level of government can and may contribute); they are governed by a board to serve the public interest; they are open to all, and every community member can access the collection; they provide basic services without charge.\nPublic libraries exist in many countries across the world, and are often considered an essential part of having an educated and literate population. Public libraries are distinct from research libraries, school libraries, and other special libraries in that their mandate is to serve the general public's information needs rather than the needs of a particular school, institution, or research population. Public libraries also provide free services such as preschool story times to encourage early literacy. They also provide quiet study and work areas for students and professionals, or book clubs to encourage appreciation of literature in adults. Public libraries typically allow users to borrow books and other materials temporarily; they also have non-circulating reference collections and provide computer and Internet access to patrons.\nThe computer access is one of the ways that public libraries have evolved. The Internet has opened up an entire world of information, which is much larger than any single library can provide. The inclusions of digital library databases have increased the number of books, periodicals, and videos available to the public. Libraries are great places for people to study, to do research, or just to read a book."

They were named because there were almost exactly the same. The only difference is that one had a tall antenna on the top.\nWhen they were built, the 1,368-foot tall buildings were the tallest in the world. Such tall buildings needed a way for people to travel in them. The towers had 95 elevators in total. Visitors used to travel to the 107th and 110th floors, where there were observation decks from which one could see the entire city and New Jersey. Inside there were offices, shops, a hotel, and on the top floor of one of the towers there was a restaurant called \"Windows on the World\". The restaurant even hosted a salsa night on Thursdays. A number of subway lines ran underneath the towers. The World Trade Center Complex, with a total of seven buildings, was so large that it had its own zip code. In 1974 a French man walked a tightrope between the twin towers.\nThe World Trade Center survived a bombing in 1993. The skyline and spirit of New York City were changed after September 11, 2001. That morning, two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan. At first the top floors of the buildings were in flames. Soon they came tumbling down, covering lower Manhattan in hot metal and ash. A total of 2,753 people died. For weeks the air smelled of burnt metal and plastic. It took eight months for the site to be cleaned. Years later, The World Trade Center is rebuilding. There is a new tower, called the Freedom Tower. There is also a memorial and museum to honor those who died in the 2001 attack."

Although the stories took place thousands of years ago, the technology shown was more advanced than anything on earth today. It is spectacular! The space vehicles alone can travel between galaxies in the Universe, which is far beyond our present-day technology. The worlds depicted are pure fantasy, and are very popular with people of all ages.\nStar Wars was originally a low-budget film that almost did not make it to the big screen. Its creator had a hard time selling the idea to the large Hollywood studios, and was turned away several times before it was finally picked up. The franchise has become one of the most lucrative series of films in the history of Hollywood. It has spawned several offshoot products such as video games, comic books, short stories, clothing, and toys.\nThe storylines are very simple. They all focus on good versus evil. The main characters have endeared themselves to the American public over the decades. Some of these characters are everlasting because of their dedication to good, and their continual struggle against the forces of evil. Star Wars was a pioneer film series that has been copied, but never with the skill of its original creator.\nMost Americans know these films very well and many of them grew up watching the franchise. The first film in the third set of movies is due to debut in 2015. It is becoming one of the most anticipated new movies in history. It is currently in pre-production, and will undoubtedly create an entire new generation of Star Wars fans in years to come."

The police came and arrested Donald for public intoxication and disturbing the peace. Donald was taken to a nearby jail. His stay only lasted a few hours. As soon as he was more sober, the police released him. Apparently, Donald wasn't quite sober enough though.\nWhen he was released, Donald realized he was pretty far from his home. He didn't feel like walking almost two miles, so he called his friend from the jail to come get him. But Donald was getting impatient. When a woman got out of her car in the parking lot, he tried to get in. The woman screamed for help. Donald screamed, \"But this is my car!\" The woman kept screaming and Donald got out. He then thought it would be a good idea to take the bus home.  A deputy was watching and arrested Donald again, after he had only been free for one hour. This time, however, Donald's jail stay would not be as short. He was charged with attempted burglary. A judge set his bail at $10,000. He didn't have $10,000, so he is still in jail awaiting trial."

She thought they were too much work and required too much attention. Her daughters really wanted a pet though.\nJames had an idea. Just like he shared custody of Robert with his ex-wife, what if he shared custody of the dog Spot. James could bring the dog to the house when he picked up James every Thursday and bring the dog back to his ex-wife's house on Sunday. Linda thought it was an interesting idea and agreed to try it. James's ex-wife Patricia really liked the idea. It gave her a break from having to take care of Spot. Robert was really happy because he didn't have to leave his dog behind, and his best animal friend could be with him all the time.

The paper invited people to meet Gonzalo at a nearby park on Saturday for a game of football. Football was Gonzalo's favorite sport. He played it ever since he was a kid.\nOn Saturday morning, Gonzalo was excited to go to the park with his new friends to play some football. He was a little worried that people wouldn't show up. Gonzalo walked to the park early. He wanted to be the first one there to meet everyone. He packed his cleats and a ball in a backpack.\nGonzalo waited in an open field close to the entrance to the park. That way everyone could see him. He would also be preventing others from taking the space. Slowly but surely, Gonzalo's coworkers began coming into the park. Some of them even brought friends and family from outside of work. Gonzalo was certain they would have a great game.\n\"I brought a ball,\" Gonzalo told one of his coworkers Leo, who said he had also brought a ball. Leo said he was a huge football fan. Sometimes Leo even held parties at his house to watch football. Both Leo and Gonzalo went to their backpacks to get their balls. That's when they realized there had been a miscommunication.\nLeo's ball was oblong and brown, while Gonzalo's ball was a round soccer ball.

With the growing popularity of American football and basketball, baseball now must share the limelight with these sports. During the late 1990s, baseball was in trouble. Attendance was down. High profile sports that featured fast-paced action such as football and basketball were stealing baseball's thunder. That was all before Barry Bonds and a couple of other sluggers brought the game back to center stage.\nBonds played the first part of his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he enjoyed moderate success. After being traded to the San Francisco Giants in 1992, Bonds began a second career that put him into the spotlight for both the right and wrong reasons. At an age when most players begin to decline in performance because of their advancing age, Bonds went on a home run tear that was unprecedented in the history of the game.\nBonds never hit more than 34 home runs in one year for the Pirates, but, playing for the Giants, he hit an astounding 73 home runs in 2001. This shattered a record that had stood for 40 years. Bonds was 38 years old by the end of the 2001 season, and many questioned how he could put up numbers like that. The answer to that question came out years later when Bonds was accused of taking illegal, performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds eventually broke Henry Aaron's record for most home runs in a career, but many baseball purists feel that the record is tainted because of the illegal drug use.\nBonds' post baseball career has been damaged because of the drug use, and Major League Baseball has implemented a drug use policy since his retirement. He was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of perjury for lying about his drug use, but was able to strike a deal to stay out of jail. In any event, his legacy is forever soiled."

Many parents brought their children to the march. The crowd began to walk down the neighborhood sidewalks. Occasionally the crowd would stop, and an organizer using a bullhorn would tell the story of a person who was killed. After the organizer told the story, there would be a prayer followed by a moment of silence. There were relatives of people who had been killed participating in the march. Some of these relatives would leave lit candles, balloons, or flowers in remembrance of the persons who died. One woman who died was found in the lake of Hollenbeck Park. Police suspect that her boyfriend killed her. She had a baby daughter. Her ex-husband participated in the march and asked that organizers include her in their prayers.\nThe march continued for 20 blocks, and ended at Wabash Park. While the march was somber, the mood inside the park was more celebratory. Different organizations had booths with information about local programs. There was a craft table for kids to draw picture about the kind of neighborhood they wanted to live in. Different bands played between speakers offering solutions to the neighborhood's problems.\nOn the same day there was another march at a nearby housing project. In the spring, four houses were firebombed. Police suspect the attacks were racially motivated. Organizers planned to hold the march again next year.

His influences included genres such as gospel, blues, jazz, pop, Rock n' Roll, and country music. Although he was born sighted, he developed a severe case of glaucoma at the age of five, and was completely blind by the age of seven, but that did not hold him back.\nBorn on September 23, 1930 in Albany, Georgia, Charles and his family moved to Greenville, Florida when he was just an infant. His mother was a devout Christian, and Charles was expected to attend bible study, and church services. His musical interests were sparked by the owner of a small cafe near his home, who played the piano for his customers. Charles was fascinated by the cafe owner's talent, and wanted to learn to play.\nWhen Charles was five, he developed problems with his sight. It is uncertain what caused him to start losing his sight, and it went undiagnosed, and untreated. By the age of seven, he was completely blind. This led to his enrollment into a special school for the blind in St. Augustine, Florida. It was at this school that Charles learned to make music.\nCharles' career spanned nearly 60 years, and he is considered by many musicians, producers, fans, and other artists as a pioneering legend in jazz. His hit singles include Hit the Road Jack, Georgia on My Mind, I've Got a Woman, and I Can't Stop Loving You. Charles branched out in the entertainment industry by acting in several films, including the very popular Blues Brothers. Charles struggled with addiction for most of his life, and died in 2004.

Many Americans view Tillman as a man of strong moral and ethical convictions, who put aside a life of personal wealth to serve his country in its time of need.\nBorn on November 6, 1976 in Fremont, California, Tillman excelled in sports. He led his high school football team, Leland High School, to a championship in his senior year. He earned a full, football scholarship to play at Arizona State University in 1994. He was named Pac 10 Player of the Year in his junior year, and was selected by the Arizona Cardinals in the 1998 NFL draft. Selfless during his entire life, Tillman turned down a five-year, $9 million contract with the St. Louis Rams because of his loyalty to the Cardinals, and to his fans.\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, Tillman turned down a $3.6 million contract with the Cardinals to enlist into the Army to help combat terrorism. Along with his brother Kevin, who turned down a career in professional baseball, the two men completed basic training, and were sent overseas. Tillman served several successful tours of duty in both Iraq, and Afghanistan before he was killed on April 22, 2004. The details surrounding his death became a controversy in the months after he was reported killed in action. Originally, the army listed his death as combat related. It wasn't until approximately one month after his death that the army changed the cause of death to friendly fire. Tillman's family claimed the army used Tillman to advance its image during a dark time in U.S. history. His death by friendly fire, which means he was killed by U.S. military personnel, not the enemy, caused a backlash against the army."

When the FOX Channel appeared on the scene, few people gave it much chance to survive in the face of its stiff competition, but Married with Children changed all that.\nThe show followed the exploits of a dysfunctional family that lived in a fictional suburb of Chicago. The main character was the father, Al Bundy, who was a lovable loser living with his self-centered wife, and bratty kids. Together, the family makes Al's life miserable as he stumbles, and fumbles his way through life. Al works as a shoe salesman that pays very little, and has little chance of promotion.\nAl is an endearing character who gained the adoration of the American public for many years. The actor Ed O'Neil, who played Al, said that people still approach him to this day calling him Al, or Mr. Bundy. O'Neil also said that playing the character for so many years made it difficult for him to find work once the series ended because people associated him with Al.\nOne of the things that made the show so popular is that no subject was off-limits to the writers. It was a controversial show  that dealt with controversial subjects. Many people boycotted the show because of its racy content, but FOX continued on. The show has cultivated a cult-like following that began in the 80s, and continues today."

The English band was possibly the most impactful group of the generation. It revolutionized music like no band or artist before them. Most young boys wanted to be Paul McCartney, or John Lennon - the two founders of the band. Becoming rich and famous in America is one of the attractions of living in the U.S., and becoming a rock star is one way of achieving this. David knew this, so he got together with three of his friends and convinced them to form a band together.\nMany American Rock N' Roll bands began their journey in someone's garage. One notable group to start this way was Van Halen. David and his friends were convinced they could become the next Beatles with a little luck and a lot of practice.\nThe band practiced regularly over the years, and soon became good enough to perform before some young audience, but they never hit the big time unfortunately. The road to success in the music industry is not an easy one to travel, but that does not deter some American dreamers. David's philosophy was \"You never know what the future holds,\" and is engaged in the music industry to this day.

Many African slaves did not have their birth dates recorded into official records during that time period because they did not have basic human rights. They were considered property owned by their white masters. It was a dark time in the country. Frederick Douglass helped change that.\nIt was illegal in the southern states to educate blacks at that time, but Douglass was fortunate enough to have been educated by the wife of his master, who began teaching Douglass the alphabet when he was 12 years old. He continued his education on his own after that. With his new reading skills, Douglass began teaching other black slaves the New Testament. He had a sympathetic owner, who did not see any harm in this activity, but his neighbors did not see eye to eye with him. It wasn't long before the lessons ended, after violent measures were taken by the white community members.\nDouglass eventually escaped slavery, and settled in the state of Massachusetts, where he began his struggle to end slavery. Douglass became one of the most influential people of his generation. He made powerful friends in the U.S. government. During one of his lecture tours in 1843, Douglass was nearly beaten to death by an angry mob, who did not agree with his message of abolition. He fled the country on a couple of occasions to avoid being put into a state of slavery again. While in Europe, Douglass spoke to enthusiastic crowds on the evils of slavery."

Today, 96 percent of the United States has a 911 call system in place. Additionally, 911 can be called from just about every phone in the country. A person can use their personal cell phone, a public pay phone, a home phone, or business work phone to make the call. 911 is an important number to remember.\nAn example of when a person can call 911 is when he or she witnesses an auto accident. If a person is driving through the streets or freeways and witnesses an accident, it would be smart to call 911 to report the accident. Many things can happen when there is an auto accident, and some may not be apparent. The drivers and passengers could be injured and in need of medical attention.

The kids all had open bags. \"I want a treat!\" Laura said and grabbed the candy from each of the bag. The landlady came running to the door. \"No, Laura. You give the kids candy, not taking from them,\" she explained gently. Thankfully, none of the kids were upset. They just looked confused. The landlady suggested that Laura should go out with some friends to a local community Halloween carnival. She would handle giving out the candy by herself.\nLaura went to her room to put on her witch costume. She walked to the local recreation center along with Joe and some other friends. The recreation center was decorated with fake spider webs and filled with artificial fog. \"We're going to egg some houses,\" Joe told her. She didn't know that throwing eggs was illegal. She just thought it was another Halloween tradition.\nA few hours later, the landlady opened the door and found Laura accompanied by police. \"Trick or treat?\" Laura asked, looking embarrassed."

It has trees and winding roads leading up to the hills where he could get lost for hours. Whenever he hiked up there, he always felt at peace with the world and with himself. It was his personal safe zone.\nOne day Johnny was hiking up a trail that he had not tried before, and soon he was lost. Griffith Park is very large and people have been lost up there in the past, but he knew he would find a way back. After about an hour of walking around in circles, Johnny heard something move in the bushes. It scared him for a second, but he just kept walking.\nIt was starting to get dark and he began thinking that he might have to spend the night in a cave or under a rock or something. That was when he heard more noise coming from the trail. It was very loud. \"Hey!\" Johnny shouted. \"What's out there? Stay away!\" He was sure it was a coyote or maybe a mountain lion. He started looking for something to fight back with in case of an attack. Johnny was in a full-panic and started shaking uncontrollably as the noise got closer and closer. Just as he thought that an animal was going to jump out of the bushes, he saw the most beautiful girl he had ever seen in his life. She was tall and blonde and had long straight hair and the first thing she said was \"Are you okay?\"\nIt turned out her name was Sheila, and she was a park ranger. She told Johnny that she had seen him walk up the trail earlier, but did not see him come back down, so she decided to come up to see if everything was okay. Johnny had never been so embarrassed in his life, but that was okay. The couple ended up getting married a little more than a year after that. She saved Johnny's life that day, in more ways than one."

This year, the school is holding another dance competition, but there has been a change in this year's competition. The competition has to be done in pairs.\nJenny's class was looking up to her with high expectations of her winning again this year. On the other hand, Jenny was unsure of this year's outcome. She wanted to enter the competition, but she had never danced with a partner before. She decided to ask some of the boys in her class to enter with her. They all said no to her because they did not know how to dance. Jenny was becoming hesitant about joining.\nShe finally decided to turn to one of her closest friends, Carl. Jenny and Carl had known each other since the first grade. Carl was reluctant to join at first because he also didn't know how to dance. Jenny insisted. He eventually agreed to join the competition.

Putting a little money away every month can help you build a savings that can, in time, open new financial doors for you. Money saved can be very useful for a number of different reasons. One of the biggest reasons to have a savings account is that you will have money to draw from if you, or someone you love, have an emergency. It gives you a good feeling to know that you can help if the time ever comes.\nChecking accounts allow you to use your money in different ways. They are tied to a debit card that a person can use just about anywhere. Debit cards are direct withdrawals from your checking account. You can also write a check in any amount that is covered by your checking account balance. Most places of business, schools and government agencies accept checks. The United States Government insures most savings and checking accounts opened in banks, so your money is safer in a bank than it is put at home.\nYou want to open the right account for you. Financial institutions will help you save your money and grow your wealth in different ways. Some pay more interest than others. Others give the saver rewards that can be redeemed in several different ways. Some banks have higher fees than others. In any event, the best way to find a bank is by doing a little research before you commit to a bank."

Living in Los Angeles has given me the chance to watch one of the oldest baseball teams in the history of the game -- the Dodgers. The team came into existence in New York City in the 1880s, when they were known by several names. Until 1956, the Dodgers played in Brooklyn New York, but in 1957, the team moved west to Los Angeles, and it has played there ever since.\nI recently asked my wife Josie if she wanted to go to a game one night, and of course she said yes. \"Why wouldn't I want to go? The weather is great and the stadium is beautiful. Besides, I think we need a break in our routine,\" she said. \"You're absolutely right, baby. Let's go!\" I said.\nWe were off to Dodger Stadium, which is nestled in the hills just north of downtown L.A. in a neighborhood called Chavez Ravine. Even though it is the third oldest stadium in the country, it is still beautiful. \"Wow. This place never gets old,\" I said as we got to our seats. Josie agreed. It was a perfect night for a ball game. The temperature was in the low 70s, and it was a clear, breezy night.\nThe Dodgers were playing the Giants that night. The two teams have been playing each other for about 100 years, ever since both teams were in New York. The Giants moved the same year the Dodgers did. only they moved up north to San Francisco. That didn't stop the rivalry though. The teams hate each other today as much as they did back in New York. The best part of the night was that the Dodgers won, so I had a couple of Dodger Dogs. \"I don't know what they do to these hot dogs, but they are delicious,\" I told Josie. She wiped some mustard off her face and said, \"Absolutely!\""

The three parts of the U.S. Government are the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Each branch works independently of the other two, and each has its own responsibilities. This system is in place to ensure that no branch can carry more power than the other. This is called the separation of powers, which was written into the Constitution.\nThe executive branch is  the branch that most Americans are familiar with. It includes the president of the United States, the vice-president, and the cabinet. The president is the leader of the country and is the commander-in-chief of the U.S. military. The vice-president is second-in-command, and will act as president if the president dies, resigns, or is removed from office. The cabinet acts as agents of the U.S. President, and carry out the duties they are entrusted with.\nThe legislative branch of government consists of the House of Representatives, and the Senate. Together they form the congress, which can levy and collect taxes, mint money, and establish federal courts. It can also declare war, and raise and support the army, navy, and air force to protect the country. The House of Representatives has 435 members, and the Senate consists of 100 senators, with two from each of the states. Any legislation, or new law, must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate."

        "content": "Buying a home may be the single most important decision a person can make. It involves several things that a prospective homeowner must know before he or she begins a search for a home. Many newcomers to the United States do not immediately purchase a home simply because of the cost involved. Most people rent a home or apartment first, and this is not a bad way to go about finding your first place to live. Renting is generally cheaper than buying a home, and the lower monthly payment may allow the renter to save a few dollars each month until he or she can afford a home.\nFinding a good real estate agent is essential to finding a good home. Realtors are paid professionals whose business is to know about home buying. One thing that must be taken into consideration is how much a person can afford. In the United States, home prices vary greatly. This variance is usually based on location and size of the home. For instance, a three bedroom house that sits on a quarter lot of land will cost much less in places like Victorville, California, than the very same home in Monterey Park, California. Other things that may affect the price of a home is the condition the house is in, the age of the home, and the quality of the schools in the area.\nMany first-time buyers look for low-cost homes, sometimes called \"fixer uppers\" so that they can purchase a home and make improvements on it as time goes by. The longer you own your home, the more its value will rise. Once you own a home for a while, you could either borrow money on it, or sell it for a larger place, or in a more desirable area. It is better to start now than later in purchasing your first home."

Mike and Maria were going to have steak and shrimp, but Maria forgot she needed their meal to be accompanied with a side of mashed potatoes. By noticing this, Maria had a bowl of cereal instead to satisfy her hunger, and then decided to make a trip to the nearest supermarket.\nBefore heading to the supermarket, Maria grabbed a pen and a notepad and started writing down a list of things she needed to buy. She then took a shower, put on some clothes, grabbed her purse, and headed towards the door. As Maria opened the door, she noticed it was raining outside and quickly grabbed an umbrella.\nShe walked down a few blocks and then turned left into her local supermarket.

He is credited with developing the General Theory of Relativity that is one of the pillars of modern science. He was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics largely based on this theory. He is best known for his famous equation of E=MC squared, his mass-energy equivalence formula.\nBorn in Germany on March 14, 1879, Einstein showed great talents and abilities from an early age. He was visiting the United States in 1933 when Adolf Hitler took power in his homeland. Because of Hitler's treatment of Jewish people, Einstein, who was a Jew, decided not to return to Germany, and to make the United States his home. He became a U.S. citizen in 1940.\nIt was Einstein who first conceived of a nuclear fission weapon that he felt Germany was on the verge of discovery. He urged President Franklin D. Roosevelt to begin development of a similar weapon, but also felt it was best not to use it. His warning about the Nazis served the president well, and the Manhattan Project was born. This project was designed to develop a nuclear weapon in the United States in case Hitler unleashed his own weapon. Einstein was a life-long pacifist. He spoke of the purity of science, and how it should be used for the betterment of Humankind, and not for creating weapons of mass destruction. Because of his high IQ, Einstein's name has become synonymous with intelligence in the United States."

A lease is usually good for a set time. Some leases are on a month-to-month basis, but most are for a period of one year or two years.\nThe lease or rental agreement lists out your responsibilities as a tenant and the landlord's responsibilities. The lease  will tell you how much the monthly rent is, when it is due, and how you can pay it. Some landlords will only take a certified check or money order, and others will accept a personal check or cash. If you pay your rent late, there is usually a late fee. The amount of the late fee is also usually in the lease. The lease will also tell you how much the security deposit is. Usually it is the amount of one month's rent. The lease will tell you if you can have pets or not. Many places do not allow pets. If you bring one in anyway, they can fine you or kick you out. If your apartment does allow pets, most likely you will have to pay an extra amount of money, called a pet deposit, to cover any damages caused by the animal. Other rules that may be included in a lease include whether you are allowed to smoke inside the property and whether you are allowed to make any changes like paint. Many landlords do not allow you to paint or even make holes in the wall to hang up pictures.\nA lease is proof that you legally live somewhere. Sometimes you need a lease to show a school that you live within a certain area. Make sure you get a copy of the signed lease from your landlord."

There were complications involving the landing module that Armstrong dealt with at the time of the landing. The module was coming in faster than planned. It was destined to miss the landing site by several miles, but some quick thinking by Armstrong prevented a potential disaster.\nWhen Armstrong did step onto the lunar surface, his words echoed throughout the country and the world: \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for Mankind.\" Years later, Armstrong and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) insisted that the quote was incorrect, and was obscured by interference. However, the quote is remembered forever in its original form.\nArmstrong received the Congressional Medal of Freedom from President Richard Nixon, and was later awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Jimmy Carter. The program was discontinued in the early 1970s. Other countries have landed unmanned missions to the Earth's largest satellite, but to date, no other person has walked on the moon since then. Neil Armstrong, a true American hero, died in 2012 folloing complications from a surgical procedure."

        "content": "In order to maintain good health, there are a couple of steps to take to help you achieve that. One is to get your vaccinations, and the other is to get regular medical check-ups. Vaccinations are preventive medical procedures that come in the form of an injection. Most children in the United States are required by law to be vaccinated for certain diseases that are easily transmitted from one person to another. Vaccinating children starts shortly after birth. The typical vaccinations include injections to prevent Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Polio. They stop the spread of measles, mumps, and chickenpox. These diseases were a big problem in the U.S. in the past, but they have all been eliminated through vaccinations. So if you are not certain if you have had your vaccinations, go see a medical professional.\nGetting a regular medical check-up is also important for maintaining good health. Doctors are highly-trained individuals whose only concern is to ensure their patients' health. It is always easier to practice preventive medicine than to treat an illness once the patient has received it. Preventive medicine is best served by getting regular check-ups. Most doctors want to see their patients every three to six months. By seeing their patients frequently, a doctor can determine slight changes in the overall health of their patients before they become a problem. Usually a check-up will include taking blood and urine samples for analysis. Many illnesses can be revealed through these tests and if caught early, are easily treatable. So make that appointment with your doctor, and if you do not have one, ask a friend, colleague, or family member, for a referral. It could be the best thing you can do for living a long, healthy life."

        "content": "Thanksgiving is a holiday celebrated by many people in the United States and Canada. In the United States it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November and marks the start of the Christmas season. Some people celebrate Thanksgiving to remember the first harvest of the pilgrims and puritans, groups of people from England who immigrated to North America in the 1600s. Some people recreate the first Thanksgiving and dress up as pilgrims, puritans, and the Native Americans who are said to have helped the new arrivals find food to survive their first winter.\nMost people, however, see Thanksgiving as one day a year to reflect upon what they are thankful for. Some families will sit together and take turns saying aloud what they are thankful for. An important part of Thanksgiving is families coming together. Extended family members often travel long distances to share the day with their loved ones. In the United States Thanksgiving is the busiest travel day of the year. People travel in planes, trains, buses, and cars to share a very special meal  - Thanksgiving dinner.\nWhat most Thanksgiving celebrations have in common is the food. On Thanksgiving many families prepare large, elaborate dinners to share with friends and loved ones. Many of these dinners use ingredients associated with the fall harvest, like cranberries, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, and blueberries. Roast turkey is the traditional meat served. It is so common that some people call Thanksgiving Day \"Turkey Day\". The turkey is usually served with gravy and stuffing. Pies are usually served for dessert. The most common pies served are sweet potato, apple, pecan, and pumpkin.\nThanksgiving is not just celebrated in the privacy of people's homes. Every year the President of the United States pardons a turkey, saving it from becoming someone's meal. In New York City, Macy's, a department store, holds a large parade with huge balloons of various cartoon characters floating down the street."

Mike had long noticed Maria and had been planning on asking her out on a date. This was not so easy for Mike to do. He was quite the shy guy, and seeing Maria always made him feel a little nervous. Maria was the most beautiful person Mike had ever seen. Maria had light skin and long brown hair; she also had blue eyes and a petite nose. Mike felt he was not handsome enough for her.\nMike also had light skin; he had short black hair and brown eyes. He was not unattractive, but seeing Maria sure made him feel subpar. One morning, as Mike was waiting in line to get his morning coffee, he decided that today was the day. He was tired of waiting around for something to happen. He knew Maria would never ask him, so he might as well be the one. He was going to ask Maria out on a date. It was now or never, he thought. Mike fidgeted as he waited in line, thinking of what words to say to her. He rehearsed it in his head and decided on what to say. Thankfully, the line for coffee was long. This gave him plenty of time to think it through. He wanted it to be perfect. First impressions, after all, are long lasting. He made his plan. He would first start by introducing himself, and then have a bit of small talk with her. The line moved forward and soon it was his turn to order. He walked up to the counter."

My dad looked at me and told me that everything would be fine.\nI had stayed up all night thinking about how it would go and if I would pass the test. When the driver instructor came out, he told me to get in the car and turn on the lights. I did as I was told. He then told me to turn on the left turn signal, and then the right turn signal. They both worked, so it was time to start driving. The instructor had dark sunglasses on, and he didn't say much when we got in the car.\nThe instructor gave me directions to go straight and make a right turn at the next stop sign, which was a couple of blocks away. I did as I was told, and then kept going straight. Then the instructor told me to keep going straight until I reached a street called Marengo and then to turn left. As I drove, I kept looking for Marengo Street, and thought I might pass it and the instructor would deduct points from my test.\nWhen I finally found Marengo Street, I turned to tell the instructor. That was when I realized that he was asleep. I couldn't believe it. This was an important event in my life, an event that I had been worried about for months. When we finished, he woke up and told me I had done a good job, and that I would be getting my license in about a month. I laughed, and thanked him. I went to tell my dad the good news."

The parents were notified as soon as possible by school officials.\nAccording to John Pineda, who witnessed the accident, the school bus almost hit the car. \"The bus wasn't going that fast, but the other car was. If the bus had hit the car, those people inside would surely have been seriously injured, or worse,\" Pineda said. Pineda also said that the driver of the school bus took precaution to turn where people weren't walking. If he were to have made a right, rather than a left, he would have definitely hit people that were crossing the street.\nPeterson issued a statement saying that the students who were inside the bus could miss school the next day to make sure they were okay, and relax with their family. According to Peterson, the police provided him with a list of students that were involved in the accident. Police are looking for the driver of the car that passed the red light.

The primary care physician was not a dermatologist though. If Andrea wanted the health insurance to pay for the dermatologist, she first needed to make an appointment with her regular physician. Otherwise, Andrea would have to pay out of her own pocket to see a dermatologist.\nAndrea called her primary care provider. She had to wait a week for an appointment since her acne was not an emergency. When it was time for the appointment, she showed her doctor the acne problem. Her primary care physician was able to prescribe a skin cream for Andrea. Andrea used that skin cream for a week, but her acne did not get any better. She called her doctor back. The doctor couldn't do anything else for her. So the doctor gave her a referral to see a skin specialist, a dermatologist.\nAndrea called the dermatologist, but she had to wait another three weeks for an appointment. Her acne had gotten worse over these three weeks. When she finally saw the dermatologist, he ran a number of blood tests and allergy tests. The dermatologist told Andrea that the acne was actually an allergic reaction to fried foods. Andrea thought it was a lot of trouble to finally find out what was wrong.

In 1970, when the World Trade Center was built, that became the tallest building. Now, the Empire State Building is the fourth tallest building in the U.S. and the 23rd tallest in the world. Inside the building is mostly occupied by offices and stores.\nPeople can go to the top of the building, where there is an observation deck. From the top there are beautiful views of New York City, especially at night. Most people take one of 73 elevators to the top. It takes less than one minute by elevator to get to the 80th floor. That is where there is a gift shop. Some people walk 1,860 steps to the top. Every year there is even a race, with people competing to see who can walk up to the top the fastest.\nThe landmark is not just famous because of its height. In 1945, a small plane crashed into it. More than 30 people have tried to kill themselves by jumping off the building. In 1933 it was featured in the movie King Kong, where a giant gorilla climbs to the top and falls to his death after being attacked by airplanes.

It just happens that Johnson is also one of the greatest basketball players to ever play in the National Basketball Association. Johnson played his entire career for the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers are the best franchise in the NBA over the past 40 years, having won more championships than any other teams.\nDuring the 1980s, the Lakers were known as \"Showtime\" because of the team's high-paced, and high-scoring style of play. Much of this style can be attributed to the charismatic Johnson. His style developed at an early age when he was playing basketball in his home state of Michigan. He attended Michigan State University, and led its team to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title in 1979.\nHe was taken by the Lakers as their first pick in the college draft, and he never left. Johnson played for the Lakers from 1980 through 1991, and then played for a few games in 1996. During the 80s, he led the Lakers to eight championship appearances, and won five. No other team had dominated the game in a single decade since the Boston Celtics in the 60s. He also won an Olympic Gold Medal in basketball, and won the Most Valuable Player Awards multiple times, but his most endearing quality remained as one of the nicest and well-liked player in the game.\nToday Johnson still calls Los Angeles his home. He has transitioned from basketball player to coach, to team owner, and businessman. He owns a successful franchise of movie theaters called the Magic Johnson Theaters. Johnson was also part of the investment group that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team in 2012. He is married, and has two sons and a daughter."

Many jobs and classes are conducted during the early morning to mid-afternoon hours, but of course there are exceptions. In California, there are many ways to get to work and school during these rush hours. This includes public transportation such as commuter trains and buses. Additionally, many people use their own transportation to get to and from where they are going. This is where car-pooling and HOV (High-Occupancy Vehicles) lanes come in handy.\nCarpooling is where a group of people join together to share a ride to work or school. Some large companies encourage their employees to carpool, and actually help match people with each other. It is a simple concept. Two, or more people who live close to each other and work in the same place can make arrangements to meet at specific times and in specific locations to share rides. The more people who join a carpool, the better the benefits. Having four people in your group is better than two because the more people who contribute to expenses, the less each individual pays. Expenses usually include gas and toll fares. Additionally, each person takes turns using his or her car which saves wear on their vehicles.\nAnother benefit that comes from carpooling is that you get to use the HOV Lanes on freeways. These lanes are reserved for carpools meaning not everyone can use them. They are generally free of traffic congestion, and can make your commute to work or school a quick and easy trip. So if you are interested in saving a little money on gas, or not using your car every day, look to your peers to start a carpool. All it takes is one other person to start a carpool, and the benefits may prove to be a pleasant experience."

Presley grew to be one of the most recognizable and famous American celebrities the country has ever known. He recorded countless records, starred on the big screen, and his songs were heard on the radio by more fans than any other artists in history.\nPresley received his first guitar at the age of 10, and soon began a musical career that would last more than 25 years. His first success was winning a high school talent contest in Memphis, Tennessee, while still in school. Shortly after graduation, Presley was discovered by Sam Phillips, a record company owner. His first commercial success came in 1954 with his hit single That's all Right. Much of Presley's success could be attributed to his unconventional dance, and live performance style. His hip movements and sexually-suggestive moves earned Presley much praise, and controversy.\nIn 1956, Presley recorded his first No. 1 hit Heartbreak Hotel, and his first No. 1 album, the self-titled Elvis Presley. He also signed a contract with Paramount Pictures Studios, which was, and is still, one of the biggest Hollywood studios in the industry. He went on to star in several movies with Paramount. In 1957, Presley was drafted into service by the United States Army, where he served overseas. His time in the military did not hurt his career. Soon after his service was over in 1960, Presley began recording music, and starring in films.\nPresley married in 1967, and had a daughter the following year. Sadly, his marriage ended in divorce in 1973. He fell into prescription drug abuse, and put on a great deal of weight. He died in August, 1977, resulting from complications of his drug abuse.

It is observed on the third Sunday in June.\nIn the early 20th century there was a mining accident in West Virginia that killed almost 400 men. A push for a day to remember the men killed, who were mostly husbands and fathers, was the start of a push for a national holiday. This was in 1908. It wasn't until 1972, however, that Father's Day was recognized by law as a national holiday. This is due in part to the fact that people were resistant to what they saw as another overly invented holiday meant to just make people spend money. It wasn't seen as a way to remember the dead or to honor living fathers and father figures. People weren't entirely wrong. Organizations representing men's clothing manufacturers put in a lot of money for the holiday to become popular.\nLike Mother's Day, it indeed is a holiday that has become highly commercialized. There are greeting cards to mark the day, and stores advertise gifts for Dad. These gifts traditionally include electronics, ties, and tools. In schools, children often make cards and other gifts. Father's Day is not a federal holiday even though it is widely celebrated. Some of the ways Father's Day is celebrated is with meals, especially barbecues since the holiday falls at the beginning of the summer."

It is observed on a Sunday between the end of March and the end of April. The exact date is calculated based on a different calendar. Many public schools in the U.S. have a week-long vacation around Easter time. Sometimes this break is called Easter or Spring break.\nIn the United States, Easter is also celebrated as a secular holiday. It is associated with the beginning of spring and symbolized by bunnies, flowers, and dyed eggs. Many children in the U.S. believe in a fictional character called the Easter Bunny. According to the myth the Easter Bunny leaves baskets full of candy for children. Sometimes these baskets are hidden and the children have to find them on Easter Sunday morning. Candy that is usually inside an Easter basket can include chocolate in the shape of bunnies or chicks, jellybeans,  and marshmallows.\nAnother activity associated with Easter is an Easter egg hunt. According to popular mythology, the Easter Bunny hides painted eggs and children need to find them. While real eggs used to be used, now it is common to use plastic eggs filled with candy. There are usually public Easter egg hunts in parks across the country. The White House even hosts an Easter egg hunt. Another Easter tradition associated with Easter is dying real eggs in different, usually pastel, colors like light pink, blue and yellow.\nIn New York City, people take to Fifth Avenue to participate in the Easter Parade. The Easter Parade isn't a parade with marching bands and floats. People walk up and down Fifth Avenue showing off elaborately decorated hats or Easter bonnets."

Social media is becoming addicting.\nResearch shows that most people spend on average almost 4 hours a day on social networking sites. That's almost 30 hours a week. While some people need and use social media for work or to stay in touch with friends, other people find that using social media so much causes anxiety and stress. People also tend to use social media as a way to procrastinate. So just as many religions ask people to abstain, or not to have certain foods or drinks for a certain time, many people are taking social media fasts. They are not updating their statuses, and they are also not reading what other people are posting. They choose to stay away from social media for 30 days.\nIronically, the details of these fasts can be found on social networking sites all over the Internet. The reasons people undertake a fast are varied. Some people want to reconnect with their families or friends by disconnecting from their cell phones. Some people want to be more productive at work. What did some fasters do instead of logging on? Some decided to connect with friends by actually sitting down and having face-to-face conversations. If friends or loved ones were far away, they would call them on the telephone instead. Some even wrote handwritten postcards or letters. The results were mixed. Some people felt that not using social media made them more anxious. Others developed more positive habits like journaling or meditating."

Players such as Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and Jerry West had made their mark in the league long before Jordan ever played the game.\nTo be sure, Jordan had a great impact on the game primarily during his playing years with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan led the team to six championship finals, winning all six during the 1990s. His legend is firmly cemented into the history of the great city, and many fans feel he has no equal. It is hard to argue against Jordan in light of his success in all the titles he achieved, but basketball is a team sport, and winning a championship needs a team effort. There have been countless superstars who played in the league that did not have good teammates, and never won a title. Chamberlain falls into that category.\nChamberlain did win two NBA titles in his career, but no one in the game ever dominated it the way he did. He holds several league records, one of which is that he is the only player ever to score 100 points in a single game. However, when Chamberlain played the game, the NBA was not as big as it was in the 90s. During the 90s, the league enjoyed a much greater popularity among American viewers, and much of this can be attributed to the greatness of Michael Jordan. Jordan brought a style of play that had rarely been seen in the NBA. He garnered many individual awards during his career. He played his last few seasons as a member of the Washington Bullets."

        "content": "In today's world, it is not unusual for people to board a plane, and be halfway around the world within hours. The jumbo jetliners in use today are commonplace in most developed countries, but there was a time, not long ago, before air travel was even possible. That was before Orville, and Wilbur Wright built and flew their first aircraft in the early 20th Century.\nOn December 17, 1903, the brothers made their historic flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, officially opening a new era in travel. Their contributions to the new science of aeronautics continued for at least 10 years after that historic day. What separated the Wright brothers from other aviation pioneers was that the brothers developed an effective mechanism to control their airplane. Their three-axis control system is still in use today, more than 100 years after its development.\nThe first flight was not a very long one. It totaled only 120 feet long, 10 feet high, and only 12 seconds in duration, but it was flight. Orville piloted the plane, as Wilbur ran alongside. There were only five eyewitnesses to the flight, but one photographer captured the image on film, and the rest was aviation history.\nThe brothers were very protective of their new invention, and made it difficult for reporters to chronicle their efforts. This led to widespread rumors that the entire thing was a hoax. For the next several years, the brothers worked to refine their flying machine in secret, leading to more doubt. However, in 1908, the brothers took their invention to Le Mans, France to put on an exhibition. Wilbur guided his aircraft making turns and other maneuvers, which amazed the crowd. Soon, the Wright Brothers were famous. They changed the way people travel."

In Southern California, there are a variety of tracks, including Santa Anita, Del Mar, Los Alamitos, and the Fairplex. Santa Anita Park is located in Arcadia, California, just a few miles northeast of Los Angeles. The track features thoroughbred horse racing, and is one of the premier tracks in the country. It is located near the base of the San Gabriel Mountains, and is known for its beautiful scenery. Many important races are run yearly, including the Santa Anita Derby and the Santa Anita Handicap. It has also played host to six Breeder's Cup races since 1986.\nThe park features a one-mile racing track, a 26,000 capacity grandstand to accommodate visitors, 61 barns and more than 2,000 horses. It has an infield park inside the track that can accommodate an additional 50,000 spectators. The infield is one of the most attractive features the park has to offer. It is a setting where people can bring their own food, drinks, chairs, and blankets to enjoy a leisurely day betting on the horses, or just picnicking. It is a beautiful setting for both adults, and children. Not every visitor to the park is a bettor, though. Many people come to Santa Anita just to enjoy the atmosphere, good weather, and food.\nThere are various ways to bet on a horse at Santa Anita, or at any racetrack. The most common is to bet a horse to win a race. Bettors can also bet on a horse to come in second, which is called to place, or to come in third, called show. Additionally, bettors can place a bet for a horse to win, place, or show, which means a person is betting a horse that will come in at least third. There are other methods for betting, including the Daily Double, where a bettor tries to pick the winner of two horse races that are established by the track. Pick Six is another popular betting venue. In this bet, a bettor picks the winner of six races, which is very difficult, but the payout is substantial."

He is a California native who graduated from the University of Southern California, where he learned how to create films. His interest in special effects, and science fiction were the driving force behind the Star Wars franchise, which he launched in 1977. Star Wars has become one of the largest and most successful film franchises in the history of Hollywood.\nBorn in Modesto, California on May 14, 1944, Lucas developed an early passion for fast cars racing. Before moving on to the film school at USC, Lucas raced cars throughout the central California region he grew up in. At USC, Lucas was fascinated by the filmmaking process. In 1967, one of his films won a national student film festival contest. That film was released years later as THX 1138, which won critical acclaim.\nAlthough Lucas is forever tied to his Star Wars series of films, he has been involved in several Hollywood blockbusters, including American Graffiti, and the Indiana Jones movies. He earned critical acclaim for these films as well. Star Wars, however, is his legacy. When the original film was first shown in 1977, Americans were captivated by it. The film depicts a fictional universe where good battles evil with good coming out on top. Americans wanted more, and Lucas was quick to accommodate them. His sequels The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, became two of the most anticipated films in recent history and both did very well at the box office.\nIn 1999, Lucas gave the American movie-going public what they wanted most - more Star Wars. The Phantom Menace was the first of the next three films, and continued the legacy of the film franchise of Lucas."

It was once a main attraction for rural Americans who lived far away from big cities. The traveling fair was a huge event at that time as it only came once a year. People would wait the entire year for the fair to come to their town, and many of them participated in it.\nThe L.A. County Fair is one of the largest fairs in the country. It features just about every kind of farm animals around. Parents can take their children to the petting zoos, where kids can pet lambs, piglets, calves, and foals. Additionally, people can bring home pets from the fair that include such exotic animals like snakes, rodents, and even tarantulas.\nOther attractions include the barnyard races that feature piglets racing around a track at breakneck speeds. There are several game booths, and a carnival that has some of the most exciting and thrilling rides in the region. This year the fair will introduce an exhibit that demonstrates how life was for early Californians, and a wilderness show. The wilderness show focuses on appreciating the natural beauty of the state, and how people today can preserve its beauty for future generations. The fair also stages several concerts on weekend nights from some of the top performers in the music industry.\nOf course, the main attraction the fair has to offer is the food. Here people can enjoy food that is only offered at the fair. One favorite is the chocolate-covered bacon treat. It is a place for those with hearty appetites. Almost any food that can be deep-fried can be found at the L.A. County Fair."

So, at the family reunion, it was no surprise to see that Paul was sitting alone at a table where no one was sitting at.

His cousins had been playing Nintendo in his uncle's room. Paul knew how to turn off all the power in the house. He locked the door to his uncle's room, and then went to turn off the power. When all the lights turned off, he could hear his cousins begin to yell. They were upset because the game was going really well.\nWhen his cousins tried to leave, they realized that the door was locked. They began to yell for help, and Paul started laughing. All of his aunts and uncles were outside enjoying the party, so no one could hear the yells. Paul went back outside and sat down at a table. He was still laughing. An hour passed, and his aunt started looking for her son. When Paul's cousins were finally set free from the room, they started looking for Paul, because they knew he had locked them in there. Paul wasn't worried; he knew they wouldn't do anything. He looked at them, laughed, and then went back to listen to music. The cousins sat down, and got something to eat. They were all mad at Paul."

Unlike Star Wars, which is a very popular movie franchise, Star Trek crosses both film and television boundaries. Star Trek precedes Star Wars by about 10 years, having been developed in the mid-1960s\nThe original Star Trek series was a ground-breaking show that addressed many sensitive issues that existed in the 60s. The show featured a multi-cultural cast that included white, black, Asian, and female actors. This was unheard of in the 60s. During that time period, nearly all shows on American TV had only white cast members. The few minority actors in these shows usually had minor roles that depicted them as gardeners, butlers, outlaws, or misfits. For the first time in television history, minority members of society had positive role models depicted on TV. This diversity led, in large part, to the popularity of Star Trek.\nThe original series ran for only three seasons, but gained a large fan base in the years following its cancellation in 1969. It spawned many future series. In all, there have been five television series and 11 films in the Star Trek franchise, which is nearly twice the number of Star War films to date.\nSome of the issues covered in the original series were racism, homosexuality, gender bias, religion, and drugs. The series developers did not shy away from these important social issues. The original creator of the series had a difficult time selling his show to the networks because of this. TV executives felt American viewers were not ready to bring these issues into their homes, but the series became very successful soon after it was launched."

This idea eventually became Disneyland, located in Anaheim, California, about 25 miles south of Los Angeles. Disney was an expert animator who created some of the most memorable characters in the history of animation.\nDisney was born in Hermosa, Illinois on December 5, 1901. He had little formal education. While in high school, Disney showed a remarkable talent for drawing cartoon characters, but he did not do well in school, and dropped out at the age of 16. He tried joining the military during World War I, but was rejected because he was too young. When Disney was 19 years old, he and a friend founded an animation company called Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists, where he developed revolutionary new animation techniques. After a few failed attempts to create a profitable and famous character, Disney developed his pride and joy Mickey Mouse in 1947.\nThe mouse's first appearance was in an animated cartoon Steamboat Willie. Such was the beginnings of a career that is thriving to this day. Mickey Mouse is still the official symbol of the Disney Corporation. The corporation has branched out to film, television, and merchandise. Along with Disneyland, Disney's legacy includes 11 theme parks worldwide, five luxury resorts, hotels, television shows, music labels, and eight motion picture studios.\nDisney also enjoyed great success in Hollywood.

Some people also think there is another class in between poor and middle class called working class. United States culture is based on the idea that people can move up the economic ladder and become middle class or even rich if they were born poor. This is the idea of going from \"rags to riches\". Moving up the class ladder is not easy though. Higher education needed to get a good paying job is expensive.\nClass in the United States is more than just how much money a person makes though. Education, what job a person has, where they live, and the culture, all play a role in what class a person will be classified as. For example, a person with only a high school diploma and a low-paying service job may be considered poor or low class. While a person with a Ph.D., who owns their own company, would be considered high class or wealthy.  In a way this makes sense because high-paying jobs usually require a high-level education. But for some people, class is something you are born with. For example, the children of billionaire Donald Trump were born rich and upper class without having done anything to earn that status.\nGender plays a role too in how someone can move up the economic ladder. Women earn less than men do, so it is harder for them to accumulate wealth. Race also plays a role in how much people earn and their ability to move up the economic ladder. In the United States, most families require both the man and woman to work in order to support the household."

High profile sports that featured fast-paced action such as football and basketball were stealing baseball's thunder. That was all before Barry Bonds and a couple of other sluggers brought the game back to center stage.\nBonds played the first part of his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he enjoyed moderate success. After being traded to the San Francisco Giants in 1992, Bonds began a second career that put him into the spotlight for both the right and wrong reasons. At an age when most players begin to decline in performance because of their advancing age, Bonds went on a home run tear that was unprecedented in the history of the game.\nBonds never hit more than 34 home runs in one year for the Pirates, but, playing for the Giants, he hit an astounding 73 home runs in 2001. This shattered a record that had stood for 40 years. Bonds was 38 years old by the end of the 2001 season, and many questioned how he could put up numbers like that. The answer to that question came out years later when Bonds was accused of taking illegal, performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds eventually broke Henry Aaron's record for most home runs in a career, but many baseball purists feel that the record is tainted because of the illegal drug use.\nBonds' post baseball career has been damaged because of the drug use, and Major League Baseball has implemented a drug use policy since his retirement. He was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of perjury for lying about his drug use, but was able to strike a deal to stay out of jail. In any event, his legacy is forever soiled."

The surprise attack was intended to destroy the American Pacific Fleet that stood in the way of Japan's complete domination of the Pacific Ocean during the 1940s. The attack was coordinated with attacks in the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Pearl Harbor was attacked by more than 350 Japanese airplane fighters, bombers and torpedo planes that were launched from six aircraft carriers.\nThe early-morning attack sank four U.S. battleships, and four more were heavily damaged. Six of the eight battleships were restored, and returned to service, but the Japanese also destroyed, or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, a minelayer, and an anti-aircraft training ship. In addition, 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed, with many of them on the ground. The attack was devastating. It took the U.S. years to recover from all the damage caused on that fateful morning. However, the Japanese were unable to destroy their main targets, the Navy's aircraft carriers. By what some call a stroke of luck, the U.S. carrier fleet was out to sea at the time of the attack.\nThe country was in shock at the news of the disaster. U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt called the attack cowardly, and declared December 7th as \"A day that will live in infamy.\" On December 8, the United States formally declared war on Japan. This plummeted the country into World War II, which Roosevelt had long hoped to avoid. Soon after the United States' declaration of war against Japan, Germany, which was a Japanese ally, declared war on the U.S. and the country was now fully involved in the greatest war in the history of the world."

        "content": "Disneyland is also called Magic Kingdom. It is located in Anaheim, California. The park opened in 1955, and was an instant success. When Anthony Martinez was a little boy, his brothers and sisters told him about Disneyland. At first, Anthony didn't know what they meant. He was just too young, and would call it \"Dizzyland\" as he couldn't pronounce it properly. His father had taken his older siblings to the park many times, but that was years ago. Anthony was much younger than his brothers and sisters.\nFor a long time, Anthony kept asking his parents to take him to Disneyland, but the feeling eventually wore off. He quit bugging his parents to take him. One day, when Anthony was about 8 years old, a classmate came to school bragging about his weekend at Disneyland. All of a sudden, Anthony wanted to go again. \"Please, mommy, take me to Disneyland,\" Anthony pleaded to his mom. His dad heard it, and immediately told him \"Okay, son, we're going this weekend for sure.\" Anthony's dad hadn't realized that his youngest child had never been there, and felt very bad about it.\nThe weekend came, and Anthony was so excited. He couldn't keep still. When they got into Disneyland, Anthony marveled at the castles and other attractions. He especially liked the life-sized characters that roamed the park. He grew up watching Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Now he was taking pictures with them. Anthony was \"in heaven.\"\nThe best part of the theme park is the rides. \"Can we go on the Captain Nemo Ride?\" That question was soon followed by \"Can we go on the Matterhorn?\" Soon Anthony had gone on just about every ride. He was overwhelmed by the place. Soon the family was back in their SUV heading back home with Anthony fast asleep. It was the greatest day of his young life. A day he would later call \"the best day of my life.\""

Although they were tired after coming back from a trip to San Diego, they had no time to waste. Their wedding was to take place next month, and Mike and Maria aimed to make it the best wedding they could manage. The future husband and wife sat down at the kitchen table and began to plan.\nMaria was the first to speak. \"First of all, I think we should set a budget,\" she said to Mike. Mike, about to say something, coughed a couple of times before getting up to serve himself a glass of water. Looking pensive, he looked back at Maria who was waiting for a response. \"Yes, we should set a reasonable budget,\" he finally replied. After an hour of deliberation, Mike and Maria had set the date, settled on a location, and began working on the guest list. Based on the budget they had set for themselves, the number of guests totaled nearly one hundred.\nNext, they decided on wedding invitations. Maria grabbed her laptop and searched for printers that could make their invitations. She soon found the right printer and made an appointment to go there and share ideas about creating the perfect wedding invitation. Mike and Maria had decided to get married at their local church. The building was large enough to accommodate their guests and would serve as beautiful setting for the bride and groom's wedding ceremony.\nIt was a lovely little Christian church in the heart of Pasadena. Mike had already discussed some of the arrangements with the church, but he still needed to secure the date for the wedding and did so. A few hours passed. \"What's next on the list, Mike?\" asked Maria, who by now was beginning to feel weary. \"Let's see. The food, the flowers, the photography, and then ...,\" Maria interrupted Mike before he could say anything else."

It is run by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. The system dates back to 1878, when the California Street line first opened. In all, there are three lines currently operating in the city, and boasts a fleet of 12 cable cars. There used to be 23 lines in use throughout the city connecting the diverse communities that make up San Francisco. The open-air cars are a major tourist attraction, and are still used by San Francisco commuters on a daily basis.\nThe simple reason cable cars were first used in the city was because of its landscape. San Francisco is very hilly, which makes it impossible for municipal buses to scale. The solution for this problem was the cable car. These cars are literally pulled by cable, up and down the steep hills of the city, making it easier for people to get from one end of the city to the other.\nThere are two types of cars in use today. Single-ended cars and double-ended cars. The single-ended cars have open-sided sections with seats that face outward to the street. The rear section of these cars is enclosed with seats facing the interior of the car. These cars seat 29 passengers. They travel in both directions by using a swivel-based turntable that turns the car at the end of the line. The double-ended cars are a bit larger, and can hold up to 68 passengers. It has 34 seats, and grips for an additional 34 standing passengers. The best feature of these cars is the pure fun they are to ride. People who ride the San Francisco cable cars are stepping into part of California's history."

During the time, Bryant led the Lakers to five National Basketball Association titles. The most recent championship was in 2010, when the Lakers beat their arch rival, the Boston Celtics. The Lakers also won seven western conference titles and eight Pacific Division titles during Bryant's time.\nThe Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA. They have appeared in 31 championship finals, more than any other teams in the league. The team has won more regular season games than any other franchise. It is clearly one of the premier NBA organizations, which came into existence in 1946.\nBefore Bryant, the Lakers already had some of the most notable superstars the league has ever known. Players such as George Mikan, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and Magic Johnson. Bryant had been central in establishing, and maintaining the legacy of this great team. He is the latest, and possible greatest of them all.\nHis individual statistics are astounding. He is the youngest player ever to score 30,000 points. He has been selected to the NBA's All Star team every year he has played, with the exception of his rookie season. He has won two Olympic Gold Medals in Basketball, leading the United States Olympic titles in 2008 in Beijing, and in the London games of 2012. In 2006, Bryant became the 2nd player in the history of the game to score more than 80 points in a single game. Only Chamberlain has scored more.

Springer has been a talk show host for several years on the show that bears his name, the Jerry Springer Show. His show is described as a tabloid talk show because of the controversial subjects covered, and because of the people who appear on the show. Springer does not invite celebrities to his show. Instead, he opts to showcase regular Americans from all walks of life. He is a former politician who served one term as mayor of the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, in the 1970s.\nHis show debuted in 1991 as a politically themed talk show, where he invited celebrities such as Oliver North, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson. The show was designed to mimic another popular daytime talk show, the Phil Donahue show. The show found moderate success, but in 1994, in order to boost ratings, the show transitioned to a more sensational format. In this new format, everyday people were confronted by family members, and friends, about controversial subjects.\nThe show has been highly-rated for decades now, but has also come under fire from many groups who claim the subjects are not appropriate for daytime television. Springer does not shy away from any subject. Guests are confronted about subjects such as adultery, prostitution, homosexuality, and hate group membership. Often, these confrontations become violent, where guests engaged in physical confrontations. The Springer show has spawned numerous copycat shows over the years, but it still out-rates every other show of its kind.\nIn May of 2000, controversy hit the show when a female guest on the Springer show was murdered by her ex-husband after viewing the episode. Springer, his producer, and the network were sued by the woman's children. The suit alleged that the controversial nature of the show led to the murder, eventually though, the suit was dropped."

Fifteen minutes had passed and the creaking hadn't stopped. Alvin slowly rose from his bed. He moved towards his door, taking one step every two seconds.

It is an isolated island with fewer than 5,000 residents, and most of them live in its only incorporated city, Avalon. It is part of a group of islands called the Channel Islands of California. The climate on the island is typically Southern Californian with warm temperatures all year round. Catalina Island has a rich history that dates back to the 16th Century when Spanish explorers visited the island. Archaeological evidence indicates that Native American tribes occupied the island centuries before that. The island had been a possession of Mexico, and eventually of the United States.\nThere are two common ways to get to the island today. Most people travel to Catalina by boat from either Orange or Los Angeles County points. Helicopter rides are also available for more daring travelers. The island today is a tourist attraction that features island tours, sport fishing, scuba diving, surfing, parasailing, and beachcombing. In past years, the island was a hotspot for the Hollywood rich and famous. Glass-bottom boat tours are available for those interested in exploring the reef system or the shipwrecks in the region. The underwater dive park is also a popular attraction for visitors.\nCatalina Island is also famous, or perhaps infamous, as the location where actress Natalie Wood died in the waters off the island's coast. The controversial death occurred more than 30 years ago while Wood and her husband, actor Robert Wagner, were sailing their yacht. Her death is still controversial today."

It takes more than two people to play.\" Carol thought about it, and said that they should start playing and others will join in, so the two girls started playing alone. Just as Carol said, more kids came over and wanted to play with them. Soon they had more than enough people for a game, and they played for hours.\nAfter the game, the girls wanted to cool off, so they decided to jump into the ocean for a little relief. The water was crowded, but that just added to the fun. It was cool and wet, and the waves were just right. Some people were surfing both on surfboards and body boards, while others were swimming out to the buoys. On the coastline, two girls were digging for sea shells and one man was using his metal detector to find hidden treasure. Carol ran up to the man and asked him what he was looking for. He said: \"Anything I can find, young lady.' Carol laughed and asked him if she could try. \"Sure. Why not?\" said the man. So Carol started scanning the beach and soon found a necklace, whcih the man let her keep. \"Why not,\" said the man. \"You found it.\" Carol was very happy and ran to tell Laura."

The chute was in a small room located next to the elevator. Frank had to take cans, bottles and other recyclables to the basement and put them in a special bin. He did not though have to worry about remembering what day was trash day. He did not have to worry about taking the trash out to be collected. That was the job of the building's superintendent.\nThe two-bedroom house Frank moved into had no superintendent though. Frank was provided with three trashcans by the city. Each trashcan was a different color. The black one was for regular garbage. The blue one was for paper, plastic, and cans so that they could be recycled. The green bin was for leaves, cut grass, and tree trimmings. Each bin needed to be put out to the curb before the city sanitation trucks came around early Monday morning. Frank couldn't put the cans out too early, either. If he put the cans on the curb before 6:00 p.m. on Sunday evenings, he could get a ticket and have to pay a fine.\nFrank decided to set a reminder on his cell phone. Every Sunday night at 6:00 in the evening his phone would beep reminding him to take the trash bins to the curb. Frank also had to pay the city every three months for trash collection. That was something that he didn't have to do when he rented an apartment. Living in a house sure involved a lot more responsibility than living in an apartment building."

The youngest children begin in kindergarten at 5, and then go to first grade, second grade and so on. Most elementary schools go up to fifth or sixth grade.\nThe focus of an elementary school is basic academic and socialization skills. Mostly children learn how to read, write, count, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Students also learn the rules of English grammar, spelling, and vocabulary. Children also learn basic social studies or history, science, art, and music skills, and participate in gym or physical education. In elementary schools children also learn how to follow directions, share, and work in groups. Students usually stay in one classroom all day with one teacher who stays with them throughout the year. Students may leave the classroom to visit the school library, the school gym, and attend special science, art, and music classes. Students also usually leave the classroom for lunch and recess. For lunch students sit at tables, separated by grade, in a large cafeteria. Recess is usually a half hour when children go out into a yard to play. The typical school day starts at about 8:00 in the morning and ends at about 3:00 p.m. Students go to school from Monday to Friday and have the weekends off.\nElementary school teachers are licensed by the state where they work. They have to graduate from college, or even graduate school taking special classes in Early Childhood and Elementary Education. Before teachers can be in a classroom with students, they have to pass a background check and take an exam."

For example, the MC will announce when the newly married couple enters the reception hall, and all the guests will stand up and applaud. A wedding reception usually has music and guests are expected to dance. The music can be provided by a DJ or by a live band. Sometimes the DJ or live band will accept requests from guests to play a certain song. When the newly married couple enters the reception, they will share a dance by themselves to a song they picked beforehand. Usually the song is something romantic and represents the couple's love for one another. Sometimes the bride will share a dance with her father and the groom will share a dance with his mother. After these special dances, the guests are invited to the dance floor.\nFood at a wedding reception can be buffet style, where everyone serves himself or herself, or it can be a sit-down meal served by waiters. Guests get to choose among a meat, chicken or fish deal. Guests generally make their choices when they respond to the initial wedding invitations.\nDuring a wedding, guests shouldn't expect to spend too much time with the bride and groom. The new couple is usually very busy greeting all of their guests. Sometimes the couple doesn't even get a chance to eat. What almost every newly married couple does get to eat at their wedding reception is the wedding cake. The bride and groom traditionally cut through the wedding cake together, and then feed the other person a bite."

The New England city is called the Witch City because of an infamous set of trials that happened there in 1692 to 1693. At the time, the city was just a town in the British colony of Massachusetts. The Salem Witch Trials accused more than 200 people of being witches. People believed witchcraft was real and was criminal. Among the accused were women, men, and even children. Nineteen people were sentenced to death. They were all hanged. One of the accused was tortured with heavy rocks being placed on him until he was crushed underneath the weight. Seven others died in jail.\nThere was never any proof that those accused, and convicted were really witches. Historians think that people would accuse people because of family feuds. Other historians think that a domino effect occurred, with people becoming hysterical after one accusation. Fear of witches spread like a disease.\nThe Salem Witch Trials have become a part of the city's history. \"The Crucible\", a play about the trials by Arthur Miller, has been turned into a movie. The city is not ashamed of its past, but rather uses it to teach tolerance and earn some tourist dollars. There is a memorial dedicated to the innocent people who died because of the witch-hunts. There is a \"Witch Museum\" that tells the story of what happened. Many people visit Salem around Halloween. Salem police cars have witch logos. A local public school is known as the Witchcraft Heights Elementary School, and the Salem High School sports teams are named the Witches.

This may seem like an obvious method, but saying hello to someone differs from country to country, and even from region to region in the same country. In the United States, people are informal when meeting other people for the most part. Saying hello tells you a lot about the person you are greeting, and it also tells that person something about you. Typical greetings are \"hello, hi, greetings, good day, good morning, or good afternoon or evening.\" With the exception of hi, all of these greetings can be considered formal greetings that are universally understood in the United States.\nSome of the more informal greetings vary greatly from person to person. Younger people have created their own slang for greeting someone, and the slang is constantly changing. For instance, the term \"what's happening\" was very popular during the 1970s and 80s, and it is still in use today, but it has been replaced by several other greetings by the newer generations. \"What's up, or wass up\" can be heard frequently in the U.S. among the younger people. These two terms are considered informal greetings that a person should never use in a formal setting. These terms are usually reserved for informal encounters and are usually said by friends.\nWhen a person says hello to another person, it says a lot about that person. It conveys a friendly attitude and a willingness to get to know the other person. It can mean that the person initiating the conversation is someone who likes to socialize, or just likes people in general. If the greeting is accompanied by a smile, it is all the better."

Philip Morris is one of the largest tobacco producing companies in the world, and the corporation used the Marlboro Man with great success over the years.\nThe Marlboro Man was a strong, rugged-looking man who rode a mighty horse, and traveled throughout the country promoting tobacco products. He appeared in television, radio, print, and billboard ads for decades. When the United States Surgeon General deemed tobacco smoke as unhealthy in the 1960s, the beginning of the end for the Marlboro Man had begun. The Surgeon General began an anti-smoking campaign by requiring all cigarette companies to place its warning label on each package sold in the country. The warning included the wording that \"Tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer.\" Soon the pressure was on the tobacco companies to curb their advertising campaigns.\nIn 1955, tobacco sales reached $15 billion in the United States alone. After the Marlboro Man was introduced to the American public, that total reached $20 billion. This increase was largely based on the Marlboro Man campaign. The company also started an advertising scheme by offering genuine Marlboro Man gear for sale. These commodities were of high quality that appealed to the outdoor type of person. The gear ranged from camping equipment, hats, to outdoor clothing. It was very successful in its time. This success came at a great expense though. Four men who portrayed the Marlboro Man died of lung cancer, earning Marlboro cigarettes as the cowboy killer.

Although it was a British ship, many Americans were on board during that terrible night of April 15, 1912. The ship was on its maiden voyage on that night when it struck an iceberg in the deep waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. The ship was in route to New York City from Southampton, UK when it hit the iceberg, killing more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers. The ship was the largest ship ever built to that date, and was thought to be unsinkable.\nThe ship's passengers varied from some of the richest people in the world at the time, to thousands of immigrant workers who were trying to find work in the United States. The Titanic was equipped with technological safety features like remote control watertight doors, and watertight compartments, but it did not carry enough lifeboats for all passengers. Because of the immense size of the ship, it was thought to be unsinkable, a fact that contributed to the small number of lifeboats carried on the ship. Additionally, many of the lifeboats were not filled to capacity when they were launched, causing more loss of life.\nMost of those killed that night were men. The protocol followed by the ship's officers required \"women and children first,\" when loading lifeboats. The accident was met by international shock and grief. Many of today's maritime rules were put into place because of this disaster. Only 705 passengers floating on lifeboats were saved that night. The ship broke into two parts before it went under. It remains more than a mile deep in the North Atlantic. The sinking of the Titanic has been documented in film and literature over the years."

The higher the status of the individual giving you a reference, the more significance it will carry with your prospective employer. If, for instance, you are applying for a job in the engineering field, it will be wise to ask your teachers or other more established engineers if they would endorse you for a specific job. If they agree, you could list them on your \"References\" page. Many employers will ask for a resume when you first apply, and if they like what they see on your resume, in many cases, they will then ask for references.\nIf you do not know any professionals in your area of study, which many students do not, a trusted teacher would be your best choice. If he or she agrees to allow you to list him or her as a personal reference, that would be an asset. Keep in mind that teachers and professionals do not automatically agree to this. Many will consider your abilities and dedication before they allow you to use them as references, so it is a good idea to ask those teachers with whom you have a good relationship with.\nThe reference page is its own unique page separate from your resume. It needs to be labeled on your page as \"References\" or \"Personal References.\" It must include the person's full name, title, and organization he or she belongs to. It must also contain contact information. This can be either a phone number or an email address, or both. The more quality references you can list on your reference page, the better."

Whenever a person is driving through any city, it is a good idea to obey all the traffic laws. Some of the basic laws, like stopping at red lights, speeding, and making U-turns, are similar in most cities, but that is not always the case. Sometimes what is legal in one city might be illegal in another. It is wise to check the traffic laws in cities where drivers work and live.\nWhenever drivers are stopped or \"pulled over\" by a policeman, it is important to move the vehicle into the nearest, safe area near a curb. Drivers will know they are being pulled over by the flashing red and blue lights atop of the police car. This is a signal that the police want you to stop. The reasons police pull cars over are many. It could be that the driver was going too fast, or that he or she failed to stop at a traffic light or stop sign. It could also be because one of the car's lights is out, or the vehicle registration is expired. These are just some of the reasons police pull drivers over.\nThere are certain things drivers need to do whenever they are faced with this situation. The first thing a driver should do is to comply with any instructions the police officer may be giving them over the speaker. If no instructions are given, pull to the nearest safe spot and wait in the driver's seat until the officer comes to the door. Always be polite and give the officer your driver's license, proof of insurance, and current registration. Remember, you should always be respectful."

For some reason, Donna and Jennifer started getting along after we broke up. \"How convenient,\" I told Jennifer. Donna was always trying to make my life hell. I guess that's her job as the older sister. She was 20 years old, while I turned 17 years old last year.\nMy mother had worked very hard to keep the party they were going to throw for me a secret. It didn't work, because Donna had a big mouth, but I was trying to keep up the secret for my mother's sake. My dad got home from work and told my mom to get the kids so that we could all go out for dinner.\nWe showed up at my favorite restaurant, which has a private room in the back for parties. Everything went downhill as soon as I opened the door. My other ex-girlfriend Sarah was there, because she wanted to try and fix our relationship. I'll never forget the look on Donna's eyes. She looked like she saw a ghost. Donna grabbed Jennifer and told her to go outside. Jennifer and Sarah never got along. It might have something to do with me, but I'm not sure.\nJennifer hadn't seen Sarah, because Donna took Jennifer outside before she had the chance. I took Sarah by the hand, and asked her who had invited her. She looked at me confused, because apparently I had invited her through a text message a week ago. It was true. I invited her, but I never thought she would show up. When Jennifer finally came into the room, she saw Sarah and became very angry. She looked at me and started yelling at me. \"Why is she here, Jason?\" asked Jennifer. I looked at her equally angry and said, \"What are you talking about? What are YOU doing here?\" Jennifer started yelling at Sarah, and Sarah started yelling at Jennifer. They got so angry that they started fighting, which eventually got us kicked out of the restaurant. My mother was crushed when she got there. Donna got grounded for a month. That was one horrible birthday."

        "content": "In U.S. cities like New York City and Los Angeles, many people live in small apartments. Despite not having homes with big yards, some apartment dwellers still seek the companionship that domesticated animals like dogs and cats offer. Some people feel that having a pet, even in a small space, is good for teaching children responsibility.\nHowever, many landlords forbid tenants from having pets, specifically cats and dogs, because of the damage the animals can do to carpets. Some landlords even forbid birds because of the noise they make. Many landlords charge an extra fee, known as a pet deposit, to tenants who want to keep pets. This is to pay for repairs or cleaning caused by the pet.\nMany times apartment dwellers will choose animals, like fish, hermit crabs, guinea pigs or hamsters, that make little noise, little mess, and won't chew up the furniture. Other people keep lizards as pets, since they don't require much space and can be kept in small cages or tanks. Another benefit of these smaller pets is that they don't need to be walked. However, some people who live in apartments have pets that are not so ordinary. Some of these less than ordinary pets include mammals like hedgehogs, amphibians like frogs, and spiders like tarantulas. Not all exotic pets are legal though.\nIn order to maintain public safety, some cities and states have laws banning specific animals as pets. New York City, for example, bans people from keeping ferrets, snapping turtles, pythons, and scorpions as pets. It seems unlikely that a family would have a polar bear named Fluffy or a whale named Bubbles as a pet, New York City has specific laws banning these wild animals from residences. These laws exist for a good reason. In 2003, a man in a Manhattan apartment  was discovered to have a 350-pound Bengal tiger as a pet."

He looked at me and said \"One man's trash is another man's treasure,\" which I didn't understand at that time.\nIn fact, he was collecting stuff he needed not only to sell, but stuff he needed to make his home. This man lived in the park by my house. No one really bothered him because he was respectful and would clean up after himself. I went running in the park one day and saw him putting together a bed with stuff he had collected from the trash. He always looked for clean stuff. If it had food trash on it, he wouldn't take it. I went back to my car and took a blanket to him. He saw it and thanked me.\nI remember one day the police were bothering him because they had to take away his stuff. The members of the neighborhood went to the police and told them that he wasn't hurting anybody by being there. The homeless man looked at everyone and thanked them, but told the police to take his home away if they had to. \"I know you guys are just doing your job. Go ahead,\" he said.\nWhen the police heard him say that, they decided to leave him alone. He has been there for a couple of years now. He has even started planting a garden outside by the football field. People often go and give him food and other items he might need. He has made trash into his treasure."

He walked into the bedroom to find the cat tearing the bed sheets with his claws.\nMike was much less sympathetic towards punishing Tiger. \"No Tiger! That's a bad cat!\" he yelled at the animal and chased him out of the room. He decided to have a serious talk with Maria regarding the cat and how troublesome he had become. When he approached Maria about the issue, Maria immediately changed the topic.\n\"Mike, we have to take the cat to the vet,\" she said. When Mike asked why, Maria said it was time to give him his shots. Mike saw how concerned Maria was and forgot all about punishing Tiger. \"Alright, you're right. When do you want to go?\" he asked Maria. Maria said she would make an appointment right away. She grabbed her cell phone and called the vet to make an appointment."

The basic service was the least expensive, but it didn't include any of the channels from his country. So Anthony signed up for a package that included channels from his country. However, that package didn't include cartoon channels that his children liked to see. So he added an expanded package to include cartoon channels. That still left out channels that showed certain series that his wife liked to see.  So Anthony signed up for a special promotion that included a premium channel for one month free.\nThe customer service representative set an appointment to send a technician to Anthony's house in a week. The appointment wasn't for an exact time. Instead the customer service representative said the technician would come between noon and 2:00 in the afternoon.  When the technician arrived, he set up a converter box and digital recorder box to the family television in the living room. The technician gave Anthony a remote and a channel guide. Anthony had to sign some papers before the technician left.\nAnthony, his wife, and their children enjoyed the hundreds of channels they now had thanks to cable. One month after the technician came and installed all of the equipment, a bill arrived. The bill totaled almost 200 dollars. Anthony could not afford to pay that much on a monthly basis. He discussed it with his wife. They decided not to keep the channels from their country and the premium channels his wife enjoyed.  The only extra channels Anthony kept were the cartoon channels for his kids."

He was also unanimously elected to a second term in 1793, the only president ever to garner 100 percent of the electoral votes. Washington was also the Commander-in-Chief of the First Continental Army that fought the British when the country was not yet established.\nHis epic \"Crossing of the Delaware\" river to recover New York City is still considered one of the greatest military moves in the history of warfare. At the time of the crossing, the British had taken Boston and New York. The Continental Army was on the run and disorganized, but Washington had a plan. He decided to take his troops across the Delaware River in the middle of winter. This was a move that many military minds thought impossible, but not Washington. The Americans were able to take New Jersey, and change the course of the war.\nAnother landmark moment for Washington was the winter at Valley Forge. In 1777, Washington led an army of more than 11,000 troops into Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, where the army suffered through a cold winter that claimed the lives of 3,000 men. When the spring arrived, instead of a demoralized, beaten group of soldiers, the army emerged battle ready, and able to continue the fight against the English in New York. The army was able to survive the fierce winter because of the training, and preparedness of Washington's officers. Washington earned the nickname, \"The Father of His Country,\" because of his military intelligence, and his concern for the people of the United States."

As soon as he was more sober, the police released him. Apparently, Donald wasn't quite sober enough though.\nWhen he was released, Donald realized he was pretty far from his home. He didn't feel like walking almost two miles, so he called his friend from the jail to come get him. But Donald was getting impatient. When a woman got out of her car in the parking lot, he tried to get in. The woman screamed for help. Donald screamed, \"But this is my car!\" The woman kept screaming and Donald got out. He then thought it would be a good idea to take the bus home.  A deputy was watching and arrested Donald again, after he had only been free for one hour. This time, however, Donald's jail stay would not be as short. He was charged with attempted burglary. A judge set his bail at $10,000. He didn't have $10,000, so he is still in jail awaiting trial."

That includes making sure their children are healthy. One of the things parents can do is to ensure that their children eat a healthy diet. Children should eat three healthy meals a day, plus a nutritious snack or two. Another thing parents can do for their children is to make sure they drink plenty of water. Water is crucial to the health of a growing child, and it is good for adults, too.\nParents should also limit the amount of sugar and fat their children consume. Unhealthy foods include sugary sodas, juice, fried foods, and candy. These foods have little or no nutritional value and can cause your child to become dependent on sugary snacks for a quick boost. Sometimes the best thing you could tell your child is \"No.\" Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so give your child a healthy breakfast every morning, which is vital to a child's well-being. It will allow your child to concentrate on his or her school work better, and will fuel them until it is time for lunch. There is no better energy boost than a good breakfast to start your child's day.\nPracticing good hygienic habits are also good for your children. Teach them to brush their teeth, to wash their hands, and to bathe themselves at an early age. Of course the best way to teach your child these habits, or anything else, is for you to act as a role model. If they see you practicing good habits, they will also do the same. Remember, a healthy child is a happy child."

While many people learn another language because of their cultural or ethnic heritage, it also helps your thinking. Studies show that people who speak two or more languages score higher on IQ tests. Speaking two or more languages also prevents your brain from aging. This means when you get older your chances of having Alzheimer's disease are small.\nIt's better and easier to become bilingual when you are younger. When you are a child, your brain is like a sponge absorbing information quickly. However, learning a second or even third language at any age  is good brain exercise. Being bilingual boosts your memory and listening skills.\nBeing bilingual also helps your chances of finding a job. So many companies in a variety of fields now work around the globe. They need workers who can communicate with all their clients worldwide. Knowing more than one language usually means you are a better multitasker. In today's fast-paced business world, being able to do more than one thing at a time is seen as a plus. Some companies may even pay bilingual workers more. This is why it's a good idea to put your language skills on your resume. There are also social benefits to being bilingual. Most people who are bilingual are more open-minded and culturally sensitive compared to those who only know one language.\nBeing bilingual or even multilingual is controversial, though. Some parents worry that switching among different languages will confuse their children. Some people feel that in the United States everyone should speak English only. There are even organizations asking the U.S. Congress to pass laws making it illegal for the government to use any other language on official documents. This movement has not been very successful."

It consists of the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. The VA Health Administration is responsible for providing veterans with all health care issues, while the Benefits Administration is designed to help veterans in areas such as guaranteed home loans, insurance vocational rehabilitation and educational benefits. The National Cemetery Administration provides burial and memorial benefits, and is entrusted with the maintenance of the VA's cemeteries.\nThe VA has served U.S. veterans from several wars beginning with survivors of World War I. It has continued the tradition of serving former military members by providing services for those veterans who need help readjusting to civilian life. Many of these veterans, especially those who saw combat during their time in the military, are in need of basic medical services for wounds suffered in conflicts. This was the original concept for the creation of the VA.\nSince that time, the VA has expanded greatly, and now provides additional services such as educational benefits, and home-buying assistance. It also helps those veterans who had become homeless after their service to their country ended. There are approximately 30 million military veterans living in the U.S. today. That number represents nearly 10 percent of the population of the country today."

I never understood why he stole the things he did. For example, that day he stole three key chains, five pairs of socks, and a t-shirt of a television show that he had never heard of.

        "content": "Driving in California, and in the rest of the United States, is a privilege. All states have a system in place to test a potential driver's knowledge and skill behind the wheel before issuing a driver's license. Some traffic laws can be tricky, but if drivers are well informed about the driving laws in the state, they can avoid getting ticketed.\nSome of the basic laws are easy to understand. Traffic signals, stop and yield signs, school zones, and crosswalks are all easily visible and are not complicated. For example, traffic signals use three colors, red, amber (yellow), and green. Red means to stop and green to go. Amber is used to notify drivers that the green light they are approaching is about to change to red. Whenever a driver sees an amber light in the distance, he or she should begin slowing down in anticipation of the red stop light. Arrows are also used to indicate direction. The same three colors are used with arrows, so there can be no confusion as to what to do when you see a directional signal.\nStop and yield signs are easy to follow, but school zones and crosswalks can be confusing. School zones generally mean to slow down, but this is only during school hours. The rest of the time, there are no additional speeding restrictions in a school zone. Crosswalks are important only when there are people using them, or about to use them. Drivers must slow down when a person is approaching a crosswalk.\nThe single most important thing to watch while driving is your speed. Going faster than the posted speed limit will almost always get you a ticket if you are seen by the police. So slow down, and pay attention to traffic signs and signals to avoid a ticket and fine."

The list of Jackson's peers in the industry is very short, to say the least. Jackson began his career in the early 1970s as the youngest member of the musical group The Jackson 5. Michael was the lead singer, and arguably the most talented of the five brothers who made up the band. He was born on August 29, 1958 as the eighth child of 10 in an African American family from Gary Indiana. The driving force behind the group's success was their father, Joseph \"Joe\" Jackson. The group was very popular in its time, but young Michael would go out on his own career soon after. He was a successful singer, songwriter, actor, dancer, and businessman, but his career was not without controversy.\nHis album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time. It was released in 1982, and was followed by a series of successful albums, films, music videos, and business ventures. In 1993 the first of several people came forward to accuse Jackson of sexually improper conduct on a child. This and other accusations would haunt Jackson throughout his adult life. Jackson also gained a reputation of strange behavior. One of the indelible images often associated with Jackson is when he held his newborn child over a hotel balcony to show it to his public.\nIt was rumored that Jackson bought the bones of the famous Elephant Man, slept in an oxygen tent, and that he altered his appearance to appear white. His photographs from his childhood and as a young adult show a very different Jackson. He married twice in his life including a brief marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of the equally great musician, Elvis Presley.\nJackson died on June 25, 2009, and even his death was not without controversy. His family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against his doctor, who was subsequently found guilty."

It has been an official federal holiday since 1894, meaning that government offices including post offices and schools are closed.\nIt is also widely thought that Labor Day was created as an alternative holiday to May Day. May Day, especially in the 1800s, had become a protest day, when workers marched to demand better rights and working conditions. There were often strikes that ended in violence. At the time, the U.S. government was afraid that May Day was being led by communists and was having a bad influence on workers. Some people feel September was also chosen since there are no other holidays between Fourth of July and Thanksgiving in November.\nOn Labor Day there are usually parades in major cities around the country. Politicians and labor leaders make speeches and hold press conferences. Labor Day is also considered the unofficial end of summer. Many people celebrate Labor Day with trips to the beaches, picnics, and barbecues. Many towns and cities host fireworks on this day. Many people also take their last summer vacations around this time. Labor Day is also the beginning of the professional and college football season in the U.S.\nLabor Day has also become an important retail holiday.

Since she lived hours away from the rest of the family, Mary thought the phone would be a good way for them to keep in touch and take up some of her time.\nUp until then, Julie had never really been interested in catching up with modern technology, but finally owning her own smartphone made her feel youthful, and she decided to join Facebook since that was what she had noticed all the younger people were doing. However, when making her profile page, she was embarrassed to put up a picture of herself since she thought she looked much too wrinkly and nobody would want to talk to her. To remedy this, she downloaded a picture of a beautiful 20-something year old from Google, posted it under her name, and went to sleep.\nThe next morning, Julie woke up and enthusiastically logged into Facebook in hopes that she would have one or two new friends. She could not believe her eyes. Her inbox was full of friend requests from dozens and dozens of young handsome men that were complimenting her beauty and wanted to know all about her. Julie decided to accept only the best-looking ones and began chatting with them day and night, never letting them know that they were actually talking to a grandma. The next time Julie met up with Mary, she thanked her so much for the phone and remarked, \"I haven't felt so young and pretty in years!\" Mary was confused and asked, \"Why?\" Julie just gave a mischievous smile and changed the topic."

        "content": "Abraham Lincoln is a name that is forever embedded into the collective conscience of every American. It is perhaps the most recognizable name in the history of the country even as his death occurred approximately 150 years ago. Lincoln presided over the country during, what is perhaps, the most divisive era in its history. Lincoln served as president for only four short years, but his impact on the country at the time, and today, has been huge.\nDuring his presidency, the United States was in the middle of a terrible civil war. At the center of the split between the two sides was slavery. The north was a fast-growing, industrial region that was more progressive than their southern counterpart. The southern economy was based on cotton production that mostly used forced labor. The north viewed this practice as unethical, and immoral, while southerners claimed it was an integral part of their culture. When Lincoln won the election, the southern states began to secede from the Union, and the war began.\nLincoln vowed to end slavery during his campaign for president, while never speaking about how the country would keep its relationship with the southern states when slavery was ended. This angered many southerners who promised to rebel if Lincoln won. The war lasted four years, and about 620,000 soldiers died. In what is considered the turning point of the war, Lincoln issued his famous Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. What it did was gain international favor from the world because of its ethical qualities. It put pressure on those countries doing business with the south to review their practices. It effectively put an end to the war. Lincoln was assassinated on April 15, 1865 by a southern sympathizer as he sat in a theater with his wife."

He was out on the road a lot, and he never really cared about keeping in touch with his kids. So, when he died, I figured all of his stuff at the cabin would be garbage. I told the town's Sheriff to throw everything out. I also told him to send me the paperwork for the cabin. I read about the discovery they made in my father's cabin. I couldn't believe it! Hendrix's guitar sold for over a million dollars, and so did the medallion.

Andrew decided to test his Spanish by introducing himself in Spanish to his girlfriend.\n\"Hola, mi nombre es Andrew,\" Andrew said with a smile on his face. He had said in perfect Spanish, \"Hello, my name is Andrew\". His girlfriend was impressed at his Spanish as they shared a conversation about the weather. Jose's lessons had paid off.\nAndrew realized that if he wished to keep progressing in learning Spanish, the best thing to do was to enroll in a Spanish course at the community college. That's exactly what he did the following day. Andrew asked some of his friends if they would like to learn Spanish with him at the community college. \"No, thank you,\" most of them said.

From a small seed in the soil, she grew flowers and herbs. This season, though, was a bust.\nShe began to do some research on the Internet on drought-resistant plants, which are plants that would do alright in full sun and without regular water. It turned out there were quite a few plants that were drought-resistant. Through her Internet search, Hannah even found a website for a place that was selling native plants, which were grown naturally from her climate.\nHannah laughed at the name though. It was called a nursery. Hannah always thought a nursery was a bedroom for a new-born baby or a very young child, not a place to buy plants. The more she thought about it though, the more it made sense. Going to a nursery was like going to get a baby. Except in this case, the baby was a plant she would bring home.\nHannah drove 30 minutes to get to the nursery, which had a whole section of drought-resistant plants. She walked up and down the outdoor aisles, carefully considering her options. Then she stopped in front of a small seedling that was just flowering. \"I found my baby,\" she thought."

As each pair took the stage one by one, Jenny grew more anxious. Carl noticed this from Jenny and told her, \"It'll be okay, Jenny. You are great, and I'm sure we'll win.\" Jenny felt better after hearing Carl's words. Soon, it was their turn to perform. They walked on stage and began to dance as soon as their song started to play.\nThey were off to a great start. Jenny's class was there cheering them on. The crowd began cheering them on as well. Suddenly, Jenny tripped and fell. The crowd was shocked. Carl managed to get Jenny back up on time for their big finale. Jenny was upset because of her fall.

Social media may become addicting.\nResearch shows that most people spend on average almost 4 hours a day on social networking sites. That's almost 30 hours a week. While some people need and use social media for work or to stay in touch with friends, other people find that using social media so much causes anxiety and stress. People also tend to use social media as a way to procrastinate. So just as many religions ask people to abstain, or not to have certain foods or drinks for a certain time, many people are taking social media fasts. They are not updating their statuses, and they are also not reading what other people are posting. They choose to stay away from social media for 30 days.\nIronically, the details of these fasts can be found on social networking sites all over the Internet. The reasons people undertake a fast are varied. Some people want to reconnect with their families or friends by disconnecting from their cell phones. Some people want to be more productive at work. What did some fasters do instead of logging on? Some decided to connect with friends by actually sitting down and having face-to-face conversations. If friends or loved ones were far away, they would call them on the telephone instead. Some even wrote handwritten postcards or letters. The results were mixed. Some people felt that not using social media made them more anxious. Others developed more positive habits like journaling or meditating."

One of the first instances where Maher questioned Catholicism was when his father stopped taking him and his sister when he was 13. He discovered his father was angry at the church because of their stance against birth control. His father has become an outspoken person against all organized religions ever since.\nMaher is currently the host of the HBO show \"Real Time with Bill Maher.\" It is a highly-rated, late night show that has received many Emmy nominations for excellence. It is a controversial show where emotions run high between Maher and his guests. Maher speaks his mind, and this has been a source of trouble over the years, but it has also earned him praise.\nIn 2001, Maher came under criticism for his comments about the terrorist attacks on the United States in September of that year. President George W. Bush had publicly called the attackers \"cowards,\" to which Maher took exception. Maher stated on his show that the real cowards were the Americans. \"We have been the cowards,\" said Maher. \"Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away; that's cowardly.\" He later said he was not criticizing the American military, but only pointing out that America plays a large role in Middle East politics.\nMaher has also made enemies among religious organizations. He says he dislikes religion, which he calls an unnecessary bureaucracy between people and God. He was once very liberal about every religion, but has changed his views on Islam saying he knows of no other religion that calls for the death of anyone who criticizes their religion. He has also called the Mormon church ridiculous."

A bride may want a blender, but she sure doesn't want to receive three and have to deal with the hassle of returning extras. Most bridal shower gifts are items that a newly married couple needs to start their life together. These gifts include dishes, pots, pans, and even appliances like toasters and microwave ovens.  Many brides also look forward to receiving some money. Cash or checks are considered appropriate gifts for a bridal shower. The money comes in handy to help pay for an expensive wedding. Sometimes people bring tasteless gifts like lingerie to bridal showers. Some people think those gifts are good because they help the new couple \"spice up\" their married life. Others find these types of presents embarrassing.\nWhile many bridal showers are surprises, others are planned with input from the bride-to-be. A bridal shower can be small and intimate and held in someone's home. It can also be a larger affair held at a restaurant or a catering hall. Sometimes snacks and desserts are served or a full meal can be offered. Traditionally bridal showers were women only affairs. However, more and more showers are no co-ed, with men and women. Traditionally men are not invited to bridal showers but now more showers include men and the groom-to-be. Like many parties in the U.S., there would be no dancing at the bridal shower, just eating and people chatting. Some bridal showers even have games."

Constantly consuming fast food is becoming a norm in American society and is resulting in millions of people suffering from obesity and diabetes for the rest of their lives. Instead of teaching children that it is okay to give in to the temptation of a quick greasy meal, parents should get their children into the habit of healthy eating everywhere they go.

Born on March 3, 1847, Bell was influenced greatly by his grandfather and father, who were both involved in work related to speech, and elocution. His greatest invention is the telephone, but ironically, he refused to have a phone in his work area. He felt phones were intrusive, and a nuisance.\nTragedy marked Bell's childhood as both of his brothers died from complications associated with tuberculosis. He came from a family of educators as his father was a university professor. His first invention was a simple corn de-husking machine he built for his childhood best friend. Bell also had other talents. He possessed a talent for music, and with no formal training, taught himself how to play the piano. He was also a ventriloquist, and entertained his friends with his curious talent.\nBecause of the booming economy in the United States, telegraph lines were being overwhelmed, and new lines had to be constructed to accommodate the traffic. The U.S. sought the help of inventors to design a line that could transmit several messages at once, which would be a marked improvement over the single transmission lines. Bell approached investors with his new idea, the telephone, and he acquired the financing needed for his work.\nOn March 10, 1876, Bell's invention was put to the test. The first words transmitted by phone were to his assistant. \"Mr. Watson - come here - I want to see you.\" Watson heard Bell's words clearly in the next room, and the telephone came into existence."

She won 39 Grand Slam Titles, 12 singles, 16 women's doubles, and 11 mixed doubles. She found success in just about every venue she participated in, including the Federation Cup Championships. King's greatest accomplishment, however, was an exhibition match that took place in Houston, Texas on September 20, 1973.\nThe 29-year-old King, who was at the top of her professional career at the time, faced a former Wimbledon Champion, Bobby Riggs. Riggs was one of the best men's players during his prime in the late 1930s and 40s. The 55-year-old Riggs challenged King to an exhibition match claiming that the women's game was far inferior to the men's game. He said that even a 55-year-old, \"washed-up\" former player could beat the top woman in the world. The stage was set for the match. However, it was not much of a match at all.\nKing soundly defeated Riggs without much trouble. The match was later exposed for what many people claimed it would be: a showcase for King to demonstrate that women could compete against men. The victory was part of the equal rights movement that was sweeping the nation during that time. King became an outspoken advocate of equal rights for women."

He had friends at school that knew how to skate, so he would go to their houses after school. As time went by, Brian got better and better at skating. He could do a lot of tricks on his skateboard, but what Brian really loved was jumping over stairs with his skateboard. His record was 15 stairs, but he wanted to beat that record. Brian and his friends went to the Hollywood 18, where a lot of skaters go to make skating videos.\nBrian knew that if he jumped over those stairs, he would become a legend with his friends. As he went up to the stairs, he started counting each stair one by one. He wanted to make sure they passed 15. On his first try, Brian jumped off his skateboard and landed on the grass next to the stairs. He wanted to try again, but he was scared. He finally got the nerve to try it again. This time he actually jumped over some stairs. Unfortunately, he didn't pass the 16th step in the staircase. He fell off his board, but he didn't get that hurt. Some girls were looking at Brian, and asked him if he could do it again. Brian knew he had to get it this time.\nAs Brian prepared for his jump, he kept looking at the girls that had gathered to see him. He was breathing heavy, but he knew he could do it. The time had arrived. Brian was ready to try it again. He pushed off the pavement, and started pedaling his skateboard faster and faster. He got to the top of the stairs and then he jumped. Brian was in the air for about 5 seconds and then he landed. The girls all applauded, and then Brian stopped his skateboard. He had done it. He beat his record. All the girls went up to give him a hug, but they all stayed away because he smelled. He started laughing. Everyone laughed and congratulated Brian."

        "content": "\"Go ahead, make my day\" is one of the most famous cinema lines ever spoken in the history of Hollywood. The actor was Clint Eastwood, and the film was 1983's Sudden Impact. Eastwood's words became an instant catchphrase that many Americans can recite to this day. Eastwood is quite possibly the epitome of the macho American man. He holds icon-like status among males for portraying the tough guy in nearly all his films.\nEastwood was born in 1930 in San Francisco before coming to Los Angeles at an early age. He briefly attended Los Angeles City College, but soon dropped out to pursue an acting career. After appearing in a couple of low-budget films, Eastwood got his big break in the old TV western Rawhide. His character Rowdy Yates was an instant celebrity, and it launched Eastwood's incredible career. Eastwood first burst onto the big screen with his roles in three western movies in the 1960s. The so-called Spaghetti Westerns, which were called that because of their ties to Italian cinema, were all very successful, and made Eastwood a household name.\nEastwood followed his success with a string of movies that is unparalleled in Hollywood history. He starred in the very popular Dirty Harry franchise, where he, once again, played the tough guy. In this series, Dirty Harry is a San Francisco police officer who takes matters into his own hands. This troubles his superiors to no end, but Harry always wins. This persona delighted the American movie audiences, especially the men.\nActing was not the only talent Eastwood would eventually display. He became an Oscar-winning director also. Arguably, his best film as a director was Million Dollar Baby, but it is hard to pick one film from his impressive list of movies. He is still active in film at the age of 74."

In order to successfully complete high school, students have to complete a series of core classes including math, English, science, history, a foreign language, and gym or physical education. Students usually can also choose to take electives, or specialized courses in a subject that interests them. Some high schools in the U.S. have exit exams that students are required to pass in addition to completing their courses in order to graduate and earn a high school diploma. A law called the No Child Left Behind Act requires high schools that get federal money to make students take a standardized exam every year. A high school diploma is required for students who want to continue on to college and is considered a minimum requirement for any jobs.\nHigh schools classes are designed to prepare students for college.

Some of these young people decided not to go to college after high school so that they could serve their country during that time of need. When they returned, many of them turned to the community college system in California to continue their education.\nThe United States government introduced the G.I. Bill at that time giving returning servicemen and women educational benefits to help them get back to school. Soon community colleges and new school districts began appearing throughout the country. Community colleges helped ease returning military personnel back into college life. It was a low cost, less stressful alternative to going back to a four-year university.\nToday, community colleges attract students from all parts of the world. In California, a large population of students comes from Asia and Latin America. These schools provide a second chance to international students who may have experienced difficulties attending college in their native countries. American students who may have not done well academically in high school, and did not enter a university, can turn to community college for a second chance, too.\nCommunity colleges provide a much-needed resource for all these students. Former military personnel, international students, and high school students alike, are all welcome. One of the best things about community colleges is that they accept anyone at anytime. This means people who have not found what they want to do in life can try more than one area of study. If they don't like one course of study, they can always try something else.

His lifes work was to bring South Africa into mainstream 20th Century thinking by ending Apartheid.\nApartheid was a system of South African government that was based on racial segregation between the minority white population and black South Africans. It was a controversial form of government that was in effect from 1948 to 1994, and caused great social turmoil. The system was put into place following World War II, but racial segregation began much earlier in the country. Apartheid separated South Africans by race by placing people into four classifications: white, black, coloured, and Indian. Each group had different levels of privilege, with white South Africans being the most favored.\nFrom 1960 to 1983, 3.5 million black South Africans were forcibly removed from their homes; in 1970, all non-white politicians were removed from government. Mandelas move to end Apartheid began in 1949 when he supported, and organized non-violent boycotts, strikes, and civil disobedience. He was arrested, and charged with treason in 1956 for his role in the social uprising, and was eventually jailed for 27 years. During this time, most of the countries in the world called for his release, and placed trade embargos against the white regime.\nThe country finally gave in to international pressure, and released Mandela.

The surprise attack was intended to destroy the American Pacific Fleet that stood in the way of Japan's complete domination of the Pacific Ocean during the 1940s. The attack was coordinated with attacks in the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Pearl Harbor was attacked by more than 350 Japanese airplane fighters, bombers and torpedo planes that were launched from six aircraft carriers.\nThe early-morning attack sank four U.S. battleships, and four more were heavily damaged. Six of the eight battleships were restored, and returned to service, but the Japanese also destroyed, or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, a minelayer, and an anti-aircraft training ship. In addition, 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed, with many of them on the ground. The attack was devastating. It took the U.S. years to recover from all the damage caused on that fateful morning. However, the Japanese were unable to destroy their main targets, the Navy's aircraft carriers. By what some call a stroke of luck, the U.S. carrier fleet was out to sea at the time of the attack.\nThe country was in shock at the news of the disaster. U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt called the attack cowardly, and declared December 7th as \"A day that will live in infamy.\" On December 8, the United States formally declared war on Japan. This plummeted the country into World War II, which Roosevelt had long hoped to avoid. Soon after the United States' declaration of war against Japan, Germany, which was a Japanese ally, declared war on the U.S. and the country was now fully involved in the greatest war in the history of the world."

        "content": "Taxes are special fees charged by a government on the people who live in a country, state or city. These fees help pay for public services like police, road and bridge repair, and public schools. In the United States people have to pay national, state, and local taxes. Income tax is a tax applied to how much money a person earns in a year. There are both federal and state income taxes. These have to be paid every year by April 15th. There are special forms the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the government agency in charge of collecting taxes, asks people to fill out. There are tax credits that people with low income, college students, and parents can get. These credits could mean actually getting money back from the government. This money is called a tax refund. People can get both a federal and state tax refund. Anyone who works has to be taxed regardless of the immigration status. Not paying income taxes could mean a fine or even jail time.\nPayroll taxes are taxes that are taken right out of a person's paycheck. There are federal and state payroll taxes. These include Social Security and Medicare taxes. Social Security taxes pay for the retirement and disability benefits received by millions of Americans each year. Medicare taxes pay for the federal health insurance program that covers the elderly and the disabled.\nPeople who own houses pay property taxes. The amount paid depends on how much the property is worth. This tax is usually paid once a year. Sales tax is a tax almost everyone pays. Sales tax is a specific extra percentage charged on nearly all purchases. Everything from soap to furniture has a sales tax attached when bought. The amount of the sales tax is different across states and cities."

The cancer had spread to her brain and there was no treatment that would cure her. \"I'll keep taking care of you,\" Millie told her sister. Millie and Arlene were both in their 50s, but Millie was 5 years older than Arlene. Arlene would always be Millie's little sister. Throughout Arlene's illness, Millie took care of things. Millie went with Arlene to all of her appointments. Millie went to all of Arlene's chemotherapy and radiation treatments. When Arlene lost her hair because of the chemo, Millie helped her pick a natural-looking wig. Arlene was appreciative, but also felt bad. Millie had a family of her own to take care of, and yet she spent most of her time taking care of Arlene.\nArlene told Millie she wanted to be put in a hospice. Millie did not know what that was. Arlene's doctor gave the sisters some brochures. The brochures explained that hospice care would try to make Arlene as comfortable as possible by providing pain management. They also focused on the emotional health of patients and their families by providing counseling. Millie was reluctant to place Arlene in hospice. Millie felt like she was abandoning her baby sister. Arlene insisted though.\n\"It's about time someone else wait on me hand and foot,\" Arlene joked. Millie went with Arlene to check into the hospice. Not only did the staff take care of Arlene, they also had activities for Millie, a member of the family. The staff told Millie that she could even spend the night here when she wanted. They asked Arlene what some of her favorite foods were so their chef could make what she liked. Arlene felt comfortable in the hospice."

Julia appreciated that she was able to participate in this holiday that recalls the Pilgrims' first harvest after arriving from England a long time ago.\nJulia's phone rang at four in the morning. It was Elizabeth. Elizabeth invited Julia to go shopping with her. \"We are going to the stores so early?\" Julia asked sleepily. Elizabeth explained that the day after Thanksgiving in the United States was called Black Friday. Stores, which held special sales, started very early. \"It's the official start of the holiday shopping season,\" Elizabeth explained.\nJulia and Elizabeth were outside the local shopping center by five in the morning. Julia was surprised to see that not only were all the stores open, but they were crowded. Elizabeth told Julia that this was nothing. Some people camped outside the mall all night so that they could be among the first to enter and get extra special deals called \"door busters\". Many times these \"door busters\" were electronic items at extremely reduced prices. Often only a small number of these items are made available. Sometimes they are only available to the first 100 people in line.\nJulia thought it sounded violent and wondered aloud if people really broke down doors to get into the store. \"Sometimes there is a lot of pushing,\" Elizabeth explained. Some people have even been hurt, or killed, because of physical fights over limited products. At 5 a.m. though, the door busters were gone and the cash registers had long lines. Many shoppers had full shopping carts of presents they intended to give away for Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa."

Jacquelyn always put a cup with water next to her bed, so that if she got thirsty during the night she didn't have to walk all the way to the kitchen. That was when it happened. The furniture started shaking, and the cup of water fell to the floor. Scruffy started barking and it woke up Jacquelyn. She looked around and saw that all her stuff was shaking. She started screaming. Soon after, her father came in and told her to come out quick.\nIt was an earthquake. Jacquelyn was so scared, and couldn't move. Her father went in and picked her up. He took her outside, where Jacquelyn's mother and brother were at already. Jacquelyn and her brother were crying. They didn't understand what was happening.\nLuckily, Jacquelyn's mother had prepared an emergency kit and had it outside. She looked for the key, which was hidden inside a fake rock, and unlocked the box. She pulled out blankets to keep her children warm. Jacquelyn looked at her mother and took the blanket. She then saw her dad take a flashlight from the box. He used the flashlight to see if the house had any damage. The father knew the house was not safe, so they stayed up until someone could examine the house.\nThe children didn't have school due to the earthquake, so they spent the day with their parents. Jacquelyn was so proud of her parents, because they knew what to do during this disaster. She talked to her friends, and they weren't so lucky. Jacquelyn went up to her mother and father and hugged them, because she knew she felt the protection of her parents."

It is normal to run several errands to multiple locations during any given day and most people do this in their own private vehicle. Individuals who have infant children must use child safety seats wherever they go with their kids. It is not only a good idea, but also required by law.\nIn California, children under 2 years of age must ride in a rear-facing car seat in the back seat unless that child weighs more that 40 pounds, or is more than 40 inches tall. If a child exceeds this height and weight requirement, he or she must then be secured in a car seat, or booster seat until the age of 8. Again, these seats must be placed in the back seat of a car. It isn't until a child is 8 years old, or has reached 4'9\" in height that he or she can ride using only an adult seatbelt. It is mandatory that passengers over the age of 16 must wear adult seat belts.\nIt is further recommended that a child should be kept in a car seat or booster seat for as long as possible. Even though it may sound like a good idea to move a child from a smaller car seat to a larger one, the California Highway Patrol advises to keep your child in a car seat for as long as the manufacturer recommends it. In other words, if a child seat manufacturer places a limit on how large a child can be to use a particular seat, then parents should keep their children in those seats until they reach that limit. It's all about child safety."

While Memorial Day remembers those who have died while serving in any of the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces -- Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard, Veterans Day honors all members of the armed forces, especially the living. As a U.S. federal holiday, government offices and schools are closed, and most people have the day off from work. Banks are also closed. If November 11th falls on a Sunday, then the holiday is observed on the following Monday.\nThe holiday was first observed after World War I, which ended On November 11 1918. It was called Armistice Day then and was more about celebrating the absence of war and honoring those that served in that one war. It didn't become known as Veterans Day until 1954 after World War II and the Korean War, when there were many more members of the armed forces.\nMany restaurants offer free meals to veterans on the date. There is always a special ceremony at Arlington National Military Cemetery in Washington D.C. This ceremony involves a wreath being placed over the grave of The Unknown Soldier. Many major cities also hold parades on this date. The U.S. flag is usually flown at half-mast as a remembrance to those soldiers who have died and many ceremonies observe a moment of silence for the same reason. In Canada the holiday is called Remembrance Day. One symbol of the day is the poppy flower. The red poppy flower is said to represent or be a symbol of the blood of soldiers. Many people wear or give out poppy flowers on the day."

Not everyone comes from the same region, or have the same background that you do. It is important to know that different people may react differently about the same set of circumstances. This is not only true about your co-workers, but maybe even the management of the company you work for. Management styles vary from person to person. Some managers may want to micro-manage everything you do, while others may take a more casual stance on supervision.\nAn example of this could be the way managers react to tardiness. Some managers may not be bothered if you are a few minutes late to work, while others may become very angry if you are even a minute late to work. You must know what your manager is looking for from you. If you know your manager does not tolerate tardiness, come into work a little early to avoid angering him or her. Leaving your home a few minutes early can be helpful in case there is a situation that may make you late.\nGetting along with your co-workers is also very important. Try to find common ground between you and a co-worker. You may even be surprised that some of your co-workers have the same interests that you enjoy. It is always easier to work with someone that you have some connection with. Of course, you may find yourself working with someone that is difficult to get along with, but that does not mean you cannot work well together. It just may take both of you a little bit of effort. Communication is key in these types of situations. If your co-worker understands you, then working together may be easier."

Jessica was five years old now, but still was not speaking in complete sentences. Jessica would not be attending a regular kindergarten in a regular school. Instead, she would be attending kindergarten in a special education school.\nWhile this bothered Emma at first, she soon learned to appreciate the school. Jessica had a specialized learning plan called an Individualized Education Plan or IEP. This plan set up specific goals for Jessica, like learning how to feed herself. Jessica also received a lot of individual attention. Instead of her being in a classroom with 20 students, there were only 8 students in her class. All of these students also were delayed like Jessica. In addition, the class had two teacher's assistants to help the classroom teacher.\nThe special education school also scheduled speech therapy sessions for Jessica. Once a day a specialist would come in and work with Jessica to help her practice learning how to move her mouth and tongue and ask for what she needed and wanted. An occupational therapist helped Jessica learn to feed herself and other age appropriate self-sufficiency skills. A physical therapist also came in to help Jessica.\nEmma may have been embarrassed at first that her daughter was in a special education school, but after a year, Emma realized it was the best thing for her. While Jessica still was a little behind other kids of her age, at the end of kindergarten, she was able to attend a non-special education school."

It can get into the low 40s at night in Pasadena during the winter, so many people dress warm for the occasion. Food is another big feature at the pre-parade celebration on New Year's Eve. People bring their portable grills to cook their favorite outdoor meals right on the sidewalk. The rich aroma of the grilling food fills the night air, and most people are willing to share their food with other overnight campers. It is fun to sample different dishes from other grillers.\nAs night turns into morning, there is still electricity in the air. People are excited about the start of the parade, which begins at 8 a.m. sharp. The floats are beautifully decorated in flowers, while the dancers and other performers dress in colorful costumes, some of which are made just for the parade. The marching bands come from nearby cities, high schools, and colleges. It is considered a great honor to participate in the Rose Parade."

There were three major TV networks at the time: NBC, CBS, and ABC. All these networks still exist, but have been joined with several other TV viewing options over the years. One of the first alternatives for television viewing is cable TV. It has been in existence for quite some time. Cable TV served much of the country's rural areas during the time the networks ruled TV. Network TV is broadcast through airwaves, and private homes receive the broadcast using an antenna affixed on the home's roof. Cable TV is a system where the cable company used cable to link several homes together to receive broadcast signals from a central antenna.\nCable TV offered more than network channels did. Soon the demand for cable TV grew in populated areas. Cable TV was allowed to show more graphic content also, which was attractive to some viewers who did not agree with the censorship network TV was subjected to. Needless to say, cable TV became quite popular because it offered more channels than over-the-air broadcast TV. Some of these channels were designed to attract specific audiences such as sports, movies, and uncensored TV fans. Soon cable TV was in nearly all the homes in the United States.\nFollowing the popularity of cable TV, satellite television came onto the scene. It offered multiple channels, just like cable, but was delivered via orbiting satellites making it possible to view live programming from virtually any part of the world. Today, streaming services are popular. These services offer TV content through Wi-Fi connections, which costs substantially less than either cable or satellite service. All that needed is a device and a good Wi-Fi connection."

William was working as a manager for a very busy chemical distribution company at the time. In order to keep up with his work, he sometimes had to work at night, or go in on weekends to catch up with his paperwork.\nWilliam was a sensible man. He was not the type of person that would fly off the handle in troubling situations. He was always very calm, and composed. This is what made his story believable. I knew he wasn't the type to make things up.\nOne night, William went to work after dark and thought nothing of it. His former manager had told him that he might hear some weird noises coming from the warehouse, but it was only the 55-gallon drums expanding and contracting. During the heat of the day, the drums would expand, and at night, when it cooled off, the drums would contract, sometimes making a sound. William was not worried.\nThat night he was sitting at his desk when he heard what sounded like someone knocking on the door leading to the warehouse. William dismissed it as a drum \"popping,\" and ignored it. A few moments later, the sound was back, and this time it was louder. Since there was no one else in the building, he became a bit nervous, but continued working. Soon the noises got louder and louder. The final straw was when he heard someone walking above the ceiling of his office. This scared him quite a bit, but again he ignored it. Finally, it happened again, and this time William ran into the warehouse to look above his office, but no one was there. After that, William never worked at night again."

The main cause was Southern states feeling that the U.S. federal government in Washington D.C. should not have the power to tell them what to do. This was especially true about two issues, taxes and slavery. The Southern economy was based on agriculture while the Northern economy was based on manufacturing. Southern crops  like cotton were sold to factories and then Southerners had to pay taxes on the finished goods sold back to them like clothing. Many Southerners felt this was unfair. Additionally the agricultural economy in the south was reliant on the labor of enslaved Africans and their descendants. Many people, especially from the North, felt this was wrong and that slavery needed to be abolished. Southerners felt the abolitionists were threatening their way of life. Seven Southern slave states, banded together, declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America. The government in Washington D.C. and its army was known as the Union, since they were fighting to keep the country united.\nAbraham Lincoln was president of the United States during the Civil War. The President of the Confederate States was Jefferson Davis. The first battle was the Battle of Fort Sumter. During the war President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate States of America. This action was supposed to show that Lincoln was still in charge of the entire United States.\nThe Civil War was the bloodiest war fought inside the United States. 620,000 were killed and millions more were injured. One of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War was the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. 51,000 people from both sides died, more than in any other battle. The Civil War ended in 1865 when General Robert E. Lee of the Confederate Army surrendered."

Frank had gotten out of work in Downtown Los Angeles around 11 p.m. He got his sweater, put his headphones on to listen to music, and put his backpack on. Frank liked taking his backpack to work, because he could take a change of clothes to work, so that he didn't have to wear his uniform after he got out. In order to get to his house, Frank had to take a bus and a train, but he didn't mind because he could listen to music.\nAfter getting off the train, Frank got something to eat at a little restaurant that stayed open late and served hamburgers. After eating, Frank still had to walk for 30 minutes. While Frank was walking through a small street with a lot of homes, he noticed there was a car behind him following him slowly. He looked back and noticed it was a police car. He didn't mind because he wasn't doing anything illegal, so he kept walking.\nAs Frank was about to get home, the police car turned on the lights and drove directly to where Frank was at. They stopped and got out of the car. The two police officers surrounded Frank. Frank was used to this, and put his hands in the air. The police officers told him to put his hands on the hood, which he did.\nAs Frank was being searched, he asked the police officers why he was being searched. They ignored him and asked him questions. \"Do you have anything illegal on you? Have you been arrested before? Do you have a weapon?\" Frank answered \"no,\" to all of their questions. They put Frank in the back of the police car. Frank asked again, why he was being searched. One officer said, \"Because you are walking around the neighborhood with a hooded sweatshirt.\" Frank had done nothing wrong, so the police let him go after searching his backpack."

This is where two or more families get together at someone's home to have dinner, and refreshments, and then play games. This is an activity where almost anyone can play. Most board games can be played by children as young as 6, or 7 years old. It is fun for the kids to test their skills against their older brothers and sisters, or their parents. One of the oldest and most popular board games is Monopoly. It is a game where all players start in the same place, and roll dice to advance from square to square.\nLittle Johnny wanted to join the game one night, and asked his parents if he could play. \"Please, mommy. Please let me play with you tonight,\" he pleaded. His mom thought about it for a while, and said, \"Okay, Johnny. Tonight you can play.\" She really didn't think he was going to be able to play the game, but to her surprise, he was very good at it. The object of the game is to bankrupt your opponents and have most money at the end of the game. You buy properties with money collected by moving around the board. The more money you have in your bank, the more property you can buy.\nJohnny landed on the Boardwalk square, which is a very prized property. It is the most expensive property, but Johnny knew its value and bought it. The square is positioned at the end of the game where everyone collects $200, but if you land on it, you have to pay a high rent. Johnny bought a couple of nearby properties too, and before long, he was collecting rent from all the other players. Johnny ended up winning the game, which made him very happy, and it also made his mom very proud of him. Johnny showed her and everyone else what he was capable of."

One day the artist was going to start working on a new sculpture, but didn't have the necessary tools to start. He went downtown and saw a poor homeless man. Because the artist was new in town and got lost, he asked the homeless man where the nearest art supply store was. The homeless man told him that it was the red and white building around the corner. The artist looked at him and said thank you. He gave the homeless man a ten-dollar bill with the words \"pass it forward\" written on the bill. The homeless man took the money and said: \"God bless you!\"\nA few hours had passed, and the homeless man started getting hungry. He walked around in town, and saw a young musician playing outside a caf. The homeless man sat down and started listening to the music played by the musician. A waiter from the caf came out and told the homeless man that he had to leave, because he wasn't buying anything, and other people wanted to sit down and enjoy the music. The musician saw this and told the waiter to leave him alone and that he would like to buy the homeless man something to eat. The waiter looked at the musician and said okay. The homeless man thanked the musician. After he finished eating, he took out the ten-dollar bill and gave it to the musician. The homeless man left.\nAfter the musician had finished playing at the caf, he decided to go to a local art festival with his girlfriend. As they were walking around and looking at all the different paintings and sculptures, the musician's girlfriend saw a sculpture she liked. It was a young man helping out an older man who had fallen down. She wanted to buy it, but didn't have enough money. The musician told her not to worry. He pulled out ten dollars, and gave it to the artist. As the musician and his girlfriend walked away, the artist looked at the ten-dollar bill, and smiled. \"Well, look at that, you found your way back home,\" said the artist."

Food trucks were a matter of convenience, and usually offered inexpensive meals. At lunchtime in cities across the United States, workers lined up to order a sandwich and a canned soda. The meal rarely cost more than five dollars. They took their food and ate as they walked. Some workers would take their food back to their offices and eat in the company lunchroom or at their desks.\nFood trucks have come a long way. They are no longer thought of as just fast food on wheels. Now food trucks are considered a gourmet dining experience. There are food trucks selling cuisine from all over the world. There are Korean barbecue food trucks and food trucks that sell lobster rolls. There are even food trucks that specialize in desserts. These dessert food trucks sell more than just ice-cream cones. They sell cakes and pies. There're even cupcake trucks.\nFood trucks have become so popular that many use social media to reach customers and create a fan base. Some food trucks use Twitter to let customers know what their menu for the day. Other food trucks use Facebook to let customers know on what corner they will be parked.\nThese clean food trucks, with their gourmet food and large fan base, are not a bargain anymore though. Rarely can you get a meal from a food truck for less than ten dollars. Some people think the price is worth the quality. Others just bring sandwiches from home."

Those living in the colonies were especially angry about taxes the British were forcing them to pay. People felt taxes were unfair because there was no colonial representation in the British parliament. One tax was the stamp tax, which taxed printed materials such as newspapers. The colonists called this \"taxation without representation\". Colonists who wanted freedom from English rule were known as Patriots. Those who supported British rule were known as Loyalists. Before full scale war broke out, there were many acts of protest by patriots, like the Boston Tea Party when Bostonians boarded British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into the harbor because of a tea tax. On April 19 the first shots were fired in Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts, which officially started the war.\nMany people were involved in the struggle for independence. Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams worked together to write the Declaration of Independence. On July 4, 1776, patriots declared themselves free. Most people know George Washington was the first president of the United States. Before that he was the commander-in-chief of the patriot army. Most of the battles in the American Revolution were fought in the northeast in places near Boston, and New York.\nThe British, known as redcoats because of their red uniform jackets, had help from German mercenary soldiers called Hessians. Patriots had support from other Europeans. France entered the American Revolution on the side of the colonists in 1778. This helped force the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1779. However, fighting would not formally end until 1783 with the Treaty of Paris when Great Britain recognized the United States as an independent nation."

I asked my mom for permission, and she said yes.\nWhen we got to the mall, Joe wanted to get something to eat, so we went to McDonald's. We got two hamburgers and two sodas, and then we went walking around the mall. For some reason, Joe always liked stealing things from the stores at the mall. I never understood why he stole the things he did. For example, that day he stole three key chains, five pairs of socks, and a t-shirt of a television show that he had never heard of. Joe always said the same thing when he got out of the store, \"I love the rush of stealing!\" I always looked at him, shook my head, and called him an idiot.\nThe worst was yet to come. When we were leaving the mall to go catch the bus, a security guard grabbed Joe and me by the shoulders and told us we couldn't leave. The security guard took us to his office, and called our parents. I was worried because I knew my dad would yell at me. Joe, on the other hand, was laughing and was telling me jokes.

It is one of the steps young people take to develop into adulthood. This is a wondrous time full of excitement and expectations. One of the most attractive things about learning to drive is the freedom that comes from operating a vehicle.\nOnce people are able to drive a vehicle, they can go anywhere in the city and beyond. In Southern California, the region was planned and built in a spread-out fashion with miles and miles of freeway access. A new driver no longer needs to rely on others to go somewhere. He or she is now free to go out on their own.\nWhen Michael Allen first learned to drive, he was so excited. He was 16 years old, which in California means he can get a driver's permit. After six months with a permit, he could have a license to drive. Michael had been pestering his father to teach him how to drive for months and now came the big day. His father Edward was a big strong man, who insisted on teaching Michael on a standard transmission car. That meant Michael had to learn how to operate a clutch and gear shifter, which is not easy.\nThe two began their lessons. Edward was a difficult task-master, and Michael was having great difficulty at first. \"Let the clutch out slowly,\" Edward began yelling every time Michael didn't do it correctly. \"Ease it through. You can do it,\" said Edward to his son. \"I'm trying, dad. I'm trying,\" said Michael. It was not pleasant at first, but soon Michael was driving up and down the block. He was very pleased, and so was his dad. Michael was now a driver."

Baseball seemed like the perfect sport for Johnny to learn to play since it is nicknamed America's Pastime.\nEmma took her son to the tryouts after school. \"I'm sorry,\" one of the coaches told Emma. \"Johnny was too young to try out for baseball. Since he was six years old, he could try out for T-ball, though.\"\nT-ball is similar to baseball except that there is no pitcher. Instead the ball is placed on a stand called a \"T\" because of its shape. This makes it easier for younger kids to hit. T-ball games are also shorter than regular baseball games. Regular baseball games last nine innings. Emma couldn't imagine her son standing still for nine minutes.\nT-ball sounded like a good way to introduce her son to the responsibilities of being on a sports team and the rules of baseball. Emma had to bring Johnny back on a different day to try out for T-ball. When she did, he was put on a team. After paying a fee, Johnny was given a uniform. Johnny looked at the back of his uniform. \"Hey, look! Mom. I'm number one!\" he said proudly.\nOnce Johnny started playing though, it was clear to Emma that he was not very good at baseball. He stuck with it though, and his team ended the season in fourth place. There were only four teams in the T-ball league. \"Can I play again next season,\" Johnny asked his mom. \"Yes, but see if you can get another number,\" she told him."

Being proactive means that you actively seek out things to do that can improve your work situation. It might be something like tidying up your workstation. Do not wait until your boss tells you to clean up. Do it on your own if you see your workstation is messy. Another way to be proactive is to make suggestions on how to better do the tasks you are assigned. Finding new ways to help the company become more efficient will always get you noticed by your employer.\nSay, for instance, you are in charge of invoicing your customers' orders, but there is always a delay between when the products or services are delivered and when you get your paperwork for invoicing. Maybe the paperwork gets hung up in accounting, or in shipping and receiving. Who knows? If you have a suggestion that improves the flow of paperwork, then suggest it to your boss.

He is a political activist, and a social critic. His films have a way of eliciting strong emotional responses.\nMoore was born in Flint, Michigan in 1954. His father was an assembly-line worker at the General Motors, an automobile-manufacturing plant; his mother was a secretary. He attended the University of Michigan, Flint campus, where he dropped out after his first year. He found work as a journalist with a couple of different local publications, but was fired from one of his jobs because of a controversy. Moore wanted to run a story about American involvement in Nicaragua, but his editors refused, which led to his dismissal. He was awarded $58,000 in an out-of-court settlement after he sued his employers.\nMoore used the money to start making documentaries. His first was \"Roger & Me,\" which was a piece designed to expose GM's closure of the Flint plant and its decision to open a plant in Mexico, where wages were much lower. His film exposes the greed corporations like GM cutting off the lifeline of many American workers so that GM could make more profit. GM had reported record profits before the closure, which irritated Moore greatly.\nHe followed this film with a string of documentaries that touched on many of the social and political problems Americans face daily. His film \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" probes the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. He is not kind to the George W.

He graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and majored in psychology. After serving two years in the United States Military, he began working as a copy editor at Esquire magazine in the early 50s. Hefner quit his job to go out on his own. He was determined to start a magazine that was similar to Esquire, a men's magazine. His first \"Playboy\" was published from his home in 1953, without a publication date. He did this because he was uncertain if there would be a second edition.\nHefner had purchased a nude picture of the famous actress, Marilyn Monroe, and used that image as the centerfold of his first issue. The 50,000 copies sold quickly, and Hefner became an instant success story. During the 60s, Hefner and Playboy were at the top of their popularity. His circulation was now in the millions, and Hefner ventured into new areas for his company. He produced films, started modeling agencies, built hotels and resorts, and hosted two television series.

Of course that was an exaggeration, but it turned out we were pretty good for a bunch of novices.\nThe three of us began meeting at my place every week to practice playing together and to bounce song ideas off each other. Bobby could actually sing. With Rudy and me putting in all those hours of practice, we got pretty good. We got so good that we played at a couple of parties and at a free Concert in the Park festival about a year later. That was as far as we got though. Rudy joined the Army the following year.

The site was very popular, but it was shut down by the school for being inappropriate.\nDuring his sophomore year at Harvard, Zuckerberg began working on Facebook, a site that allowed its users to create a profile, share photos, and communicate with other members. He dropped out his sophomore year to dedicate his work to his site. He moved his operation to Palo Alto, California. By the end of 2004, Facebook had had more than 1,000,000 members.\nZuckerberg's rise to the top has not been without controversy.

While Julie tried to feed the injured bird bits of moist bread, Julie's mom looked online for local animal rescue organizations. She felt silly trying to save a pigeon though. Finally she found an organization that would take the bird, but not until the next morning. Julie stayed up all night watching the bird.\nThe next morning Julia and her mother took the subway to the bird rescue organization. Many people on the train gave Julie and her mother strange looks. Julie's mother just shrugged. When they got to the rescue organization, Julie told the worker, \"Please take good care of Sebastian\"."

        "content": "One of the main reasons for California's beauty is the tectonic plate movement beneath the surface of the state. This movement is responsible for some of California's breathtaking mountain ranges and deep valleys. California is part of a large area of land called the Ring of Fire that surrounds the Pacific Ocean. It is a hotbed of volcanic activity and earthquakes.\nCalifornia has had its share of earthquakes over the years. The most famous was the Great San Francisco earthquake of 1906. The city was completely unprepared for an earthquake of this magnitude. The quake was estimated to measure 7.8 on the Richter scale. More than 80 percent of the city was destroyed, and an estimated 3,000 people lost their lives.\nSan Francisco was again hit by a large earthquake in October 1989. The Loma Prieta quake measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, and occurred during the World Series, an annual championship series of baseball. Although the loss of life was minimal compared with other quakes, it had a profound effect on the transportation system in the city.\nSouthern California has suffered its share of quakes also. In 1971, the region was hit  in Sylmar, just north of Los Angeles; in 1994, the area was devastated in the Northridge quake.  Other smaller, but none-the-less frightening, and dangerous quakes have plagued both regions.\nBecause of these disasters, building codes have improved greatly. This has helped minimize the number of deaths suffered from these quakes. Furthermore, engineers are constantly at work to improve buildings. Americans have the ability, knowledge, and determination to survive and thrive in the face of danger."

It was just a normal Thursday night in the middle of June. \"Why would there be fireworks now?\" Betty asked.\nBetty and her husband just moved into a new house after their wedding. This was the neighborhood her husband grew up in. He said it was common for people to start setting off fireworks in the summer, even before the Independence Day holiday. \"The whole summer is a reason for fireworks here,\" Betty's husband told her. He said that even when it wasn't summer, people set off fireworks for whatever they were celebrating.\n\"Maybe someone is having a graduation party or a birthday,\" Betty's husband told her. He said that sometimes people set off fireworks even when a local sports team won a game. Betty wondered how that was legal. She thought fireworks were illegal to buy and use. Betty's husband told her that it was easy enough for people to buy fireworks. He also told her that different counties in the state had different laws, so people could buy fireworks in one county and use them in a different county, like where they lived. \"Also people can legally set off fireworks for holidays besides the fourth of July, like for Lunar New Year,\" he added.\nBetty tried to go back to sleep, but the loud booms and crackles kept going. She decided to get a glass of water and go out into the yard to see the fireworks."

        "content": "Health insurance is one way to pay for health care. Health care includes visits to the doctor, prescription medication, and emergency services. People can pay for medicine and doctor visits directly in cash or they can use health insurance. Health insurance usually means you pay less for these services. There are different types of health insurance. At some jobs, companies offer health insurance plans as part of a benefits package. Individuals can also buy health insurance. The elderly, and disabled can get government-run health insurance through programs like Medicaid and Medicare. There are many different health insurance companies or plans. Each health plan has a set of doctors they work with. Once a person picks a plan, they pay a premium, which is a fixed amount of money every month. Once in a plan, a person picks a doctor they want to see from that plan. That doctor is the person's primary care provider.\nObamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, is a recently passed law that makes it easier for people to get health insurance. The law requires all Americans have health insurance by 2014. Those that do not get health insurance by the end of the year will have to pay a fine in the form of an extra tax when they file their income taxes. Through Obamacare, people can still get insurance through their jobs, privately, or through Medicaid and Medicare. They can also buy health insurance through state marketplaces, where people can get help choosing a plan based on their income and health care needs. These marketplaces also create an easy way to compare what different plans offer. If people cannot afford to buy health insurance, they may qualify for government programs that offer free health insurance like Medicaid, Medicare or for children, a special program called the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)."

During a practice session for the 1994 United States Figure Skating Championships, Harding and her ex-husband hired her husband's friend to physically assault Kerrigan. The attack was intended to improve Harding's chances to make the Olympic team, which she did. The plan was to break Kerrigan's leg, but was not successful. Kerrigan only suffered severe bruising. She was also part of the Olympic team in Lillehammer, Norway.\nWhen it was discovered that Harding was behind the attack, a media frenzy ensued. Kerrigan was on the cover of both Time, and Newsweek in January 1994. The media descended onto the Olympic city in great numbers, and the video of the competition became one of the most watched shows in American history. The following month, Harding's husband cooperated with authorities by testifying against Harding and her co-conspirators in a plea-bargaining agreement. Harding was banned from competing for life by the United States Figure Skating Association after pleading guilty for her part of the attack on March 16, 1994. By pleading guilty, she was able to avoid a jail sentence.\nHarding remained in the American limelight for several years following the incident. Her ex-husband released a wedding sex video of Harding and himself. Some of those images were published by Penthouse Magazine. She competed in a Fox TV network broadcast of Celebrity Boxing in 2002. She went on to try a professional boxing career the following year, but with little success. Kerrigan, on the other hand, fell out of the American culture scene, never to be heard of again."

Because the artist was new in town and got lost, he asked the homeless man where the nearest art supply store was. The homeless man told him that it was the red and white building around the corner.

He walked around in town, and saw a young musician playing outside a caf. The homeless man sat down and started listening to the music played by the musician. A waiter from the caf came out and told the homeless man that he had to leave, because he wasn't buying anything, and other people wanted to sit down and enjoy the music. The musician saw this and told the waiter to leave him alone and that he would like to buy the homeless man something to eat. The waiter looked at the musician and said okay. The homeless man thanked the musician. After he finished eating, he took out the ten-dollar bill and gave it to the musician. The homeless man left.\nAfter the musician had finished playing at the caf, he decided to go to a local art festival with his girlfriend. As they were walking around and looking at all the different paintings and sculptures, the musician's girlfriend saw a sculpture she liked. It was a young man helping out an older man who had fallen down. She wanted to buy it, but didn't have enough money. The musician told her not to worry. He pulled out ten dollars, and gave it to the artist.

However, her road to richness was not all completely smooth. Her story reminds us that in order to win the lottery, there are two crucial requirements. The first and most obvious necessity is a lot of luck. The second requirement is just as important, but much less often mentioned -- getting organized.\nAstrid's story began when getting in line for a lottery ticket at her local supermarket. The woman ahead of her decided to let her cut in front of her to pay. This woman was also planning on buying a lottery ticket. Had she not given Astrid her spot in the line, the lottery money would have been hers!\nOn the day that the winners were announced, Astrid realized she had won, she could not contain her excitement. She danced with joy all around her house and jumped on the phone to tell her closest relatives what had just happened. The next morning Astrid woke up and prepared to go claim her prize money, but suddenly realized that she could not remember where she had placed her ticket. Given that her memory was no longer as sharp as it used to be, she searched and searched around her messy house for hours to no avail. She had absolutely no recollection of where she might have stored or dropped the ticket.\nAstrid had been given thirty days to claim her prize, or else it would be canceled. For 27 days, her schedule was dedicated to searching every surface and square foot of her house for the missing ticket. With only three days left, she decided to finally call her daughters for help. She had been too embarrassed to call them from the beginning because her house was so messy, but now had no other choice. Figuring that helping their mother find the ticket would probably secure at least an extra million dollars to them, all three of Astrid's daughters immediately sped over to her house.\nWithin the first half hour of searching, the youngest of her daughters hollered, \"I found it!\" It turned out Astrid had left it in a dish cabinet. \"Oh, thank you, daughter!\" Astrid cried. \"I owe you so much!\" Her daughter's smile glistened with pride as her two sisters scowled at her from the next room."

I kept asking over and over again until she finally said okay, but she said she was going with me. \"I'm a big boy, mom. I can go alone,\" I said. She would not agree. \"We're going together, or not at all,\" she said. And of course I said okay.\nWhen the big day came, I was so excited. I almost had an accident while waiting in line.

When we finally reached the end of the line, it felt like I waited a month, we got on and put on our seat belts. I was excited and afraid at the same time. Then it started.\nI went so high up in the air that I got dizzy. My stomach began to turn, and I felt like throwing up. It was just too fast and too high for me. I didn't get sick, but I was sure glad I was on the ground again when I told my mom, \"Please don't send me up there again, mom!\""

Time-out is a chair next to the teacher's desk where a student has to sit quietly when they do something wrong.\n\"They aren't kicked out of the classroom, just taken out of the immediate situation so they can reflect on what they did wrong,\" the teacher explained.

This school is a separate building or set of buildings. Most students in middle school are between the ages of 10 and 14. The grade system continues in middle school. Middle school usually starts with 6th or 7th grade and ends with 8th grade. While they are less common, some elementary schools go from kindergarten to 8th grade.\nMost students are assigned a middle school based on where they live. However, there are charter, private, and specialized public middle schools that have an application process. The purpose of middle school is to provide a transition period between elementary school and high school. Middle school prepares students for high school life. In middle school students don't stay in one classroom all day with one teacher. Students change classrooms for different subjects and have different teachers for each subject. In middle school some students may even be able to choose some of their own classes, called electives. There is a set of core classes that all students have to take. These include English, math, science, and social studies or history classes. Gym or physical education classes are also required.\nA common feature of middle school is a homeroom, which is a classroom students visit at a scheduled time once a day or once a week. A homeroom teacher takes attendance and makes announcements of things students need to know. The homeroom also helps students feel like there is one common place and one common teacher they see regularly. This is to help with the transition from elementary school to secondary school. Once a student finishes middle school, they have a graduation ceremony and go to a high school assigned to them or a high school they picked."

It's seen as a space to write down who you have a crush on, a place to write down secrets, things you don't want anyone else to know. The stereotype is that only women keep diaries. In fact, your diary doesn't have to have pink flowers on it. Keeping a diary, also called a journal, is a very old tradition. It can be useful for many different kinds of people. Many famous people have kept diaries. Many powerful people have kept diaries. Some of these people include famous writers and even presidents.\nKeeping a journal is said to have health benefits. It improves not just mental and emotional health, but also physical health. Studies show that keeping a diary, that is, writing out thoughts daily, can decrease asthma and arthritis symptoms. Writing uses your left brain, which is analytical and rational. While your left brain is busy, your right brain is free to create and feel. This removes mental blocks and allows you to use all of your brain power to better understand yourself, others, and the world around you.\nThe key to successful diary keeping is not editing, which means not stopping any thoughts from coming through. This even means allowing thoughts that disturb you to come out in your writing. It helps clarify your feelings, and is especially useful if a person is faced with a hard decision. Sometimes just writing down the pros and cons help you better understand an issue. You begin to see a problem from different angles. This is helpful if you are having a disagreement with others."

By being completely honest with your doctor, he or she will have a better idea of how to proceed with your treatment if treatment is necessary.\nOne of the questions that may be listed is about your medical history. In order to move forward with a treatment plan, it is important for a doctor to know of any illnesses you have dealt with in the past. If, for instance, there is a history of cancer or heart disease in your family, this information could be very valuable to your doctor. Other questions may include drinking and smoking habits, allergies, and the medications you are currently taking. All this information helps healthcare professionals develop a profile of your current medical condition and identify, through your family history, any issues that may come up in the future.\nAll information shared with a healthcare professional is kept in complete confidentiality meaning your doctor will never share your personal information with anyone else.

Although Sterling is a very successful and rich man, his team has seen very little success in the NBA over the years. In recent years, the Clippers have made some strides in the league, having made the playoffs every year since 2011.\nSterling was recently in the news for a very different reason, though. On April 25, 2014, a controversial news and entertainment show aired a recorded conversation between Sterling and a female friend, where Sterling is heard making racial comments about some of her black friends. Sterling is not kind in his description of these friends. He said he did not want her bringing any black people to his Clippers games because he did not want her to be seen publicly with them.\nSterling's rant gained international attention. The NBA is made up of more than 90 percent black players, so many people questioned how Sterling could feel this way about many of his own employees. His comments created an immediate backlash from the black community and from Americans as a whole. He was under pressure from the NBA to sell the team after many black people commented that they no longer would attend his games.\nThe NBA has issued a lifetime ban against Sterling, which effectively prohibits him from entering any arena to view a basketball game for the rest of his life. Sterling challenged the ban, and refused to sell the team."

He eventually got the hang of it. They spent the rest of the time perfecting their moves. The day of the competition was almost near. Jenny and Carl were beginning to get nervous. They were going up against nine other pairs from the same school.\nThe day of the competition arrived. Carl had not become a great dancer, but had definitely improved since he began. Since Jenny won last year's competition, she was to perform with Carl last. The pairs that were performing this year were better dancers compared to last year's competition. As each pair took the stage one by one, Jenny grew more anxious. Carl noticed this from Jenny and told her, \"It'll be okay, Jenny. You are great, and I'm sure we'll win.\" Jenny felt better after hearing Carl's words. Soon, it was their turn to perform. They walked on stage and began to dance as soon as their song started to play.\nThey were off to a great start. Jenny's class was there cheering them on. The crowd began cheering them on as well. Suddenly, Jenny tripped and fell. The crowd was shocked. Carl managed to get Jenny back up on time for their big finale. Jenny was upset because of her fall. After their performance, the judges tallied up the scores and were ready to announce the winner. Jenny and Carl won, but it was a close call. If it wasn't for Jenny's talent and Carl's quick thinking to keep the routine going, they wouldn't have won. They were both awarded with a trophy and medals. Jenny and Carl were full of cheer."

Nothing seemed to work.\nThe next day, Mike felt so tired during work. He had a hard time staying awake at his desk. His boss even noticed how tired he was and made a sly remark at him. \"Mike, I'm paying you to work, not to sleep,\" his boss said. Mike felt embarrassed hearing his boss's comment. He could not wait to go home and sleep.\nThat same night, Mike lay in bed and had the same problem. Although he had taken a nap when he arrived back from work, he still had a hard time falling asleep at night. \"What should I do, Maria?\" he pleaded to his girlfriend. Maria suggested he make himself some hot cocoa. He asked Maria if she would mind making him some.\nMaria at first said no to his request, but after he started moving around again, she got up and went to the kitchen. If Mike could not go to sleep, neither could she. She gasped in horror when she opened the kitchen cabinet to discover there was no more cocoa. She opened her fridge and there was no milk, either. She walked back into the bedroom and told Mike the bad news."

Eventually they had a son. Every once in a while, Albert would take out the old Fender Stratocaster and play a song for his baby son named Max. He loved playing guitar for Max, because it would calm him down when he started crying. As Max got older, he started listening to the same kind of music his father listened to.\nAlbert and his son would listen to music together and talk about what they thought the songs meant. During Max's tenth birthday, Albert gave his son a Fender Stratocaster as well. The same model his father had gotten him. It cost him a bit more, but he wanted his son to have the same one as his. Max was happy, he asked his dad to teach him all the songs he knew. Albert smiled and said, \"Of course!\"\nWhen Max turned 17, he joined a band. They played local shows and were able to record some songs by themselves. One day as Max was walking home from band practice, someone stopped him and took away his guitar. He was devastated. He went home and locked himself in his room. He couldn't face his dad. He knew he had let him down. When it was time for dinner, Max opened his bedroom door and saw his dad's Fender Stratocaster on the guitar stand. There was a letter and a set of keys on the guitar. The letter said \"To my guitar hero, Max. Here is my guitar, you need it more than I do, and the key to your new car, so nothing like this will happen to you again.\""

Eisenhower was the U.S. military Supreme Commander in the European Theater of Operations during World War II. During his presidency, Eisenhower negotiated a truce in Korea, and worked hard to maintain the peace during the infamous Cold War with Russia.\nBorn in Denison, Texas on October 14, 1890, Eisenhower excelled in high school sports, and he received appointment to the U.S. military academy at West Point. He began his military career in North Africa, and by D-Day in 1944, Eisenhower had risen to Supreme Commander in Europe. He reached the rank of five-star general, which is the highest rank in the U.S. Army.\nEisenhower served as president of the prestigious, Ivy League school, Columbia University after the war, and decided to run for president in 1952. He won a sweeping victory, and took office in 1953. His greatest accomplishment during his presidency was his handling of the Cold War. Relations with Russia were strained before he took office, but he quickly gained the Russian's confidence, and diplomatic solutions replaced military posturing.\nHe was a moderate Republican who favored a balanced budget and social programs. He continued former President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs to help boost the economy, and championed education rights for all Americans. Eisenhower intended to only serve one term in office, but the Republican party was in danger of losing control of both the House and the Senate. He was convinced to run in 1956, and beat Adlai Stevenson in a landslide victory. One of his greatest domestic moves was the development of an interstate highway system, which created jobs, and stimulated the economy."

This central California region boasts more than 400,000 acres of natural beauty that is uniquely Californian. The park is known as the Land of the Giants because of its beautiful trees. The landscape features great mountains, foothills, deep canyons, a large cavern system, and, of course, the world's largest trees.\nThe park sits side by side with King's Canyon National Park in the stunning San Joaquin Valley. Sequoia National Park was officially established as a national park in the 1890s. It features 14 campsites that include picnic tables, fire rings for outdoor cooking, and food storage boxes. It is a great place for a family vacation with many of its campsites open year round. But the most popular attractions are its forests. The ancient trees are some of the oldest living organisms on earth, and draw millions of visitors worldwide. Redwood trees can reach heights of more than 375 feet. They are closely related to the Giant Sequoia trees, and are often mistaken for each other. They both are uniquely Californian, as they do not grow naturally in any other region in the world.\nRedwood trees live up to 2,000 years, and have branches that grow up to five feet in diameter. Its bark can grow up to 12 inches thick. The Giant Sequoia trees can live up to an astonishing 3,000 years, and have branches up to eight feet in diameter. Its bark can grow to an amazing thickness of three feet. Both trees have dark brown bark, and look very similar, but the Redwood thrives in coastal climate, while the Sequoia exists in more mountainous areas. In either case, they are a must-see California attraction."

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in March 2010 by President Barack Obama, and came into effect in January 2015. The Act provided insurance to 20 to 24 million Americans who previously had no health insurance. This Act has come under a lot of criticism and is currently being reviewed with the intention of repealing it. The new U.S. Congress is planning on replacing the Act with a new one.\nHealthcare is very expensive in the United States. Hospital stays for even a few days can cost much more than most Americans can afford. Still there exists a complex network of clinics, offices, medical centers, hospitals, and outpatient facilities that are available to the public. Additionally, there are county hospitals and other low-cost facilities that can provide service to the insured and uninsured alike. Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) also provide medical services to the public. These HMOs are usually tied to employer insurance coverage, but individuals can purchase insurance from these types of healthcare providers, too.\nFinding a good doctor, one that you feel comfortable with, is the first step in taking command of your healthcare. Once you find a good doctor, he or she can refer you to specialists who can address any special needs you may have. You can find a good doctor anywhere in the U.S. regardless of your insurance plans. All you need is a little patience and persistence.\nMost people in the U.S. do not rely on the Affordable Care Act for their healthcare needs. Many employers provide their workers with insurance as part of the benefits package. However, other Americans purchase individual insurance plans that can be costly."

Bond is a fictional character, but that does not mean he does not exist in the collective consciousness of the American public. For generations, the Ian Fleming-inspired, British secret agent has entertained American audiences with his suave demeanor, and grace under fire. Bond first appeared in Fleming's Casino Royale in 1952. The novel followed the exploits of agent 007 as he fought to protect the United Kingdom and the world from disaster. From its beginnings in print, Bond has transitioned to television, film, comics, video games, and radio.\nThe most famous medium for the super spy is film, however. To date there have been a total of 23 films depicting Bond. The 007 movies are where most Americans came to know James Bond. The first feature film debuted in 1962 with the great Sean Connery starring in the title role in Dr. No. Connery went on to star in six films as Bond. Roger Moore holds the record for depicting 007 in the Bond films, having appeared in seven films from 1973 through 1985. Other actors who have played Bond include George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig, the latest Bond. David Niven starred as Bond in a parody of the franchise.\nAll of Bond's films have three things in common. They all feature guns, cars, and beautiful leading ladies with exotic, and often erotic names. Some of the most famous actresses to appear in Bond movies are Jane Seymour, Ursula Andress, Britt Ekland, Maud Adams, and Diana Rigg. The most recent film was 2012's Skyfall starring Daniel Craig. The franchise is not showing signs of decline."

This kind of parents hover over their children like helicopters, which means these parents are always on top of their children.\nWhile being an aware and involved parent is not a bad thing, helicopter parents take it to the extreme. The actions of helicopter parents actually hurt children, by not teaching them to be responsible for their actions. For example, a helicopter parents would call their adult college-age child to wake them up to go to class when part of college is learning to be responsible and learning to manage your own time. Helicopter parents are also overly worried about their kids getting hurt. This means helicopter parents hold back their child's natural curiosity. Part of growing up  means your kid has to get hurt, physically and emotionally. This is how lessons are learned. Instead, the kids of helicopter parents can grow up to be overly needy, dependent adults. Some people blame the rise of helicopter parenting on the rise of cell phones. Mobile phones make it easier for parents to track their kids all the time.\nThe opposite of the helicopter mom is the free-range mom. The free-range mom follows a slow parenting style, meaning she lets her kids explore the world at their own pace with little direction. The name free-range comes from the idea that kids should have the freedom to explore their world or range in a way that makes sense to them. This often means that free-range moms will not schedule activities like extra classes or play dates for their kids. Instead a free-range mom will just let her child play in a park. There is less of an emphasis on things like the latest toys."

Last year, I got a DUI, which means Driving Under the Influence. If you get pulled over and you smell like alcohol, the police will ask you to take a breathalyzer test. When you do the test, you have to blow really hard into a machine, which will then tell you if you are over the limit to drive a vehicle. The limit is usually .08 blood alcohol volume. So, if you pass that, you are going to jail.\nEven though you won't go to jail for a long time, you will be suffering the consequences of your mistake for a long time. Here is a list of the things you will have to do if you get a DUI: go to court, go to alcohol education classes, go to Alcoholics Anonymous, pay a lot of money in fines. If you don't want to pay, you will have to do community service. I got my DUI almost two year ago, and I am still suffering the consequences. I still have 56 hours for community service.\nI have to update my insurance policy, and deal with the Department of Motor Vehicles. You waste a lot of time and money. It gets difficult to get a job, because you have to let your future employer know that you have been arrested. It's not worth it. If you are thinking about going out to celebrate and party with friends and family, do one of the following: get a designated driver, take the bus or train, or call a cab. It may cost you a little bit of money, but compared to how much money you will lose if you get a DUI, it's nothing. Don't drink and drive."

Michael was a junior at his college, and Scott was a freshman. They both tried out for the college team, but were so nervous during the tryouts that they didn't make it. One day, while they were playing basketball, Michael noticed that a guy was watching them play. When Michael and Scott finished playing, the guy who was watching them went up to Michael.\n\"You guys have some skills,\" the guy said. Michael finally realized who the man was. It was Charles King, a famous basketball player. Charles told them that he used to play basketball at that park too when he was younger. Charles asked them if they played for school, or if they had a team with friends. They said they didn't make it into their school's team. \"I never made it into my school's basketball team either,\" Charles said.\nCharles asked the brothers if they wanted to play a game of 2 on 1, they happily said yes. Charles won, of course, but he told the brothers that they were really good. Charles then told the brothers that he was starting a basketball camp at his old high school, and if they were interested; they could join it for free. The brothers had heard about it, and said that they would love to join. \"We just have to ask our mother,\" Scott said. Charles laughed, and said, \"Of course, you don't want to get mom mad.\" The two brothers ran back home, and they told their mom about what had happened at the park. She told them that they could join as long as they kept up with their homework and their classes. The brothers agreed, and went back to the park to practice."

Earlier that week, she had been visited by her children and grandchildren to celebrate her 70th birthday, and had received the phone as a gift from her granddaughter Mary. Julie had been widowed for five years now. Since she lived hours away from the rest of the family, Mary thought the phone would be a good way for them to keep in touch and take up some of her time.\nUp until then, Julie had never really been interested in catching up with modern technology, but finally owning her own smartphone made her feel youthful, and she decided to join Facebook since that was what she had noticed all the younger people were doing. However, when making her profile page, she was embarrassed to put up a picture of herself since she thought she looked much too wrinkly and nobody would want to talk to her. To remedy this, she downloaded a picture of a beautiful 20-something year old from Google, posted it under her name, and went to sleep.\nThe next morning, Julie woke up and enthusiastically logged into Facebook in hopes that she would have one or two new friends. She could not believe her eyes. Her inbox was full of friend requests from dozens and dozens of young handsome men that were complimenting her beauty and wanted to know all about her. Julie decided to accept only the best-looking ones and began chatting with them day and night, never letting them know that they were actually talking to a grandma. The next time Julie met up with Mary, she thanked her so much for the phone and remarked, \"I haven't felt so young and pretty in years!\" Mary was confused and asked, \"Why?\" Julie just gave a mischievous smile and changed the topic."

Mike considered taking Maria to a park and asking her there. Mike also thought about taking Maria out for a romantic dinner. There were so many possibilities, but Mike could not make up his mind.\nOne morning as Mike was getting up from bed, he thought of just asking her right there and then. Maria was sleeping beside him when he got the idea. Mike quietly crept to the dresser to open a drawer. He reached under his clothes and grabbed the ring he had bought. He walked next to Maria on the bed and whispered her name. Maria slightly opened her eyes and saw Mike standing over her. Before she could see what he was holding in his hand, a nervous Mike suddenly got a bad case of cold feet. Instantly he hid the ring behind his back.\n\"Mike, what are you doing?\" Maria asked drowsily. Maria rubbed her eyes so she could see more clearly. \"Nothing, honey. I was just... looking at how beautiful you look while sleeping,\" Mike cleverly answered. The even more clever Maria did not believe what he said and became even more suspicious. \"Why do you have your hand behind your back?\" she asked when she noticed Mike's awkward stance.\nMike became nervous and suddenly changed the topic. \"Let's go out somewhere special tonight! What do you say, dear?\" Mike asked enthusiastically. \"Umm, sure,\" Maria replied. Later that night, Mike and Maria were out driving around town. Mike wasn't sure where to take Maria. As Mike wondered where to go, Maria sat in the passenger seat asking Mike where they were going. It was a beautiful, clear night in Pasadena with stars in the sky and a big full moon."

Barbara was sure that if she had a college degree, finding a better-paying job with benefits would be easier.\nBarbara's daughter was now a teenager. She was beginning to look at colleges. This inspired Barbara to go back to school herself. Barbara wanted to finally get her bachelor's degree. Since her daughter was in high school, Barbara had more time. She didn't have to constantly watch over her daughter. However, even as a teenager, Barbara's daughter still needed to eat and needed clothes, so going to college on a regular schedule was not an option for Barbara.\nBarbara went to the local community college to learn about her options. A college counselor told her that she could take online classes to finish her degree. Barbara was worried that these classes wouldn't give the same credit as a traditional college class would. The counselor told her the credits were the same, and online classes were good for non-traditional students like her. Barbara enrolled and became a student again."

In Los Angeles, there are many opportunities for those who are interested in volunteering their time. L.A. is a big place whose residents have lots of reasons to volunteer. One way to help take care of the city, its people, animals, trees, and beaches is to give back by volunteering. It not only exposes the volunteer to new places, people, and events, but also helps those who may be less fortunate.\nSome people volunteer to work with the homeless in L.A. The homeless population in Los Angeles has grown in recent years, making volunteering to help them more important than ever. One of the ways to help is to volunteer at a local homeless shelter. Most of these shelters are in the downtown area. You can help by working in the kitchen, or distributing food and other goods to those in need. It is very satisfying work and can be enjoyable, too. One other popular volunteer opportunity is to work with animals. Most local animal shelters welcome volunteers to work with animals, and you don't have to be an expert to do this.\nYou can also work for the elderly or disabled people. Many of these people do not have access to transportation, or have limited mobility. You can help by delivering meals to their doorsteps, or by taking them on an outing to their local market, or restaurant so that they can get a hot meal. Other volunteer opportunities exist in academics. Many students cannot afford to pay a private tutor to help them with their classes. There are organizations that can help. You can help too by volunteering as a tutor. These are just some of the opportunities available. To find more, google \"volunteer opportunities\" followed by the city you want to volunteer in."

Kenneth and his friends decided to go to the beach the first day of the summer. When they got there, they found it was filled with tourists and people trying to escape the heat.\nEven though the beach was filled with people, Kenneth didn't care. He knew all the cool places to go. He was friends with some shop owners. He was also friends with the owners of a little Mexican restaurant. He had a little booth reserved for him during the summer so that whenever he got hungry he didn't have to wait for a table. The owners were family friends of Kenneth and they loved having him around. Kenneth didn't like to abuse their relationship, so he only went to the restaurant once or twice a week, and he always left good tips.\nThere are a lot of activities to do at the beach. People can go swimming, rent a bike, play volleyball, or shop around. Kenneth is always careful when he is around volleyball nets and people bicycling. Last year, he was walking by the volleyball nets when a large man jumped up to hit the ball, which ended up hitting Kenneth right in the head. The man ran to Kenneth to make sure he was okay. He was okay, but a bit dizzy. As Kenneth was trying to get his balance back, he walked right into the path of a bicycle. He crashed into a woman riding a bicycle, and they both fell down.

One of the many reasons America is such a great country is the diversity you see all around. America is one big melting pot of citizens from different backgrounds.\nAmerica is also home to many of the world's top colleges and universities. The California Institute of Technology is a top world-ranked college that focuses highly on science and engineering. It is located in the city of Pasadena. Harvard University is another top world-ranked college that you might be familiar with. The buildings at Harvard date all the way back to the year 1636, making Harvard the oldest university in the United States. It is located in the state of Massachusetts. University of California, Los Angeles is another institute worthy of recognition. Located next to Hollywood, UCLA has distinguished itself as a prestigious and selective university due to the number of people who apply for admission throughout the United States. The universities mentioned are but a few of the many other excellent schools that make the United States so outstanding.\nAmerica is also known for being at the forefront of freedom and equality.

It is a beautiful drive, winding lazily in and out of sight of the sea, and going up hills and down coastal valleys. For first-time cruisers, it could be breathtaking.\nOne lazy Saturday, I was a bit bored, so I called my girlfriend, who was studying for her English test on the coming Monday, to see if she wanted to go for a ride. \"Hey Sheila, want to go for a cruise?\" She hemmed and hawed for a while before finally agreeing to go with me. \"Where are we going?\" she asked, but I wanted it to be a surprise. She had been hitting the books pretty hard lately because of her upcoming mid-term exams. I figured she needed a break, and so did I.\nWe started driving. Soon we were going through the Santa Monica tunnel. This tunnel is especially nice. When you enter it, you have no clue what is waiting at the other end. As soon as the exit comes into view, the ocean, in all its glory, appears right before your eyes. Sheila was instantly delighted. She turned to me after a while and said \"Thanks, baby. I really needed this.\" I said \"Me too, babe.\"\nWe talked for what seemed like hours. After that we went up and down, left and right, with the ocean as our companion. We ended up in Santa Barbara, a coastal town about 140 miles north of Los Angeles. It was getting late, so we decided to stay for the night. Santa Barbara is a college town, so it's easy to find affordable rooms to spend the night. That was one of the best nights of my young life."

A funeral parlor is a place where the preparation of the corpse for burial takes place. Part of the preparation can be dressing the deceased, doing their makeup, and placing them in a coffin for people to see. Some people do have a closed casket wake, where you can't see the dead person; some people are not even choosing coffins for their dearly departed loved ones.\nIn the United States, more and more families are choosing not to have traditional wakes. There is a recent trend of people having non-traditional wakes with the deceased person posed doing something they loved doing when they were alive. For example, a family in New Orleans had their dead loved one posed at a table with a cigarette between her fingers and a can of beer. One funeral home in Puerto Rico has become famous for its non-traditional wakes. It all started in 2008, when a family asked for their dead loved one to be propped up against the wall of their home for the wake. When a paramedic died, his family had his dead body in the driver's seat of an ambulance. Another family had a man propped up in a fake boxing ring for his wake. One dead man was posed on top of his motorcycle. Recently, a grandmother was posed sitting in her rocking chair.\nThese non-traditional wakes have their critics though. Some people think they are disrespectful. They think of death as a solemn and sad occasion, not a time to pose the dead as if they were toys. Fans feel it helps them remember the dead as they were when they were alive."

This document is provided by the employer either through direct contact at the employer's location, or online. Most applications are now filled online, but some organizations still accept hard-copy applications. Once the application is submitted, the employer will contact you if he is interested in hiring you. This is when an applicant must begin to work on his or her personal documents.\nWhen submitting a resume to an employer, it is important to include a cover letter. A cover letter can either be a hard-copy document on its own, or be written in the text area of an email. It is recommended that you create a cover letter and attach it to the email, along with your resume when sending it in. You can then use the text area of the email to respond to the resume request and to indicate that you are including a cover letter.\nWhat goes into the cover letter is very important. This is where the applicant introduces himself, or herself to the employer and tells the employer why the job is right for them. Your cover letter should thank the employer for the opportunity, briefly explain why you are interested in the job, and why you would be a good fit. It is a good idea to research the organization prior to writing your cover letter so that you know a little about what the company does. This is also good advice when writing your resume. Always use good grammar and spelling, and don't forget to spellcheck your documents. Most resumes and cover letters are emailed into the organization's human resources department, but it is also a good idea to print a hard copy."

People living in the U.S. can begin their education as early as the age of three, and continue their academic careers well into adulthood. How long someone goes to school varies greatly from individual to individual. It all depends on what individuals want from the educational system and life in general. Some people are satisfied with achieving a high school diploma, while others strive for higher education.\nBy the time children reach the age of three, parents will often enroll them into preschool. Some schools offer classes for children who are as young as two, but three is usually the youngest age children begin their education. After preschool comes kindergarten to 6th grade in the public school system. The 6th grade is the last year of elementary school. Once a child has completed elementary school, he or she will be enrolled into high school, which is from Grade 9 through 12. When students reach the 12th grade, they have completed their required education. Beyond the 12th grade, furthering your education is optional.\nAt college level in California, the state offers three options to continue your academic career. They are the Community College system, the California State University system, and the University of California system. Each system is unique. Where a student enrolls depends on the student and what that student's goals are. These are the choices students have for their education. However, there is another choice available, which is a private school. Private schools operate much like public schools with some differences. It is important to look into all your options to see what the best options for you are."

Griffith was a Welsh-born philanthropist and mining tycoon, who wanted to give the public access to a state-of-the-art observatory, so it was free of charge to visitors. He felt common people should be able to enjoy the wonders of the universe, and not be solely for the scientific community.\nGriffith donated 3,015 acres of land specifically to house the observatory that opened on May 14, 1935. During the first five days after the opening, the planetarium averaged more than 13,000 visitors a day. One of the major attractions was the Foucault Pendulum that is designed to show the earth's rotation and the Zeiss reflecting telescope. The observatory has a striking view of Los Angeles and Hollywood, and the Pacific Ocean can be seen on clear days from there.\nIn 2002 the planetarium was subjected to a $93 million renovation and expansion, which closed the museum for four years. After it reopened in 2006, the facility expanded underground with new exhibits, a cafe, a gift shop, and a theater. The Wilder Hall of the Eye section concentrates on the astronomical aspect of the observatory. It is where people can view the stars through the observatory's telescope, and features an interactive exhibit that is very popular. The Ahmanson Hall of the Sky is another popular attraction for viewing images in the night sky that are visible to the naked eye. The observatory frequently stages viewing nights when the public is invited to bring their own telescopes. It is open daily, and remains free of charge."

She loved learning about the success of people she knew when she was just a teenager. She loved finding out people were getting married, having babies, and traveling.\nSoon however, Katherine found herself comparing herself to the people she was reading about on Facebook. It began to make her feel bad that some people seemed to be doing so much better than she was. They had better jobs, nicer clothes, and cuter boyfriends. She was also spending a lot of time on Facebook. It took a lot of time and energy to keep up with everyone's status updates.\nKatherine started to think. She looked at the list of over 500 friends she had on Facebook and realized some of them were not really friends at all."

Suddenly she heard music. It was a harmonica playing a sad song. It sounded like a blues song. She opened her eyes to look where the sound was coming from. Was it from someone's iPod with the volume up loud?\nThe sound was coming from a man leaning against the subway doors playing a harmonica. When he finished playing the song he walked up and down the aisles with a cup in his hand asking for tips. Michelle didn't feel like this was fair. While the music wasn't unpleasant, it's not like she had a choice. She was forced to listen to it since she has to take the train home from work.  Now he was asking to be paid by the people being forced to listen? He had some nerve. Michelle didn't give the man any money. Some of her fellow commuters did drop a few coins in the man's cup.\n\"You shouldn't encourage that,\" Michelle told one of her fellow commuters after he dropped some change in the man's cup. \"I don't even think it's legal for him to play music in the train and ask for money,\" Michelle said. She then scanned the advertisements and notices inside the train car. Sure enough she found a sign that said playing music and soliciting was not allowed and that there would be a fine for people caught by the police.\nWhen the harmonica player passed by Michelle and extended his cup out so he could put in some change, she pointed to the sign. The harmonica player shrugged his shoulders. \"We all have to make a living, lady,\" he said."

        "content": "When you rent an apartment, you need to check the lease for rules and responsibilities. For example, some landlords do not want you to have guests spend the night. This is because the landlord doesn't know who your guests are. If they damage the apartment in any way, you will be responsible. Also sometimes a friend who wants to crash on your couch ends up staying for a really long time, and ends up becoming another tenant.\nYou are responsible for all the utilities you use while living in a rental apartment. This means you will have to pay for the electricity and gas you use. If the landlord pays for any utilities, it will say so in the lease. Once you move in, you will have to call the electric company and the gas company so they can put accounts in your name. Also if you want a phone line, cable or Internet, you will have to call those companies and pay for those services yourself unless the lease says that is included in your rent.\nYour landlord is supposed to have access to the apartment you are renting from them. This doesn't mean they can just barge in whenever. It does mean though that with notice, the landlord is allowed to come into the apartment during a reasonable time, meaning not in the middle of the night when you are sleeping. During this time the landlord will inspect the apartment to make sure you are following the rules, and the landlord can also make any necessary repairs. All of this should be written out on the lease. If it is not, do not be afraid to ask the landlord to add that information. It protects both the landlord and you."

These attacks came in August, 1945, during the final stages of World War II against the Empire of Japan. Two cities targeted by the U.S. were Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The war in Europe was over in May of that year, with Nazi Germany's surrender, but the Japanese carried on. The U.S. and its allies conducted a firebombing campaign against the Japanese. It devastated the country, but they would not surrender. The allies were looking at a costly campaign to invade the Japanese mainland. The Japanese were determined to fight to the last person to defend their country, if necessary. This was a major factor in the decision to use the atomic bomb.\nThe U.S., along with China and the United Kingdom, called for Japan's surrender in July 1945 with a threat of devastation, but Japan refused. On August 9, the first bomb was dropped on the city of Hiroshima. Nicknamed \"Little Boy,\" the bomb killed approximately 90,000 to 170,000 Japanese citizens. The blast completely destroyed the city. Three days later, a second bomb, nicknamed \"Fat Man,\" destroyed the city of Nagasaki. That bomb killed an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 Japanese citizens. About half of the total deaths were immediate. The remainder of the deaths came months after, when the survivors of the initial blast became sick from radiation poisoning, and injuries.\nOn August 15, after the two atomic bomb attacks, and a declaration of war on Japan by the Soviet Union, Japan decided to surrender. The reasoning behind the decision to use nuclear weapons on Japan is debated to this date. Many say that the bombs saved Japanese, and American lives. The argument is that because of Japanese determination,  many more lives would have been lost. In any event, the two attacks are the only nuclear attacks in world history."

It is known as one of the best bands ever to come from a garage-band background. Founded by brothers Eddie and Alex Van Halen in their home in Pasadena, California in 1972, the band was one of the top rock acts in the country, and is as popular today as it was then.\nEddie Van Halen is considered one of the best lead guitarists in the history of music by many of his peers, while Alex was a superior drummer. Together, they formed the nucleus of the popular band that also included bass guitarist, Michael Anthony, and vocalist, David Lee Roth. The brothers were born in the Netherlands, and immigrated to the United States when they were children. The two were inseparable, and developed an interest in music in the mid-60s. They formed the band in 1972, using the name Genesis. They later changed the name to Mammoth when Eddie discovered Genesis was already in use. Eventually they renamed the band Van Halen.\nAccording to popular legend, Van Halen was discovered by Gene Simmons of the rock band Kiss, while they were performing at Gazzarri's on the Strip, a popular spot for heavy metal rock bands in the 70s. They continued to play at gigs throughout Southern California when they released their self-titled debut album Van Halen in 1978. The album peaked at No. 19 on the Billboard list, and the band never looked back. Van Halen's greatest commercial success was from 1978 through 1985, but their albums continue to sell. It has garnered a cult-like following from several, younger generations of American Rock n' Roll fans."

That is probably why the house was so inexpensive. The previous owners of the house had it foreclosed. Then some house flippers bought the property for a very cheap price, renovated it, raised the sales price, and sold it. Bob thought the house was still a good bargain though.\nAfter he moved in, Bob began to see that many of the renovations to the home were merely cosmetic. While the house flippers put in new stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, they hadn't upgraded the electrical work. This meant that every time Bob ran the dishwasher and the coffee machine, all the power in the house went out. Bob spent over $1,000 dollars to have the house rewired. The new carpets that the house flippers installed was put over the original hardwood floors. Bob decided to rip out the ugly oatmeal colored carpets and refinish the old floors. That was another $3,000.\nThe house was an old stucco house that got very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. The house flippers installed some cheap windows. Bob hired a contractor to put in new double pane storm windows and install ceiling fans. That was another few thousand dollars. Bob wanted to make the house energy efficient, so he leased solar panels that were installed on the roof. This not only lowered his monthly electric bill, but added value to the home.\nWithin two years, all the changes Bob made to the house totaled more than $20,000. In that time the value of his home rose almost $100,000. Bob felt he made a good investment. He knew when he sold the home, he would get more money than he paid."

There is nothing more embarrassing than going to the prom and having another girl wearing the same dress.\nFor the parents, like Callie, one of the biggest stressor was money. Tickets to the prom cost $120 per student. Renting tuxedos cost a lot of money. Not to mention the fact that traditionally he had to buy his date a corsage. Most students split the cost of a limousine among friends.\nCallie had more than money on her mind, though. She had heard stories about wild things happening on prom night. She worried about Jesus drinking alcohol, even though he was underage.\nCallie encouraged her son not to worry so much about finding a date. Maybe he could go to prom with a group of friends.

This is because, according to some, the holiday has its roots in a Christian holiday that remembers the dead. Others say the holiday has its roots in the ancient harvest season traditions of Ireland. In the U.S. though, the focus is less on memories of the dearly departed or agriculture. It is about kids dressing up in scary costumes and going door-to-door asking for candy. This is called trick-or-treating. When children knock on the door of a house or ring the doorbell, they usually say \"Trick or Treat\". The \"trick\" part is a fake threat signaling that the kids will commit a prank if they aren't given something delicious. Homeowners then give the children candy, raisins, or some other food treat. Many homeowners decorate their houses to prepare for the holiday and let kids know that they are participating and can ring the bell for candy. Traditional decorations often include jack-o'-lanterns, which are pumpkins with faces carved into them and candles inside. Jack-o' lanterns were thought to scare away evil spirits when Halloween was first celebrated among the ancient Christians. Also turnips, not pumpkins, were originally used. People often decorate using the colors black and orange.\nHalloween is not just for kids;  adults get in on the fun by attending costume parties. There are often contests for who has the best costume. There are also games bobbing for apples, where people have to get an apple using only their teeth from a large bucket of water. Other people celebrate by scaring themselves by going to haunted houses, homes where people dressed up as ghosts, zombies, and werewolves and jump out to frighten guests. People also tell scary stories or watch horror movies."

In the months to follow, the group became the biggest Rock N' Roll band ever to hit the United States.\nThe group's success opened the door for other British bands to make their way to America. Bands such as the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks and The Dave Clark Five were soon playing their music to American audiences.\nThe Beatles were made up by four of the finest musicians to ever play rock music. Their lead singer was Paul McCartney, and drummer Ringo Starr. Both still play to this day. Two of the original members, singers and songwriters, John Lennon, and George Harrison, have tragically passed away, but their music lives in American culture to this day. The Beatles have sold more records in the United States than any other country in the world.\nThere was controversy in the U.S. prior to the group's first appearance. Conservative Americans viewed the Beatles as upstarts, with brash, new ideas, lyrics, and sound. The young generation of the time was ready for a change, and the Beatles gave them what they wanted. They were nicknamed the \"Mop Tops\" because of their long, bowl-like haircuts that flew in the face of convention in the 60s. Nothing was going to stop the Beatles though.

Using these sites to search for employment is a convenient way to find work, but it is not the only way available.\nMore traditional methods for finding work are through newspapers, trade publications, schools, word-of-mouth, and the Employment Development Department (EDD). The EDD is a job service organization run by the state of California. Job seekers can visit any of its WorkSource Centers and register for work. Job seekers can find a WorkSource Center by visiting the EDD website. Newspaper publications also publish open positions in the classified ads section. This is how the majority of jobs were advertised before the advent of the Internet, and jobs are still listed there. Most colleges have their own job service offices for students. Lastly, word-of-mouth advertising, which is simply hearing about an open position from a friend, colleague, or family member.\nAnother effective way of finding employment is to network. Networking is the practice of going to conventions, trade shows, and conferences, where you get to know people working in your field. It's a good idea to invest in personal business cards to hand out at these events, which is a quick and efficient way to meet people and share your contact information.

The ancient Greeks are said to have included a form of boxing as far back as 600 BC. The modern sport of boxing can be traced to the 16th Century when it became a popular sport in Great Britain. Today, the sport still uses a variation of the Marquess of Queensberry rules that were established in 1867. Boxing is the purest form of competition. It pits one man, or woman, against another in an enclosed ring with only the person's fists as weapons. Early matches in the United States featured bare-knuckle fighting, but today boxers use protective gloves.\nOne of the most successful boxers in America is Mike Tyson. Tyson holds several boxing records. The greatest is possibly when he became the youngest boxer ever to win the heavyweight championship in three different boxing organizations. Tyson was just over 20 years old when he accomplished this feat. He was one of the most feared fighters of his time. Tyson won a total of 50 fights with 44 of those victories coming by knockout.\nTwelve of Tyson's knockouts came in the first round, which earned him the nickname of Iron Mike. Eventually, his advancing age and fast living took their toll on Tyson. By the early 90s, his career was virtually over. Even though his boxing career lasted until 2002, Tyson was never the same. He went on to a brief acting career, most notably in the popular 2009 comedy hit The Hangover.\nTyson's post-boxing career had its ups and downs. He appeared on Barbara Walter's talk show with his wife, television actress Robin Givens, where Givens called Tyson a manic-depressive, and that living with him was pure torture. Tyson was arrested in 1991 for raping an 18-year-old girl, and spent several years in jail. He has attempted several comebacks, but has never regained his old glory."

They are the community college system, which has more than 113 schools statewide, the 23 Cal State Universities, and the 10 University of California schools. Each school is unique from the other. The community college system can be seen as a stepping stone for admittance into a Cal State, or UC school. They offer lower-division classes that are transferable to both university systems. Cal State schools are more education-based, while UCs are more research-based schools, so where a student attends after high school or community college depends on the individual.\nOne other option exists for those seeking a college education. It is vocational school. Vocational schools are generally not part of California's public school system, although there are exceptions. Some of the Cal States offer vocational courses in various fields. These schools include Cal Poly Pomona, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and Cal State Channel Islands. These three schools offer vocational training in specific areas that might appeal to some students.\nTraditional vocational schools can be found throughout the state. These schools offer classes in nearly all vocational studies, such as Automotive Technology, Information Technology, and technical trainings in the medical field. Vocational schools can be an attractive option for some students who do not want to commit to a 4-year college program. Students who attend these schools can earn both degrees and certificates in their chosen fields in as little as six months to a couple of years depending on the course of study.

He won both elections by very wide margins over his Democratic opponents, incumbent Jimmy Carter in 1980, and Walter Mondale in 1984. In the election, Reagan took every state with the exception of Minnesota, which was Mondale's home state. Reagan had an endearing quality that served him well when addressing the country. This came from his days as a Hollywood actor, where he starred in several movies after a short career in radio broadcasting.\nBorn on February 6, 1911 in Tampico, Illinois, Reagan grew up in small towns throughout the state. At one time, the family lived in an apartment above a department store. After he won the presidency, and moved into the White House, Reagan joked that he was \"living above the store again.\" It was this type of down-to-earth humor that endeared him to the American public.\nAs a teenager attending Dixon High School in California, Reagan began developing an interest in acting, sports, and storytelling. After a brief career as a radio broadcaster, Reagan auditioned for a part in a movie in 1937. He landed the role, and signed a seven-year contract with the Warner Brothers Studio. He appeared in several films before being called into the military, effectively ending his Hollywood career.\nReagan served as Governor of California for four years prior to becoming president. His presidential term was very successful as he presided over many of the landmark events during the 1980s. During his final term, Reagan suffered from the effects of Alzheimer's Disease, which negatively affected his ability to govern, but he carried out his term, and his legacy as a great president remained intact."

Other key events in the revolution occurred in the city. One was the Boston Massacre, when British troops fired upon protesters, killing five. The Boston Tea Party, when colonists dumped an entire shipment of British tea into the harbor to protest taxes, was not a party at all.

King's greatest accomplishment, however, was an exhibition match that took place in Houston, Texas on September 20, 1973.\nThe 29-year-old King, who was at the top of her professional career at the time, faced a former Wimbledon Champion, Bobby Riggs. Riggs was one of the best men's players during his prime in the late 1930s and 40s. The 55-year-old Riggs challenged King to an exhibition match claiming that the women's game was far inferior to the men's game. He said that even a 55-year-old, \"washed-up\" former player could beat the top woman in the world. The stage was set for the match. However, it was not much of a match at all.\nKing soundly defeated Riggs without much trouble. The match was later exposed for what many people claimed it would be: a showcase for King to demonstrate that women could compete against men. The victory was part of the equal rights movement that was sweeping the nation during that time. King became an outspoken advocate of equal rights for women."

She had spent the previous night in front of her television set watching a reality show that followed lucky people who had found amazing things at their local thrift shops. All of these people had bought seemingly ordinary items for extremely low prices, and ended up discovering that their items were actually very valuable treasures. After having spent five consecutive hours watching other people's experiences, Mary was determined to give bargain hunting a try in hopes of finding something that would make her rich.\nOne of her favorite stories from the show was of a man who had purchased a copy of the Declaration of Independence thinking that it was a cheap replica, for only $2. He ended up discovering that the print was actually one of only 200 official copies of the Declaration of Independence commissioned by John Quincy Adams in 1820. The man ended up making $477,650 after selling it.\nAs Mary walked into her local thrift shop, she tried recalling what all the people in the reality show had looked for. The most common items that people got rich from were paintings and so she headed straight to the Home Decorations aisle. Once there, she couldn't decide which looked most expensive. They actually all seemed pretty ugly to her. \"Excuse me,\" Mary said to an elderly woman walking by. \"Which painting do you think could make me richer?\" Confused, the old lady quickly pointed at one and walked away.\nThe painting the old lady had pointed at was of a cat collage with almost 20 different cat faces jumbled atop of one another.  \"Definitely not my first choice,\" thought Mary. However, she trusted destiny's decision and bought the painting for five dollars. After putting it up online, she began receiving dozens of emails asking if the picture frame displayed came with the painting. In order to see what all the buzz about the frame was about, she took it to an antique store and asked if there was anything special about the frame. \"Of course, it is special!\" remarked the clerk at the store. \"Its wood and age make it at least $25,000!\" Mary ended up selling the frame for $30,000. A few days later, the buyer returned the ugly painting to her through the mail."

Mike headed to the bathroom to take a shower while Maria continued to sleep. Fortunately for him, Maria had ironed his clothes the night before. Maria was able to sleep a little longer since she had no classes to attend today. Mike came out of the shower and began to get dressed. He grabbed his shoes from the closet and began to tie his shoes. As the clock struck seven o'clock, Mike opened the blinds in his bedroom and allowed the warm but surprisingly welcoming sunlight into the cool room.\nThe rays of light shone on Maria as she lay in bed sleeping. Mike still had time to make a trip to the grocery store to purchase milk and eggs for breakfast with Maria. Mike searched his drawers for his car keys to head out. Once he found them, he headed back to the bedroom to awaken Maria. By this time, she was somewhat awake.\nAs he sat by her side of the bed, Mike said in a soft voice, \"Maria, I have enough time to get some groceries. Would you like me to make us some breakfast?\" \"That would be great, honey,\" Maria replied in a sleepy voice. \"What would you like for breakfast?\" he asked curiously. \"Toast with scrambled eggs and a cup of coffee would be nice,\" she said, now more awake. \"I'll be sure to pick up some eggs, milk, and bread for us. I'll return in a few minutes, dear,\" Mike said. \"Thank you, love,\" Maria said, as she leaned forward to give him a kiss on the cheek. With the three items to buy in mind, Mike made his way to the car outside in the driveway.\nDriving around beautiful, sunny Pasadena, Mike headed to his local grocery store. Mike parked his car under a shady tree. He got off the car and locked it. As Mike walked into the store, he felt a blast of air from the air conditioner above his head. He first picked up a shopping basket from the entrance and walked to the cold food aisle to grab a dozen white eggs. Next, Mike grabbed a loaf of sliced bread for toast. Finally, he grabbed a gallon of cold milk. With all the items in his basket, he stood in line to pay. As he approached the cashier, Mike gently placed the carton of eggs and bread down as well as placing the gallon of milk on the counter. He took out his wallet to get ready to pay. The cashier was a young lady who looked like a high school student. She finished helping the last customer before Mike."

In the United States it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November and marks the start of the Christmas season. Some people celebrate Thanksgiving to remember the first harvest of the pilgrims and puritans, groups of people from England who immigrated to North America in the 1600s. Some people recreate the first Thanksgiving and dress up as pilgrims, puritans, and the Native Americans who are said to have helped the new arrivals find food to survive their first winter.\nMost people, however, see Thanksgiving as one day a year to reflect upon what they are thankful for. Some families will sit together and take turns saying aloud what they are thankful for. An important part of Thanksgiving is families coming together. Extended family members often travel long distances to share the day with their loved ones. In the United States Thanksgiving is the busiest travel day of the year. People travel in planes, trains, buses, and cars to share a very special meal  - Thanksgiving dinner.\nWhat most Thanksgiving celebrations have in common is the food. On Thanksgiving many families prepare large, elaborate dinners to share with friends and loved ones. Many of these dinners use ingredients associated with the fall harvest, like cranberries, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, and blueberries. Roast turkey is the traditional meat served. It is so common that some people call Thanksgiving Day \"Turkey Day\". The turkey is usually served with gravy and stuffing. Pies are usually served for dessert. The most common pies served are sweet potato, apple, pecan, and pumpkin.\nThanksgiving is not just celebrated in the privacy of people's homes. Every year the President of the United States pardons a turkey, saving it from becoming someone's meal. In New York City, Macy's, a department store, holds a large parade with huge balloons of various cartoon characters floating down the street."

His ads ran on television from 1964 through 1999, effectively entering the collective conscience of the American people for generations. Philip Morris is one of the largest tobacco producing companies in the world, and the corporation used the Marlboro Man with great success over the years.\nThe Marlboro Man was a strong, rugged-looking man who rode a mighty horse, and traveled throughout the country promoting tobacco products. He appeared in television, radio, print, and billboard ads for decades. When the United States Surgeon General deemed tobacco smoke as unhealthy in the 1960s, the beginning of the end for the Marlboro Man had begun. The Surgeon General began an anti-smoking campaign by requiring all cigarette companies to place its warning label on each package sold in the country. The warning included the wording that \"Tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer.\" Soon the pressure was on the tobacco companies to curb their advertising campaigns.\nIn 1955, tobacco sales reached $15 billion in the United States alone. After the Marlboro Man was introduced to the American public, that total reached $20 billion. This increase was largely based on the Marlboro Man campaign. The company also started an advertising scheme by offering genuine Marlboro Man gear for sale. These commodities were of high quality that appealed to the outdoor type of person. The gear ranged from camping equipment, hats, to outdoor clothing. It was very successful in its time. This success came at a great expense though. Four men who portrayed the Marlboro Man died of lung cancer, earning Marlboro cigarettes as the cowboy killer. The Marlboro Man is still popular in some parts of Europe and Japan, where smoking is still in vogue."

Public Television is a network of television stations throughout the country that is dedicated to bringing alternative programming to the people of the United States.\nMr. Rogers' Neighborhood ran from February 1968 through August 2001, and was hosted by the show's namesake, Fred Rogers. It was a half-hour children's show that featured the popular Rogers as host. It is often referred to as the Mr. Rogers show.\nRogers began his show in 1953 on a PBS station in the northeast part of the country as the Children's Corner. He performed as a puppeteer, and it was aired on live television. There Rogers developed many of the characters that would become famous as his show progressed. In 1967, his show went on the national TV stage, and remained there until 2001.\nRogers' style and calm demeanor made him an instant celebrity who was well-liked by both children and adults. In his early life, Rogers studied to become a Presbyterian minister, but didn't like how children's programming was being presented. He began writing children's songs, and soon began his own local show on public television. During the next three decades, Rogers became a true American icon through his show. His great compassion, morality, and patience were possibly his most liked characteristics.\nRogers was not only a great TV personality, he was also a human rights advocate.

That was before the great Jackie Robinson broke what was called the color line in baseball. Prior to April 15, 1947, Major League Baseball was an exclusive \"whites only\" organization that barred black players from participation. Black Americans could only play in the Negro Leagues that existed roughly between 1920 through 1948. Robinson, and the Brooklyn Dodgers, put an end to segregation in baseball that year, and began a movement for racial equality in the United States.\nRobinson was born in Cairo, Georgia on January 31, 1919, but grew up in Pasadena, California, near Los Angeles. He was an outstanding athlete who played baseball and football for Pasadena City College, then at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). During his time with the Dodgers, the team won one championship, and appeared in the World Series six times. From 1949 to 1954, Robinson was named to the All-Star Team, and he won the National League Most Valuable Player Award. He was also named the Baseball Rookie of the Year in 1947, the first year the award was given.\nToday, Robinson is honored by every team in both the National and American Leagues on Jackie Robinson Day. On that day, all MLB players wear the number 42 in honor of Robinson. That number, used to be worn by Robinson, was retired universally by all baseball teams, making it the first time any league has retired a number. No player on any MLB team can ever wear that number again. Robinson was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1962.

Some of the typical benefits packages employers offer today are retirement accounts, medical and dental insurance, paid sick time off, vacation, and employee discounts on goods and services. Many employers, for instance, will pay medical insurance for employees, but not for their families. However, there are some companies that do include families at either no cost or low cost. This is especially attractive to some prospective employees with families as the cost of medical care is high in the United States.\nMany companies will help their employees plan for retirement with a 401k account. This retirement plan is available to employees who choose to take advantage of it. It usually involves a monthly contribution from the employee that is taken in the form of a payroll deduction. Some companies will match all or part of its employees' contributions. It's an attractive and sensible benefit.\nDental insurance is also important to some employees. Dental care, like medical care, can be costly for those with no insurance. Fortunately, many companies offer this benefit. Like medical insurance, workers with families can benefit most from this insurance. Another important benefit most companies offer is paid sick time off work. No employee is immune to getting sick from time to time. It is good to know that when an employee is sick, he or she can take the necessary time off to heal.\nVacation time is also important to many employees as well as having discounts for goods and services provided by the company. In all, having a good benefits package can be even more important than having a high-paying job only."

A person who drives a car has the freedom to go wherever he or she wants, for the most part. However, driving a car comes with responsibilities. One of the primary responsibilities is that a driver must have auto insurance. Car insurance, like most other insurances, is designed to protect the buyer, in this case, the car owner from suffering great expenses in an emergency situations. No matter how good a driver you may be, there are many other drivers on the road, and many of them may not be as good a driver as you are. It is important to recognize this since you are sharing the road with them.\nThere are two basic types of car insurance, liability and collision. The state of California requires that all drivers carry liability insurance. Collision insurance is optional unless the driver has borrowed money to buy the car from a financial institution. In that case, the bank, or credit union, will require the driver to purchase collision insurance.\nLiability insurance is a part of the general insurance system of risk financing to protect the insured person from the risks of liabilities from lawsuits and similar claims. It protects the policy holder in the event he or she is sued for claims that come within the coverage of the insurance policy. For the most part, liability insurance will cover a person from financial damages caused by the insured. So if you cause an accident, liability insurance will protect you. It will cover property damage, and bodily harm damage up to the amount of insurance purchased, so think carefully about any financial caps you set on your insurance. The best thing to do, as always, is to shop around."

Scully has been the voice of the team since 1950, and holds the record of 65 years broadcasting for a single team in professional sports history.\nHe was born in the Bronx, New York on November 29, 1927, and wanted to become a radio broadcaster after listening to football games in his hometown. He served two years in the United States Navy before enrolling into Fordham University majoring in journalism and broadcasting. He was hired by Barber, who served as mentor for the new broadcaster. Barber gave Scully some advice that he has followed throughout his career. Barber said to become a successful broadcaster, you cannot be a homer, which is an announcer who roots for the team he works for. He also told him to keep his opinions out of his broadcasts, and to always be objective. Scully is all that.\nThe qualities he learned from Barber have served Scully well. He has a narrative style that puts his audience at ease. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982, and continues to broadcast all Dodgers home games. He is a true Los Angeles icon."

        "content": "Rosa Parks is a prime example of how an ordinary American can change the world around her. She was born in 1913, in the southern state of Alabama. Parks became famous for challenging a discriminatory policy in the city of Montgomery, Alabama. During the 1950s, Black Americans in the south were not allowed to ride in the front seats of public buses if a white person needed that seat. Blacks were expected to get out of their seats, and go to the back of the bus, which was designated as \"Colored Only.\"\nOn December 1, 1955, Parks refused to obey the bus drivers order to surrender her seat to a white passenger who had boarded the bus. Even though Parks was seated in the Colored Only section, the bus was filled, and she was required by law to give her seat to the white rider. Parks was arrested, and charged with civil disobedience. She later said  she had grown \"tired of giving in.\"\nHer arrest and subsequent trial made Parks a national symbol for the Civil Rights Movement. Her arrest also lead to the Montgomery Bus Boycott that was a political and social protest campaign against racial segregation. Although the boycott only lasted 21 days, it was instrumental in the Supreme Court decision to declare Alabama's practice of segregation unconstitutional.\nParks has remained a symbol for the Civil Rights Movement even after her death in 2005 at the age of 92. She has been called the \"First Lady of Civil Rights,\" by the United States Congress, and \"The Mother of the Freedom Movement.\" She has been honored by the U.S. government with prestigious awards such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Congressional Gold Medal. She has been honored with her own museum in Michigan, and has received several other civil rights awards both before and after her death."

        "content": "A blended family is a family where one parent has children that are not biologically related to the other parent. The most famous blended family in American popular culture is the Brady Bunch. The Brady Bunch was a U.S. television show that ran from the 1960s into the 1970s. It featured a widowed father, Mr. Brady, who was left to raise three sons. Mr. Brady ends up marrying a woman who has three daughters of her own from a previous relationship. Both adults in the family end up helping to raise children that are not theirs biologically. Half of the children are stepchildren, although all the children call Mr. and Mrs. Brady\nWhen the television show first came out, it was controversial. Prior to the Brady Bunch, most television families were traditional ones, which means a man married a woman and together they raised their children. However, now blended families are seen as normal. Not only do people remarry after a spouse has died, as in the television show. People remarry after getting divorced. These remarried couples often have their own children. Increasingly, many blended families are not even legally married. More and more couples live together without getting married.\nBlended families happen because divorce and remarriage can be more complicated than what is seen on television. The Bradys, as widows, didn't have to worry about visitation rights. In some blended families, children live part of the time with one parent. Sometimes one parent sees his or her children only on weekends or during school vacations. The Brady family also didn't worry about child support payments.\nThe most common type of blended family is a mother with children from a previous relationship starts a new relationship with a man. This is because usually the mother has custody of the children."

Best of all, California mostly maintains this kind of nice weather throughout the year. Jeffrey and Chad were grateful to be surfers in California and not in Iceland. While their other friends were skateboarding and rollerblading, Jeffrey and Chad were at the beach surfing the day away.\nJeffrey was fifteen years old when he first learned how to surf. Chad was two years younger when he started learning. They both had met at a surfing competition. Jeffrey was eighteen and Chad sixteen at the time of the competition. Despite being rivals at first, Jeffery and Chad soon became buddies after the competition. Now twenty-one and nineteen, Jeffrey and Chad had become the best surfers in the West Coast. Their medals and trophies were proof of this.\nThere wasn't anything more satisfying in the world than surfing the waters as the sun beamed from above and the wind blew by. Surfing was an exhilarating and incredible experience. It was also a great stress reliever. Jeffery and Chad felt as if they were on top of the world when surfing. Nothing else mattered when you were in the midst of a barrel ride.  Jeffery and Chad knew that surfing for them would be a lifelong passion.\nThe beach was a great place to be at. This was especially true in the summer when pretty girls would gather on the weekends, bonfires would line the shores at night, and vendors and artists would attract visitors to purchase their wares. There was never a dull moment while at the beach. But if it wasn't for the waters, Jeffrey and Chad would have no reason to go to the beach."

These boroughs are Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Bronx. Manhattan has the most people of all the boroughs, about 1.5 million, even though it is the smallest borough by size. If you send a letter to someone who lives on Manhattan, don't write Manhattan on the envelope. You should write \"New York, New York\", like the famous  Frank Sinatra song.\nBecause the island is so small, most people live and work in tall buildings. Some of these buildings are called skyscrapers because it looks like they are touching the sky. Some famous skyscrapers in Manhattan are Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, 70 Pine Street, Trump Building, GE Building, and Citigroup Center. Manhattan is connected to the other boroughs by a series of bridges and tunnels. The most famous bridge may be the Brooklyn Bridge because of its brick arches. The New York City subway, a massive mass transit system that mostly runs underground, also connects the island to the rest of the boroughs.\nManhattan, like the other boroughs, has many different neighborhoods, many of which are named for the ethnic communities that first lived there. Some of these neighborhoods include Little Italy, Little Germany, Little Brazil, Chinatown, and Koreatown. One of the most famous parts of Manhattan is Times Square. Times Square is called the crossroads of the world. Every year millions of people gather there on New Year's Eve to watch an illuminated crystal ball drop. There are many theaters around Times Square. Most of these theaters are on Broadway, a famous street considered the home of the American theater industry. Another famous Manhattan street is Fifth Avenue. A part of the avenue features expensive designer stores like Tiffany's. Fifth Avenue is also famous for its Museum Mile."

We decided to go see them. The whole family crammed into two cars. We drove for about 40 minutes. When we got there, our faces lit up with joy at the sight of all the lights.

No one noticed, and we left him there for an hour. He knocked on the house that he went to see, and told the people that lived there what had happened. He knew my cell phone number, and so he called me. We were about to arrive at my house when I got the call. I told my dad, and he nearly crashed the car, because he got so scared.\nWe dropped everyone off and I decided to go with my dad to pick up my brother. When we arrived at the house, my brother was sitting on the couch watching television with the children that lived there and drinking hot chocolate. My dad hugged him and said sorry. The people who lived there said that it was fine that their children liked my brother because he was funny. They said he could come back anytime. I was relieved nothing had happened to my brother."

She kept yelling to Daniel that she had to go to the restroom, but he couldn't hear her. She yelled at Daniel once more and that's when it happened. She had an accident on the dance floor. Some of her urine actually got on Daniel's shoes. After it happened, the girl was so embarrassed that she ran out of the club crying. Daniel couldn't believe what had happened. He told people to move out of the way, while his friend came over to clean up the dance floor.\nThe weird thing about that incident was that the girl came back the next day looking for her cell phone, but she didn't remember Daniel.

Dennis was the only boy that went to a private school, and his friends would often tease him about it. \"You're not one of us! You're not one of us,\" they would sometimes chant. He wasn't really alone, though. His friend Patricia also went to the Catholic school, but she was a girl. After a while, they began walking to the small school together every morning. Pat was the first girl friend Dennis had ever had. She wasn't his girlfriend. She was just a friend who happened to be a girl.\nThe nuns at the school were very mean. They ruled the school like it was a prison. Dennis was afraid to even raise his hand to ask a question. His mother was often called into meetings with the principal about Dennis, who would also sit in the office listening to the principal telling his mother how smart he was, but was very lazy. Needless to say, Dennis didn't do well in school and ended up going to a junior college after high school. He didn't do very well there either, and soon dropped out.\nThat all changed after Dennis grew up and started working. He had worked for many years before deciding he wanted to earn a degree after all. Dennis went back to school at the age of 30, and soon was a college graduate with a degree. It turned out Dennis wasn't as lazy as those nuns thought he was."

People can pay for medicine and doctor visits directly in cash or they can use health insurance. Health insurance usually means you pay less for these services. There are different types of health insurance. At some jobs, companies offer health insurance plans as part of a benefits package. Individuals can also buy health insurance. The elderly, and disabled can get government-run health insurance through programs like Medicaid and Medicare. There are many different health insurance companies or plans. Each health plan has a set of doctors they work with. Once a person picks a plan, they pay a premium, which is a fixed amount of money every month. Once in a plan, a person picks a doctor they want to see from that plan. That doctor is the person's primary care provider.\nObamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, is a recently passed law that makes it easier for people to get health insurance. The law requires all Americans have health insurance by 2014. Those that do not get health insurance by the end of the year will have to pay a fine in the form of an extra tax when they file their income taxes. Through Obamacare, people can still get insurance through their jobs, privately, or through Medicaid and Medicare. They can also buy health insurance through state marketplaces, where people can get help choosing a plan based on their income and health care needs. These marketplaces also create an easy way to compare what different plans offer. If people cannot afford to buy health insurance, they may qualify for government programs that offer free health insurance like Medicaid, Medicare, or for children, a special program called the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)."

He was a pathologist, euthanasia advocate, and author, who came into fame during the late 1990s. He died in 2011. Kevorkian was a firm believer in euthanasia for the terminally ill. He designed a suicide machine that helped 130 people end their lives. Kevorkian was persecuted throughout his career as a suicide facilitator, and was convicted in 1999 for his involvement in an assisted suicide. He served eight years in prison, and was released in 2007 after agreeing to no longer assist with anyone's suicide.\nKevorkian had a difficult time working as a pathologist at the University of Michigan, where he earned his doctorate degree. He did not see eye to eye with his employers, and chose to leave the hospital to pursue his own interests. In 1987, Kevorkian purchased advertising space in Detroit newspapers as a \"death consultant.\" His first known assisted suicide was for a 54-year-old woman who suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease. Kevorkian was not charged in the case because Michigan did not have a law in place regarding assisted suicide. The state did file murder charges initially, but those charges were dropped. The Michigan Medical Board, however, did strip Kevorkian of his medical practitioner's license.\nKevorkian defended himself at subsequent trials by claiming he took no action to assist in his patient's suicide. He had invented a machine that was designed to be operated by the patient using the machine. Therefore, Kevorkian argued he had no hand in causing the death of his patients. His patients had complete control of the suicide from start to finish. Kevorkian's role in the deaths was to simply help attach his patients to his machine. The rest was up to them. Some called Kevorkian a raging madman who lost his mind, while others called him an angel for helping to end the suffering of his patients."

Griffith was a Welsh-born philanthropist and mining tycoon, who wanted to give the public access to a state-of-the-art observatory, so it was free of charge to visitors. He felt common people should be able to enjoy the wonders of the universe, and not be solely for the scientific community.\nGriffith donated 3,015 acres of land specifically to house the observatory that opened on May 14, 1935. During the first five days after the opening, the planetarium averaged more than 13,000 visitors a day. One of the major attractions was the Foucault Pendulum that is designed to show the earth's rotation and the Zeiss reflecting telescope. The observatory has a striking view of Los Angeles and Hollywood, and the Pacific Ocean can be seen on clear days from there.\nIn 2002 the planetarium was subjected to a $93 million renovation and expansion, which closed the museum for four years. After it reopened in 2006, the facility expanded underground with new exhibits, a cafe, a gift shop, and a theater. The Wilder Hall of the Eye section concentrates on the astronomical aspect of the observatory. It is where people can view the stars through the observatory's telescope, and features an interactive exhibit that is very popular. The Ahmanson Hall of the Sky is another popular attraction for viewing images in the night sky that are visible to the naked eye. The observatory frequently stages viewing nights when the public is invited to bring their own telescopes. It is open daily, and remains free of charge."

He has been described by his 18th Century peers, and historians alike, as the \"First American.\" This is due to the fact that Franklin played an integral part in creating a revolutionary force in colonial America in defiance of British rule. Franklin wore many hats during his lifetime. He was a politician, inventor, postmaster, scientist, and journalist. He served as President of the state of Pennsylvania, U.S. Minister of France, the first Postmaster General, and Speaker of Pennsylvania.\nFranklin was born on January 17, 1706 in Boston, Massachusetts into a family of 10 children. His family was working-class, so Franklin's rise to prominence was not an easy one. His parents wanted Benjamin to become a clergy member of their church, but at the age of 12, Franklin began working as a printer's apprentice with his older brother. This is where Franklin learned the printing, and news trade that would eventually lead to his Poor Richard's Almanac, and The Philadelphia Gazette publications. This is where Franklin amassed his considerable wealth.\nFranklin was also a prolific inventor. He is responsible for inventing such items as the Franklin stove, lightning rod, bifocal glasses, and a flexible catheter. Part of America's popular lore has Franklin proving that lightning has electrical properties by flying a kite in a thunderstorm. This may, or may not have been true, but his legend is firmly in place.\nFranklin was a tireless separatist, and fought the English for colonial independence with dogged tenacity. He made at least two diplomatic trips to the British Isles to petition for colonial independence. Upon his return from the second trip, the revolutionary war with England had already begun. He was one of the original signers of the historic Declaration of Independence."

        "content": "One of the most important things a person can have is a good resume. Having a good resume increases a job seeker's chances of acquiring a good-paying job. A resume is basically a promotional document that nearly all employers ask for when seeking to fill an open position. Think of a resume as a snapshot, or picture of you. It contains all the important information employers need to know who you are, and what your qualifications are. It also includes your educational background, your previous work experiences, special skills, certificates, and most importantly, contact information.\nA resume should be written in a short and concise manner. Job seekers should try to get as much information onto a resume as possible using the least number of words. The resume should not be more than one page in length, although for more experienced job seekers, a two-page resume may be acceptable. Human Resource professionals, who are responsible for finding new employees, want to know what talents a job seeker can bring to their organization, so a good way to start a resume is to have a skills section at the top. By listing your skills first, an HR employee can quickly get an idea of what skills and talents the job seeker has.\nAfter listing your skills, you can then list either work experience or education. What comes after the skill section is an individual decision. For instance, if a person is looking for work straight after college, it would probably be best to list education first. However, if a person has a long work history, it might be best to begin with work experience. A good piece of advice would be to take your resume to a professional for review to see if you are going in the right direction."

        "content": "One of the best feelings anyone can have is when they buy their first car. Buying a car may seem like an easy thing to do, but it is a bit more than that. Buying the right car to fit a particular need is not as easy as it seems. The first thing a new car buyer should do is to figure out how much he or she can buy. Car prices range from a couple of thousand dollars for a used vehicle to over ten or twenty thousand for a new one.\nOnce a buyer determines the price of a car that he or she can afford, it is time to start shopping. One way to shop for a car is to use the Internet. There are many websites that deal exclusively in finding the right car for any person. Try cars.com, or autotrader.com for starters. Additionally, most major car dealerships have their own online websites, where prospective buyers can sit in the comfort of their own home and search for cars. All of these websites let buyers narrow their search using filters such as minimum and maximum prices, make, model, year, color, and new or used. These are very powerful tools that are available to consumers with just a click of the mouse. Another way to find a car is the old-fashioned way, that is, to visit a car dealership and talk to a sales person.\nOnce a car is purchased, it must be registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). For most new car sales through dealerships, the registration is taken care of for the consumer. The registration paperwork and fees are sent directly to the DMV. When a used car is purchased through a private owner, the registration has to be done by the buyer. It is a simple process. Just go to the DMV with the paperwork, pay the fee and they'll do the rest."

        "content": "Virtually everyone in the United States has a credit report. Credit reports are an important factor in the lives of most people. These reports are like a running log, or diary, or your credit transactions. A good credit report can be a great asset to an individual just as a poor report can make it difficult for people to better their lives. There are three major credit report agencies in the U.S., Transunion, Equifax and Experian. All work in the same way. The agencies take your credit history, accounts, and trends to establish your personal credit rating. It is a complicated process, but if you apply some common-sense financial practices, you can raise your rating as time goes by.\nThe most basic aspect of any credit rating is how individuals pay their bills. Too many missed payments or late payments will lower your score, so it is important to always make your payments on time. Another consideration is having too many credit card accounts. Once you have a good credit rating, you will begin getting offers from banks that want your business. The general rule is to have no more than a couple of credit cards. If you are going to have multiple accounts, it is best to have one Visa and one MasterCard, although some people prefer American Express cards. Another thing to watch for is your balances.\nCredit card balances are important because they show the credit bureaus how you manage your accounts. It is best to use no more than 60 percent of your credit card limit. So, if you have a $1,000 credit limit, try to keep your balance around $600.  If you use too much of your balance, it tells the bureaus that you are stretched for money. Be smart with your accounts, and a good credit rating will follow."

        "title": "Attachment Parenting",
        "content": "Having your kid physically attached to you probably doesn't sound like fun, but an American pediatrician, William Sears, promotes a style of parenting that keeps small children as physically attached as possible. This is called attachment parenting.\nThe idea behind attachment parenting is that if a small baby feels protected and safe by physical contact with their parent, especially their mother, that child will grow up to be a more independent adult. One way parents are encouraged to be close to their babies is by using a sling or a wrap to carry the baby around instead of putting the baby in a carriage. This is often called \"wearing\" your baby. Parents are also encouraged to sleep with their babies. Parents are too big to fit in a crib, so instead parents are told to bring the baby into the adult bed. This is supposed to teach the baby about sleep regulation as well since the baby will learn to mimic adult sleep patterns. This co-sleeping is controversial though. There are concerns that babies sleeping with adults could suffocate, accidentally get crushed, or fall off the bed. There is also concern about sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, where babies just suddenly stop breathing.\nAnother marker of attachment parenting is not worrying about spoiling a baby. Many times parents feel that paying attention to a baby's every cry makes them too needy or spoiled. Attachment parenting feels that every baby's cry should be responded to and that the baby should never be left to \"cry it out.\" Instead, the baby should be comforted and crying should be taken as a signal that the baby needs something. Most attachment parents also breastfeed on demand, feeling that not only is this physically healthier, but also promotes a bond between mother and child."

When Chaco made his first sound, Rob couldn't believe his ears. Rob expected a quack, but Chaco honked. Chaco was no duck. Chaco was a goose.\nRob didn't reject Chaco though. He kept him as long as he could. Chaco was not a quiet goose. He made a lot of noise, honking day and night. Rob's neighbors started to complain. Rob didn't want to give Chaco up, but he couldn't risk his neighbors calling the police on him either. Rob had to make a decision.\nRob decided to take Chaco to a nearby park that had a lake with other geese. Rob felt sad leaving Chaco and he was pretty sure his feathered friend felt sad, too. Rob goes twice a week to the park to visit Chaco so that both the goose and the owner are less sad. When Rob goes to visit, Chaco swims across the lake right into Rob's arms. Sometimes, Chaco will even give Rob a little peck, a goose's way of giving a kiss.\nWhen Rob goes to visit, he always brings snacks for Chaco. The other geese seemed to be jealous of all the attention Chaco was getting, so now Rob brings enough bread for all the geese to share. Rob and Chaco also play. Rob throws his former pet into the lake. Chaco goes underwater, swims a little, and then returns to the shore so that Rob can throw him in again."

It wasn't until it was time for her to get up from the plane seat that she realized her legs were shaking, her heart was racing, and her forehead was sweating.\n\"Keep calm!\" she kept repeating to herself the whole way to her new apartment. She had worked so hard to get here, and she knew that she had nothing to be afraid of. Still, as she looked out of her new living-room window, the world outside looked much too scary to face. Having grown up on the West Coast her whole life, she was not prepared for how everything looked here. The warm, bright sun that she was so used to seeing out this time of year was nowhere to be seen. Everyone's accents seemed completely unfamiliar, and the people even seemed taller than normal.\nShe decided to stay in the safety of her apartment that night and didn't go outside until it was time for her class the following afternoon. As the professor asked some basic questions to see what level everyone was at, Andrea's mind went completely blank. \"Oh no!\" she thought to herself. \"I'm not even supposed to be here! Everyone knows so much more than me.\" Just then, the professor pointed at her and asked her a question about the functions of the spinal cord. As frightened as she was, the answer was just blurted out of her mouth instinctively. \"Impressive!\" says the teacher. \"You'll do just great here.\" she assured her. As the teacher walked away, one of the pesky giant ants crawled across Andrea's desk. She quickly flicked it off the edge, and then smiled confidently."

He had worked so hard to get this.\n\"That will be $104.01,\" the salesperson told John. \"Did you advertise it as $94.99?\" John asked angrily. He thought the salesperson was trying to take advantage of him. \"Yes, it is, but we have to add sales tax. It's the law. In California the sales tax is 9.5 percent, \"the salesperson explained. \"Why don't you just put the final price on advertisements and price tags then?\" John asked. \"Then everything seems more expensive and people won't come into the store to buy,\" the salesperson explained. \"Everything is more expensive!\" John said angrily, walking out of the store without the telescope."

However, there are those who would argue that there were others who were just as great. Ali was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and was first called Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., but changed his name in the late 1960s after adopting Islam as his religion.\nAli was not only one of the greatest heavyweight boxers ever to step into the ring, but also a deeply spiritual person who defied the United States government by standing on his ethics. He was a controversial and divisive man who elicited great emotion from those who loved him, and those who wanted him jailed.\nAli was on top of his profession in the late 60s when his draft classification was changed. He was ordered to enlist in the Army, but he refused. He claimed that he could not go to war because of his religious convictions. Many saw this move by the U.S. government as a way to silence the outspoken boxer because he was well beyond the age most young American men were being drafted at the time. Ali was stripped of his title, and was banned from boxing, while his case went through the U.S. court system. Ali was inactive during his ablest years from the age 25 to almost 29. There is no telling how many more victories and titles he could have won during his stolen prime.\nEventually, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an 8 - 0 decision in Ali's favor, overturning his conviction of draft evasion. His stance was not popular at the time among conservative Americans; many people disliked him very much, but his determination and moral principles held up his decision. He is now regarded as one of the most influential persons in the history of the U.S. He was named \"Sportsman of the Century\" by Sports Illustrated magazine, and \"Sports Personality of the Century\" by the BBC."

Most of these holidays, or days of recognition, are obscure and may be regionally based, but the U.S. enjoys many holidays throughout the year. Holidays are basically days people can take off work or school. There are a handful of federal holidays that most companies, government offices, states, and residents celebrate yearly. These days are given to the people of the United States to break the routine of working eight hours a day, seven days a week. They differ from vacation time. Vacation time is personal experiences that take place at a time and place the vacationer and his or her employer agrees on.\nThe first federal or national holiday takes place right at the beginning of the year on January 1st. New Year's Day is the first of several government holidays. It is followed by Martin Luther King Jr. Day, President's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The reason why some of these holidays do not have a fixed day or date is because they are celebrated on a Monday to give workers a three-day holiday from work. This practice came into being a number of years ago, leaving few fixed-date holidays such as New Year's Day, Independence Day, and Christmas Day.\nEach holiday celebrates a different event or person. Memorial Day, for example, is in memory of those who have died while in the service of their country during their time in the military. Thanksgiving Day celebrates the first meal shared by Native Americans and the colonists from Europe. Each holiday is unique and is celebrated in different ways."

It was considered a sophisticated habit that many of the nation's elite members engaged in, which was later copied by the general populace of the country. Younger people who smoked were the \"cool\" kids. Many young people, who wanted to fit into the group, started to smoke at an early age only to discover that the habit caused quite a bit of harm to them.\nThere was a time when cigarette advertisements were everywhere. It was legal to run commercial ads on television, radio, billboards, and bus benches, but all that changed sometime in the 1970s. Today, tobacco companies are limited in how and where they can advertise their deadly products. Generally speaking, smoking has fallen out of favor with most Americans because of the consequences associated with the habit.\nCigarette smoking is the leading, preventable cause of death in the U.S. today. Its effects on the human body are many, and can be devastating. More than 480,000 Americans die from the negative effects of cigarette smoking each year. Cigarette smoking can lead to cancer, stroke, lung disease, and the overall health deterioration of the smoker. Smoking can make it more difficult for women to become pregnant, and smoking while pregnant not only affects the mother, it also has a negative effect on the unborn fetus. It can also lead to premature birth, low birth weight in newborns, and even stillborn babies. In men, cigarette smoking can reduce sperm count making it more difficult to father a child. When a smoker smokes in public, he or she is also fouling the air, and affecting those who do not smoke. It also makes people's clothes and breath smell. In all, it is a very bad habit."

Unlike ground vehicle hijacking, which is done for financial gain for the most part, skyjacking is a darker, more dangerous, potentially life-threatening action. During the mid-1960s to the 1970s, about 160 aircraft were skyjacked worldwide. In the United States, many had taken control of aircraft, but no one had ever escaped the reach of law enforcement with one glaring exception, D.B. Cooper.\nD.B. Cooper's real name is Dan Cooper, but his legend began as D.B. Cooper because of a mistake by the media in 1971. On November 24, Cooper hijacked a Boeing 727 jetliner after purchasing a one-way ticket from Portland to Seattle, Washington. Cooper demanded $200,000, and four parachutes to be delivered upon arrival to Seattle. Authorities complied with his ransom request, and Cooper let all 36 passengers, and most of the crew off the plane at that time.\nOnce back in the air, Cooper directed the pilot to fly to Mexico, but the jet's fuel was not enough to make there without stopping to refuel. It was decided to land in Reno, Nevada for refueling. When the aircraft reached Reno, Cooper was not on board. It is thought that Cooper jumped out of the aircraft somewhere in the wooded forests of Oregon. He had ordered the plane to fly at the lowest possible speed, and to fly at only a 10,000 foot elevation. The legend of D.B. Cooper was born.\nTo this date, the Cooper skyjacking is the only case that is unresolved in the United States. Cooper was never found, nor was any evidence of the $200,000, and his parachute. Many believe Cooper could not survive a drop of such a great altitude, while others say the absence of any of the money, or any evidence of his death proves he survived. In any event, D.B. Cooper is a true American legend."

She was diagnosed with \"Brain Fever,\" by her family doctor, but most people speculated that she suffered from either Scarlet Fever, or Meningitis. Unable to see, or hear, Keller became difficult to deal with as her behavior was described by her family and friends as wild.\nSoon Keller and her family developed their own type of sign language that allowed them to communicate on a limited basis. Helen's mother sought help for her anguished child, which eventually led to Anne Sullivan, who was a recent graduate of the Perkins Institute for the Blind. The school had been successful in the past in educating blind students, and Sullivan was one of its star graduates. Once Sullivan and Keller got through the difficult beginnings, their friendship, and association lasted for 49 years.\nKeller was determined to become educated, and to teach herself to communicate. After attending several schools, she became the first deaf and blind person to earn a college degree. She became very well-known, and began a lecture tour where she addressed social and political issues, including women's suffrage, and birth control.\nIn 1920, she helped found the American Civil Liberties Union, which is still active today. She addressed Congress to raise awareness to the plight of the blind. Through all her accomplishments, she fell into disfavor with the American public because of her socialist views later in her life.

Obama is a representative of the Democratic Party with his presidency coming after the controversial George W. Bush left office.\nOne of the defining aspects of his presidency is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly and inaccurately called Obamacare. This act, passed into law by the U.S. Congress and signed by the president in March 2010, became effective on January 1, 2014. It is the single, most significant change in government healthcare since Medicare was implemented in 1965. This act was intended to increase the affordability of care for Americans, expand insurance coverage, and lower the uninsured rate in the country. It is a controversial act that has many detractors, but most Americans now carry health insurance, which was not true before 2014.\nObama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1961. He is a graduate of both Columbia University in New York City, and Harvard Law School. Before becoming president, he served as senator for the state of Illinois. He is considered a liberal by many southern conservatives, but this may be an unfair label. The perception is largely due to the Affordable Care Act, and his attempts at immigration reform. Additionally, Obama ended the U.S. involvement in the Iraq war. He also ordered the military operation that eventually resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden.

The rest of the rent is paid directly by the government to a landlord. Not all landlords accept Section 8. If you qualify for Section 8, it is your responsibility to find a landlord who accepts the program.\nEligibility for the program depends on your annual income and how many people are in your family. To qualify you have to be a U.S. citizen or a legal resident of the U.S. If you are undocumented or have a tourist visa, you cannot apply for this program. Like with all public housing programs, you will have to fill out an application to see if you qualify. On the application you will have to say how much money you make, how much money you have in the bank, and how many people are in your family. You will have to give proof of how much you make. The government will ask to speak to your boss, see your bank statements and proof that you pay taxes.\nIf you qualify, you will probably be put on a waiting list. Section 8, like other public housing programs, has many people applying for them. You could be waiting many years before you actually get a voucher, which is like a coupon that says how much rent the government is willing to pay for you.

Once invited, it is very important to let the host know if you are actually going to show up. Many times hosts have a party catered, which means other people prepare the food.

However, she trusted destiny's decision and bought the painting for five dollars. After putting it up online, she began receiving dozens of emails asking if the picture frame displayed came with the painting.

Emily had only completed her general education classes at community college, and now the focus was in her subject of interest.\nEmily passed all her classes with flying colors in a span of two years. It took all her dedication and will power to finish her education. Emily received her bachelor's degree in sociology. Her daughters would look up to their mother in the years to come and realize that it's never too late to go back to school."

The U.S. boasts not only a great number of professional sport teams and leagues, but also a great amateur network of sports and events. In the U.S., there are four major professional leagues of sports teams. They are Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), and the National Hockey League (NHL). Each one of these leagues is very popular and is also very profitable for the owners of the teams. Nearly every major city in the United States has a team from each one of the leagues. Some cities have more though.\nLos Angeles has two NFL teams, the Rams and the Chargers; two baseball teams, the Dodgers and the Angels; two basketball teams, the Lakers and the Clippers; two NHL teams, the Kings and the Ducks. It is one of a handful of cities that have multiple teams within its region. There is also a professional soccer league in the U.S. now. It came into existence in the mid-1990s after the U.S. hosted the World Cup in Southern California in 1994. The league was created as a condition imposed by the international football association FIFA to host the games in the U.S. Soccer, as the rest of the world calls it, is not as popular in the U.S. as in much of the world, but it has gained some momentum since 1994.\nAmateur sports also thrive in the U.S. One of the most popular sports in the amateur world is college football. Nearly every university across the country has an American football team, and there are thousands of colleges and universities in the country. Most of these schools belong to a league that can contain several schools, and most of these schools field basketball, baseball, hockey, and soccer teams, too."

Amy knew the transition would be difficult at first, but was confident that she would love her new life and succeed in becoming a Broadway star. She had envisioned herself getting off the airplane and immediately making new friends with whom she would spend her nights exploring The City That Never Sleeps.\nUnfortunately, the reality of Amy's situation was far from the perfect life she had imagined. Her days were spent jumping from theatre to theatre looking for auditions. Although she was very pretty, and great at acting, her accent made it difficult for her to get hired for any roles. Directors kept telling her to work on her American accent, but the more she practiced it, the more she sounded like a cowboy rather than a New Yorker.\nAmy's nights were spent working at a diner in order to pay for her ridiculously expensive one-room apartment where the sinks always leaked and the hot water never worked. To top it all off, the city that she had imagined as being filled with bright lights and friendly faces like in the movies was made up mostly of smelly alleys, big rats, and angry crowds that were always in a hurry to get somewhere. Still, Amy didn't let anything crush her spirits, and was determined to keep working hard until her dreams would come true.\nFinally one day, Amy was clearing some tables in the diner while singing her favorite song as usual. \"Excuse me,\" said a man in a nearby booth. \"I couldn't help but notice that you have a beautiful voice.\" Amy blushed and thanked the man. \"I'm actually casting for a star in my new Broadway musical of Mary Poppins,\" he continued. \"How would you feel about acting?\" Amy's heart raced with excitement just as Frank Sinatra's \"New York, New York\" began playing on the diner's jukebox. She was finally going to make it."

Helen confirmed this.\n\"My neighborhood is right next to yours,\" Helen told Patricia while they were both checking out customers. \"Drop by anytime you want on a day when we're both not working,\" Helen said. Patricia took the invitation too literally. She was able to get Helen's address from their manager at work. \"I want to surprise my new friend,\" Patricia told the manager. The manager thought that was sweet and without thinking about Helen's privacy, he passed the address onto Patricia. On a day that Patricia and Helen both had the day off, Patricia looked up Helen's address on her map application on her cell phone. Helen's house was only 10 minutes away.\nPatricia followed the directions, and at 9:00 a.m., she rang the doorbell at 2374 Evergreen Avenue. It took Helen awhile to answer the door. She looked genuinely surprised, but also confused when she saw Patricia on her doorstep. \"What are you doing here? How did you get my address?\" Helen asked. She was still in her pajamas and her hair was a mess. \"You told me to drop by anytime we both had a day off, so I got your address from our manager. I want to give you a surprise!\" Patricia said. \"I was just being polite. You can't just show up at someone's house!\" Helen said before slamming the door on Patricia's face."

Madonna, as she is commonly known, burst onto the music scene in the early 1980s with a style that had never been seen before. Her sexy, and scantily clad costumes and performances both delighted and aggravated the American public for years. She excelled at pushing the boundaries of what most Americans perceived as acceptable in her music videos and live performances. Madonna did not shy away from controversial subjects, either.\nMadonna was born in Bay City, Michigan in 1958. She moved to New York City to pursue a career in dancing as a young woman. She began her music career with a couple of club bands in New York, but was soon noticed by music industry executives. In 1983, she released her first album titled simply, \"Madonna.\" This was just the beginning for the superstar. She followed her initial success with several hit albums and singles such as Like a Virgin, and Into the Groove. She coupled her commercial success in music with successful performances in a series of movies such as Desperately Seeking Susan, and Evita. It seemed there was nothing Madonna could not do.\nOne of Madonna's defining characteristics is her ability to reinvent herself. Many artists find success in the very competitive, entertainment industry, but most are only successful for a short period of time, but not Madonna. She has sold more than 300 million records worldwide to date. She ranked second only to the Beatles on Billboard's list of Greatest Acts of the 20th Century.\nMadonna's career has not been without controversy, though. She has been the subject of several lawsuits for her acts, but she survived, and thrived through it all. She is still one of the best female artists in the United States today."

On both days banks, schools and the post offices were closed; on both holidays, stores offered special sales; on both holidays, people hung the American Flag, and sometimes there were even fireworks. Laura had seen on television that on both days the President of the United States made a speech and visited a cemetery laying a wreath on the grave of a soldier. Laura decided to ask the mailman Brian what the difference was. She figured he would know since he had both days off from work.\nThe next day when Brian was dropping off Laura's mail, she asked him. Brian explained that Memorial Day is usually observed on the last Monday of May. This meant that it could be on a different date every year. Memorial day is a day for remembering and honoring those in the military who died, especially if they died in a battle. Brian also told Laura that Memorial Day was also considered the unofficial start of summer. Many public beaches would open on Memorial Day. Veterans day is a day set aside to thank and honor all people who served in the United States military. Brian explained that Veterans Day is also to remember those that are still alive. Brian told Laura that the date for Veterans Day never changes. It is always held on November 11, which was the date when World War I ended in 1918."

Having a car would make traveling much more convenient. Joel had been getting around by means of public transportation. He was ready to stop taking the bus to school and work.\nThe first thing Joel had to do was to go to DMV to register the car under his name. After that, he took a driving manual book from DMV to study for the written test. Passing the written test was the only way to get a driving permit.  Joel studied for a few days, and passed his test. With the permit in hand, Joel next had to find someone to teach him how to drive.\nJoel already knew who to ask for driving lessons. \"If I'm going to teach you how to drive, you're going to have to commit 100 percent.

It is a beautiful drive, winding lazily in and out of sight of the sea, and going up hills and down coastal valleys. For first-time cruisers, it could be breathtaking.\nOne lazy Saturday, I was a bit bored, so I called my girlfriend, who was studying for her English test on the coming Monday, to see if she wanted to go for a ride. \"Hey Sheila, want to go for a cruise?\" She hemmed and hawed for a while before finally agreeing to go with me. \"Where are we going?\" she asked, but I wanted it to be a surprise. She had been hitting the books pretty hard lately because of her upcoming mid-term exams. I figured she needed a break, and so did I.\nWe started driving. Soon we were going through the Santa Monica tunnel. This tunnel is especially nice. When you enter it, you have no clue what is waiting at the other end. As soon as the exit comes into view, the ocean, in all its glory, appears right before your eyes. Sheila was instantly delighted. She turned to me after a while and said \"Thanks, baby. I really needed this.\" I said \"Me too, babe.\"\nWe talked for what seemed like hours. After that we went up and down, left and right, with the ocean as our companion. We ended up in Santa Barbara, a coastal town about 140 miles north of Los Angeles. It was getting late, so we decided to stay for the night. Santa Barbara is a college town, so it's easy to find affordable rooms to spend the night. That was one of the best nights of my young life."

Anthony was fighting for women's rights long before the social revolution 50 years ago. She was born in 1820 to a Quaker family. Quakers are a close-knit, faith-based group of people who live a very simple and strict life. It is a traditional way of life where gender roles are clearly defined.\nShe spent much of her early life fighting for social change. She was an anti-slavery abolitionist, teacher, author, and was a leading figure in gaining women the right to vote, and to hold office. The suffrage movement was designed to gain voting rights for women who previously had no voice in government. Another social cause Anthony was heavily involved with was the anti-slavery movement. Anthony made her family farm available for like-minded people to have anti-slavery meetings. She was involved in the abolitionist movement until the end of the American Civil War, when slavery was abolished. She then turned her attention to women's rights.\nAnthony founded a weekly publication called \"The Revolution\", which she used to publish women's rights literature. The newspaper's motto was \"Men their rights, and nothing more; women their rights, and nothing less.\"\nIn 1872, after touring the country trying to build momentum for women's rights, she illegally voted in the presidential election. She was arrested and fined, even though she fought. Anthony never paid the fine. The incident served to bring more awareness to the struggle women had to endure. Anthony fought the good fight until her death in 1905 at the age of 84. She is honored today by the United States mint with the Susan B. Anthony $1 coin."

They were also of the same age. She was in Joe's class, and she remembered Joe, too.\nAfter about two weeks, they were going steady. Joe was so happy, but had to hide his relationship from his parents, which was okay because Carmen was hiding him from her family, too! \"Are you kidding me?\" Carmen said, \"They would kill me if they knew I had a boyfriend!\" Everything was going great for a time, but Joe's mom was right. His grades started slipping, and he soon was on academic probation because he was spending too much of his free time with Carmen. She also dropped a grade or two. As a result, both of them had to go to summer school to improve their grades, but Joe didn't care. He was in love and that was all that mattered at the time.

He is credited for being the father of the modern computer, and for almost single-handedly starting the personal computer revolution. He studied at Harvard University, but did not graduate because of his desire to develop new software.\nAs a 13-year-old student at the Lakeside School, which was an exclusive college preparatory school, Gates was introduced to computer programming. That year he developed a program that allowed users to play tic-tac-toe against the computer. Gates was reportedly fascinated by the computer's ability to reproduce software code. In 1975, Gates approached a company called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). He convinced the owner that he had written a program that would work with his platform. The owner of the company bought into Gates innovations, and the two men reached an agreement to develop software for MITS. The Microsoft Company was born.\nGates went on to develop the Windows operating system with then partner IBM Corporation. The two companies had differences though, and their partnership ended quickly. Gates left Microsoft in 2000, but remains on its board of directors.

Despite not having homes with big yards, some apartment dwellers still seek the companionship that domesticated animals like dogs and cats offer. Some people feel that having a pet, even in a small space, is good for teaching children responsibility.\nHowever, many landlords forbid tenants from having pets, specifically cats and dogs, because of the damage the animals can do to carpets. Some landlords even forbid birds because of the noise they make. Many landlords charge an extra fee, known as a pet deposit, to tenants who want to keep pets. This is to pay for repairs or cleaning caused by the pet.\nMany times apartment dwellers will choose animals, like fish, hermit crabs, guinea pigs or hamsters, that make little noise, little mess, and won't chew up the furniture. Other people keep lizards as pets, since they don't require much space and can be kept in small cages or tanks. Another benefit of these smaller pets is that they don't need to be walked. However, some people who live in apartments have pets that are not so ordinary. Some of these less than ordinary pets include mammals like hedgehogs, amphibians like frogs, and spiders like tarantulas. Not all exotic pets are legal though.\nIn order to maintain public safety, some cities and states have laws banning specific animals as pets. New York City, for example, bans people from keeping ferrets, snapping turtles, pythons, and scorpions as pets. It seems unlikely that a family would have a polar bear named Fluffy or a whale named Bubbles as a pet, New York City has specific laws banning these wild animals from residences. These laws exist for a good reason. In 2003, a man in a Manhattan apartment  was discovered to have a 350-pound Bengal tiger as a pet."

The ancient Greeks are said to have included a form of boxing as far back as 600 BC. The modern sport of boxing can be traced to the 16th Century when it became a popular sport in Great Britain. Today, the sport still uses a variation of the Marquess of Queensberry rules that were established in 1867. Boxing is the purest form of competition. It pits one man, or woman, against another in an enclosed ring with only the person's fists as weapons. Early matches in the United States featured bare-knuckle fighting, but today boxers use protective gloves.\nOne of the most successful boxers in America is Mike Tyson. Tyson holds several boxing records. The greatest is possibly when he became the youngest boxer ever to win the heavyweight championship in three different boxing organizations. Tyson was just over 20 years old when he accomplished this feat. He was one of the most feared fighters of his time. Tyson won a total of 50 fights with 44 of those victories coming by knockout.\nTwelve of Tyson's knockouts came in the first round, which earned him the nickname of Iron Mike. Eventually, his advancing age and fast living took their toll on Tyson. By the early 90s, his career was virtually over. Even though his boxing career lasted until 2002, Tyson was never the same. He went on to a brief acting career, most notably in the popular 2009 comedy hit The Hangover.\nTyson's post-boxing career had its ups and downs. He appeared on Barbara Walter's talk show with his wife, television actress Robin Givens, where Givens called Tyson a manic-depressive, and that living with him was pure torture. Tyson was arrested in 1991 for raping an 18-year-old girl, and spent several years in jail. He has attempted several comebacks, but has never regained his old glory."

Forrest is allowed to attend a regular public school.\nBecause of his athletic ability, Gump gets a scholarship to play football at the University of Alabama, where he excels at the game. Upon graduation, he is approached by an army recruiter, and joins the military, where again he excels. Gump is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving the lives of many of his fellow troops during a vicious firefight in the Vietnam War.\nAfter his time in the service, Gump wins an international ping pong competition in China, brings down President Richard Nixon while staying at the infamous, Watergate Hotel, meets three presidents, and goes on several, cross-country runs that gain massive media attention. Throughout his life, Gump maintains solid relationship with his friends from the Army, and dearly loves his only childhood friend and sweetheart, Jenny. Forrest Gump touches the American spirit like no other film ever has."

        "content": "A housewarming party is a special party to be held when someone buys or moves into a new apartment or house. The person or people who bought the property or moved are the ones who throw the party. The party is an opportunity for friends and family to congratulate the person on the new home. It also gives people a chance to see what the new home looks like. It is an opportunity to fill the new space with love  and hopefully presents.\nIt is traditional to bring a gift to a housewarming party. Some people register a list of items they want or need for their new home at a local store or stores. Some common items people will put on a gift registry include kitchen tools like knives and items like curtains. Even if there isn't a registry, a good housewarming gift is something to decorate the new house with like a piece of art or a plant. You can also bring food or drinks to share with the other guests. This is often appreciated since at a housewarming there isn't a lot of food served, usually just appetizers or sandwiches. There are usually no planned activities like games at a house warming party. The host or hostess of the party will, however, probably give all the guests a tour of their new home. Sometimes, because a housewarming party happens shortly after a person moves into their new home, people may be asked to help unpack boxes. This isn't usual though.\nHousewarming parties get their name from the fact that a long time ago people would actually bring firewood to a new home as a gift. This was so that the person could keep their home warm for the winter. Now most homes have central heating and don't use fires to keep warm."

Even when Maggie came back to the United States, the two friends kept in touch with each other via Facebook and Skype.\nMaggie waved to Lisa from the table in the restaurant when she saw her Chilean friend walk in. Lisa looked the same, just a little older and a little fatter. \"Tell me what is new with you?\" Maggie asked Lisa. Lisa explained that she worked for an airline and was in town on business. \"I get to travel all the time now,\" Lisa told Maggie. \"Oh, really?\" Maggie replied. \"Yes really, and I can even sometimes get tickets for friends and family members at really low prices,\" Lisa continued. \"Oh, really?\" Maggie replied. Maggie was annoying Lisa. Lisa was beginning to feel like Maggie didn't believe what she was saying. \"I can show you the memo from my job that explains it all if you don't believe me,\" Lisa said angrily. \"Why wouldn't I believe you?\" Maggie asked and confused.  She thought it was great that Lisa had a job that took her all over the world, and that even let her do it with friends and family.\n\"Well, you keep saying oh, really?' like you are challenging what I'm saying,\" Lisa said. Maggie explained that when she said \"oh really\", it just meant she found what Lisa was saying interesting and wanted her to elaborate. \"Oh, really?\" Lisa said before the two friends both burst out laughing."

He was surprised to find that the featured poet was none other than his friend Anthony. Ken decided to see what his old pal was up to.\nKen sat in the last row of the area set up inside the bookstore. When Anthony was introduced and came up the podium, Ken hardly recognized him.

Anthony's poetry was quite good.\nAnthony recognized Ken sitting in the back row.  When the reading was over, Ken stood in line with the others waiting for Anthony to sign a copy of his book. When it was Ken's turn, Anthony stood up and hugged his long lost friend. Anthony invited Ken to stay until he had finished signing books. Ken did, and the two men grabbed a cup of coffee at a nearby caf.\nEven though so many years had passed since the two had seen each other, both men had a lot in common. Both graduated from college with degrees in comparative literature. Both went to graduate school. Anthony got his Master's of Fine Art in writing.  Ken went to law school. Both men married Mexican women. Both men divorced. Both men also had sons that were only a year apart. Ken and Anthony decided not to lose touch again.

Walt Disney World opened 16 years later in Orlando, Florida, as part of a much larger complex that includes the Epcot Center, the Disney Animal Kingdom, and the Disney Hollywood Studios, but for many years, it was just Disneyland in Southern California. Then came Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California, just a stone's throw away from Disneyland.\nKnott's touts itself as \"America's 1st Theme Park,\" and technically it is, but its beginnings are not like Disneyland. Knott's was originally a place where local residents could buy berries and preserves. It did not become a major theme park attraction until well after Disneyland was built. Nevertheless, it is today one of the favorite attractions for both young and old visitors to the region. The park features world-class roller coaster rides, and shows. It also has an annual Halloween themed night called \"Fright Night,\" which has become a very popular attraction in the past 20 years.\nAnother famous theme park in the L.A. area is Magic Mountain, which is located in Valencia, California, just a few miles north of the Los Angeles basin. It also features world-class rides and attractions, and has been featured in several Hollywood films, including the original vacation movie with Chevy Chase. These three parks form the core of Southern California-based theme parks, but there are more theme parks in the region including Legoland, Sea World, Universal Studios, and the California Adventure next to Disneyland. These are just some of the major attractions Americans can visit to have a good time in Southern California."

All of his friends had been driving since the age of eighteen, and Joel felt like he was left behind.

The only problem was finding steady employment.\nJoel felt like he had applied everywhere possible. He had walked into several fast food restaurants. He had stepped in countless coffee shops. He had visited various retail stores and supermarkets. Joel went around shaking the hands of managers, introducing himself as a college student who was interested in working. Joel mingled with employees and talk to frequent customers, in hopes of getting some recognition or even a piece of advice. After submitting application after application, it seemed like he would never get hired. Joel felt like giving up hope.\nBut then one afternoon, Joel received a call for an interview.

I didn't understand why my brother wanted, or felt that he needed to keep his relationship secret.\nA few years later, my brother told me that he had broken up with a girlfriend he had. I asked why, but he didn't want to talk about it. I found out what really happened one day while I was using the computer. My brother had saved his last conversation with Lily. It seemed like Lily had lied to my brother. They had met a couple of times in real life, and they seemed to have had a real relationship. The only problem was that Lily already had a husband. My brother was crushed to find out that she was married. On that day I realized that an online relationship is risky.

So Anthony signed up for a special promotion that included a premium channel for one month free.\nThe customer service representative set an appointment to send a technician to Anthony's house in a week. The appointment wasn't for an exact time. Instead the customer service representative said the technician would come between noon and 2:00 in the afternoon.  When the technician arrived, he set up a converter box and digital recorder box to the family television in the living room. The technician gave Anthony a remote and a channel guide. Anthony had to sign some papers before the technician left.\nAnthony, his wife, and their children enjoyed the hundreds of channels they now had thanks to cable. One month after the technician came and installed all of the equipment, a bill arrived. The bill totaled almost 200 dollars. Anthony could not afford to pay that much on a monthly basis. He discussed it with his wife. They decided not to keep the channels from their country and the premium channels his wife enjoyed.

His father was an attorney; his mother was a banker, who worked for the United Way for many years. He is credited for being the father of the modern computer, and for almost single-handedly starting the personal computer revolution. He studied at Harvard University, but did not graduate because of his desire to develop new software.\nAs a 13-year-old student at the Lakeside School, which was an exclusive college preparatory school, Gates was introduced to computer programming. That year he developed a program that allowed users to play tic-tac-toe against the computer. Gates was reportedly fascinated by the computer's ability to reproduce software code. In 1975, Gates approached a company called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). He convinced the owner that he had written a program that would work with his platform. The owner of the company bought into Gates innovations, and the two men reached an agreement to develop software for MITS. The Microsoft Company was born.\nGates went on to develop the Windows operating system with then partner IBM Corporation. The two companies had differences though, and their partnership ended quickly. Gates left Microsoft in 2000, but remains on its board of directors.

People in the U.S. are free to practice the religion of their choice without fear of persecution. Religious persecution was one of the main reasons many immigrants fled their countries to live in the United States. Various religious faiths have flourished within the United States. A majority of Americans report that religion plays a very important role in their lives, a proportion unique among developed countries. Christianity is the most popular religion in the country, but it is not the only one practiced here by far.\nDuring the country's infancy, Anglicans, Roman Catholics, and mainline Protestants, as well as Jews, arrived from Europe. Various Protestants, who left the Church of England, greatly diversified the religious landscape. Methodist and Baptist churches increased drastically. Jehovah's Witnesses and the Latter Day Saint movement spread also. Beginning in 1990s, the religious share of Christians is decreasing due to secularization, while Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and other religions are spreading. Protestantism, historically dominant, ceased to be the religious category of the majority in the early 2010s. What is most important, however, is that all religions are safe to practice in the United States.\nChristianity is not the only religion to see a decline in membership in recent years. Nearly all religions are shrinking in size because of the country's move to a more secular way of life. Atheism is on the rise in the country as the number of people who claim to be atheist or to have no religious connection is increasing."

People who had similar likes and interests  would gather together to share experiences, make new contacts, and promote themselves, or their businesses.\nOn the Internet, social networking websites made their first appearances during the late 1990s. The first major social networking website in the United States was MySpace. MySpace was a comprehensive, social networking site that allowed its users to exchange messages, share pictures, and make new friends in a way that was never thought of in the past. With MySpace, people who did not go out much could reach out to others from the comfort of their own homes.\nIn 2004, Facebook was created. It was originally a website created for use by Harvard University students, graduates, and faculty, but it soon expanded to include just about everyone. Facebook is an elaborate social networking site that has grown incredibly fast. It is now larger than some of the largest companies in the world. It is a website that is in constant change. New features are added regularly. Facebook has revolutionized the way people stay connected with each other and the rest of the world. The way it works is simple. Users can set up a new account easily. All a new user needs is an email address to start. Once a person has created an account, he, or she can invite friends by sending a request out to people they know who also have their own Facebook pages.

His wife explained that \"to give someone a hand\" could also mean to applaud someone. \"They don't need help. They just want us to clap,\" Jaime's wife said. Jaime felt a little embarrassed. He sat back down and began clapping along with the rest of the audience.\nJaime thought to himself that someone needed to give the English language a hand. How could one phrase mean two different things? He meant the English language needed help."

        "content": "Chanuka, which can also be spelled as Hanukkah, is an 8-day Jewish holiday. It is known as the Festival of Lights, which celebrates the dedication of an ancient Jewish temple in Jerusalem thousands of years ago. According to the Hebrew, or Jewish Bible, a miracle took place then. A one-day supply of oil miraculously lasted eight days. The dates of Hanukkah always change, but usually occur anywhere in late November to Late December.\nThe main way people observe the holiday is by lighting a candle on a candelabra, a special candle holder with space for 9 candles on each of the 8 nights. This candelabra is called a menorah. Now there are also electric menorahs. Some people also use oil lamps. The 9th candle space is usually higher than the others and is lit on every night. This 9th candle is there so that people can see the other candles they are lighting. So, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on. Some families have the head of household light the candles. Other families share the responsibility. The menorah is supposed to be placed somewhere visible like in a window facing the street. The candles are supposed to stay lit for at least 30 minutes after it gets dark. There are also special prayers people say and holy songs sung when the candles are lit.\nSchools and government offices are open for Hanukkah since the observances happen at night. Some families exchange gifts on each night of the holiday. Some foods traditionally eaten on Hanukkah include latkes, fried potato pancakes, and doughnuts. These and other fried foods are eaten because they are cooked in oil and remind people of the oil that lasted for 8 nights. Children play with a special four-sided spinning top called a dreidel."

He wrote two of the most significant novels, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which provided the settings for his novels.\nClemens held a variety of odd jobs as a young man. He was a journalist, miner, printer's apprentice, and typesetter, but journalism was what he liked doing best. His writing style earned him praise from critics worldwide. William Faulkner, another great American author, called him \"The Father of American Literature.\"\nTwain was already a very successful writer when he wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. The main character Tom Sawyer was based on his own experiences as a child. His best friends were also based on real-life friends Twain grew up with. Huckleberry Finn, the main character of his finest work, was also based on a childhood friend.\nTwain was a prolific writer who penned several books, and other publications. Most of his writing was taken from his life in the western part of the United States while traveling with his brother Orion. He was born Christian, but later in life questioned his faith, and developed negative feelings toward organized religion. He was once quoted as saying, \"If Christ were here, now there is one thing he would not be - Christian.\" Twain died in 1910 from a heart attack at the age of 74."

The scenery, fresh air, and new surroundings will please you greatly. Unfortunately, you must always be on the alert for other drivers. Some drivers may not be as cautious as you, and that is why you must always be alert. Even the best drivers get into accidents, and sometimes they can be at fault, too. No one is perfect, and mistakes can happen.\nOnce an accident has happened, it is important to file a claim with your insurance company as soon as possible. Insurance claims are investigated by the insurance company, which means the circumstances surrounding the accident are carefully examined. Usually, when an accident occurs, the local police department will arrive at the scene and write a report. This report is a very important document that your insurance company is sure to request after you place a claim. The report will describe in detail what the police officer has determined has happened to cause the accident. Who caused the accident is very important to insurance companies because whoever is at fault will be the one who pays for the damages caused by the accident.\nSo if someone drives through a stop sign and hits you, the accident is that person's fault and his or her insurance must pay for your damages. If it is you who goes through the stop sign, then it is your fault, and your insurance must pay. If the accident is not your fault, a police report will support your claim that the accident is not your fault. Most claims can be filed online today, but it may be a good idea to go to your insurance carrier's office to file in person. That way there is no confusion."

It was formed in July 1930, and today employs approximately 280,000 people at hundreds of its offices throughout the U.S. Its annual budget for the 2014 fiscal year  is nearly $153 billion, making it one of the largest government agencies in existence today.\nThe Department is broken into three main subdivisions. It consists of the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. The VA Health Administration is responsible for providing veterans with all health care issues, while the Benefits Administration is designed to help veterans in areas such as guaranteed home loans, insurance vocational rehabilitation and educational benefits. The National Cemetery Administration provides burial and memorial benefits, and is entrusted with the maintenance of the VA's cemeteries.\nThe VA has served U.S. veterans from several wars beginning with survivors of World War I. It has continued the tradition of serving former military members by providing services for those veterans who need help readjusting to civilian life. Many of these veterans, especially those who saw combat during their time in the military, are in need of basic medical services for wounds suffered in conflicts. This was the original concept for the creation of the VA.\nSince that time, the VA has expanded greatly, and now provides additional services such as educational benefits, and home-buying assistance. It also helps those veterans who had become homeless after their service to their country ended. There are approximately 30 million military veterans living in the U.S. today. That number represents nearly 10 percent of the population of the country today."

Armstrong set foot on the surface of the moon on July 20, 1969, in what was one of the most watched telecasts in the history of the country. Armstrong became an instant celebrity, whose name became a household word for generations to come.\nThe lunar landing mission was carried out on the Apollo 11 Spacecraft. Armstrong was the mission commander for the historic flight, and was the second and last mission flown by him. There were complications involving the landing module that Armstrong dealt with at the time of the landing. The module was coming in faster than planned. It was destined to miss the landing site by several miles, but some quick thinking by Armstrong prevented a potential disaster.\nWhen Armstrong did step onto the lunar surface, his words echoed throughout the country and the world: \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for Mankind.\" Years later, Armstrong and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) insisted that the quote was incorrect, and was obscured by interference. However, the quote is remembered forever in its original form.\nArmstrong received the Congressional Medal of Freedom from President Richard Nixon, and was later awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Jimmy Carter. The program was discontinued in the early 1970s. Other countries have landed unmanned missions to the Earth's largest satellite, but to date, no other person has walked on the moon since then. Neil Armstrong, a true American hero, died in 2012 folloing complications from a surgical procedure."

Simpson knew this when he transferred to the school in the mid-1960s from San Francisco Community College. At USC, Simpson found fame. His fortune was to come later. He helped the university reach the coveted Rose Bowl berth in 1968, following an outstanding 1967 season where he led the nation in rushing yards. His 64-yard run against arch-rival UCLA, in what many people say was the greatest game in college football history, is what legends are made of. Simpson later played in the National Football League, where he gained more fame and fortune. Upon retirement, he turned to an acting career where he starred in many commercials, and eventually movies.\nUnfortunately, Simpson's life took a tragic turn years later. He was accused of murdering his wife, and her friend in the early 90s. His trial was one of the most watched events in the history of television. Simpson was acquitted of the murder, due largely to his \"Dream Team\" of the high-priced attorneys. Many people believed that Simpson committed the murder and got away with it.\nSimpson was later convicted in a Nevada court for several offenses, and is currently serving time in prison.

        "content": "The United States has a well-developed economic structure. Banks are in the business of lending money, holding savings, helping buy homes, and providing credit to those who are qualified. A credit card can be a useful tool if used wisely. It gives people a sense of freedom by giving them the power to purchase products without cash. Basically, credit card use is a bank loan that the user promises to pay back with interest. Credit card transactions are common in the United States.\nTo acquire a credit card, you can visit a bank, or go online to find banks offering cards. Banks base their interest rate on a person's credit history and assets. The better your credit history, the better position you will be in to get the best credit card interest rate. Interest rates vary greatly. Some can be as high as 20 to 25 percent, while others are well under 10 percent.\nWhen a person first applies for a credit card with little or no credit history, the interest rate will not be as low as it is for a person who has a well-established credit history. However, don't become discouraged. Everyone has to start somewhere. A new credit card holder will probably be limited to a $500 credit line. This is a figure that many banks use for new credit card customers. This limit is in place until the cardholder shows that he or she is a responsible person by making the monthly payments on time. If the credit card payment is due on the 25th day of each month, it will be a good idea to pay it a day or two before that date. With that done, the credit line will increase giving the user more freedom to use his or her card."

Rudy loved playing around with his guitar. Neither one of us had ever taken music lessons, but we loved our instruments. \"Hey Rudy, why don't you come over? We can play for a while,\" I suggested. \"No problem, man. If it's okay with you, I'll bring my cousin Bobby with me. He plays the bass guitar.\" I told him that would be great and waited for them to arrive.\nBobby didn't just play the bass, he jammed at it. \"You're really rock on that bass, Bobby,\" I told him. He said he had been playing for years and wanted to form a band. We all looked at each other, and it hit us like a bolt of lightning. \"We can do this!\" Rudy and I said at the same time. \"All we need is a vocalist,\" I said, to which Bobby chirped, \"I can do that, too!\" That was the beginning of the best Rock N' Roll band ever  \"The Coke Bottles\". Of course that was an exaggeration, but it turned out we were pretty good for a bunch of novices.\nThe three of us began meeting at my place every week to practice playing together and to bounce song ideas off each other. Bobby could actually sing. With Rudy and me putting in all those hours of practice, we got pretty good. We got so good that we played at a couple of parties and at a free Concert in the Park festival about a year later. That was as far as we got though. Rudy joined the Army the following year. Bobby and I were never able to find another lead guitarist, so the greatest Rock N' Roll band \"The Coke Bottles\" never made it big, but that was okay with me. We had our day in the sun."

Inside the base of the statue there is a plaque with a famous poem written on it. The poem is \"The New Colossus\" by Emma Lazarus. Many immigrants feel this poem speaks to them the reasons they came to America. One line of the poem is: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\". Lady Liberty was not always green. She used to be copper colored, but the years have caused the copper that the statue is made of to change color.\nThe 151-foot tall sculpture was a 100th birthday gift from France to the United States in 1886. It is located on Liberty Island right off the southern tip of Manhattan, New York City. The only way to get there is to take a ferry. Inside the base of the statue is a museum. To get to the crown, people have to climb 377 steps up a double spiral staircase from the feet of the statue. There is no elevator. People need to be in good shape to climb to the top.

Anthony was fighting for women's rights long before the social revolution 50 years ago. She was born in 1820 to a Quaker family. Quakers are a close-knit, faith-based group of people who live a very simple and strict life. It is a traditional way of life where gender roles are clearly defined.\nShe spent much of her early life fighting for social change. She was an anti-slavery abolitionist, teacher, author, and was a leading figure in gaining women the right to vote, and to hold office. The suffrage movement was designed to gain voting rights for women who previously had no voice in government. Another social cause Anthony was heavily involved with was the anti-slavery movement. Anthony made her family farm available for like-minded people to have anti-slavery meetings. She was involved in the abolitionist movement until the end of the American Civil War, when slavery was abolished. She then turned her attention to women's rights.\nAnthony founded a weekly publication called \"The Revolution\", which she used to publish women's rights literature. The newspaper's motto was \"Men their rights, and nothing more; women their rights, and nothing less.\"\nIn 1872, after touring the country trying to build momentum for women's rights, she illegally voted in the presidential election. She was arrested and fined, even though she fought. Anthony never paid the fine. The incident served to bring more awareness to the struggle women had to endure. Anthony fought the good fight until her death in 1905 at the age of 84. She is honored today by the United States mint with the Susan B. Anthony $1 coin."

The first orbiting shuttle, Columbia, was launched into space in April 1981. The last mission to space for the shuttle program was carried out by the shuttle Atlantis in July 2011. In all, six orbiters were built including the shuttle Endeavour, which can be seen today at the California Science Center in Los Angeles, California.\nMore than 20 organizations throughout the country petitioned to become home to the retired shuttle in 2012, but Los Angeles gained the prize. Transporting such a huge and complex machine was no easy task. It landed at the Los Angeles International Airport on September 12, 2012, and three weeks later began its journey through the streets of L.A. to the California Science Center in Exposition Park.\nThe orbiter encountered a few problems during its 12-mile journey, and it drew thousands of spectators to the streets to catch a glimpse of the giant spacecraft. Endeavour required a police escort through temporarily closed streets. More than 400 oak trees were cut down to clear the path for the shuttle; power lines and telephone poles had to be removed to accommodate the behemoth. Endeavour also had difficulty crossing bridges throughout the city, but in the end, the shuttle reached its final destination.\nToday, the Endeavour exhibit can be seen at the Samuel Oschin Pavilion at the California Science Center in Los Angeles.

It is observed on a Sunday between the end of March and the end of April. The exact date is calculated based on a different calendar. Many public schools in the U.S. have a week-long vacation around Easter time. Sometimes this break is called Easter or Spring break.\nIn the United States, Easter is also celebrated as a secular holiday. It is associated with the beginning of spring and symbolized by bunnies, flowers, and dyed eggs. Many children in the U.S. believe in a fictional character called the Easter Bunny. According to the myth the Easter Bunny leaves baskets full of candy for children. Sometimes these baskets are hidden and the children have to find them on Easter Sunday morning. Candy that is usually inside an Easter basket can include chocolate in the shape of bunnies or chicks, jellybeans, and marshmallows.\nAnother activity associated with Easter is an Easter egg hunt. According to popular mythology, the Easter Bunny hides painted eggs and children need to find them. While real eggs used to be used, now it is common to use plastic eggs filled with candy. There are usually public Easter egg hunts in parks across the country. The White House even hosts an Easter egg hunt. Another Easter tradition associated with Easter is dying real eggs in different, usually pastel, colors like light pink, blue and yellow.\nIn New York City, people take to Fifth Avenue to participate in the Easter Parade. The Easter Parade isn't a parade with marching bands and floats. People walk up and down Fifth Avenue showing off elaborately decorated hats or Easter bonnets."

September 11th was the day Muslim extremists hijacked four commercial airliners in an attempt to destroy the American spirit by slamming those jets into four buildings. Three of the four jets reached their targets, while one was stopped by a group of everyday heroes who gave their lives for their country.\nIn the early morning hours on September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 slammed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. A few minutes later, Flight 175, also an American Airlines flight, struck the south tower. Both suicide attacks brought the towers down, but not immediately. It took time for the extreme heat from the burning jet fuel to weaken the towers to their eventual collapse. At about the same time, American Airlines, Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, which is a government building in the country's capitol, Washington D.C.\nThe fourth flight, United Airlines Flight 93, was also headed for the capitol city. Most people think its target was either the capitol building, or the White House, the president's home. A group of brave passengers, upon hearing the news of what was happening in the country, decided to take down the giant airplane even though they knew they would not survive. They stormed the cockpit and took the controls from the hijackers. The plane flew out of control, crashing into a field in the state of Pennsylvania, where all passengers were killed.\nIn all, about 3,000 Americans lost their lives on that day, but the American spirit was not suppressed. Those responsible for the attacks were quickly dealt with, and the country soon began its journey to recovery. September 11, 2001, a day America will never forget."

Mike was still sound asleep.\nIt was another beautiful day in the state of California. Maria loved to wake up early in the morning and cook breakfast. Mike, on the other hand, would much rather sleep in. Maria made sure to wake up Mike by offering him a home-cooked breakfast Mike could never refuse. \"Wake up, Mike. It's time to rise and shine,\" she said, shaking him back and fourth. Mike covered his face with a pillow and let out a long groan. \"It's too early, Maria. Can't we keep sleeping?\" he asks. \"It's Sunday for goodness sake!\" Maria pulls the pillow from his face and taps his face with her hand. \"Come on! Wake up! I'm going to cook breakfast. I'm making pancakes and eggs, your favorite,\" she says to Mike, hoping to get him out of bed. Mike reluctantly gets out of bed and walks to the kitchen. He could not say no to pancakes for breakfast. Maria made the best pancakes in the world. He was indifferent about eggs. Maria did not know about this.\nThe sun peered through the window and blinded him. He closed the shutters to block the sunlight. Maria began to cook, while Mike served himself a tall glass of orange juice. Mike sat down at the kitchen table and let out a big yawn. Unlike Maria, he was not an early bird. Maria finished cooking the eggs and pancakes, and served both herself and Mike the food. She sat down with Mike and had a conversation while eating breakfast."

I asked her if George was home, she looked at me with sad eyes and said that George was in the hospital. I finally understood why George was the way he was.

Polio was a vicious disease that took its victim's lives, or left them with major disabilities. In 1952, the U.S. suffered one of its harshest epidemics of polio in its history. More than 58,000 cases of polio were reported that year, and 3,145 people lost their lives. Additionally, more than 21,000 people suffered some form of paralysis that ranged from mild paralysis to extreme cases where people became disabled. Dr. Jonas Salk is responsible for ending that plague.\nBorn in New York City on October 28, 1914, Jonas Salk grew up in modest surroundings. His parents were not wealthy, but they were able to put food on the table, and maintain a roof over their children's head. Salk demonstrated great academic success from childhood. By the age of 13, he was enrolled into a school for gifted children. He was considered a perfectionist by his peers, and succeeded academically in a very competitive environment. In college, Salk opted to go into medical school even though his mother wanted him to become an attorney. After graduating from medical school, Salk began his research on polio, which was considered a scourge of western society.\nPolio had baffled medical science since its discovery in the mid-19th Century. When Salk turned his attention to the disease, there was little hope that anyone could find an adequate cure. Salk developed his vaccine in the early 1950s, and in April of 1955, his accomplishment was heralded in newspapers across the country. Salk became a national hero. His vaccine effectively ended the polio epidemic in the United States and many countries around the world."

More and more adults are reliving their childhoods or creating memories they didn't have as children by having theme parties for their birthday or other occasions.\nTheme parties are based on an idea, a television show, a fictional character, or really anything. Sometimes guests are expected to dress according to the theme as well. For example, the Toga party is a type of theme party where guests are expected to dress in togas, really just white sheets. Toga parties used to be especially popular among college students. In a masquerade party, everyone wears a mask and has to guess who is behind it. The mystery is part of the fun. Speaking of mystery, there are murder mystery parties, where the guests have to solve a fake murder. Some adults throw parties based on seasons. A summer beach party, for example, might feature guests wearing their swimsuits. Another popular type of theme party is the game night party. In this type of party, people get together to play  various board games. A variation of the game night party is the casino party, where adults play games typically found in a casino-like blackjack or poker.\nAnother theme party could focus on a specific region or country. For example, a Mexican theme party might feature tacos, the colors of the Mexican flag and Mexican music. Guests should be careful when dressing up for these types of theme parties though. Dressing up like a certain ethnic or racial group is usually considered offensive. It's better to just enjoy the food, and not portray a stereotype."

During that time, Carson entertained generations of American television viewers with his down-to-earth style, casual approach, and quick-witted humor. The Tonight Show was already a big success when Carson took over from the retiring Jack Paar, but Carson took the show to the next level. His style, and grace on camera has been mimicked by many late-night talk show hosts, who have credited Carson as their mentor.\nCarson was born thousands of miles away from the glitz of New York, and Los Angeles, in the city of Corning, Iowa, in 1925. Carson began his entertainment career at the age of 14 when he appeared at county fairs as a magician, which was his first love. His family moved to the state of Nebraska when Carson was a young man, and he served as a communications officer for the U.S. Navy during the tail end of World War II. His broadcast career began in 1950 in Omaha, Nebraska before moving to Los Angeles, and landing a job with a local television station.\nCarson officially became host of The Tonight Show on October 1, 1962. The show was based in New York City until 1972 when, at Carson's request, the show was permanently moved to the Los Angeles area. Carson hosted his show in Burbank for the next 21 years, where he perfected his style and approach to his guests. It was considered an honor to be invited to The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson.\nCarson was a true entertainer. He performed many skits during his reign, where he dressed up in costume, and played ridiculous characters, which is something today's late-night hosts do not do. Carson was never afraid to laugh at himself."

In order to get to his house, Frank had to take a bus and a train, but he didn't mind because he could listen to music.\nAfter getting off the train, Frank got something to eat at a little restaurant that stayed open late and served hamburgers. After eating, Frank still had to walk for 30 minutes. While Frank was walking through a small street with a lot of homes, he noticed there was a car behind him following him slowly. He looked back and noticed it was a police car.

However, many families choose to pay for their children's primary and secondary education by sending them to private schools. There are many different types of private schools and many different reasons why parents send their kids there. Some private schools are military type and yet others are boarding schools where students live on campus. Some private schools are affiliated with a certain religion. These schools teach a specific faith's  beliefs and traditions as well as the regular academic subjects. There are schools run by Catholics, Protestants, Jewish people, Muslims, and Orthodox Christians. There are also private schools that specialize in teaching disabled students.\nSome parents choose private schools because they feel that they offer a better education than public schools; others choose private schools because they offer a different type of curriculum. Waldorf Schools, for example, only let children play and use items made of natural materials.\nPrivate schools are also called independent schools or non-state schools because they are not run by local, state, or national governments. They can pick what students to go to their schools. They do this through admission examinations and interviews. There is often an admissions application. Some private schools accept anyone who can pay tuition to send their children there. Some schools charge up to $45,000 a year. Private schools charge tuition because they do not get any money collected from local, state, and national taxes. Some private schools offer a limited number of scholarships to help pay for school. Many of these scholarships are need-based, meaning for students who can't afford the tuition. Other scholarships are offered for students with very good grades or for students that have a talent in a sport or art."

It is the day when the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the new country's forefathers, and is a national holiday. It has been celebrated every year since 1776. Americans hold this day as one of the most revered holidays in the country.\nIndependence Day celebrations include firework shows that are held by various organizations throughout the country. The shows are held at stadiums, recreational parks, and private homes. Additionally, many businesses have giveaways and special discounts for all residents on this day. The firework shows are best at stadiums, where they attract a large number of people. This is a recent change in the way Americans celebrate the day. In the past, most people bought their own fireworks from vendors who sell their goods in supermarket parking lots.\nThe reason many cities no longer allow the sales, or use of fireworks is because of the fire hazards they pose. This is why the large, professional celebrations stadiums and parks have become popular in recent years. Of course, many people still celebrate at home though. There are some cities where sales and use of fireworks are still legal, and many Americans take full advantage of this.\nAnother Fourth of July tradition is the backyard barbeque. The holiday occurs in the middle of summer, and Americans love to grill outdoors to avoid the heat inside the house. Hamburgers and hot dogs are the food of choice, but steaks are also prepared often. There is nothing better than a great American meal and a cold drink celebrating the Fourth of July. It is a popular holiday, and it is one that has great meaning to most Americans."

In places like Southern California, it rarely rains during the summer. Residents of this region get very little tropical conditions during this time. The heat is dry, much like a desert. This means it is a good time to invite friends, neighbors, family, and co-workers to enjoy a summer feast.\nBarbeque grills vary greatly in type and size. Some people prefer the propane fueled grills, or a natural gas grill, while others prefer the old-fashioned charcoal briquettes. Of course, there are still grillers who like natural wood-burning grills.\nAlong with the food, grilling outdoors is a social setting. People get together to have beverages and food, and get caught up with the latest happenings. It's a great way to meet new people and to network with others while having a great time. Additionally, many people bring their children along, and they have fun playing with each other.\nThe main attraction though is the food. Grillers love experimenting with new spices and sauces to enhance the flavor of their favorite meats. Ribs and chicken are very popular menu items. People can cook just about anything on a grill, such as warming tortillas, toasting bread, grilling onions, corn, and fish. One of the best things about a backyard barbeque afternoon is the wonderful smell of grilling food that carries through the air.\nThe tradition is especially true on holidays such as the Fourth of July, and Veterans Day, but celebrants do not need an excuse to grill outdoors. All they need is a grill, food, and good company to have a good time."

In the past, fraudulent scams were limited to phone and traditional mail delivery system. Those methods were time-consuming, required extensive research, and reached limited potential victims. With email, scammers can reach tens of thousands of individuals per email blast. They only need to reach a very small percentage of people they email to be successful.\nMany of the email scams present today are recycled scams from the years before the use of email. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which regulates communications in the United States, has listed the 12 most common email scams, such as chain letters, phony business opportunities, work-at-home schemes, investment opportunities, free goods, and guaranteed loans. Beware of these types of emails from unknown users or sources, especially if they are marked \"urgent\" or \"immediate action required.\"\nThere are some actions you can take to help you avoid becoming an email scam victim. You can filter spam emails through your settings. Most email applications and Web mail services include spam-filtering features, or ways to set your email to detect spam. Regard all unknown email with suspicion, and treat email attachments with caution. Install antivirus software and keep it up to date. Installing firewalls on your personal computer may also be a good idea. By practicing these precautionary methods, you can avoid becoming another victim."

That is the day President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas while riding in an open-air car. The president was visiting Texas for the first time since his inauguration in January, 1961. Kennedy was one of the most popular presidents in the history of the United States, and still remains so today. His death shocked the nation for several reasons, but mostly because it was televised on a live broadcast. Kennedy was the first president to appear on television at a time when most Americans owned a TV. He was not the first president to be televised, but previous presidents who appeared on TV did not reach the general public because before 1960, not many Americans owned a set.\nKennedy was warned not to ride in an open-air car that day by his bodyguards, but he wanted the public to see him live. He did not want to be hidden behind an armored car. According to the official government commission, Kennedy fell victim to a single assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, but many Americans dispute that finding to this date. Police say Oswald shot the president from a building while Kennedy rode in his car with his wife. The mood was festive at the time as the city of Dallas welcomed the president to Texas. Kennedy was a handsome, young president who was the youngest man ever to reach the presidency.\nOswald later killed a Dallas police officer during his escape from the crime scene, but was soon found hiding in a movie theater. He required police protection from an outraged public, and was held in protective custody. Oswald, who was a former member of the U.S. military, was unhappy with the president for his policies, but never admitted to being the assassin. Conspiracy theories involving rival political parties, the Cuban government, and organized crime have also been advanced as to who actually killed Kennedy."

It was called a nursery. Hannah always thought a nursery was a bedroom for a new-born baby or a very young child, not a place to buy plants. The more she thought about it though, the more it made sense. Going to a nursery was like going to get a baby. Except in this case, the baby was a plant she would bring home.\nHannah drove 30 minutes to get to the nursery, which had a whole section of drought-resistant plants.

He was reelected in November 1964 by the largest popular vote in the history of the country. Although eligible to run for reelection in 1968, Johnson declined.\nBorn in Stonewall, Texas on August 27, 1908, Johnson lived in a small farmhouse in a rural setting. He was a talkative youth who was a bit awkward by some accounts, but that did not stop him from running for office. He was elected his 11th grade class president, and by the time he graduated from, what is now called, Texas State University, he had been a polished politician. His presidency was driven by his philosophy of the \"Great Society,\" which is what he wanted to transform the United States into.\nIn 1964, Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Bill that protected every American's right to vote, guaranteed access to public accommodations, and withheld federal funds for programs that demonstrated discriminatory practices. During his presidency, the country saw a marked increase in the economy. More people were gainfully employed in the United States primarily because of his Economic Opportunity Act.\nHis presidency was not without controversy though. He escalated the United States involvement in Southeast Asia. This increase sparked an unprecedented response from the American people who opposed the war. Demonstrations that included violent confrontations between American citizens and government authorities rocked the country. This tainted an otherwise successful run as president."

That was okay with Phil though because that was his life, and he thought it was just the way everybody in the world lived.\nPhil had a lot of fun and had many friends. It wasn't until Phil was about 12 years old that he began to realize that there were better things out there in the world. Phil and his best friend Albert would sit around and talk about getting out of this place to see the world. It was a fantasy, but it was a good fantasy. They really didn't know how they would do it, but they had a dream. Then one day Phil's cousin Ralphie came to visit.\nPhil didn't know Ralphie very well. Ralphie grew up in Texas and was about 8 years older than Phil. It had been years since Phil saw his cousin. That day Ralphie changed Phil's life. Ralphie walked into the house wearing his Marine Corp uniform, and Phil knew at that moment that he wanted to become a Marine.\nPhil and Ralphie talked all night long. Ralphie told him all about the Corp and Phil was fascinated. Ralphie was wearing his medals and awards, and his uniform was so neat and clean that Phil wanted to join at that moment. Five years later, Phil enlisted in the Marines. He was 17 and needed his mom's permission. His mom said \"Where do I sign?\"Of course she was joking, but she knew Phil was going to do this. It was his way out of this place, so she gave him her blessings. The day Phil left, he promised his mom he would be back. He kept his promise. He came back several times over the years, and helped his family as much as he could."

She especially loved watching the commercials. \"You really can buy anything here in America!\" she told her friends. One afternoon she was watching television and saw a commercial that really grabbed her attention. It showed a cartoon woman tossing and turning. The woman in the commercial was unable to sleep because she was busy thinking about the day that had passed and worrying about the day ahead. Barb wasn't quite sure what the commercial was advertising. Was it a bed? Was it a pillow? Was it just a public service announcement urging people to sleep more? Suddenly a voice on the television began speaking very quickly, listing side effects of the sleeping pill the commercial was advertising. One of the side effects was insomnia. Barb thought that seemed like an odd side effect for a sleeping pill.\nThe next day Barb happened to be in the local neighborhood pharmacy picking up a few things. She remembered the commercial she had seen the night before for the sleeping pills. She walked up and down the aisles looking for them. Since she saw it advertised on television, she thought she might try them. Sometimes she had a hard time sleeping. When she couldn't find the pills on her own, she walked over to the pharmacy counter and asked the pharmacist where she could find the pills.\n\"Do you have a prescription?\" the pharmacist asked. Barn explained that she didn't, but she saw the pills advertised on television and thought she would try them. \"Those are not available over the counter,\" the pharmacist explained. Barb thought it was dumb for there to be a commercial for something she couldn't just go get at the store. She walked out of the pharmacy without buying anything."

She will always be remembered as America's first, bona-fide sex symbol having starred in numerous Hollywood movies and posing nude for national men's magazines. She may not have been the first actress or entertainer to use her sex to make a name for herself, but she was the first to do it in the modern media age, where she was visible to most of the country.\nBorn on June 1, 1926 in Los Angeles, California, Monroe had natural beauty and talent from the beginning although her childhood was marked by tragedy. She was born to an unwed mother who was unable to care for her child because of her mental and financial instability. Monroe was placed in foster homes, where she lived with different families throughout most of her childhood. She never knew who her biological father was. She even thought for a time that her father was the famous Hollywood actor Clark Gable. Monroe was reunited with her mother as a teenager, but was soon taken away from her because of mental issues. She spent the rest of her youth living with her mother's best friend, Grace.\nIt was during her time with Grace that Monroe developed her love for the cinema. The two would often go to see movies together, and Monroe became fascinated by the Hollywood lifestyle. She began her career in small parts in \"B\" movies, but was soon noticed by Hollywood producers. Her first starring role came in 1952's Don't Bother to Knock. Her acting career took off after that.\nMonroe parlayed her popularity into a relationship with President John F. Kennedy after performing at one of his birthday parties. Tragically, Monroe died in what was ruled as \"probable suicide\" by the L.A. County Coroner's Office after a long battle with drug, and alcohol abuse, and mental issues. She was just 36 years old."

Actually, I was about 28 days older than him  a fact that I always threw in his face. \"You must respect your elders,\" I would sometimes tell him. That usually got a nasty response from him. Anyway, George came up to me one day and said, \"Hey Richard, why don't we form a bicycle club?\"\nI thought about it for a while, and then he said, \"We could give ourselves a cool name and get hats and stickers and have lots of fun. What do you say?\" I immediately fell in love with the idea. \"You bet, Georgie Porgy!\" I used to call him that all the time even though I knew he hated it. Well before we knew it, we got a couple of other guys together and came up with the best name for a club ever. We were the \"White Skulls.\" Why we chose that name, I'll never know, but all the kids seemed to like it, so I was okay with it, too.\nThe four of us went to the local bike shop and we each picked out a skull decal to put on our bikes. I chose a green one, while Georgie Porgy picked red. He shouted: \"I am the red skull! I am the king of the club! If you don't like it, try to take it from me!\" George was a pretty big guy, so no one argued with him. We rode our bikes everywhere and had a great summer. That's how we formed the greatest bike club ever!"

When he finished playing the song he walked up and down the aisles with a cup in his hand asking for tips. Michelle didn't feel like this was fair. While the music wasn't unpleasant, it's not like she had a choice. She was forced to listen to it since she has to take the train home from work.  Now he was asking to be paid by the people being forced to listen? He had some nerve. Michelle didn't give the man any money. Some of her fellow commuters did drop a few coins in the man's cup.\n\"You shouldn't encourage that,\" Michelle told one of her fellow commuters after he dropped some change in the man's cup. \"I don't even think it's legal for him to play music in the train and ask for money,\" Michelle said. She then scanned the advertisements and notices inside the train car. Sure enough she found a sign that said playing music and soliciting was not allowed and that there would be a fine for people caught by the police.\nWhen the harmonica player passed by Michelle and extended his cup out so he could put in some change, she pointed to the sign. The harmonica player shrugged his shoulders. \"We all have to make a living, lady,\" he said."

It has trees and winding roads leading up to the hills where he could get lost for hours. Whenever he hiked up there, he always felt at peace with the world and with himself. It was his personal safe zone.\nOne day Johnny was hiking up a trail that he had not tried before, and soon he was lost. Griffith Park is very large and people have been lost up there in the past, but he knew he would find a way back. After about an hour of walking around in circles, Johnny heard something move in the bushes. It scared him for a second, but he just kept walking.\nIt was starting to get dark and he began thinking that he might have to spend the night in a cave or under a rock or something. That was when he heard more noise coming from the trail. It was very loud. \"Hey!\" Johnny shouted. \"What's out there? Stay away!\" He was sure it was a coyote or maybe a mountain lion. He started looking for something to fight back with in case of an attack. Johnny was in a full-panic and started shaking uncontrollably as the noise got closer and closer. Just as he thought that an animal was going to jump out of the bushes, he saw the most beautiful girl he had ever seen in his life. She was tall and blonde and had long straight hair and the first thing she said was \"Are you okay?\"\nIt turned out her name was Sheila, and she was a park ranger. She told Johnny that she had seen him walk up the trail earlier, but did not see him come back down, so she decided to come up to see if everything was okay. Johnny had never been so embarrassed in his life, but that was okay. The couple ended up getting married a little more than a year after that. She saved Johnny's life that day, in more ways than one."

Donna cared for Sandy every day. She fed her, brushed her, and played with her. Donna went with Sandy whenever it was time to take her to the veterinarian's office for a physical checkup. Donna always wanted to be with her furry friend on those occasions because she didn't want Sandy to feel alone and afraid. Donna was also responsible for cleaning up after Sandy, which meant picking up her poop. Donna didn't mind though. She loved Sandy.\nOne day, Donna and Sandy were coming home from the park. They were walking down the street near their home when Donna let Sandy off her leash. Donna knew she wasn't supposed to let her off the leash, but she always did when they were just a few houses away. Sandy would run into the yard, yelping and howling while waiting for Donna to get home.\nThis day was different though. Sandy saw a cat across the street and started running after the cat just as Donna's neighbor was driving home. Sandy was hit and killed by the speeding car as Donna screamed in shock. \"No!\" yelled Donna, but it was too late. Sandy was gone. Donna was very sad. She blamed herself for Sandy's tragic death, but her mom told her that Sandy was happy in Heaven now.

Betty's husband told her that it was easy enough for people to buy fireworks.

Camping involves people leaving the comfort of their home and driving to spend a few nights or more in the great outdoors.\nWhen people camp, they can sleep in a tent, a camper, or if they want to be fancier, they can sleep in a cabin. Some people like to really \"rough it\" and use no shelter except for a sleeping bag and sleep under the stars. Some people drive across the U.S. in what is known as a recreational vehicle or RV, which is a trailer. Inside there are beds, a tiny bathroom and a kitchen.\nThere are campgrounds all over the United States. These are places where campers gather together and usually pay a fee to pitch a tent or place a camper in a designated outdoor spot. Many of these campgrounds have water hoses and electric hookups so that people can wash dishes and themselves and plug in a radio or their computers.  Most campsites also have a fire ring or pit, which is a hole in the ground where people can safely make a fire for roasting marshmallows, a popular camping activity. There usually is also a picnic table for people to eat their meals. Many of these campgrounds also have shared bathrooms complete with showers. Some campgrounds have playgrounds, pools, and game rooms. Some also organize activities for people who like sing-alongs, where people will gather together and sing songs. Usually it is illegal to camp in a place not designated as an official campsite, meaning you can't just pitch a tent in a forest.\nWhen people go camping they often do other outdoor activities like fishing, canoeing, hiking, kayaking, swimming, horseback riding and mountain biking."

In the months to follow, the group became the biggest Rock N' Roll band ever to hit the United States.\nThe group's success opened the door for other British bands to make their way to America. Bands such as the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks and The Dave Clark Five were soon playing their music to American audiences.\nThe Beatles were made up by four of the finest musicians to ever play rock music. Their lead singer was Paul McCartney, and drummer Ringo Starr. Both still play to this day. Two of the original members, singers and songwriters, John Lennon, and George Harrison, have tragically passed away, but their music lives in American culture to this day. The Beatles have sold more records in the United States than any other country in the world.\nThere was controversy in the U.S. prior to the group's first appearance. Conservative Americans viewed the Beatles as upstarts, with brash, new ideas, lyrics, and sound. The young generation of the time was ready for a change, and the Beatles gave them what they wanted. They were nicknamed the \"Mop Tops\" because of their long, bowl-like haircuts that flew in the face of convention in the 60s. Nothing was going to stop the Beatles though. Their music is as popular today as it was 50 plus years ago. This February, the Grammy Awards presented a special telecast celebrating the 50th anniversary of the group's first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show."

The chute was in a small room located next to the elevator. Frank had to take cans, bottles and other recyclables to the basement and put them in a special bin. He did not though have to worry about remembering what day was trash day. He did not have to worry about taking the trash out to be collected. That was the job of the building's superintendent.\nThe two-bedroom house Frank moved into had no superintendent though. Frank was provided with three trashcans by the city. Each trashcan was a different color. The black one was for regular garbage. The blue one was for paper, plastic, and cans so that they could be recycled. The green bin was for leaves, cut grass, and tree trimmings. Each bin needed to be put out to the curb before the city sanitation trucks came around early Monday morning. Frank couldn't put the cans out too early, either. If he put the cans on the curb before 6:00 p.m. on Sunday evenings, he could get a ticket and have to pay a fine.\nFrank decided to set a reminder on his cell phone. Every Sunday night at 6:00 in the evening his phone would beep reminding him to take the trash bins to the curb. Frank also had to pay the city every three months for trash collection. That was something that he didn't have to do when he rented an apartment. Living in a house sure involved a lot more responsibility than living in an apartment building."

After Donald sold the painting, he bought art supplies with the money he received. He decided to forget about being an accountant. He had never felt so happy."

        "content": "Steve Jobs was a self-made billionaire, who brought personal computers into the homes of nearly every American in the country. He is credited with developing the technology that has personalized the computers. Jobs, along with his childhood friend Steve Wozniak, co-founded Apple Computers in 1976, working out of Jobs' garage.\nJobs was born on February 24, 1955 to parents who gave him up for adoption shortly after birth. He was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs. His father was a machinist who liked to spend time with his son taking electronic components apart, and reassembling them. This is when and where Jobs developed his interest in mechanical reconstruction. Jobs was not the best student in high school. He was known as a class clown, although he was very intelligent. It was in high school that he met Wozniak.\nBoth Jobs and Wozniak had a great interest in electronics, and the pair was known for making computer technology smaller, cheaper, and more accessible to average persons. Jobs got his start working as a video game designer for the Atari Corporation. Once Jobs got Apple going, he sold his first computers, which were called the Apple I, for $666.66 each. The Apple I earned Jobs nearly $800,000 its first year, and that was just the beginning. The Apple II earned the fledgling company nearly $140 million, and by 1980, the company was worth $1.2 billion.\nJobs branched out his financial kingdom venturing into other businesses such as Pixar Animation Studios, which was also very successful. He briefly left Apple to found the NeXT Corporation, which produced both software and hardware, but NeXT floundered, and Jobs went back to Apple to develop iPhone and iPad. Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, and eventually lost his battle with cancer in October, 2011."

In those ten years, Jerry had made dozens of friends from around the city. He didn't understand why they had to move. Jerry wished he could stay behind while his family left to Arizona. He knew things weren't ever going to be the same if he left Riverdale, California.\n\"Why do we have to move?\" Jerry would ask, sounding depressed. His parents had answered that question countless times already. Despite knowing the answer, Jerry was reluctant to believe it, so he kept asking. \"Why do we have to move?\" Jerry asked time after time. The simple truth was that Jerry and his family just could not afford to live in Riverdale any longer. It was hard for Jerry to accept that truth.\nOn the day before the move, Jerry walked around the familiar places in Riverdale. He walked passing the oak tree where he first kissed a girl. He walked past the corner mini-market where he would bring back milk every Sunday. He passed by his high school where he had learned and discovered his love of math and science.\nJerry knocked on the doors of friends' houses to say one final goodbye. \"Good bye, Tom,\" Jerry told his best friend. \"Goodbye Jane,\" Jerry told his girlfriend. The night fell when Jerry finally finished bidding his farewells to everybody he knew. \"Goodbye, Riverdale,\" Jerry said, looking out his bedroom window as he went to sleep. That night, Jerry dreamed of moving to Arizona and making friends on the first day there. Everything in Arizona seemed great in his dream. The following morning when he awoke, Jerry no longer felt so bad about moving. \"Everything is going to be all right,\" Jerry said to himself as he stepped into the moving van on his way to Arizona."

It was almost vacant of any cars. \"I think we came at a good time, guys,\" Mike said to Maria and Doug.\nThey parked near the bowling alley entrance and exited the car. Judging from the outside, the bowling alley seemed like it was not such a big place. Doug noticed this and made a comment. \"Are you sure this is a bowling alley? It looks more like a small market to me,\" Doug said. \"Let's wait until we get inside,\" Mike responded. \"This place has me curious, too.\"\nThey walked in through the doors. Doug and Maria were especially surprised at how much bigger the inside of the building looked compared to the outside. Doug was almost in disbelief. \"Wow! You were not kidding, Mike,\" he said, looking around the large building. Maria told Mike that she had to use the restroom. Mike noticed the sign and pointed her in the right direction. Doug repeated that he was still hungry, so Mike motioned to the vending machine he could see near the restroom sign. Doug went to the vending machine and bought some peanuts. Lucky Strike also served food, but that could wait until after the trio had played. As soon as Maria and Doug returned, the three went up to the counter to buy their rounds of bowling."

Mickey Mouse is a creation of the late Walt Disney, who pioneered the age of theme parks into popular, American culture. Today, Mickey is the official mascot of the Walt Disney Corporation. He is what is called an anthropomorphic character, which is a term used to describe a non-human character that has human characteristics. Mickey can speak, laugh, cry, and use his hands like a human. He also walks on two legs rather than four. His trademark red shorts, large yellow shoes, white gloves, and over-sized mouse ears make him one of the most recognizable cartoon characters in America, and in the world.\nMickey was created by Disney in 1928 in the short film Steamboat Willie. That film was the first of 130 films starring the famous mouse. He has also starred in 10 full-length, feature films. In the 1930s, Mickey began to appear in comic books, and on November 18, 1978 he got his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He became the first cartoon character to earn a star on the historic sidewalk. Ten of his films have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film with Lend a Paw winning the award. Walt Disney received an Honorary Award for creating the character in 1932.\nOne of the most popular children's shows in American history was the \"Mickey Mouse Club,\" which ran from 1955 to 1996. Mickey has a girlfriend named Minnie Mouse, a dog named Pluto, and a host of friends that include Donald, and Daisy Duck, who are stars on their own.\nToday, Mickey Mouse merchandise can be found world wide. He appears in all Disney theme parks throughout the world. In 1988 Mickey made his last full-length film appearance when he starred in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This was a significant occurrence because it was the first time that Disney characters starred alongside Warner Brother's characters. The two corporations had been long-time rivals."

As a teenager, Crowe began developing his musical talent, but he found little success. He had several of his songs played on New Zealand radio, but none made the charts. He turned to acting after moving to Australia, where he appeared in several stage productions, including the Rocky Horror Picture Show. He landed a role in the television comedy Neighbors, and made his film debut in 1990.\nCrowe became a popular movie star for his performance in the epic film Gladiator. In the film he portrays a Roman general who is slated to become a high-ranking official, but the leader dies, and is replaced by his evil, neurotic son. The new leader fears Crowe's character, and strips him of his rank. He was put into a state of slavery, but becomes a champion gladiator, and leads a revolt against the leader's regime. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Crowe won the award for Best Actor.\nHe followed his success in Gladiator with a string of highly entertaining movies, culminating with the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind. The film follows the life of Nobel Prize winner, John Nash. Crowe expertly plays Nash, who is brilliant, but suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. Crowe's performance earned him several awards for Best Actor and the Best Movie Oscar.

It might have something to do with me, but I'm not sure.\nJennifer hadn't seen Sarah, because Donna took Jennifer outside before she had the chance. I took Sarah by the hand, and asked her who had invited her. She looked at me confused, because apparently I had invited her through a text message a week ago. It was true. I invited her, but I never thought she would show up. When Jennifer finally came into the room, she saw Sarah and became very angry. She looked at me and started yelling at me. \"Why is she here, Jason?\" asked Jennifer. I looked at her equally angry and said, \"What are you talking about? What are YOU doing here?\" Jennifer started yelling at Sarah, and Sarah started yelling at Jennifer. They got so angry that they started fighting, which eventually got us kicked out of the restaurant. My mother was crushed when she got there. Donna got grounded for a month.

Zuckerberg is the man who changed the way people keep in touch with each other. He literally changed the world.\nBorn in White Plains, New York on May 14, 1984, Zuckerberg developed an interest in computer programming at an early age. When he was just 12 years old, he had developed a working messaging system that his father Edward used in his dental office. Zuckerberg had many friends who were artists, and they would come by and draw pictures for Mark. He would then design a computer game based on the characters drawn. In high school, Zuckerberg developed a music software program that drew interest from several large companies. He enrolled into Harvard University in 2002, where he developed his first social networking site for students only. The site was very popular, but it was shut down by the school for being inappropriate.\nDuring his sophomore year at Harvard, Zuckerberg began working on Facebook, a site that allowed its users to create a profile, share photos, and communicate with other members. He dropped out his sophomore year to dedicate his work to his site. He moved his operation to Palo Alto, California. By the end of 2004, Facebook had had more than 1,000,000 members.\nZuckerberg's rise to the top has not been without controversy. Some of his Harvard peers claimed he stole their ideas, and filed suit against Zuckerberg. The case was settled, but it continues to be an issue. Facebook generates more than $1.5 billion in net revenues today."

There are special forms the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the government agency in charge of collecting taxes, asks people to fill out. There are tax credits that people with low income, college students, and parents can get. These credits could mean actually getting money back from the government. This money is called a tax refund. People can get both a federal and state tax refund. Anyone who works has to be taxed regardless of the immigration status. Not paying income taxes could mean a fine or even jail time.\nPayroll taxes are taxes that are taken right out of a person's paycheck. There are federal and state payroll taxes. These include Social Security and Medicare taxes. Social Security taxes pay for the retirement and disability benefits received by millions of Americans each year. Medicare taxes pay for the federal health insurance program that covers the elderly and the disabled.\nPeople who own houses pay property taxes. The amount paid depends on how much the property is worth. This tax is usually paid once a year. Sales tax is a tax almost everyone pays. Sales tax is a specific extra percentage charged on nearly all purchases. Everything from soap to furniture has a sales tax attached when bought.

The bridge spans the San Francisco Bay, and is part of a network of five main bridges that cross the bay in the San Francisco and Oakland area. The region with its bay has one of the most breathtaking views in the world, and part of which is the historic Golden Gate Bridge.\nIt is perhaps the most iconic and recognizable landmark in the entire United States. Construction on the bridge began in 1933, while the country was deeply mired in the Great Depression. Many people think the bridge was, in large part, responsible for the country's economic recovery because of the number of workers employed. The material used to build the bridge also contributed to the manufacturing, distribution, and transportation.\nThe bridge connects San Francisco to the San Francisco peninsula in Marin County through both California State Route 1, and U.S. Route 101. Before the bridge was built, the only way to get from one location to the other was to go around the bay, or to take a ferry across. Construction of the bridge was controversial at the time. Many thought the project was simply too complex, expensive, and dangerous to build. The construction plan approved concentrated on safety for the workers who would be involved in the construction, and it worked well until February 17, 1937. Remarkably, only one worker had died up to that date, but on that date, a scaffolding collapsed killing 10 men in the tragic accident.\nThe bridge was completed later that year, and has been in use ever since. It is one of California's great landmarks with people from all over the world drawn to see it."

Paramedics are usually attached to a county, or city fire department, but there are also some private paramedic organizations.\nIn Southern California, there are two primary schools for paramedic training. They are UCLA's Daniel Freeman Paramedic program and the Paramedic Training Institute. Both of these schools provide candidates for the Los Angeles County and City Fire Departments. To become a paramedic for a county or city organization, candidates must also pass a psychological screening and a physical training program.\nSome of the equipment paramedics carry is very specialized. They carry basic and advanced life support gear such as forcible entry tools so they can reach people in peril, saws to cut through obstacles, and other emergency equipment. Paramedics provide a valuable service to the communities they serve. They must be certified in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) techniques, and be trained to handle all situations.\nSome paramedics are trained to respond to what is called Mass Casualty Incidents (MCI). These emergencies occur whenever there is a tragic event such as the September 11, 2001 attacks on the country, and other emergencies like earthquakes, mudslides, or floods. Paramedics  can also be sent to emergency situations by citizens who call the 911 emergency phone number."

The service it provides is generally called mail delivery, but it offers many other services also. It employs more than 600,000 employees nationwide making it the 3rd largest single employer in the country. Being established in 1775, it is one of the oldest government agencies in existence. Millions of American individuals, businesses, and other government agencies depend on the USPS to deliver mail, documents, and packages countrywide on a daily basis.\nEach day the USPS delivers approximately 660 million pieces of mail to as many as 142 million delivery points. It operates 31,000 post offices and locations in the U.S., and delivers 155 billion pieces of mail each year. The basic rate to deliver First-Class Mail (no more than 1 ounce) is 49 cents, so mailing a letter to anyone in the United States will cost you less than 50 cents, regardless of its destination. Additionally, the USPS owns one of the largest civilian vehicle fleets in the nation, which helped it earn the total revenue of more than $74.49 billion in 2016.\nAlthough the USPS is one of the largest government agencies in existence, it has been negatively affected by the advent of the World Wide Web, and email. These two factors have led to a decline of volume since 1998. In response, the USPS announced it would close more than half of its mail processing centers, eliminate 28,000 jobs, and reduce overnight delivery of First-Class Mail. This will close down 252 of its 461 processing centers. However, the most effective way to send a letter in the United States is still by using the United States Postal Service."

This is where two or more families get together at someone's home to have dinner, and refreshments, and then play games. This is an activity where almost anyone can play. Most board games can be played by children as young as 6, or 7 years old. It is fun for the kids to test their skills against their older brothers and sisters, or their parents. One of the oldest and most popular board games is Monopoly. It is a game where all players start in the same place, and roll dice to advance from square to square.\nLittle Johnny wanted to join the game one night, and asked his parents if he could play. \"Please, mommy. Please let me play with you tonight,\" he pleaded. His mom thought about it for a while, and said, \"Okay, Johnny. Tonight you can play.\" She really didn't think he was going to be able to play the game, but to her surprise, he was very good at it. The object of the game is to bankrupt your opponents and have most money at the end of the game. You buy properties with money collected by moving around the board. The more money you have in your bank, the more property you can buy.\nJohnny landed on the Boardwalk square, which is a very prized property. It is the most expensive property, but Johnny knew its value and bought it. The square is positioned at the end of the game where everyone collects $200, but if you land on it, you have to pay a high rent. Johnny bought a couple of nearby properties too, and before long, he was collecting rent from all the other players. Johnny ended up winning the game, which made him very happy, and it also made his mom very proud of him. Johnny showed her and everyone else what he was capable of."

Taking office January 1, 1994, Giuliani was mayor during the terrorist attack on the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. His reaction to that horrible attack has been viewed by many as one of the best crisis-management cases the country has ever seen. However, his legacy as mayor is not limited to his actions following 9/11. He is also known for his tireless crusade against New York's organized crime, and corrupt businesses. He is credited for bringing organized crime boss John Gotti to justice.\nGiuliani's image as being tough on crime launched him into a career in politics. As mayor of New York, he gained a reputation as a no-nonsense, tough guy that was able to get things done. His response to the crisis on September 11 earned him Time Magazine's Person of the Year recognition for 2001. He was also knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 2002.\nBorn into an Italian-American family in Flatbush, New York on May 28, 1944, his father had organized crime ties, which influenced him greatly as a child. His early education consisted of Catholic schools. He considered a career as a Roman Catholic priest for a time. He eventually graduated from Manhattan College as a political science major. He then attended the New York School of Law, and became an attorney.\nDuring the days following the 9/11 attack, Giuliani made his presence known. He took to the media on a daily basis reassuring New Yorkers that the situation was in control, and that the city will recover, and become stronger than ever.\nAlthough he has been heralded for his response during the September 11 attack, he was previously criticized for ignoring the Islamic threat of terrorism in light of the World Trade Center bombing of 1993."

She thought that this was the reason why people had trouble relating to people in the real world. Everyone was living online now.\nMaria had trouble making new friends because she hated being on social media websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. She rarely met new people. She tried going up to people on the bus and starting a conversation, but they always looked at her weirdly. She felt like she was an outsider, and the only one that was not caught in the Internet's web of lies.\nOne day, while Maria was walking in the park, she saw a girl walking through the park. The girl wore a long, colorful dress, and was always smiling. Maria wanted to talk to this girl. She walked up to the girl and said hello. At first the girl was startled, because she didn't see Maria coming, but then she smiled and said, \"Hello. Do we know each other?\" Maria shook her head and said no. Maria asked her if she wanted to hang out and talk. The girl said sure. Maria and the girl talked for hours.

        "content": "Regular dentist visits can do more than keep your smile attractive. They can tell dentists a lot about your overall health, including whether or not you may be at risk for disease. New research suggests that the health of your mouth mirrors the condition of your body as a whole. For example, when your mouth is healthy, chances are your overall health is good, too. On the other hand, if you have poor oral health, you may have other health problems, so it is important to see a dentist on a regular basis.\nDentists are not hard to find. If you are working, and have dental insurance coverage, your company will provide a list of dental care offices whose services are covered by their insurance. It would be wise to check this out. However, why is dental hygiene so important? Research shows that more than 90 percent of all systemic diseases, which involve many organs or the whole body, have oral health connections, including swollen gums, mouth ulcers, dry mouth and excessive gum problems. Diseases such as diabetes, oral cancer, heart or kidney diseases, leukemia, and pancreatic cancer can all have ties to poor oral hygiene.\nSome of the things you can do starts with seeing a dentist on a regular basis. Seeing a dentist regularly helps to keep your mouth in top shape and allows your dentist to watch for developments that may point to other health issues. A dental exam can detect problems such as poor nutrition, and improper jaw alignment. Provide your dentist with a complete medical history, and inform him or her of any recent health developments, even if they seem unrelated to your oral health. One of the great advantages of oral health is having a great smile. A healthy smile can give a person confidence and is a good indication of a healthy body."

Suddenly, he smiled and blurted out. \"I know exactly where to go!\"\nIt was warm day in Pasadena.

His military record is impressive, as he fought successfully in some of the most dangerous, and historic battles during the great war. Murphy also found success after the war as an actor who appeared in several films.\nMurphy was born into a very large family in Hunt, Texas. He was one of 12 children, and grew up in abject poverty. His father deserted his family; his mother died at a young age, so Murphy dropped out of school to get work. Murphy held a series of odd jobs from an early age to help the family financially, but eventually realized that a military life was the best course to take.\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Murphy knew he needed to be in the military to defend his country, but he was not yet old enough to enlist legally. With the help of one of his older sisters, who helped provide him with false records, Murphy enlisted into the Army at the age of 17. It wasn't long before Murphy began making his name in the military. He first saw action in the invasion of Sicily, and was involved in the liberation of Rome. He became famous for leading his men into a battle while he was wounded, and out of ammunition. He won several awards for valor.\nAfter the war, he launched a successful Hollywood career. His most notable film was playing himself in the epic movie classic From Here to Eternity, which was based on his autobiography. Murphy starred in several western-themed films. He died at the age of 46 in a plane crash in the state of Virginia."

It is also the home to The Lincoln Park Zoo, the oldest public zoo in the U.S. Maybe the windy city should be called the city of firsts.\nChicago is the third most populous city in the U.S., after New York City and Los Angeles.

President Barack Obama used to live in Chicago.\nNearly 40 million people visit Chicago every year.  Many of them visit the Willis Tower.

This is because the landlord doesn't know who your guests are. If they damage the apartment in any way, you will be responsible. Also sometimes a friend who wants to crash on your couch ends up staying for a really long time, and ends up becoming another tenant.\nYou are responsible for all the utilities you use while living in a rental apartment. This means you will have to pay for the electricity and gas you use. If the landlord pays for any utilities, it will say so in the lease. Once you move in, you will have to call the electric company and the gas company so they can put accounts in your name. Also if you want a phone line, cable or Internet, you will have to call those companies and pay for those services yourself unless the lease says that is included in your rent.\nYour landlord is supposed to have access to the apartment you are renting from them. This doesn't mean they can just barge in whenever. It does mean though that with notice, the landlord is allowed to come into the apartment during a reasonable time, meaning not in the middle of the night when you are sleeping. During this time the landlord will inspect the apartment to make sure you are following the rules, and the landlord can also make any necessary repairs. All of this should be written out on the lease. If it is not, do not be afraid to ask the landlord to add that information. It protects both the landlord and you."

Specifically, King protested segregation that separated blacks and whites in public restrooms, public pools, public schools, on buses, and at restaurants.

On the holiday many people participate in marches and vigils remembering Dr. King. Others use the day as a day of service and volunteer in their community by cleaning up garbage in a local park or serving food to the homeless. However, the holiday was controversial. Some states didn't want to honor Dr. King and tried to  rename the holiday or combine the day with another holiday.\nOnly two other people have a U.S. national holiday, Christopher Columbus and George Washington. Martin Luther King Jr. Day  became a holiday in 1983 after pressure from civil rights activists and marches, similar to the ones King used to lead.

Since the founding of the country people have come from different countries in search of a better life and opportunities. Immigration laws, however, are always changing and are complicated. This leads to many people coming into the U.S. without proper legal status. While some people call immigrants who come and stay in the U.S. without the proper papers \"illegals\", many consider this term offensive. The more acceptable term is \"undocumented\" since they do not have the correct legal documents.\nIt is estimated that there are more than 11 million undocumented people in the Unites States. While some people will say there is no reason for immigrants to be undocumented in the U.S., there are limits on the number of Green Cards, or legal permanent  resident cards, people from certain countries can get. There are also long waiting lists, up to 14 years in some cases, for people coming from certain countries, to apply for legal status in the U.S. Additionally there are a limited amount of visas, or permits, for people coming into the U.S. with manual labor skills. Millions of undocumented people have been deported, or sent back to their country of origin under President Obama.\nIn 2013, the U.S. Senate passed an immigration reform bill. The law adds extra border security along the U.S.-Mexico border, and also makes it easier for immigrants to become citizens. The bill, which also has to be approved by the House of Representatives, has not yet been presented or voted on by Congress.

The three parts of the U.S. Government are the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Each branch works independently of the other two, and each has its own responsibilities. This system is in place to ensure that no branch can carry more power than the other. This is called the separation of powers, which was written into the Constitution.\nThe executive branch is the branch that most Americans are familiar with. It includes the president of the United States, the vice-president, and the cabinet. The president is the leader of the country and is the commander-in-chief of the U.S. military. The vice-president is second-in-command, and will act as president if the president dies, resigns, or is removed from office. The cabinet acts as agents of the U.S. President, and carry out the duties they are entrusted with.\nThe legislative branch of government consists of the House of Representatives, and the Senate. Together they form the congress, which can levy and collect taxes, mint money, and establish federal courts. It can also declare war, and raise and support the army, navy, and air force to protect the country. The House of Representatives has 435 members, and the Senate consists of 100 senators, with two from each of the states. Any legislation, or new law, must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\nThe judicial branch is entrusted to apply the laws created by the legislative branch of government.

The stadium where he played in New York is commonly called \"The House that Ruth Built.\" Ruth played baseball for 22 years for the Boston Red Sox, and the New York Yankees, where he rewrote the record books. He almost single-handedly invented the home run, which is baseball's most cherished feat. Before Ruth, the home run was a novelty. It was a game of strategy, but the Babe changed all that.\nRuth was born in a rough section of Baltimore, Maryland in 1895. Much of his childhood has been lost to history. He spent a number of years at St. Mary's reformatory school after being labeled as \"incorrigible.\" His behavior was thought to be beyond rehabilitation. When exactly he got his start in baseball is also a mystery. Some accounts offer that he was placed on St. Mary's baseball team by the coach of the time. One popular story has Ruth being sent to the school because of his natural ability to hit a baseball. The story is that Ruth broke many windows while playing baseball on the streets, and that is why he was sent to the school in the first place.\nBefore the 1920s, baseball was a slow game that included advancing players around the bases by strategically hitting the ball within the park. Ruth came in and was soon hitting balls out of the ballpark to the delight of the fans in attendance. The home run became an integral part of the game. Ruth earned several nicknames because of his power, including the \"Bambino,\" and the \"Sultan of Swat.\"\nWhen Ruth was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees in a very unpopular move, the Yankees won seven World Series championships in his 12 years. Ruth made headlines for his after-hours antics in New York City as well. His drinking, and womanizing are well-documented.

The salesperson shook his head. \"No, sir. These are all working weapons. I have some machetes and knives too if you want something more traditional,\" the salesperson explained.\n\"No, I just came in for some softball equipment,\" William told the salesperson. \"Well, you can take home any of these lovely rifles or guns along with your softball equipment today,\" the salesperson continued. \"I don't need a license?\" William asked. The salesperson shook his head. \"There's no waiting period?\" William asked. The salesperson shook his head again. \"I don't have to take a safety course?\" William asked. He couldn't believe it was so easy to buy a gun.\n\"No, sir. It's cash and carry here,\" the salesperson said, \"So can I show you a fine firearm today?\" William shook his head. \"No, but can I take a picture? My friends back in New York won't believe it's this easy to buy a gun here.\" \"Sure, buddy,\" the salesperson said, \"I'll even take a picture of you with any weapons you want.\""

A basketball hit me in the head when I was talking to a girl. I was trying to climb the big rope in the gym and fell down in front of everyone, who started laughing. However, the worst thing was yet to happen.\nAt the end of a year, we always have a test to see how we have improved. We have to run a mile. The whole class does this at the same time. I wasn't the fastest runner, but I knew I could get a good score for this test. For this activity, we have to go into the locker room and change into our uniform. I left my uniform in my locker the other day since it was clean. When I opened my locker, I saw a note saying, \"Buy new uniform, loser.\" Someone had broken into my locker and took my clothes. I told the teacher, who went into his office and gave me an old uniform that had been left behind. \"Suit up and I'll see you out there,\" he said.\nI tried tying a rope around the shorts to make them fit, but they wouldn't. The bell rang, and I knew my teacher would be mad if I didn't get out there. I started running, and barely got there before he started calling names. After he finished with the roll call, we started the test. The whole class set off running. I was doing okay at the beginning. After a while, people started passing me. A lot of people laughed at my shorts. Then it happened. One guy pushed me out of his way, and I ended up falling. My shorts fell first, and then I fell to the ground. That was when all the girls started passing me. One of them shouted, \"Ew, he doesn't have clean underwear.\" I picked up my shorts, and walked the rest of the mile. It was the most embarrassing moment in my life."

That was the year Lindbergh flew from New York City to Paris across the Atlantic Ocean solo. Aviation technology was not very advanced during that time period. Lindbergh's plane The Spirit of St. Louis was believed by many to be simply too small to make the solo flight across the great Atlantic. Just carrying enough fuel for the flight was a challenge, and so was the trip itself. Because of the limitations on the speed of aircraft at the time, it would take many hours to make the trip; it was generally accepted that a pilot could not make it alone. Lindbergh would not be deterred though.\nLindbergh was working as a mail pilot when he decided to make his cross-Atlantic flight. Six well-known and trained aviators had lost their lives trying to make the flight before him, so his odds for success were not in his favor. On the morning of May 20, 1927, Lindbergh launched his small plane from Roosevelt Field in New York, and determined to reach Paris. The flight was an international event as Lindbergh's progress was reported by report stations throughout his flight. Lindbergh faced many dangers and challenges during his flight, including foul weather, and flying blind through thick fog. He also had to fight his fatigue during the nearly 54-hour flight.\nIt was all well worth the trouble when Lindbergh landed in Paris on Saturday night, May 21, 1927. More than 150,000 French citizens had gathered to join the celebration of his historic flight. Lindbergh had become an international superstar literally overnight. He came home to an adoring the American public that celebrated his fame with a parade through the streets of New York City."

One of my favorite things to do when my family comes over to visit is go for a ride in my dad's car and see all the houses with their Christmas lights on.\nLast year, my dad told us that he had seen a neighborhood with the whole block filled with houses with lights. We decided to go see them. The whole family crammed into two cars. We drove for about 40 minutes. When we got there, our faces lit up with joy at the sight of all the lights. My cousins decided that they wanted to walk outside and watch the lights. We all got out and started walking, but when it was time to go back home, we didn't notice that my youngest brother was not in the car.\nHe had separated from the family, and went to see a house all the way at the end. No one noticed, and we left him there for an hour. He knocked on the house that he went to see, and told the people that lived there what had happened. He knew my cell phone number, and so he called me. We were about to arrive at my house when I got the call. I told my dad, and he nearly crashed the car, because he got so scared.\nWe dropped everyone off and I decided to go with my dad to pick up my brother. When we arrived at the house, my brother was sitting on the couch watching television with the children that lived there and drinking hot chocolate. My dad hugged him and said sorry. The people who lived there said that it was fine that their children liked my brother because he was funny. They said he could come back anytime. I was relieved nothing had happened to my brother."

They were named because there were almost exactly the same. The only difference is that one had a tall antenna on the top.\nWhen they were built, the 1,368-foot tall buildings were the tallest in the world. Such tall buildings needed a way for people to travel in them. The towers had 95 elevators in total. Visitors used to travel to the 107th and 110th floors, where there were observation decks from which one could see the entire city and New Jersey. Inside there were offices, shops, a hotel, and on the top floor of one of the towers there was a restaurant called \"Windows on the World\". The restaurant even hosted a salsa night on Thursdays. A number of subway lines ran underneath the towers. The World Trade Center Complex, with a total of seven buildings, was so large that it had its own zip code. In 1974 a French man walked a tightrope between the twin towers.\nThe World Trade Center survived a bombing in 1993. The skyline and spirit of New York City were changed after September 11, 2001. That morning, two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan. At first the top floors of the buildings were in flames. Soon they came tumbling down, covering lower Manhattan in hot metal and ash. A total of 2,753 people died. For weeks the air smelled of burnt metal and plastic. It took eight months for the site to be cleaned. Years later, The World Trade Center is rebuilding. There is a new tower, called the Freedom Tower. There is also a memorial and museum to honor those who died in the 2001 attack."

We looked for hours.\nMy dad told me that maybe Spot got picked up by a dog catcher. If that was true, then he would be at the dog pound, which is where they send all the dogs that get lost. My friend Mark told me that they put pictures of all the dogs they find in the street online, so I went online to try. I spent more than an hour checking the online pictures of the dogs, and finally found my Spot. I started jumping with joy.\nI went with my mom and dad to pick up Spot. When we got there, he started barking and running in circles all around his cage. I knew he was happy to see us. He had been lost for about two weeks. When we got him home, he ran around the backyard and ran directly into his little house my dad and I built for him. He started barking really loudly, which is weird for Spot. As soon as my sister heard Spot, she came running out to try and catch him. He ran around her and then let himself be captured. I think he just wanted to be petted. I knew he was happy to be back home and even happier when I brought out his food. I hope Spot never gets lost again."

For example, Gustav really wanted to see the Grand Canyon in Arizona. He also really wanted to go to Los Angeles to see where some of his favorite movie stars lived.\nOnce in New York City Gustav asked the hotel concierge if they could arrange some trips for him. The concierge was helpful and informed Gustav about the different Amtrak trains he could take to Philadelphia and Washington D.C.  \"What about the Grand Canyon and Hollywood?\" Gustav asked. \"What about them?\" the concierge asked, looking confused. \"What about trips there?\" Gustav asked. The concierge pulled out a map and showed Gustav how far Arizona and California are from New York. \"A train there will take you about a week. A plane ride will take about six hours,\" the concierge explained. Gustav was disappointed. He had no idea that the United States was such a large country.

He has been hosting the show that bears his name since 1993 after he was passed over for Johnny Carson's replacement following the 1992 season. Many observers felt Letterman was the obvious choice to replace Carson when the latter retired. \"Late Night with David Letterman\" had the choice time slot immediately following Carson, and both were under contract with the National Broadcasting Company (NBC).\n\"The Late Show with David Letterman\" debuted on August 30,1993. Letterman took his fan base with him to CBS for the most part, and the battle lines had been drawn. Letterman's new show was not an exact duplicate of his show on NBC. CBS executives did not want Letterman to import his old show, opting to create a new image for Letterman. Letterman persisted and his show took root, and found its audience. Letterman has since surpassed Carson's record for longevity in 2013. Letterman has now hosted a late night show for more than 31 years.\nLetterman's early life was influenced by his father, who was also a comic. He was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on April 12, 1947. His first foray into the entertainment industry came while a college student at Ball State University, where he served as a radio broadcaster for the student-run station. He moved to Los Angeles in 1975 at the behest of his former wife. Once in L.A., Letterman began doing stand-up comedy, at the world famous Comedy Club, and his career was launched."

The professional basketball league has existed since 1947, and there have been many individual players that have excelled in the game. Players such as Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and Jerry West had made their mark in the league long before Jordan ever played the game.\nTo be sure, Jordan had a great impact on the game primarily during his playing years with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan led the team to six championship finals, winning all six during the 1990s. His legend is firmly cemented into the history of the great city, and many fans feel he has no equal. It is hard to argue against Jordan in light of his success in all the titles he achieved, but basketball is a team sport, and winning a championship needs a team effort. There have been countless superstars who played in the league that did not have good teammates, and never won a title. Chamberlain falls into that category.\nChamberlain did win two NBA titles in his career, but no one in the game ever dominated it the way he did. He holds several league records, one of which is that he is the only player ever to score 100 points in a single game. However, when Chamberlain played the game, the NBA was not as big as it was in the 90s. During the 90s, the league enjoyed a much greater popularity among American viewers, and much of this can be attributed to the greatness of Michael Jordan. Jordan brought a style of play that had rarely been seen in the NBA. He garnered many individual awards during his career. He played his last few seasons as a member of the Washington Bullets."

Public housing options are run by the federal, state, and city government agencies. Living in public housing is often called \"living in the projects\", but this is a negative term based on stereotypes. Not all public housing options mean living in huge, run-down buildings with lots of crime.\nPublic housing programs come in all sizes and types. One type is a single-family house. Another type includes living in a high-rise building, or apartments in tall buildings. All public housing options are rental options, meaning you do not own the place where you live.\nEligibility for public housing is based on a number of factors. One factor is your annual gross income, meaning how much money you make in a year. Another factor is if you are elderly or have a disability. Another factor taken into consideration is your U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status. Most public housing options are only available to U.S. citizens or U.S. legal residents. Like with any rental, your references are checked to make sure you and your family will be good tenants. This means looking at your credit history and your criminal record. People with criminal records are usually banned or not allowed to use public housing options.\nTo find out if you are eligible for public housing, you need to visit a government housing assistance office close to you. You can find your local housing assistance office by checking the yellow pages or by looking online. You will have to fill out an application. On the application you will need to list the names, gender, and date of birth of all people who would be living in the house or apartment."

The flowers thrown may not be actually the same flowers the bride carries down the aisle during the wedding ceremony. An identical bouquet is created for the bride to toss.

There have been videos documenting how women will sometimes even  fight each other for the bridal bouquet.\nThe groom has something to toss at the wedding reception, too. One tradition is the groom takes a garter from his new wife's leg and toss the garter to the unmarried men attending the reception. According to the tradition, the single man who catches the garter will be the next man to get married. Sometimes the groom will remove the garter from his wife's leg with his teeth. At some wedding receptions, the man who catches the garter has to place it on the leg of the woman who catches the bridal bouquet. Some people think this is too sexual, and just skip this part. It is the decision of the bride and groom.\nThe bride and groom often toast each other with champagne before the end of the reception. Sometimes a bride and groom will leave the reception before it is over. They go right to the airport to begin their honeymoon, a special vacation celebrating their new life together."

Eastwood's words became an instant catchphrase that many Americans can recite to this day. Eastwood is quite possibly the epitome of the macho American man. He holds icon-like status among males for portraying the tough guy in nearly all his films.\nEastwood was born in 1930 in San Francisco before coming to Los Angeles at an early age. He briefly attended Los Angeles City College, but soon dropped out to pursue an acting career. After appearing in a couple of low-budget films, Eastwood got his big break in the old TV western Rawhide. His character Rowdy Yates was an instant celebrity, and it launched Eastwood's incredible career. Eastwood first burst onto the big screen with his roles in three western movies in the 1960s. The so-called Spaghetti Westerns, which were called that because of their ties to Italian cinema, were all very successful, and made Eastwood a household name.\nEastwood followed his success with a string of movies that is unparalleled in Hollywood history. He starred in the very popular Dirty Harry franchise, where he, once again, played the tough guy. In this series, Dirty Harry is a San Francisco police officer who takes matters into his own hands. This troubles his superiors to no end, but Harry always wins. This persona delighted the American movie audiences, especially the men.\nActing was not the only talent Eastwood would eventually display. He became an Oscar-winning director also. Arguably, his best film as a director was Million Dollar Baby, but it is hard to pick one film from his impressive list of movies. He is still active in film at the age of 74."

Helen's husband Roger came over to see why Helen was screaming and jumping. Helen told Roger \"You're not going to believe it. Your sister entered us in a sweepstakes for a Hawaii vacation, and we won. We won, Roger!\" Roger didn't believe it at first, but then he researched it. \"Well, I guess we're going to Hawaii, honey,\" he told Helen. They both started jumping with joy.\nHelen and Roger arrived at Hawaii, and couldn't believe how beautiful everything looked. They had been married for 20 years, but had never had a vacation. After they had checked into their hotel room, they decided to go to the beach. They met a surfer named William, although he liked to be called Will, who was offering free lessons. Seeing that Roger had always wanted to learn how to surf, they decided to go. Will explained to Roger how to paddle the surf board, and he taught him how to stand up on it. After two hours of training in the sand, Will told Roger that they would go out to the water. Roger didn't like that.\n\"Where are we going?\" Roger nervously asked. \"Over there,\" said Will, as he pointed to the ocean. He started getting nervous, and started breathing heavy. Helen went over to Roger and calmed him down. \"They're probably in their honeymoon,\" people said as they passed Roger and Helen. Roger laughed. He finally calmed down. He went out to the ocean with Will, and tried to surf. Every time he tried to get on the surf board he ended up falling. When they got back to the land, Helen hugged Roger and kissed him. \"You did great, honey. I love you,\" Helen said. Roger knew she was lying, but he had never seen Helen smile so greatly. He let it go."

Maria had bought a few things for the kitchen. Mike, as usual, was stuck with the task of being the carrier. A few hours had passed since they had first arrived. Mike wondered if they were going to be there much longer.\nThere was a UCLA football game he wanted to watch at home. He looked at his clock and noticed that it was almost five o'clock. The football game started at six. Mike and Maria had been at the mall since two that afternoon. Their time had been spent window shopping and actual shopping. There were a lot of people at the mall that day. It made sense seeing as how it was the weekend.\nThe mall usually had the most visitors during the weekend, especially by families. Mike and Maria passed by a family with a crying child. The child was crying because he wanted a toy and his parents wouldn't buy it. The child's wailing was so loud it made Mike's ears ring!\nMike looked at Maria and said, \"I hope our future children aren't cry babies like that one.\" Maria laughed and agreed. \"Let's just agree not to have any,\" she said. \"I hope you are kidding,\" Mike replied. Maria looked straight ahead as they continued walking. They were nearing the exit and Mike saw the opportunity to bring up leaving."

They can also serve in the military and go fight in wars for the country. An 18-year old can also buy cigarettes and other tobacco products, but 18-year-olds cannot buy alcoholic beverages. People in the U.S. need to wait until they are 21 to be able to do that.\nAt the age of 18, people can legally live on their own, work, and get married. However, turning 18 doesn't mean everyone is ready to take on adult responsibilities. At the age of 18, most people are just graduating from high school. Many will go to college. Some young people choose to go to college far from their homes and live in dormitories. Others pick a college close to home and stay with their parents to save money. Yet others will choose to live on their own. Legally, a parent does not have to provide for their child when the child turns 18.\nSome parents in the U.S. take this very seriously and expect their children to move out as soon as they turn 18. Some parents will even forcibly kick their kids out when the kids turn 18. There tends to be some difference about this depending on if the kid is female or male. It is considered more acceptable for a female to stay living with her parents after her 18th birthday. Many females aren't expected to leave their parents' house until they get married. There is still an expectation for young men, however, to go out and live independent lives as soon as they can. With the economy of the U.S. struggling, some adult children are returning to their parents' home in their 20s and 30s. These are called boomerang kids, since like a boomerang, they return where they came from."

Nancy heard that cell phone companies rejecting people because they had poor credit. However, she needed a phone. She wanted people to be able to get in touch with her no matter where she was; she wanted to have a cell phone in case of an emergency, so she decided to go to a local cell phone company store and see if they would work with her.\nThe clerk at the cell phone store was very helpful. He was willing to work with Nancy to find a cell phone plan that worked with her budget. He checked Nancy's credit and found out that her credit rating was not very high. He told Nancy that this didn't mean she couldn't have a cell phone. Nancy could get a no-contract or pre-paid cell phone. The clerk explained to Nancy that her credit would not be checked, and she wouldn't have to sign a contract that tied her to a specific phone or service. With a pre-paid phone, she would pay the same amount of money every month. The cost depended on how many minutes she wanted to be able to talk, how much text messaging she planned on doing, and if she was going to use the phone to access the Internet. A pre-paid phone plan meant that Nancy would not get a special deal on a phone though. She would have to pay full price and no special discounts would apply. Nancy had some choices to make."

She had envisioned herself getting off the airplane and immediately making new friends with whom she would spend her nights exploring The City That Never Sleeps.\nUnfortunately, the reality of Amy's situation was far from the perfect life she had imagined. Her days were spent jumping from theatre to theatre looking for auditions. Although she was very pretty, and great at acting, her accent made it difficult for her to get hired for any roles. Directors kept telling her to work on her American accent, but the more she practiced it, the more she sounded like a cowboy rather than a New Yorker.\nAmy's nights were spent working at a diner in order to pay for her ridiculously expensive one-room apartment where the sinks always leaked and the hot water never worked. To top it all off, the city that she had imagined as being filled with bright lights and friendly faces like in the movies was made up mostly of smelly alleys, big rats, and angry crowds that were always in a hurry to get somewhere. Still, Amy didn't let anything crush her spirits, and was determined to keep working hard until her dreams would come true.\nFinally one day, Amy was clearing some tables in the diner while singing her favorite song as usual. \"Excuse me,\" said a man in a nearby booth. \"I couldn't help but notice that you have a beautiful voice.\" Amy blushed and thanked the man. \"I'm actually casting for a star in my new Broadway musical of Mary Poppins,\" he continued. \"How would you feel about acting?\" Amy's heart raced with excitement just as Frank Sinatra's \"New York, New York\" began playing on the diner's jukebox.

When someone dies and the cause of death is undetermined or suspicious, the body is brought here for examination. It is the coroner's job to determine the time, cause, and manner of death. Sometimes the coroner will have to perform an autopsy, which is like an operation on a dead body to try to figure out how the person died. One of the reasons the L.A. Coroner's Office is so popular is because of the number of famous people who have been examined there. Some of those people include Marilyn Monroe, Robert F. Kennedy, Michael Jackson, and Whitney Houston.\nThe Los Angeles Coroner's Office is so popular that there is even a gift shop where visitors can buy items like shirts, caps, and mugs with the Coroner's logo on them. One tee-shirt people can buy even says, \"Our bodies of work speak for themselves\". They even sell beach towels with body outlines. The store is open five days a week. They also have a website and a paper catalog for those who are not close enough to visit. The Coroner's Office claims the purpose of the store is to tell people how fragile life is and to create awareness and responsibility toward one's actions. Some people feel that having a store in the same place where dead people are is disrespectful.\nThere have been a number of television shows about the L.A. Coroner's Office. Some of these are reality TV shows featuring what workers really do there. An example is called \"Death Detectives\". Other shows are fictional like \"Quincy M.E.\" The M.E. stands for medical examiner, the person who performs the autopsies."

Mickey Mouse is a creation of the late Walt Disney, who pioneered the age of theme parks into popular, American culture. Today, Mickey is the official mascot of the Walt Disney Corporation. He is what is called an anthropomorphic character, which is a term used to describe a non-human character that has human characteristics. Mickey can speak, laugh, cry, and use his hands like a human. He also walks on two legs rather than four. His trademark red shorts, large yellow shoes, white gloves, and over-sized mouse ears make him one of the most recognizable cartoon characters in America, and in the world.\nMickey was created by Disney in 1928 in the short film Steamboat Willie. That film was the first of 130 films starring the famous mouse. He has also starred in 10 full-length, feature films. In the 1930s, Mickey began to appear in comic books, and on November 18, 1978 he got his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He became the first cartoon character to earn a star on the historic sidewalk. Ten of his films have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film with Lend a Paw winning the award. Walt Disney received an Honorary Award for creating the character in 1932.\nOne of the most popular children's shows in American history was the \"Mickey Mouse Club,\" which ran from 1955 to 1996. Mickey has a girlfriend named Minnie Mouse, a dog named Pluto, and a host of friends that include Donald, and Daisy Duck, who are stars on their own.\nToday, Mickey Mouse merchandise can be found world wide. He appears in all Disney theme parks throughout the world. In 1988 Mickey made his last full-length film appearance when he starred in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This was a significant occurrence because it was the first time that Disney characters starred alongside Warner Brother's characters. The two corporations had been long-time rivals."

The \"Babe,\" as he was known, is largely responsible for building the game as it exists today. The stadium where he played in New York is commonly called \"The House that Ruth Built.\" Ruth played baseball for 22 years for the Boston Red Sox, and the New York Yankees, where he rewrote the record books. He almost single-handedly invented the home run, which is baseball's most cherished feat. Before Ruth, the home run was a novelty. It was a game of strategy, but the Babe changed all that.\nRuth was born in a rough section of Baltimore, Maryland in 1895. Much of his childhood has been lost to history. He spent a number of years at St. Mary's reformatory school after being labeled as \"incorrigible.\" His behavior was thought to be beyond rehabilitation. When exactly he got his start in baseball is also a mystery. Some accounts offer that he was placed on St. Mary's baseball team by the coach of the time. One popular story has Ruth being sent to the school because of his natural ability to hit a baseball. The story is that Ruth broke many windows while playing baseball on the streets, and that is why he was sent to the school in the first place.\nBefore the 1920s, baseball was a slow game that included advancing players around the bases by strategically hitting the ball within the park. Ruth came in and was soon hitting balls out of the ballpark to the delight of the fans in attendance. The home run became an integral part of the game. Ruth earned several nicknames because of his power, including the \"Bambino,\" and the \"Sultan of Swat.\"\nWhen Ruth was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees in a very unpopular move, the Yankees won seven World Series championships in his 12 years. Ruth made headlines for his after-hours antics in New York City as well. His drinking, and womanizing are well-documented. However, Ruth was a spiritual man who lived-out his years as a devout Catholic."

The water was clear, but cold.\nOne of Donald's favorite things to do at the pool was to go on the diving board. As Donald stood on the edge of the diving board, he started jumping in order to get high enough to do a flip. He jumped once, and then twice. When he was about to jump off again, he saw that Sarah was looking at him from the entrance of the pool. Donald got so nervous that he couldn't finish the flip, and he landed on his back. Everyone in the deep end of the pool started laughing. Donald felt embarrassed as he swam to the edge of the pool, but when he got there he saw Sarah waiting for him. \"Ouch, that had to hurt. You want to go swimming with me?\" Sarah asked Donald. Donald said sure nervously, and started swimming with Sarah. Donald had never been happier, and never been in that much pain."

The list of Jackson's peers in the industry is very short, to say the least. Jackson began his career in the early 1970s as the youngest member of the musical group The Jackson 5. Michael was the lead singer, and arguably the most talented of the five brothers who made up the band. He was born on August 29, 1958 as the eighth child of 10 in an African American family from Gary Indiana. The driving force behind the group's success was their father, Joseph \"Joe\" Jackson. The group was very popular in its time, but young Michael would go out on his own career soon after. He was a successful singer, songwriter, actor, dancer, and businessman, but his career was not without controversy.\nHis album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time. It was released in 1982, and was followed by a series of successful albums, films, music videos, and business ventures. In 1993 the first of several people came forward to accuse Jackson of sexually improper conduct on a child. This and other accusations would haunt Jackson throughout his adult life. Jackson also gained a reputation of strange behavior. One of the indelible images often associated with Jackson is when he held his newborn child over a hotel balcony to show it to his public.\nIt was rumored that Jackson bought the bones of the famous Elephant Man, slept in an oxygen tent, and that he altered his appearance to appear white. His photographs from his childhood and as a young adult show a very different Jackson. He married twice in his life including a brief marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of the equally great musician, Elvis Presley.\nJackson died on June 25, 2009, and even his death was not without controversy. His family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against his doctor, who was subsequently found guilty."

The secretary smiled and told Mary that it didn't cost anything except a little bit of time. In order to find out if Mary's child was qualified to get free lunch at school, she had to fill out a form. The form was available in many languages besides English. It asked Mary basic questions like where she lived, how many children she had, and what her annual income was.\nFilling out the form was easy, and Mary didn't have to include proof of her income. She was worried though if the information on the form would be shared with other agencies. The secretary told her that the information was not shared. If Mary made below a certain amount annually, her child could get free lunch not just during the school year, but also even during the summer, when there was no school.\nMary knew this would help her family. While Mary did work, she only worked part-time. Giving her child money for lunch every day did add up and impact the family budget.\nAfter filling out and submitting the form back to the school secretary, Mary had to wait a month or two before finding out if she was qualified. A few weeks after she submitted the form, a letter arrived in the mail. The letter informed her that her child was qualified.

Tickets to the prom cost $120 per student. Renting tuxedos cost a lot of money. Not to mention the fact that traditionally he had to buy his date a corsage. Most students split the cost of a limousine among friends.\nCallie had more than money on her mind, though. She had heard stories about wild things happening on prom night.

Memorial Day is always observed on the last Monday of May. Memorial Day has its roots in the U.S. Civil War when a holiday, Decoration Day, was established to honor both Union and Confederate soldiers who died. On Decoration Day people used to \"decorate\" the graves of deceased soldiers with flags and flowers. The name Memorial Day became more widely used after World War II in the late 1940s. However, the holiday wasn't officially called Memorial Day until 1967.\nMemorial Day is commemorated by ceremonies in cemeteries across the country. The most well-known one is held in Arlington National Cemetery near Washington D.C. Arlington is a military cemetery, meaning only military personnel are buried there. Volunteers place U.S. flags on military graves at Arlington and other national cemeteries. There are also parades in honor of fallen service people held in different towns and cities. Another Memorial Day tradition is flying the U.S. flag at half staff until noon, meaning it is flown at half its normal height. This is considered a sign of mourning. The flag is raised to its full height after noon as a sign that the military will rise up despite the loss. There is also a national Memorial Day concert that takes place on the lawn of the U.S. Capital.\nMemorial Day is also known as the unofficial start of the summer season. Many beaches and pools open up for Memorial Day weekend. Many people also host barbecues on Memorial Day weekend."

It is the second most important decision you will make as a parent - apart from deciding to have children in the first place. It is a very personal decision that is based on many factors. Some of those factors are having a strong teacher and child relationship, ensuring the school you choose is proficient in Math and English studies, and picking a school your child is comfortable with.\nThe connection between a child and a teacher is more important than any curriculum. Think of it this way: your 3 or 4-year-old is accustomed to being surrounded by loving people like his or her parents or siblings throughout the day, and the school is your children's first time to spend a large portion of their day away from those people; you want to look for a preschool teacher who is good with students, takes pride in his or her students' progress, and is consistently open to their improvement. The only way to know all this is to talk to your teacher.\nEnglish and Math proficiency is the key to a successful academic career.  It is okay to ask about a school's success rate in these two critical areas. Pick a school that has shown a solid history of student academic success in these subjects. If a school is good at teaching these basic skills, then there is a good chance your child will benefit from it. Another thing to remember is your child's feelings. Children are more perceptive than you may realize, and they lack the ability to successfully communicate this to adults. So talk to your child, ask them how they feel about the school, and listen carefully to what they say."

George laughed and said, \"Start with Journalism 101.\"\nChris took his advice, and soon he fell in love with writing in journalism style. Its short, precise method of writing appealed to Chris. Journalists deal only in facts. It is not like English writing. You don't paint pictures in journalism; you report facts. There is a measure of creativity involved with writing in a journalistic style, but it is unlike English.\nSoon, Chris earned his certificate, and went on to earn his Master's degree in journalism. He now works for a large, daily newspaper. He is very grateful to his old friend George, who introduced him to journalism. He has now been published more than 200 times.

Alcohol is a depressant that slows down a person's reactions. It also affects different people in different ways. Some people can have a beer or two, or maybe a couple of cocktails without being negatively affected, while others will be severely impaired with the same amount. For those who have a lower threshold for alcoholic drinks, even one or two drinks can mean trouble when driving an automobile.\nNot only is drinking and driving not a good idea, it is against the law. In the United States, Driving Under the Influence (DUI) of drugs or alcohol is a very serious offense. If a person is caught by the police on a DUI charge, it will mean trouble for that person. Being convicted of DUI can mean the loss of the person's driver's license, a large fine, and worst of all, it may mean jail time.\nDrinking and driving could also be dangerous. If a person drives after having a few too many drinks, his or her driving skills will not be as good as they should be. Drivers must have control at all times. Remember, a driver is operating a vehicle that weighs about 2,000 pounds, which could reach speeds of up to 100 miles per hour. Driving a car is a great responsibility. Drunk drivers can cause accidents, injuries, and even deaths. So the next time you are going out for a good time, please consider using a ride-sharing service, or a taxi. Enjoy yourself. Have a few drinks, but be smart. The life you save may be your own."

She knew she had to study for at least three hours per day in the next couple of days if she hoped to get the grade she wanted. Luella needed to score at least a ninety percent in her test in order to pass her Algebra class with an A.\nThe stakes were high for Luella. She had attended every lecture this semester. She had jotted down notes upon notes to take home and study. She had even sat in a few tutoring sessions after class. After turning in all her homework and passing all her quizzes, Luella still felt like she could fail her final test. After all, it was cumulative, meaning the test would test her on everything she had learned.\nLuella knew what she had to do. It was time to buckle down and study like there was no tomorrow. Motivated and determined, Luella sat at her desk and studied for at least three hours for the next three days. By the time the night before the test came, Luella felt confident that she would do well.\nLuella woke up that Monday morning with a grin on her face. She had dreamed of taking the test. In the dream she passed her test with an A. It was up to Luella to make her dream come true that Monday morning. Luella was assured she would. She knew all that studying was about to pay off as she walked into her classroom and sat down at her desk. \"Nothing can go wrong,\" Luella said to herself.\nShe was right!

Donna was only 10 years old, and couldn't remember a day in her life without Sandy by her side. Sandy was Donna's best friend.\nThe two could be seen together on most days. Donna cared for Sandy every day. She fed her, brushed her, and played with her. Donna went with Sandy whenever it was time to take her to the veterinarian's office for a physical checkup. Donna always wanted to be with her furry friend on those occasions because she didn't want Sandy to feel alone and afraid. Donna was also responsible for cleaning up after Sandy, which meant picking up her poop. Donna didn't mind though. She loved Sandy.\nOne day, Donna and Sandy were coming home from the park. They were walking down the street near their home when Donna let Sandy off her leash. Donna knew she wasn't supposed to let her off the leash, but she always did when they were just a few houses away. Sandy would run into the yard, yelping and howling while waiting for Donna to get home.\nThis day was different though. Sandy saw a cat across the street and started running after the cat just as Donna's neighbor was driving home. Sandy was hit and killed by the speeding car as Donna screamed in shock. \"No!\" yelled Donna, but it was too late. Sandy was gone. Donna was very sad. She blamed herself for Sandy's tragic death, but her mom told her that Sandy was happy in Heaven now. Donna held a little service for her doggie and buried her in the back yard so that Sandy would always be near her. Donna knew they would be together again."

He could do a lot of tricks on his skateboard, but what Brian really loved was jumping over stairs with his skateboard. His record was 15 stairs, but he wanted to beat that record. Brian and his friends went to the Hollywood 18, where a lot of skaters go to make skating videos.\nBrian knew that if he jumped over those stairs, he would become a legend with his friends. As he went up to the stairs, he started counting each stair one by one. He wanted to make sure they passed 15. On his first try, Brian jumped off his skateboard and landed on the grass next to the stairs. He wanted to try again, but he was scared. He finally got the nerve to try it again. This time he actually jumped over some stairs. Unfortunately, he didn't pass the 16th step in the staircase. He fell off his board, but he didn't get that hurt.

The time had arrived. Brian was ready to try it again. He pushed off the pavement, and started pedaling his skateboard faster and faster. He got to the top of the stairs and then he jumped. Brian was in the air for about 5 seconds and then he landed. The girls all applauded, and then Brian stopped his skateboard. He had done it. He beat his record.

Her face is nearly wrinkle-free, and it seems she has more energy than people half her age.\n\"Good morning, Helen.\" I said as I walked outside on my way to work. \"Hi Robert, how are you?\" she asked. \"Fine!I'm doing fine. Your yard is looking good,\" I said. And it was. Sometimes it really bothers me that I can't get my lawn to look as nice as hers. \"What's your secret, Helen?\" I asked. \"Secret to what?\" She answered. \"To having such a beautiful lawn! I water mine, I seed mine every year and I still can't get it to look as good as yours. I'm jealous!\" I said with a smile. Helen just nodded and had this funny little look on her face that suggested she was just better at keeping her lawn nice than I was.\nI didn't like that look, but I guess it's okay that she feels that way. I've known Helen since she was a little girl and things have not gone well with her lately. She's been alone for a long time. She wasn't very pretty when she was young. She had terrible acne that covered her face from ear to ear. It made her very self-conscious so she didn't go out on dates very much, but that all changed when she met Josh.

William was working as a manager for a very busy chemical distribution company at the time. In order to keep up with his work, he sometimes had to work at night, or go in on weekends to catch up with his paperwork.\nWilliam was a sensible man. He was not the type of person that would fly off the handle in troubling situations. He was always very calm, and composed. This is what made his story believable. I knew he wasn't the type to make things up.\nOne night, William went to work after dark and thought nothing of it. His former manager had told him that he might hear some weird noises coming from the warehouse, but it was only the 55-gallon drums expanding and contracting. During the heat of the day, the drums would expand, and at night, when it cooled off, the drums would contract, sometimes making a sound. William was not worried.\nThat night he was sitting at his desk when he heard what sounded like someone knocking on the door leading to the warehouse. William dismissed it as a drum \"popping,\" and ignored it. A few moments later, the sound was back, and this time it was louder. Since there was no one else in the building, he became a bit nervous, but continued working. Soon the noises got louder and louder. The final straw was when he heard someone walking above the ceiling of his office. This scared him quite a bit, but again he ignored it. Finally, it happened again, and this time William ran into the warehouse to look above his office, but no one was there. After that, William never worked at night again."

        "content": "Once you find an apartment you want to rent, you need to contact the landlord, the person who owns the property. Most landlords are not individuals anymore, but rather are companies that own a number of properties. You and the landlord will set a date to view the place you are interested in renting.\nOn that date you can see the apartment and ask questions. Some landlords will require you to fill out an application. The application will ask questions about your job, salary, and how many people are going to live with you in the apartment. The landlord wants to make sure they have responsible tenants who will pay rent on time. Some landlords will even ask for references, the names and telephone numbers of people who can verify that you have a job and are a responsible person. Most landlords will also run a credit check. A credit check is your history of paying bills on time. If your potential landlord sees that you owe a lot of money to different companies and don't pay your bills on time, they may not want you as a tenant. If you have bad credit or an unstable work history, you may be required to get a co-signer, that is another financially responsible adult to sign the lease, a rental contract, with you. This co-signer is legally responsible for paying the rent if you stop paying.\nIf you cannot afford a full apartment, another option is to rent a room in someone's home. The process to rent a room is like renting an apartment except you only have a room and usually have to share the bathroom and the kitchen. Most apartments and rooms in the U.S. are unfurnished. You are expected to bring your own furniture, including a bed, a dresser, a sofa, and anything else you need."

Temple starred in some of the greatest movies ever made during the film industry's infancy. Born on April 23, 1928 in Santa Monica, California, Temple was encouraged by her mother to develop her interest in singing, acting, and dancing. She enrolled young Shirley into a dance school at the age of 3. She also began styling Shirley's hair copying silent movie star Mary Pickford's wholesome, All-American, pigtail look.\nHer first acting experience came while she was still in the dancing school at a very young age. She appeared in a series of short films where child actors were used to play adults. The shorts, as they were called, were satirical in nature, and soon fell out of favor with the public. Temple gained valuable acting experience at a young age, though. A Fox Film songwriter was very taken by the young star, and he introduced her to studio executives. She was signed to do her first film in 1933 at the age of 5. The film Stand Up and Cheer was a big hit, and Temple's career was off.\nHer career is one of the most remarkable in Hollywood history. She made dozens of successful films as a child actress. She was very mature, and talented for someone so young, but by 1942, her films began to flop. Her career was seemingly over by her teen years, and announced her official retirement in 1950. This did not stop Temple though, as she began a second career as a public servant. She got involved with the Republican party, ran in a special election, in California, in 1967, but lost. She was then noticed by U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who offered her a diplomatic position, which she accepted.She served as ambassador to several countries during her political career under President Gerald Ford, and President George H.W.

The bridge spans the San Francisco Bay, and is part of a network of five main bridges that cross the bay in the San Francisco and Oakland area. The region with its bay has one of the most breathtaking views in the world, and part of which is the historic Golden Gate Bridge.\nIt is perhaps the most iconic and recognizable landmark in the entire United States. Construction on the bridge began in 1933, while the country was deeply mired in the Great Depression. Many people think the bridge was, in large part, responsible for the country's economic recovery because of the number of workers employed. The material used to build the bridge also contributed to the manufacturing, distribution, and transportation.\nThe bridge connects San Francisco to the San Francisco peninsula in Marin County through both California State Route 1, and U.S. Route 101. Before the bridge was built, the only way to get from one location to the other was to go around the bay, or to take a ferry across. Construction of the bridge was controversial at the time. Many thought the project was simply too complex, expensive, and dangerous to build. The construction plan approved concentrated on safety for the workers who would be involved in the construction, and it worked well until February 17, 1937. Remarkably, only one worker had died up to that date, but on that date, a scaffolding collapsed killing 10 men in the tragic accident.\nThe bridge was completed later that year, and has been in use ever since. It is one of California's great landmarks with people from all over the world drawn to see it."

Another great thing about Hide and Seek is that anyone could play, boys, girls, young, and old. Hide and Seek was great. All you needed was a little imagination and a sense of adventure.\nThe way the game is played is simple. I remember the first time I played. I came up to some of my brother's friends who were playing in the neighborhood. \"Hey, what are you guys playing?\" I asked. \"We are playing Hide and Seek,\" said Robert, my brother's best friend. \"Can I play?\" I asked, even though I didn't really know the rules. After a while, the boys let me play. The object of the game is to hide from one of the players. This person closes his eyes and counts to 10 out loud to start the game. While he or she is counting, the rest of the kids run to find a hiding place.\nHiding places can be anywhere. Behind cars, or in the bushes, just about anywhere! It was Robert's turn. When he had counted 10, he yelled, \"Ready or not, here I come!\" Whoever is the first person found becomes \"It\", and it's their turn to count. I thought I had the best hiding place ever. I was in the bushes near my house. I could see through the leaves everything Robert was doing, and I knew he was getting close to finding David, another one of my friends.\nI was overjoyed that I wasn't going to be the first one found. I had proven myself to everybody who said I was too young to play when all of a sudden, a mouse ran over my foot! I jumped and screamed out of the bushes, and was the first one found. The next thing I knew, I was counting out loud and trying to find my friends."

        "content": "Identity theft can be one of the most devastating financial crimes that a person can suffer. The crime happens when someone uses information about you for his or her financial gain without your permission. Whenever a person has their identity stolen, the criminal can break into their bank accounts, use their active credit cards to purchase goods and services, and acquire new credit cards. Once a person has his or her identity stolen, it can take years to recover from the theft. However, there are some steps you can take that will help protect your identity and your assets.\nOne of the most important things to do is to protect your Social Security Number (SSN). This number is what the government, employers, and financial institutions use to track your financial life. The SSN should be kept in a safe place, and the number should be used carefully. Do not give it out to anyone you don't trust. Other things to consider are your billing statements, credit reports, receipts, and bank statements. Look for unauthorized charges on your credit cards, and for new credit information on your credit reports. The sooner you detect any unusual financial activity, the easier it will be to repair the damage.\nIdentity theft can affect more than your credit scores or bank accounts though. Some of the less apparent effects can be losing employment opportunities since many employers use credit information as a screening tool for new hires. With your identity information, people can compromise your income tax returns. It also can prevent victims from opening new credit accounts, or making a major purchase. The identity theft issues must be cleaned up in order to move forward with any large purchases and get the best interest rates. So take care of your financial identity, and you can reduce your chances of becoming an identity theft victim."

According to the legend, St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland. St. Patrick's Day has also become, especially in the United States, a day to celebrate Irish culture. In major cities across the country like in New York and Boston, there are parades and festivals. People wear green and decorate with shamrocks, a type of three-leaf clover. Some people wear buttons or tee shirts that say \"Kiss me, I'm Irish\". In the U.S. St. Patrick's Day is not a legal holiday, meaning government offices and schools are open.\nThe biggest and oldest parade takes place in New York City. It actually began about 250 years ago before the U.S. was even its own country. Every year thousands gather along to watch hundreds of Irish step dancers and bagpipe players march. Irish step dancing is done in groups or solo. Dancers perform complicated moves with their feet and legs while keeping their upper bodies stiff. The parade has also been a source of controversy because the parade is associated with the Catholic Church in New York City; gay and lesbian organizations have not been allowed to march. Many people protest the parade or boycott it.\nSt. Patrick's Day has also become associated with the drinking of a lot of alcohol, specifically beer. One drink that is often seen around the holiday is \"Green Beer\". This is really  just regular beer with green food coloring. Many people feel like the holiday celebrates stereotypes about the Irish, like the myth that they all like to drink and get drunk. Others complain that the holiday has become too focused on drinking, with public drunkenness as a problem in major cities around the holiday."

        "content": "These days many people attend community colleges with plans to transfer to a four-year college or university to get a bachelor's degree. It's kind of like a stepping-stone. There are many reasons why people do this. One reason is that some community colleges have transfer agreements with private and state colleges and universities that guarantee admission. Even if a community college doesn't have that agreement of a guaranteed spot in a four-year college, it has articulation agreements with four-year schools. These agreements tell you exactly what classes a student in a community college needs to take in order to be able to transfer. These agreements make sure that students don't waste time taking classes that won't transfer. Most of these classes one needs to take before transferring are general education classes, like math and English.\nAnother reason why many students start their undergraduate degree at a community college is a financial one. A four-year college or university is much more expensive than a two-year college. This is especially true for immigrant students, who don't qualify for financial aid, loans or scholarships. Also community colleges tend to offer more evening classes so they can accommodate people who have to work while attending school. They are also a good option for older students with families, who need a more flexible schedule while taking care of children. Community colleges also tend to be commuter schools, meaning people don't have to live on campus in dorms. Attending a community college means you can still live at home with your parents, which can save the family a huge amount of money.\nIf a student didn't do well in high school, a community college would provide him or her with another opportunity to enter a four-year university. Community colleges offer many classes to help students develop their math and writing skills. When you attend a four-year college, you are expected to have those skills already. Community college will prepare students to successfully graduate from a four-year school."

        "content": "There is perhaps no greater mystery in the annals of American history as that of the Amelia Earhart story. Earhart's story is one of controversy, and intriguing. She was an accomplished aviator, the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo. She accomplished this during a time when women were not highly regarded in the United States. American women during the 1930s did not have the same advantages men had. There were few employment opportunities. Educated women were a scarcity. Women who did find employment during this era were working as grade-school teachers, nannies, and maids for the most part. Amelia Earhart did a lot to change that perception.\nAlthough Earhart was born into a family that did see financial success, but that success was fleeting. There were times in her life when her family struggled to make ends meet because of poor money management. Earhart was home schooled for most of her life, and she gained her pilots license at an early age. In December of 1920, Earhart's father took Amelia to an airshow in Long Beach, California. This is where she first became interested in flying. After earning her aviator's license, she accomplished a feat that only a few men had ever done: flying solo across the Atlantic. She earned national fame for this and was soon a household name.\nTragically, Earhart was lost in an attempt to fly around the world in 1937. She was never found. The theories about how she met her end are countless. Many think she fell victim to the Japanese prior to the start of World War II. This thinking was rooted in the idea that Earhart was a spy. Other outlandish theories include alien kidnapping, but most likely she had mechanical difficulties flying over the Pacific Ocean. Earhart was either killed instantly, or survived, according to one popular theory, and lived out her days on a deserted island."

It is no surprise that Bobby weighs two hundred and fifty pounds. It might be surprising to know that Bobby is only fifteen years old. Bobby didn't care that he was big. He was content with how he looked and loved eating as much as he could.\nBobby liked to tell jokes to his friends. \"Knock, knock,\" Bobby would say. \"Who's there?\" friends would ask. \"Gorilla,\" Bobby replied. \"Gorilla who?\" they'd ask back. \"Gorilla me a hamburger!\" Bobby replied, delivering the punch line. The joke was in how the word gorilla sounded like grill. Bobby's joke always left people in stitches.\nEven though Bobby was popular and friendly, he was still teased by some kids in school. Fat boy Bobby was the nick name the mean kids gave to Bobby. Whenever Bobby heard the nick name, he would reply with gusto, \"sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.\" The bullies would funnily reply, \"I bet you would eat those sticks and stones, fat boy Bobby!\" and scurry off running.\nBobby did not let idiotic name calling bother him. He had more important things to think about, like what he was going to eat for dinner. Bobby knew that one day he would have to lose weight if he wished to live a longer life. Until that day came, Bobby would continue eating what he wanted and as much he wanted."

The previous owner had maintained it for years and had spent a lot of money restoring it to its original condition. The car was a BMW, made in the year 1984. It was black and had only two doors. The interior was also black and had leather seating. The vehicle looked practically new to Joel, despite it being older than the new owner of it.\nJoel was eager to start driving his new car. At 21, Joel had felt the need to be driving already. He was attending college in the city of Los Angeles, working at a bookstore in the city of Montebello, and living in the city of Bell. Having a car would make traveling much more convenient. Joel had been getting around by means of public transportation. He was ready to stop taking the bus to school and work.\nThe first thing Joel had to do was to go to DMV to register the car under his name. After that, he took a driving manual book from DMV to study for the written test. Passing the written test was the only way to get a driving permit.  Joel studied for a few days, and passed his test. With the permit in hand, Joel next had to find someone to teach him how to drive.\nJoel already knew who to ask for driving lessons. \"If I'm going to teach you how to drive, you're going to have to commit 100 percent. Do you understand?\" Joel's uncle asked him. \"Yes, sir,\" responded Joel. After a month full of trial and error, Joel finally learned how to drive his car. Although it was scary at first, driving eventually became easy enough for Joel."

Sarah Lee Parker was his classmate, but he rarely talked to her. Donald liked Sarah a lot. He knew he was going to miss her.\nThe first day of summer had arrived. Donald woke up around noon. He hated waking up early for school, so he wanted to sleep late for the first day of summer. As soon as he woke up, he put on his swimming shorts, got a towel, kissed his mom goodbye, and ran to the park to go to the pool. As Donald jumped into the pool, his heart began to beat fast. The water was clear, but cold.\nOne of Donald's favorite things to do at the pool was to go on the diving board. As Donald stood on the edge of the diving board, he started jumping in order to get high enough to do a flip. He jumped once, and then twice. When he was about to jump off again, he saw that Sarah was looking at him from the entrance of the pool. Donald got so nervous that he couldn't finish the flip, and he landed on his back. Everyone in the deep end of the pool started laughing. Donald felt embarrassed as he swam to the edge of the pool, but when he got there he saw Sarah waiting for him. \"Ouch, that had to hurt. You want to go swimming with me?\" Sarah asked Donald. Donald said sure nervously, and started swimming with Sarah. Donald had never been happier, and never been in that much pain."

He starred in films such as Splash, Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Apollo 13, Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, and Big.\nBorn in Concord, California in 1956, Hanks began his career in television in the popular TV show Bosom Buddies, where he plays a man living in a women's dormitory. In order to live among the women, he and his roommate must dress in women's clothing during the evening hours after arriving from work. This series ran for three years and made Hanks a legitimate star.\nHanks reached film stardom in Splash, which was a very popular love story involving Hanks as a frustrated bachelor, and a mermaid. The movie launched his film career that featured Hanks in mostly comedic roles. Hanks would probably always be known as a comedic actor if he did not star in his share of dramatic roles. He played a former baseball star in A League of their Own, and a romantic lead in the popular Sleepless in Seattle. In 1993, Hanks won an Academy Award for his portrayal as a displaced worker who gets fired from his job because he contracts AIDS in the film Philadelphia. He lost 35 lbs. for his role as the gay lawyer because he wanted to look sickly. Hanks followed his Oscar-winning performance in Philadelphia with a second Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Forrest Gump. He became only the second actor to win the award in consecutive years.\nTom Hanks has used his celebrity status to address several causes such as same-sex marriage, environmental issues, and the development of alternative fuels."

        "content": "During the 1970s, one of the biggest movements occurring in the United States was the fight for equal rights. Many members of American society felt disenfranchised and discriminated against, especially in the workplace. Some American workers enjoyed a living wage complete with benefits and other advantages, while others struggled to earn enough to survive. One of the most oppressed groups of workers during this time period was California farm workers.\nThe farm workers were migrant workers who came into the country mostly without documentation to work in the fertile fields of California's Great Central Valley. This region in central California has often been described as the country's fruit basket because of its rich soil and high yields. Farm workers tended these fields during the day, and lived and slept on the farm at night. They earned less than the state's minimum wage, and had no fringe benefits other American workers enjoyed. Cesar Chavez changed all that.\nCesar Chavez, the Arizona-born civil-rights activist and labor leader, became the voice of these workers, and began a movement to bring basic rights to this group. Taking the lead from the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Chavez began a series of non-violent demonstrations protesting the deplorable conditions farm workers had to endure. Many of these workers worked much longer than eight hours a day, and received no overtime pay. Chavez, who was a farm worker himself in the 50s, led marches, and called for boycotts. These activities were very effective in changing the working conditions for farm workers and other oppressed workers.\nChavez was highly recognized during his lifetime, and his legacy increased after his death in 1993. He has reached iconic status among the Mexican-American community."

        "content": "Buying a home is a big life decision. There are many ways to go about finding a new home. One of the best ways to do this is to find a realtor. Realtors are professional people whose job is to find the right home for the right person. There are many variables involved in choosing where to live, and finding the right realtor can be just as challenging.\nThe first thing to know is that realtors want to sell you a home. Most realtors work on a commission basis, which means they get paid a percentage of what the home costs. The amount of pay varies at different real estate companies. The best realtors want to keep their clients happy by getting them into a home they want, and can afford. There are many reputable real estate companies operating in the United States. Some companies have offices in most of the major cities of the country.\nSome of the things to look for in a realtor are how many homes he or she has sold. It is okay to ask for this information. The realtor must be knowledgeable about homes and the areas you are looking to buy in. Look to see if the realtor is busy, and if his office is listed online. Once you find the right realtor, your house will be next. Be sure to give the realtor all the information he or she asks for. Buyers usually know how much house they can buy. The California market for homes is very competitive, so homes are expensive here. It is good to know how much you can afford to pay per month before you go looking for a home. The area you buy your home can influence pricing to a great degree. The same home in one area could cost significantly more than in other neighborhoods, so shop carefully."

It is a term that describes the behavior people exhibit in public versus in private social situations. It is a relatively new term that has drawn both criticism and praise from many Americans. Being politically correct is achieved by speaking about something or someone in public without being disrespectful. This applies even if you are speaking on a topic that you disagree with. It is very closely related to politeness, but has more meaning than simply being polite.\nIn the past, it was considered acceptable to speak your mind when discussing politics or religion, for example. This type of candor sometimes created a conflict between the speaker and those listening who may disagree with him or her. An example of this may be if someone is speaking about the current President in an offensive manner in public. There are those who support the President and may not share the speaker's point of view. On the other side of the argument, it could be you who is in a group of people expressing views about the President that you may not agree on. Is it better to confront the speaker or to simply remove yourself from the situation? Being around people who do not practice political correctness can be uncomfortable.\nThe best way to go about your day is to speak of controversial subjects privately with friends or family. Some political and religious feelings are deeply rooted in some people who may not feel comfortable about a person speaking against his or her beliefs. This can lead to confrontation, and even conflict. The best way to proceed is to be careful of the topics you engage in conversations on when you are out in public."

He graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and majored in psychology. After serving two years in the United States Military, he began working as a copy editor at Esquire magazine in the early 50s. Hefner quit his job to go out on his own. He was determined to start a magazine that was similar to Esquire, a men's magazine. His first \"Playboy\" was published from his home in 1953, without a publication date. He did this because he was uncertain if there would be a second edition.\nHefner had purchased a nude picture of the famous actress, Marilyn Monroe, and used that image as the centerfold of his first issue. The 50,000 copies sold quickly, and Hefner became an instant success story. During the 60s, Hefner and Playboy were at the top of their popularity. His circulation was now in the millions, and Hefner ventured into new areas for his company. He produced films, started modeling agencies, built hotels and resorts, and hosted two television series. His publication was not without controversy, though.\nIn 1963, he was arrested and stood trial for publishing a photo of American actress, Jayne Mansfield. The charges were eventually dropped, but it was clear that there would be challenges to his publication because of its content. Hefner permanently moved his headquarters to Los Angeles in 1975 so that he could be closer to the film industry. He has been married three times, and has four children."

It is perhaps the most recognizable name in the history of the country even as his death occurred approximately 150 years ago. Lincoln presided over the country during, what is perhaps, the most divisive era in its history. Lincoln served as president for only four short years, but his impact on the country at the time, and today, has been huge.\nDuring his presidency, the United States was in the middle of a terrible civil war. At the center of the split between the two sides was slavery. The north was a fast-growing, industrial region that was more progressive than their southern counterpart. The southern economy was based on cotton production that mostly used forced labor. The north viewed this practice as unethical, and immoral, while southerners claimed it was an integral part of their culture. When Lincoln won the election, the southern states began to secede from the Union, and the war began.\nLincoln vowed to end slavery during his campaign for president, while never speaking about how the country would keep its relationship with the southern states when slavery was ended. This angered many southerners who promised to rebel if Lincoln won. The war lasted four years, and about 620,000 soldiers died. In what is considered the turning point of the war, Lincoln issued his famous Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. What it did was gain international favor from the world because of its ethical qualities. It put pressure on those countries doing business with the south to review their practices. It effectively put an end to the war. Lincoln was assassinated on April 15, 1865 by a southern sympathizer as he sat in a theater with his wife."

Since then, Schwarzenegger has had multiple careers as an actor, politician, and philanthropist.\nSchwarzenegger began weight training at the age of 15. By the time he was 20 years old, he had won the prestigious Mr. Universe title. The professional body-building honor is awarded annually, but this was not his only body-building title on his resume. He won seven Mr. Olympia titles during his body-building career. Additionally, he wrote several books on the subject. His body-building career spanned from 1965 to 1980.\nHis film career began in 1970 when he starred in a little-known movie called Hercules in New York. However, from these beginnings, Schwarzenegger cultivated a long, and successful career as an action movie star in Hollywood. His movies are some of the most popular films to ever show in the U.S. His most recognizable role was arguably as the Terminator in the film series of the same name. Following a long and successful film career, Schwarzenegger, who was always interested in politics, began a political career that culminated with his election to two terms as California's Governor.\nSchwarzenegger was first elected governor in October, 2003, running on a Republican Party platform. He enjoyed moderate success as governor in his first years, but struggled greatly after that. He had many political opponents who cited that he had no political experience, and had won the elections simply because of his popularity.

Sometimes superstores are also called big box stores. Many times they are chain stores owned by one company.\nThe flyers all had different messages about the superstore opening. One set of flyers invited him and others to apply for jobs at the store. The jobs paid well and even offered some benefits. Mark thought this was a good thing since he knew many people were looking for work. Another set of flyers included coupons to be used on opening day. The store had many bargains for common items like paper towels, but also for big screen televisions. Mark thought this too was a good thing. It seemed like a good idea to be able to get a variety of things in one place instead of going from one store to another. It would save time and money. Superstores could sell groceries and clothes under one roof.\nAnother set of flyers contradicted the positive messages about the superstore though. Some local residents were organizing a protest of the superstore. The flyers said that the superstore was bad for the community because it threatened the business of smaller stores in the area. Mark thought about Mr. Hernandez who owned a small grocery store down the block. That was where Mark bought staple food items like eggs and milk.

The Lakers are the best franchise in the NBA over the past 40 years, having won more championships than any other teams.\nDuring the 1980s, the Lakers were known as \"Showtime\" because of the team's high-paced, and high-scoring style of play. Much of this style can be attributed to the charismatic Johnson. His style developed at an early age when he was playing basketball in his home state of Michigan. He attended Michigan State University, and led its team to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title in 1979.\nHe was taken by the Lakers as their first pick in the college draft, and he never left. Johnson played for the Lakers from 1980 through 1991, and then played for a few games in 1996. During the 80s, he led the Lakers to eight championship appearances, and won five. No other team had dominated the game in a single decade since the Boston Celtics in the 60s. He also won an Olympic Gold Medal in basketball, and won the Most Valuable Player Awards multiple times, but his most endearing quality remained as one of the nicest and well-liked player in the game.\nToday Johnson still calls Los Angeles his home.

In the United States, Darwin has become the symbol for atheists in the country as his theory of evolution smacks in the face of creationism. His theory claims that all of earths species have descended from their ancestors, and that they have adapted to their surroundings throughout history. It also claims that every species has a common ancestor. Darwin introduced his theory in his landmark book On the Origin of Species in 1859.\nHis book was met with suspicion from both the scientific community and the general public, but by the 1870s, his work was beginning to gain mass acceptance. One of his most significant studies came when he sailed with the HMS Beagle, a British sea vessel, to the Galapagos Islands. The islands have been long isolated from the South American mainland, and provided him with a unique insight on the process of evolution.\nWhile sailing from island to island, Darwin noticed similarities between island species and mainland species. Most were similar in many ways, but some had subtle differences. He also found that the same species had differences from island to island. To Darwin it was clear that the reason for the slight differences was the individual environment of each island. These islands showed Darwin the evolution process in the making.\nDarwin has many critics from religious circles. A very famous caricature of Darwin depicting him as a half-human monkey was published in 1871 in response to his theory that humans evolved from ape-like creatures. He spawned a movement of non-believers called Darwinism, which includes people who feel his theories are rooted in the scientific method as opposed to religious dogma."

The meetings also offer parents the opportunity to ask questions and see what their child is learning.\nWhen it is almost time for parent-teacher conferences, the school will send parents a note and usually give them an appointment time. There are appointments during the day and in the evening. Evening appointments are used for parents who work during the day. Parent-teacher conferences do not last very long. Normally they do not last longer than 10 minutes. This is why it is important for parents to make sure they arrive at their appointments on time and come prepared with questions. If a parent needs more than 10 minutes, he or she should try to schedule another meeting with the teacher. Keeping a teacher for more than 10 minutes when there are parents waiting is disrespectful.\nMost children do not go along with their parents to the meetings. This allows both the parent and teacher to talk honestly about the child's progress without making the child feel bad. Usually a teacher will offer advice to the parent on how to support their child's education."

Thousands of people immigrate to the United States every year from different parts of the world to have access to these kinds of opportunities. This is what is known as \"the American dream\". One of the many reasons America is such a great country is the diversity you see all around. America is one big melting pot of citizens  from different backgrounds.\nAmerica is also home to many of the world's top colleges and universities. The California Institute of Technology is a top world-ranked college that focuses highly on science and engineering. It is located in the city of Pasadena. Harvard University is another top world-ranked college that you might be familiar with. The buildings at Harvard date all the way back to the year 1636, making Harvard the oldest university in the United States. It is located in the state of Massachusetts. University of California, Los Angeles, is another institute worthy of recognition. Located next to Hollywood, UCLA has distinguished itself as a prestigious and selective university due to the number of people who apply for admission throughout the United States. The universities mentioned are but a few of the many other excellent schools that make the United States so outstanding.\nAmerica is also known for being at the forefront of freedom and equality. Although our history may be contradictory to these ideals, we have progressed and now live in a land of equal opportunity. Whether you wish to become a doctor, a lawyer, or a librarian, America is the best place to be at to achieve these dreams."

        "content": "If you want to rent an apartment, you need to sign a lease, which is a legally binding contract between you and the landlord, the person who owns the property. A lease is usually good for a set time. Some leases are on a month-to-month basis, but most are for a period of one year or two years.\nThe lease or rental agreement lists out your responsibilities as a tenant and the landlord's responsibilities. The lease  will tell you how much the monthly rent is, when it is due, and how you can pay it. Some landlords will only take a certified check or money order, and others will accept a personal check or cash. If you pay your rent late, there is usually a late fee. The amount of the late fee is also usually in the lease. The lease will also tell you how much the security deposit is. Usually it is the amount of one month's rent. The lease will tell you if you can have pets or not. Many places do not allow pets. If you bring one in anyway, they can fine you or kick you out. If your apartment does allow pets, most likely you will have to pay an extra amount of money, called a pet deposit, to cover any damages caused by the animal. Other rules that may be included in a lease include whether you are allowed to smoke inside the property and whether you are allowed to make any changes like paint. Many landlords do not allow you to paint or even make holes in the wall to hang up pictures.\nA lease is proof that you legally live somewhere. Sometimes you need a lease to show a school that you live within a certain area. Make sure you get a copy of the signed lease from your landlord."

Many people in the U.S. are really dependent on their cars to get to work and school. In fact most American workers spend an hour driving to work each day. In order to drive in the U.S., you have to go to your local Department of Motor Vehicles first, and take a written test to get your learner's permit. If you pass this test, you can practice driving so you can pass a road test and get your license. The Department of Motor Vehicles or DMV has free booklets you can go and get to study for your learner's permit. You can also access the information online and even take a practice written exam. To prepare for the road test, you can have a friend teach you to drive or pay to take classes at a driving school. You cannot, however, practice driving by yourself. If you are caught driving with only a learner's permit, you can get into trouble with the law.\nOnce you get your driver's license in one state, you can use it to drive in all of the United States. Wherever you drive, you will see signs posted along the road indicating the speed limit. These numbers are not a suggestion. Generally you can drive faster on a highway than on local streets. Local police use special equipment to detect your speed. If they detect you are speeding or driving over the speed limit, police can stop you and give you a ticket. You will have to pay a fine, and some of the fines are more than $100. The lines painted on the road are not just to keep cars in their lanes.  They send a message. For example, a double solid yellow line means that it is against the law to pass another car here."

He is a historic figure primarily because he is the first African American to hold the position of president. His policies have gained him many supporters, as well as many detractors. He is one of the greatest presidents to govern the country in the history of the United States. Obama is a representative of the Democratic Party with his presidency coming after the controversial George W. Bush left office.\nOne of the defining aspects of his presidency is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly and inaccurately called Obamacare. This act, passed into law by the U.S. Congress and signed by the president in March 2010, became effective on January 1, 2014. It is the single, most significant change in government healthcare since Medicare was implemented in 1965. This act was intended to increase the affordability of care for Americans, expand insurance coverage, and lower the uninsured rate in the country. It is a controversial act that has many detractors, but most Americans now carry health insurance, which was not true before 2014.\nObama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1961. He is a graduate of both Columbia University in New York City, and Harvard Law School. Before becoming president, he served as senator for the state of Illinois. He is considered a liberal by many southern conservatives, but this may be an unfair label. The perception is largely due to the Affordable Care Act, and his attempts at immigration reform. Additionally, Obama ended the U.S. involvement in the Iraq war. He also ordered the military operation that eventually resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden. Obama was reelected as president in November, 2012."

Most Americans get both Christmas Day and Christmas Eve off from their jobs so that they can spend time with their families. Many people are busy buying gifts for their loved ones in preparation for the big day. Christmas day is the time when families open presents that they have given each other. The presents are wrapped in beautiful paper, and usually include a colorful bow and a tag with a person's name on it. These presents are placed under a tree that is brought into their home and decorated with bright ornaments by the entire family.\nWhen Michelle was a little girl, she loved helping her mom and dad decorate the Christmas tree. It all began by going to a Christmas tree lot, where vendors sold freshly cut trees to the public. Families can walk through the lots to pick the tree that is right for them. Michelle loved going to shop for a tree because of the sweet aroma that would come from the trees. \"I like this one, daddy,\" Michelle said. \"It's perfect,\" her dad agreed and bought the tree. It was just the right size, with full, green branches.\nOnce the tree was brought home, Michelle helped her mother place the tree in the right spot, and began decorating it. Her brothers and sister would help, too. This was always a great family tradition. They put a string of flickering lights around the tree, along with pretty ornaments of different kinds. Each family member got to place their own special ornament on the tree right where they wanted to. The colors blue, red, yellow, and red would blink on and off and would shine brightly, reflecting off the ornaments. As the family stood and viewed the decorated tree, all were smiling. Michelle turned to her father and said, \"Thank you, daddy.\""

In 2011, Anthony topped the list of most hated Americans, and today she is still in the top five of that same list. This all stems from the results of a 2011 murder trial, where Anthony was acquitted of killing her two-year-old daughter. As in the O.J. Simpson trial, public opinion was highly in want of a guilty charge. All evidence seemed to point to Anthony as the guilty person. To this day, Americans still feel the justice system did not work in this case.\nAnthony's daughter Caylee was born on August 9, 2005, but the day of her death remains unknown. It is simply listed as 2008. The reason for this is because the exact time and date of her death was never determined. Caylee Anthony was last seen alive on June 16, 2008, but it wasn't until July 15 that her grandmother reported her missing. A total of 30 days passed from the time Casey Anthony reported leaving her daughter at a babysitter's house to the time Caylee was reported missing. During that time period, Casey was seen enjoying the nightlife in Southern Florida. Many photos exist of her partying away while her daughter was missing. The public perceived this behavior as unnatural for a caring, loving mother.\nWhen Casey was asked of her daughter's whereabouts, the lies began. Casey said she had left her daughter at a babysitter's house, which was not true. She also lied several times to the police about where her daughter was. However, a forensic scientist concluded that a smell coming from Casey's trunk was decomposing flesh. Casey was convicted of lying to the police, and other charges, but she was acquitted in the murder trial despite the evidence against her. Today she is free, but lives in hiding for fear of retaliation."

        "content": "Halloween is on October 31. It is also called All Hallows' Eve or All Saints' Eve. This is because, according to some, the holiday has its roots in a Christian holiday that remembers the dead. Others say the holiday has its roots in the ancient harvest season traditions of Ireland. In the U.S. though, the focus is less on memories of the dearly departed or agriculture. It is about kids dressing up in scary costumes and going door-to-door asking for candy. This is called trick-or-treating.\nWhen children knock on the door of a house or ring the doorbell, they usually say \"Trick or Treat\". The \"trick\" part is a fake threat signaling that the kids will commit a prank if they aren't given something delicious. Homeowners then give the children candy, raisins, or some other food treat. Many homeowners decorate their houses to prepare for the holiday and let kids know that they are participating and can ring the bell for candy. Traditional decorations often include jack-o'-lanterns, which are pumpkins with faces carved into them and candles inside. Jack-o' lanterns were thought to scare away evil spirits when Halloween was first celebrated among the ancient Christians. Also turnips, not pumpkins, were originally used. People often decorate using the colors black and orange.\nHalloween is not just for kids;  adults get in on the fun by attending costume parties. There are often contests for who has the best costume. There are also games bobbing for apples, where people have to get an apple using only their teeth from a large bucket of water. Other people celebrate by scaring themselves by going to haunted houses, homes where people dressed up as ghosts, zombies, and werewolves and jump out to frighten guests. People also tell scary stories or watch horror movies."

Born on June 27, 1880 in Tuscumbia, a small town in Alabama, Keller was stricken with a childhood disease that left her deaf, and blind. The illness Keller suffered is a mystery to this day. She was diagnosed with \"Brain Fever,\" by her family doctor, but most people speculated that she suffered from either Scarlet Fever, or Meningitis. Unable to see, or hear, Keller became difficult to deal with as her behavior was described by her family and friends as wild.\nSoon Keller and her family developed their own type of sign language that allowed them to communicate on a limited basis. Helen's mother sought help for her anguished child, which eventually led to Anne Sullivan, who was a recent graduate of the Perkins Institute for the Blind. The school had been successful in the past in educating blind students, and Sullivan was one of its star graduates. Once Sullivan and Keller got through the difficult beginnings, their friendship, and association lasted for 49 years.\nKeller was determined to become educated, and to teach herself to communicate. After attending several schools, she became the first deaf and blind person to earn a college degree. She became very well-known, and began a lecture tour where she addressed social and political issues, including women's suffrage, and birth control.\nIn 1920, she helped found the American Civil Liberties Union, which is still active today. She addressed Congress to raise awareness to the plight of the blind. Through all her accomplishments, she fell into disfavor with the American public because of her socialist views later in her life. She died in her sleep just days before his 88th birthday, but she lives in the American consciousness for her tireless work, and perseverance."

It was advertised as a cozy one-bedroom apartment with a view. She made an appointment to view the apartment. When the landlord opened the door, Julie was sorely disappointed. The cozy bedroom barely fit a twin mattress and a nightstand. The window actually offered a view of a brick wall.\nJulie didn't give up hope though. The next apartment she saw was advertised as having a renovated kitchen. Since Julie loved to cook, she imagined herself cooking gourmet meals on shiny new kitchen appliances. However, the broker showing Julie around explained that the only renovations were new knobs on old wooden cabinets. Julie was beginning to lose hope. She then saw a listing for a basement apartment with access to a low maintenance yard. Julie imagined herself hosting barbecues for her friends until she saw that the low maintenance yard was a tiny slab on concrete.\nJulie decided to stop looking for apartments that had features she liked. Instead she was going to look for an apartment close to her job. She read a listing for a studio that was close to a freeway. This meant a shorter commute. When she saw the place, she found that the studio actually overlooked the freeway, and traffic could be heard from the bedroom.\nJulie was discouraged. She decided not to move out yet."

This may be why he is so popular. Love him, or hate him, Limbaugh does not pull punches with his commentary. His favorite subjects to attack are liberals, and what he perceives as liberal bias in mainstream media.\nLimbaugh was born on January 12, 1951 in Cape Girardeau, Missouri to a family of professionals. His grandfather, father, and brother were all attorneys, and his uncle served as a federal judge in his home state of Missouri. Limbaugh began broadcasting at an early age. He was an average student, and attended college for less than one full year. His mother had aspired for Rush to get a college degree, but that was not to be. She once said of her son, \"He flunked everything,\" and \"he didn't seem interested in anything but radio.\"\nLimbaugh made the right decision. Today, he is one of the highest paid journalists in the field. His road to fortune was not an easy one, though. He used to bounce from job to job mainly at small radio stations as a music disc jockey. His first major break came in 1984 when he was a radio talk show host in Sacramento, California. It was here that President Ronald Reagan was successful in his repeal of the Fairness Doctrine. This doctrine required media outlets to give air-time to opposing viewpoints whenever the station made a controversial claim.\nWith this doctrine out of the way, Limbaugh was free to say whatever he wanted to, and not have to give equal time to anyone. He took full advantage of this ruling. His audience consists of a large segment of American society, especially the right-wing, conservative, Christian coalition."

German automaker, Karl Benz, is credited with inventing the first motor vehicle in the late 1880s, but Ford was the man who made it possible for everyday citizens to own one. Before Ford came up with his assembly line process, cars were built one at a time by hand, which was a very costly and inefficient method of production. Ford's assembly line revolutionized the way cars were built, and his methods are still in use today.\nIn 1886, Benz patented his Motorwagen, which was a four-wheel, two-passenger, self-powered motor coach that was designed to replace the horse and carriage. These vehicles were expertly crafted, but were available to only the wealthiest people of the time. Thanks to Ford, that all changed in 1906. His Ford Motor Company, the first automobile company to use assembly line techniques to build cars. transformed the automobile from an expensive curiosity to a practical tool that could be used to transport people and goods easily and efficiently. His first mass-produced product was the Model T. It remains one of the most sold vehicles ever, and was the first to reach 15 million sales.\nFord's impact on the 20th Century cannot be overstated. At one time it was estimated that nine out of 10 vehicles on American roads were Fords. His cars spurred the American economy like no other single factor. The country's roadways were built in response to the great number of vehicles Ford and subsequent American automakers produced. Additionally, Ford's vehicles created a network of support industries such as parts, repair, and maintenance services. It also caused a revolution in how goods were transported in the country. Henry Ford was a true American icon."

Some of the mail advertised on the envelope that she might already be a winner. His mother was also getting many more magazines. Some of the magazines were about things his mother didn't eve care about, like cats.\n\"Mom, why are you getting so many magazines?\" Tom asked her. She told him that she had been entering contests and that part of the process included subscribing to magazines. \"It will increase my chances of winning the jackpot,\" she told him. Soon the family mailbox was filled with more contests announcements, magazines, and bills.\nTom's mother was surprised. She didn't think that checking off the boxes of magazines that looked interesting and affixing stickers to the return forms would cost her. She was spending more and more money and hadn't won anything. She wanted to be like the people in the commercials she saw on television. People bringing balloons and oversized checks surprised those people who entered the contests. Tom read the fine print. The magazines weren't free and Tom's mother was not increasing her chances of winning anything by subscribing. Tom did some research and found out there had even been lawsuits against the companies running the contests and selling the magazine subscriptions.\nTom's mother felt bad. \"It pays to win, mom, but you can't pay to win,\" Tom told her. Tom's mother wondered what she was going to do with all these magazines."

When Jeff was 11 and Carol was 13, Ruth decided to take her kids to Disneyland, which would be the first time any of them ever went. When they arrived at Disneyland, Ruth explained to her children that if they got split up, they would meet at the front of the park.\nThe first thing Ruth did when they got inside was looking for Mickey Mouse. She wanted to take pictures with all the characters at Disneyland. She even made a list of the characters she wanted to take pictures with. Her children looked at her and smiled. They saw that their mom was acting like a little girl again. She was giggling every time she took a picture with a character.\nHer favorite Disney character was Donald Duck, so she kept an eye open for him. When they were in line for a ride, she saw that Donald was taking pictures with people by a restaurant. She told her children: \"Look, guys, it's Donald! Hopefully, he is still there when we get out.\" When they got out of the ride, Donald wasn't there anymore. Ruth told her children that it was okay, and that they would bump into him later on.\nThey enjoyed their day at Disneyland until it was time for the park to close. Ruth and her children were looking at the fireworks that they put on every night at Disneyland. She hugged her children and told them she loved them. They hugged her back and continued to watch the show. When they were leaving the park, her children noticed that Donald was taking photos with some other people, and their mom hadn't noticed him yet. Carol told her mom that she needed to go to the restroom, and asked her mom to wait for her for a moment. While she was waiting for Carol to come back from the restroom, Ruth felt someone poke her on her shoulder. It was Donald Duck with Carol! Ruth began tearing up a bit, and hugged both of them. They all took photos with Donald Duck, the last character on Ruth's list."

Most people in the U.S. identify as being Christian, but only half of those people attend church on a regular basis. The second most popular religion is Judaism. The third most common religion in the U.S. is Islam. Other religions practiced in the U.S include Hinduism, and Buddhism. About 20 percent of all people in the U.S. say they don't practice any religion. One of the founding principles of the United States is religious freedom, which means people can practice whatever religion they want without being discriminated against. This is even guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. This is one reason why the United States has no official religion.\nBecause there are so many different religions in the United States, there are many different types of houses of worship. Christians attend churches. Jews and Hindus attend temples. Muslims attend mosques. Many people use what they wear to reflect their religious beliefs. For example, some Islamic women wear a scarf called \"hijab\" to cover their head. It is disrespectful to ask a Muslim woman to take off her hijab or ask for her to show you what is under it. Male followers of an Indian religion called \"Sikhism\" usually wear cotton turbans. Again it is wrong to take a person's turban off or ask that they take it off. Male followers of Hasidism, a branch of Judaism, have long curls on the side of their heads. They wear a fringed prayer shawl. Other Jewish men may wear a small cap on their heads called a yarmulke. This is supposed to be a constant reminder that God is above them."

He is a political activist, and a social critic. His films have a way of eliciting strong emotional responses.\nMoore was born in Flint, Michigan in 1954. His father was an assembly-line worker at the General Motors, an automobile-manufacturing plant; his mother was a secretary. He attended the University of Michigan, Flint campus, where he dropped out after his first year. He found work as a journalist with a couple of different local publications, but was fired from one of his jobs because of a controversy. Moore wanted to run a story about American involvement in Nicaragua, but his editors refused, which led to his dismissal. He was awarded $58,000 in an out-of-court settlement after he sued his employers.\nMoore used the money to start making documentaries. His first was \"Roger & Me,\" which was a piece designed to expose GM's closure of the Flint plant and its decision to open a plant in Mexico, where wages were much lower. His film exposes the greed corporations like GM cutting off the lifeline of many American workers so that GM could make more profit. GM had reported record profits before the closure, which irritated Moore greatly.\nHe followed this film with a string of documentaries that touched on many of the social and political problems Americans face daily. His film \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" probes the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. He is not kind to the George W. Bush administration for their lack of response to the attacks, and to the Bush family's alleged ties to Osama Bin Laden, the mastermind of the attack."

That is probably why the house was so inexpensive. The previous owners of the house had it foreclosed. Then some house flippers bought the property for a very cheap price, renovated it, raised the sales price, and sold it. Bob thought the house was still a good bargain though.\nAfter he moved in, Bob began to see that many of the renovations to the home were merely cosmetic. While the house flippers put in new stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, they hadn't upgraded the electrical work. This meant that every time Bob ran the dishwasher and the coffee machine, all the power in the house went out. Bob spent over $1,000 dollars to have the house rewired. The new carpets that the house flippers installed was put over the original hardwood floors. Bob decided to rip out the ugly oatmeal colored carpets and refinish the old floors. That was another $3,000.\nThe house was an old stucco house that got very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. The house flippers installed some cheap windows. Bob hired a contractor to put in new double pane storm windows and install ceiling fans. That was another few thousand dollars. Bob wanted to make the house energy efficient, so he leased solar panels that were installed on the roof. This not only lowered his monthly electric bill, but added value to the home.\nWithin two years, all the changes Bob made to the house totaled more than $20,000. In that time the value of his home rose almost $100,000. Bob felt he made a good investment. He knew when he sold the home, he would get more money than he paid."

The Tonight Show was already a big success when Carson took over from the retiring Jack Paar, but Carson took the show to the next level. His style, and grace on camera has been mimicked by many late-night talk show hosts, who have credited Carson as their mentor.\nCarson was born thousands of miles away from the glitz of New York, and Los Angeles, in the city of Corning, Iowa, in 1925. Carson began his entertainment career at the age of 14 when he appeared at county fairs as a magician, which was his first love. His family moved to the state of Nebraska when Carson was a young man, and he served as a communications officer for the U.S. Navy during the tail end of World War II. His broadcast career began in 1950 in Omaha, Nebraska before moving to Los Angeles, and landing a job with a local television station.\nCarson officially became host of The Tonight Show on October 1, 1962. The show was based in New York City until 1972 when, at Carson's request, the show was permanently moved to the Los Angeles area. Carson hosted his show in Burbank for the next 21 years, where he perfected his style and approach to his guests. It was considered an honor to be invited to The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson.\nCarson was a true entertainer. He performed many skits during his reign, where he dressed up in costume, and played ridiculous characters, which is something today's late-night hosts do not do.

At some wedding receptions, the man who catches the garter has to place it on the leg of the woman who catches the bridal bouquet. Some people think this is too sexual, and just skip this part. It is the decision of the bride and groom.\nThe bride and groom often toast each other with champagne before the end of the reception. Sometimes a bride and groom will leave the reception before it is over. They go right to the airport to begin their honeymoon, a special vacation celebrating their new life together."

He was only four years old at the time, but he remembers watching Michael Phelps win six gold medals, and wanted to be just like him. Tommy's parents thought he was too young at the time, but decided the time was right to give him lessons.\nMany homes in the United States have swimming pools, but Tommy's did not. His parents lived in a condominium, which is like an apartment complex. So Tommy's parents took him to the local YMCA to enroll him into swimming classes. \"This place is big,\" said Tommy. Everyone is so big and strong. Tommy was just a kid, but he was determined to learn how to swim.\nWhen the family reached the pool, Tommy's jaw almost dropped to the floor. He was amazed at the size of the pool. He had never seen anything so large in his life. It was an Olympic-sized pool and there were many swimmers doing laps while others were just playing around, or diving off the three diving boards. Tommy got even more excited.\nOff to the left, there were a group of kids about Tommy's age, who were already in a swimming class. Some of the younger kids were crying, but that was okay with Tommy. He was not afraid though. He was determined to learn how to swim."

Rob shook his head.\nMike didn't want to stick anything up his son's nose to try and take out the mini toy brick out. He was scared he would push the Lego up higher and hurt his son. \"I guess we have to go to the hospital,\" Mike told his son. Rob looked scared. It was a short drive to the hospital emergency room. Mike felt like the most negligent dad in the world when he told the triage nurse the reason for the visit. \"My son has a Lego stuck up his left nostril,\" Mike said in a low voice."

Visitors can get tickets to see a show being taped and can also tour the studios.\nVisitors to Rockefeller Center can visit the plaza, which becomes an ice skating rink in the winter. Every year a huge Christmas tree is placed there and thousands of people attend the tree lighting ceremony, which always features famous singers. In the spring, summer, and fall, the plaza becomes a cafe. In the middle of the plaza is a statue of the Greek god Prometheus. His myth states that he brought fire to the world. 200 flags from all countries of the United Nations surround the plaza.\nRadio City Music Hall is another famous building in Rockefeller Center.

In the mid to late 60s, America's involvement became a huge issue. The conflict in Vietnam was divisive for many reasons, but mostly because of the public's perception that it was an immoral and illegal operation. The other major factor was that the U.S. was still engaged in drafting young men into the service of the country against their will.\nOne of Hollywood's major film stars of the time was Jane Fonda. Fonda came from Hollywood movie royalty, being the daughter of the great actor, Henry Fonda. She won two Oscars, seven Golden Globe awards, and an Emmy award through her long career. In the 60s she was a political activist who was against the war in Vietnam. She was very outspoken against the conflict, as many celebrities were at the time.\nIn 1970, Fonda made headlines for a very different reason. She and two fellow actors starred in an anti-war film that drew much controversy. In July of 1972, Fonda drew the wrath of many Americans when she was photographed sitting with North Vietnamese Army members on an anti-aircraft gun. That image soiled her reputation as an actress, and as a true American. Many called Fonda a traitor for interacting with the enemy. Years later, Fonda said that she was manipulated into taking that photo, but many Americans still have their doubts.\nDuring her trip to North Vietnam, which was at war with the U.S. backed South Vietnam, Fonda made a number of radio broadcasts denouncing America's involvement in the war. This further cemented her image as a traitor. However, there are many Americans who feel she was a true patriot because she refused to stand still and spoke out against the war."

It is estimated that Graham's sermons have reached a total of more than 2.2 billion people worldwide. He is credited with converting more than 3.2 million Americans to Christianity through his broadcasts.\nBorn on November 7, 1918, Graham grew up in a dairy farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. His parents were of Scottish descent, and were practicing Presbyterians. Graham's education included attending several colleges before settling on what is now Trinity College in Florida. It was there that Graham heard the calling of Jesus Christ, and began devoting his life to spreading the word of god.\nGraham served as spiritual advisor to several presidents, including, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon Johnson. He was a friend to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. whom he invited on more than one occasion to preach at his ministries. He once bailed King out of jail after the civil rights leader was jailed for participating in a peaceful demonstration.\nOne of Graham's most powerful tools was his crusades. He began staging evangelical events at arenas and auditoriums to spread the word of god. He was one of the first preachers to invite black clergymen to participate in his crusades. He was also a champion of integration. In one famous incident, Graham went into the audience to remove barriers that were set up to segregate blacks from whites. He told the organizers that they either remove the barriers, or they can stage their event without him. Graham was a man of high moral character."

After these special dances, the guests are invited to the dance floor.\nFood at a wedding reception can be buffet style, where everyone serves himself or herself, or it can be a sit-down meal served by waiters.

Yeager was already an accomplished fighter pilot in World War II, but his greatest achievement was after the war when he served as a test pilot for the United States Air Force. It was thought impossible to fly faster than sound during that period, and no one knew if a pilot could survive flying at that speed, or how it would affect him if he did survive. That did not deter Yeager, though.\nYeager was born on February 13, 1923 in Myra, West Virginia. He served during World War II as a fighter pilot. He did not start out as a pilot, though. Yeager enlisted as a private who worked as an aircraft mechanic in the old Army Air Forces, where Yeager enrolled into a special program that trained enlisted men to become pilots. Yeager benefited greatly from having superior eyesight. He was considered a natural pilot early in his flight career.\nAs a fighter pilot in the European Theater, Yeager was shot down in France by German fighter planes. He avoided capture, and helped a fellow pilot to safety after that pilot had lost his leg in the crash. Yeager was awarded a medal for his actions. He demonstrated exceptional talent as a pilot and once shot down five enemy fighters in a single day. After the war, Yeager began a new career as a test pilot, where he flew the experimental aircraft Bell X-1 into aviation history.\nOn October 14, 1947, Yeager flew his X-1 faster than the speed of sound. He became the first human being to fly faster than sound, and he went on to break more records during his 60-year flight history.

Lindbergh's plane The Spirit of St. Louis was believed by many to be simply too small to make the solo flight across the great Atlantic. Just carrying enough fuel for the flight was a challenge, and so was the trip itself.

Six well-known and trained aviators had lost their lives trying to make the flight before him, so his odds for success were not in his favor. On the morning of May 20, 1927, Lindbergh launched his small plane from Roosevelt Field in New York, and determined to reach Paris. The flight was an international event as Lindbergh's progress was reported by report stations throughout his flight. Lindbergh faced many dangers and challenges during his flight, including foul weather, and flying blind through thick fog. He also had to fight his fatigue during the nearly 54-hour flight.\nIt was all well worth the trouble when Lindbergh landed in Paris on Saturday night, May 21, 1927. More than 150,000 French citizens had gathered to join the celebration of his historic flight. Lindbergh had become an international superstar literally overnight.

There are some cities where sales and use of fireworks are still legal, and many Americans take full advantage of this.\nAnother Fourth of July tradition is the backyard barbeque. The holiday occurs in the middle of summer, and Americans love to grill outdoors to avoid the heat inside the house. Hamburgers and hot dogs are the food of choice, but steaks are also prepared often. There is nothing better than a great American meal and a cold drink celebrating the Fourth of July. It is a popular holiday, and it is one that has great meaning to most Americans."

        "content": "While many women are involved in planning their bridal showers, a baby shower usually comes as a complete surprise. A baby shower is a party where a pregnant woman is \"showered\" with gifts and good wishes. A baby shower is usually given by a close female friend or relative of the mother-to-be. Sometimes co-workers of a pregnant person will also throw a baby shower.\nThe baby shower is usually given when the mother-to-be is between 6 and 9 months pregnant. Sometimes though, because predicting the due date of a baby isn't always exact, a baby shower can happen after the baby is born. A baby shower can be held in someone's home or outside, like in a restaurant or catering hall. Traditionally only women are invited to a baby shower. However, more and more baby showers are also including the father-to-be. Like with a bridal shower, a mother-to-be will often register a wish list of things she wants at one or several stores. This list usually consists of things the mother wants for her baby including clothes, diapers and even furniture like high chairs and cribs. This way friends and family members can go to the store and buy something from the list. Registering helps make sure that there aren't repeat items, like 30 bottles when a new mom only needed 15.\nSome baby showers also feature a paper mache wishing well. This is not just for decoration. People can  put cards inside with wishes for the new baby and mom. Most of these cards also contain money or gift cards to help the mom-to-be buy whatever else she needs for the baby. Sometimes there are games at a baby shower. In one game everyone guesses the due date of the baby. Another game has people taste  baby food and guess the flavor"

While she understood this to mean that you can't get something for nothing, she heard other mothers at her child's school talking about the free lunch program.\n\"How much does it cost to enroll?\" Mary asked the secretary at her child's school. The secretary smiled and told Mary that it didn't cost anything except a little bit of time. In order to find out if Mary's child was qualified to get free lunch at school, she had to fill out a form. The form was available in many languages besides English. It asked Mary basic questions like where she lived, how many children she had, and what her annual income was.\nFilling out the form was easy, and Mary didn't have to include proof of her income. She was worried though if the information on the form would be shared with other agencies. The secretary told her that the information was not shared. If Mary made below a certain amount annually, her child could get free lunch not just during the school year, but also even during the summer, when there was no school.\nMary knew this would help her family. While Mary did work, she only worked part-time. Giving her child money for lunch every day did add up and impact the family budget.\nAfter filling out and submitting the form back to the school secretary, Mary had to wait a month or two before finding out if she was qualified. A few weeks after she submitted the form, a letter arrived in the mail. The letter informed her that her child was qualified. The letter also told her that her child could also get free breakfast in school."

When they were in elementary, they both shared a dream of becoming astronauts and flying in spaceships to discover unknown galaxies and unknown life forms. In middle school, they both shared the dream of becoming famous basketball players. Then, in high school, they both had the urge to become famous rock stars.\nIt wasn't always a cheerful friendship.

However, there are those who would argue that there were others who were just as great. Ali was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and was first called Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., but changed his name in the late 1960s after adopting Islam as his religion.\nAli was not only one of the greatest heavyweight boxers ever to step into the ring, but also a deeply spiritual person who defied the United States government by standing on his ethics. He was a controversial and divisive man who elicited great emotion from those who loved him, and those who wanted him jailed.\nAli was on top of his profession in the late 60s when his draft classification was changed. He was ordered to enlist in the Army, but he refused. He claimed that he could not go to war because of his religious convictions. Many saw this move by the U.S. government as a way to silence the outspoken boxer because he was well beyond the age most young American men were being drafted at the time. Ali was stripped of his title, and was banned from boxing, while his case went through the U.S. court system. Ali was inactive during his ablest years from the age 25 to almost 29. There is no telling how many more victories and titles he could have won during his stolen prime.\nEventually, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an 8 - 0 decision in Ali's favor, overturning his conviction of draft evasion. His stance was not popular at the time among conservative Americans; many people disliked him very much, but his determination and moral principles held up his decision. He is now regarded as one of the most influential persons in the history of the U.S. He was named \"Sportsman of the Century\" by Sports Illustrated magazine, and \"Sports Personality of the Century\" by the BBC."

        "content": "A public park is a place where people can go to spend time away from the home in an outdoor environment. Parks have many features designed to give the most options possible to park visitors. How a park shapes up depends greatly on the natural environment it is located in. It may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil, and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains, or playground structures. Many parks have fields for playing sports such as football and baseball. They may also have paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking, and other activities. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting, and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills.\nAdditionally, many parks engage the community by providing venues for recreation and events. Many parks hold outdoor concerts where visitors can enjoy live entertainment. Parks are traditionally selected to host traveling carnival shows. These carnivals have mechanical rides that people can enjoy for a small fee. Carnivals also have game booths, video games, and food available. Parks are sometimes divided into active and passive recreation areas. Active recreation involves cooperative or team activity, including playgrounds, ball fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and skate parks. Active recreation such as team sports, due to the need to provide substantial space to congregate, typically involves intensive management, maintenance, and high costs. Passive recreation, also called \"low intensity recreation\", emphasizes the open-space aspect of a park and allows for the preservation of natural habitat. It usually involves a low level of development, such as rustic picnic areas, benches and trails."

Since the founding of the country people have come from different countries in search of a better life and opportunities. Immigration laws, however, are always changing and are complicated. This leads to many people coming into the U.S. without proper legal status. While some people call immigrants who come and stay in the U.S. without the proper papers \"illegals\", many consider this term offensive. The more acceptable term is \"undocumented\" since they do not have the correct legal documents.\nIt is estimated that there are more than 11 million undocumented people in the Unites States. While some people will say there is no reason for immigrants to be undocumented in the U.S., there are limits on the number of Green Cards, or legal permanent  resident cards, people from certain countries can get. There are also long waiting lists, up to 14 years in some cases, for people coming from certain countries, to apply for legal status in the U.S. Additionally there are a limited amount of visas, or permits, for people coming into the U.S. with manual labor skills. Millions of undocumented people have been deported, or sent back to their country of origin under President Obama.\nIn 2013, the U.S. Senate passed an immigration reform bill. The law adds extra border security along the U.S.-Mexico border, and also makes it easier for immigrants to become citizens. The bill, which also has to be approved by the House of Representatives, has not yet been presented or voted on by Congress. Because of this, many are asking President Obama to take action to protect some of the undocumented, many of whom have been in the U.S. for many years and have children that are U.S. citizens."

In California, which is the most populous state in the country and the third largest in area, getting around is easy. There are commuter trains to take people quickly and efficiently to and from work, school, or when on recreation. Additionally, nearly every city has bus service that commuters can use to reach other neighborhoods. Southern California boasts the largest car culture in the country. Nearly everyone in the region owns a car that they use on a daily basis to get to work, school, or elsewhere.\nIn recent years there has been great importance placed on expanding the existing commuter train system in California. In Southern California, Metro has added a number of new commuter train lines that help residents get from place to place. The same situation exists in other large cities and regions throughout the state. California has also decided to build a high-speed rail line linking Southern California with Northern California. This \"Bullet Train\" is currently under construction and should be in place in the near future. Once it is built it will give travelers who would normally fly an option to take the train instead. This is good news to those who are afraid of flying, or do not have time to take a bus.\nOther ways of getting around in the country have appeared in recent years. Car sharing services such as Uber and Lyft have come onto the scene. These services are similar to taking a traditional Taxi, and are very popular.

Writing checks was the only way, other than paying cash, to pay bills in the past, but with the advent of the Internet and online banking, it is used sparingly today. Still, most lenders will accept written checks as payment for most bills.\nMost companies pay their employees electronically today, but some still issue checks. Paychecks are issued either every week or every other week. In order for an employee to cash the check, he or she will need proper identification. Accepted IDs would be a state driver's license, or a state-issued identification card. People can go to any Department of Motor Vehicles in any state to acquire an ID. Once a person has an ID, he or she can go to a bank, credit union, or check-cashing business to cash their check. It is a simple process. The best thing to do is to open a checking or savings account at a bank where you plan to cash your checks. This way you can avoid charges from check-cashing businesses for their services.\nWriting a check is easy, too. Once you have a checking account, and enough funds to cover your checks, you can use your checks at many retail outlets. Checks can also be used to pay back personal loans to friends or family. Remember, writing good checks that will not give the recipients trouble cashing can be to your advantage. Your reputation and credit rating can be established or damaged depending on how good your checks are. One of the worst things you can do is to write checks when you do not have the funds to cover them. Be responsible, not to write bad checks."

Her sexy, and scantily clad costumes and performances both delighted and aggravated the American public for years. She excelled at pushing the boundaries of what most Americans perceived as acceptable in her music videos and live performances. Madonna did not shy away from controversial subjects, either.\nMadonna was born in Bay City, Michigan in 1958. She moved to New York City to pursue a career in dancing as a young woman. She began her music career with a couple of club bands in New York, but was soon noticed by music industry executives. In 1983, she released her first album titled simply, \"Madonna.\" This was just the beginning for the superstar. She followed her initial success with several hit albums and singles such as Like a Virgin, and Into the Groove. She coupled her commercial success in music with successful performances in a series of movies such as Desperately Seeking Susan, and Evita. It seemed there was nothing Madonna could not do.\nOne of Madonna's defining characteristics is her ability to reinvent herself. Many artists find success in the very competitive, entertainment industry, but most are only successful for a short period of time, but not Madonna. She has sold more than 300 million records worldwide to date. She ranked second only to the Beatles on Billboard's list of Greatest Acts of the 20th Century.\nMadonna's career has not been without controversy, though.

During the 1960s, music in the United States was greatly influenced by the social issues of the day. Many call the decade a revolutionary period in the country's history, and music was a big part of that revolution.\nWhen David was young, he was in love with the Beatles. The English band was possibly the most impactful group of the generation. It revolutionized music like no band or artist before them. Most young boys wanted to be Paul McCartney, or John Lennon - the two founders of the band. Becoming rich and famous in America is one of the attractions of living in the U.S., and becoming a rock star is one way of achieving this. David knew this, so he got together with three of his friends and convinced them to form a band together.\nMany American Rock N' Roll bands began their journey in someone's garage. One notable group to start this way was Van Halen. David and his friends were convinced they could become the next Beatles with a little luck and a lot of practice.\nThe band practiced regularly over the years, and soon became good enough to perform before some young audience, but they never hit the big time unfortunately. The road to success in the music industry is not an easy one to travel, but that does not deter some American dreamers. David's philosophy was \"You never know what the future holds,\" and is engaged in the music industry to this day. A couple of his original band members are also in the industry enjoying marginal success, and are still pursuing their dream."

It is important to know a few things about ER services before you go to one when you are in need of immediate medical attention.\nThe first thing you should do is to locate the nearest ER in the neighborhood you live in since that is where you spend the majority of your time. It would also be a good idea to know where the ERs are near your place of work or school. ERs are for emergency treatment only. If you are in an auto accident, or have fallen and feel confused, it may be good to get to an ER to get checked out. Other symptoms that may require ER services are, shortness of breath, severe pain, pressure on the chest, or changes in your vision. In cases of severe trauma, emergency medical personnel such as paramedics will be sent to your location for assessment and treatment. If this occurs and it is determined that you need further emergency treatment, the paramedics, or an ambulance will transport you to the nearest center.\nIt is also important to know that ERs are expensive, so if you don't have medical insurance, a visit to an ER can be expensive. This is not to say that you must have insurance to receive emergency medical treatment though. ERs cannot refuse treatment to any person regardless of their ability to pay for the service. Be prepared to answer questions that medical personnel will ask. Sometimes these questions may seem too personal, but it is necessary to know as much about you before medical providers can treat you properly."

You can do it,\" said Edward to his son. \"I'm trying, dad. I'm trying,\" said Michael. It was not pleasant at first, but soon Michael was driving up and down the block. He was very pleased, and so was his dad. Michael was now a driver."

The city of Pasadena was a relatively calm place. Mike had grown up in Pasadena.\nHe had established a strong bond with the town, and was eager to go back to his childhood residence. Mike had been living in Los Angeles when he was dating Maria. When Mike and Maria decided to move in together, Pasadena was Mike's first choice of location to relocate to. Maria did not have any objections.\nShe agreed, and they both began looking for apartments. They looked through the newspaper section that listed housings. After a week of searching, they came across a nice one bedroom apartment. They called the landlord to set up an appointment to go see the place in person."

        "content": "One of the best skills a person can learn is how to perform first aid. First Aid is the practice of giving emergency care to someone who has suffered any injury and is in need of help. There are many ways to administer first aid to an injured person, but the steps you take are determined by the type of injury. There are, however, some basic steps to take.\nThe first thing you should do is to take a look at your surroundings to see if it is safe to approach the injured person. If the person is alert, ask a few basic questions that will help you determine what to do next. Some questions you can ask are: How were you injured? Do you have any pain? If so, where? What did you eat last? Is there anything about your medical history that can help? These simple questions can help you assess the person's condition before you get started.\nThe next thing a first aid administrator should do is ask for permission from the injured person to perform first aid. It would also be wise to tell them exactly what you are going to do before you do it. If the person is unconscious, try to proceed to the best of your ability. A first aid kit would help and if there is anyone else around you, it would be good to ask for help. Call 911 and try to calm the person down by reassuring him or her that help is on the way. Unless you have medical training, these are the best steps to take in an emergency situation. These small steps can mean the difference between someone's life or death. Your family and friends will all appreciate the first aid you have performed."

        "title": "Homelessness in Los Angeles",
        "content": "It is very common to see homeless people on the streets of Los Angeles. This is a problem that has persisted in the city since the beginning of the 20th century. Back in that time, California was known for offering many job opportunities in farming, and many young men were hopping on trains from all over the country to arrive in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, many of those men often ended up finding themselves without a job, a place to stay, or even food to eat. To help these people, many churches began to establish shelters in the area of Los Angeles that would eventually become Downtown. Even as the farm landscape changed to a big city environment, these shelters remained a refuge for many individuals that found themselves homeless\nNowadays, the homeless population of Los Angeles is made up of much more than just young men looking for work. Many economic and social changes have resulted in both men and women of all ages turning to the streets of Los Angeles. Some of them are there as a result of substance abuse that has left them moneyless and jobless. Others are veterans from various wars that cannot find the resources to get back to their normal lives. Additionally, many of these people suffer from mental disabilities that limit them from finding a job or being accepted in the rest of society.\nSince there are a lot of different causes that lead to homelessness, it is easy to see why finding solutions to helping all of the homeless people is so difficult. Although there are many programs that focus on providing the homeless food daily, it is much harder to find programs that try to assist the homeless in finding jobs, and stable housing. In order to finally find a solution that will effectively help decrease the number of homeless people in the city, a lot more individualized attention must be placed on individuals based on their physical and mental health, and circumstance."

Every night at seven o'clock, Tom would pick up Mary at her house and the two would walk Buddy around the neighborhood for about an hour. Mary no longer walked Buddy alone at night, and Tom no longer followed Mary.\nOne night, as they were walking Buddy, Mary and Tom decided to grab a bite to eat because they were hungry. \"Where do you want to eat?\" Tom asked Marry. \"Let's go to Pizza Mountain,\" she replied. \"I don't feel like eating pizza right now,\" Tom said. \"Do you have any suggestions?\" Mary asked. \"How about going back to my house? I'll cook our own food!\" Tom said. Mary thought this was a great idea. The two headed back to the street where they lived and thought about what to cook on the way.\nWhen they arrived, they had decided on making hamburgers. Mary wrote down a list of ingredients they were going to need to make the hamburgers. Tom went to the refrigerator and took out all the ingredients that he had. \"Where are the buns?\" Mary asked when she saw they were missing. \"I'll run to the market and get some hamburger buns,\" Tom said. By the time Tom came back from the market, Mary had prepared the food. All they needed to do now was to put the food between the buns.\nMary and Tom were about to take their first bites into their burgers when Buddy came in through the door wagging his tail and salivating. \"I think he wants a burger,\" Tom said. Mary rose from her seat and made a burger for Buddy. Buddy ate the burger in one bite as soon as Mary handed it to him."

Before eating roast turkey, sweet potatoes, and cranberry sauce, each person at the table had to say something they were grateful for. Julia appreciated that she was able to participate in this holiday that recalls the Pilgrims' first harvest after arriving from England a long time ago.\nJulia's phone rang at four in the morning. It was Elizabeth. Elizabeth invited Julia to go shopping with her. \"We are going to the stores so early?\" Julia asked sleepily. Elizabeth explained that the day after Thanksgiving in the United States was called Black Friday. Stores, which held special sales, started very early. \"It's the official start of the holiday shopping season,\" Elizabeth explained.\nJulia and Elizabeth were outside the local shopping center by five in the morning. Julia was surprised to see that not only were all the stores open, but they were crowded. Elizabeth told Julia that this was nothing. Some people camped outside the mall all night so that they could be among the first to enter and get extra special deals called \"door busters\". Many times these \"door busters\" were electronic items at extremely reduced prices. Often only a small number of these items are made available. Sometimes they are only available to the first 100 people in line.\nJulia thought it sounded violent and wondered aloud if people really broke down doors to get into the store. \"Sometimes there is a lot of pushing,\" Elizabeth explained. Some people have even been hurt, or killed, because of physical fights over limited products. At 5 a.m. though, the door busters were gone and the cash registers had long lines. Many shoppers had full shopping carts of presents they intended to give away for Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa."

        "content": "During the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Germany, Chancellor Adolf Hitler vowed to use the games to showcase Aryan superiority to the rest of the world. Hitler was convinced that the white, Aryan male was part of the superior race, and promised his games would prove this superiority on the Olympic stage. American track and field athlete, James \"Jesse\" Owens, had a different idea.\nOwens was an excellent athlete at Ohio State University during the early 1930s. During one track meet in 1935, Owens set three world records, and tied another, in what has been called \"the greatest 45 minutes ever in sports.\" Although Owens found great success in his athletic career, he grew up during a time in America when black people were still highly discriminated against. Segregation laws were still in effect in many parts of the country, and Owens felt this prejudice directly. He was not able to stay in the same hotel rooms as his white teammates, nor was he allowed to eat at the same restaurants. Ironically, Owens was treated better during his time at the 36th Olympics in Germany.\nDuring the games, Hitler became annoyed that Owens was winning so many gold medals. Owens was proving Hitler's racist claims and rhetoric as untrue. Hitler didn't like it. Owens ended up winning four gold medals at these games. Hitler refused to shake his hand. One of the defining moments of the games is when Owens was befriended by German athlete Luz Long. Owens cherished his friendship with Long, especially because he knew that Long could fall out of favor with Hitler's brutal regime.\nMany German fans shook Owen's hands, even though Hitler did not, but when Owens returned to the United States, he found not much had changed in there."

That was the time when Maggie spent a semester abroad as part of her undergraduate studies. Lisa was a Chilean student who helped Maggie learn Spanish and how to play soccer. Even when Maggie came back to the United States, the two friends kept in touch with each other via Facebook and Skype.\nMaggie waved to Lisa from the table in the restaurant when she saw her Chilean friend walk in. Lisa looked the same, just a little older and a little fatter. \"Tell me what is new with you?\" Maggie asked Lisa. Lisa explained that she worked for an airline and was in town on business. \"I get to travel all the time now,\" Lisa told Maggie. \"Oh, really?\" Maggie replied. \"Yes really, and I can even sometimes get tickets for friends and family members at really low prices,\" Lisa continued. \"Oh, really?\" Maggie replied. Maggie was annoying Lisa. Lisa was beginning to feel like Maggie didn't believe what she was saying. \"I can show you the memo from my job that explains it all if you don't believe me,\" Lisa said angrily. \"Why wouldn't I believe you?\" Maggie asked and confused.  She thought it was great that Lisa had a job that took her all over the world, and that even let her do it with friends and family.\n\"Well, you keep saying oh, really?' like you are challenging what I'm saying,\" Lisa said. Maggie explained that when she said \"oh really\", it just meant she found what Lisa was saying interesting and wanted her to elaborate. \"Oh, really?\" Lisa said before the two friends both burst out laughing."
