He stormed out of the cafe doors. Then, he ran across the street to his car. Since he was in a hurry, he did not check for traffic. Suddenly all he saw was a big white truck about to run him over. Luckily, the homeless man pushed Mitchell out of the way just in time to save his life. Mitchell gave him five dollars every morning after that."

Why did you do that?\" Betty asked. \"I lost my dog, so I'm going to put my sign up. Besides, no one cares about a mouse.

Every three weeks, he increased the weight he lifted by five pounds.\nHe also did push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups. He also drank protein shakes before he worked out. Protein shakes helped him gain muscle mass. John also changed his diet, too He started eating foods like beef, eggs, brown rice, and beets. In six months, John was no longer skinny. He was muscular and no one bullied him in college. He felt a lot happier, too. He felt more confident about himself and was happier going to class every day. His friends from high school noticed the change and complimented him on his healthier body.\nJohn was so inspired by his own body change that he decided to create a program teaching high schoolers how to get stronger. He first taught at his old high school, and then taught at several high schools nearby. Later he made a DVD about how to get stronger. The DVD was sold worldwide. Eventually John went on talk shows and wrote books about his journey."

        "content": "Technology is such a big part of teenagers' lives. Teenagers are always on social media, uploading pictures, replying to people, and more. Because the use of technology is becoming more and more popular, cyberbullying has become a trend too. Cyberbullying is bullying done online. This includes texting mean things about people, posting private photos of others, and more. One of the many bad things about cyberbullying is that one can be anonymous, which means that no one would know that he or she is the one cyberbullying someone.\nMichelle was scrolling on Facebook one day. A photo of her face photoshopped onto a fat person was on Facebook. Michelle was shocked. Who made this? She looked at who posted it and it was someone with the username \"chubbybunny94.\" She asked her friends if they knew who was behind this. Unfortunately no one knew. At school, the next day people made fun of her. It was annoying, but Michelle didn't care too much because she knew she was not fat. During lunch time, however, it got out of control. A classmate threw a piece of cake at her face and said, \"Eat it fatty!\" Michelle ran to the bathroom and cried.\nMichelle's friends told the principal about what happened. The principal made an announcement at every 11th grade classroom saying that if the cyberbully does not confess, he will call the police. A couple of days later, the cyberbully confessed. It was John. He did it because he was mad at Michelle for refusing to help him cheat on a test. John was suspended for three days. Michelle feels better."

Patricia started laughing out loud. \"You're kidding me, right?\" Patricia said. \"Yeah, I am! Guess you got me!\" Mary lied. It took Mary over two years to pay off the dress she bought last year. Now she had to get a new one.\nEveryone would be wearing dresses that cost at least $100. Mary could only spend $30 on a dress. She went to a thrift shop. She looked around for hours trying to find something good. Mary finally came across a long, red, and strapless dress. It was originally $300, but now only $20! What a good deal! Mary wore the dress at Patricia's party and everyone complimented her."

She could barely even recognize herself.\nJean asked her friends and family what they thought. Most of them liked it. They said it made her look edgier, but very different. In fact, when she met up with her friends, they asked who she was. One of them even tried calling the police when Jean showed up in front of her house.\nWhen Jean was shopping with her friends at the mall, a model scout came up to her and asked if she would consider modeling.

But usually they lose. It was her birthday. She took $100 to the casino. She went to the change booth. She got change for her money. She got 400 quarters for her $100. The quarters were in paper rolls. Forty quarters were in each roll. She put the rolls into a plastic bucket. She carried the bucket over to a slot machine. She loved slot machines. She opened a roll of quarters. She put a quarter in the machine. She pulled down on the handle. She looked at the screen. Give me three cherries, she thought. Or give me three bananas. Or give me three apples. Three of anything is a winner. Two cherries, or one cherry, is a loser. She played for several hours. Sometimes she won. She felt good when she won. But usually she lost. Finally, she lost all her quarters. She went home. She spent $100, but she had fun. I will play again on my next birthday, she thought."

Jared screams in frustration.\nJared goes to Lucas. \"Do you have my water bottle?\" Jared asks. \"I gave it to Richard to give to you,\" Lucas says. That was weird since Richard was the first person he asked about the water bottle. Jared went back to Richard. \"Lucas said you had my water bottle,\" Jared said. \"I told you, I saw Albert hold it. Lucas probably meant Richard Lopez, not me,\" Richard said. \"I'm just going to buy a new water bottle,\" Jared said. He bought a blue one this time."

He likes to listen to upbeat pop songs that inspire him to begin the day with a good start. He then goes to the bathroom, brushes his teeth, and washes his face. He has his clothes laid out on the chair the night before. After he has combed his hair. He then eats cereal for breakfast. He packs his stuff into his backpack. He makes sure he does not forget anything, especially his phone and wallet. He makes sure that he has all his homework also.\nLinda starts her morning every day without music. Instead, she sets multiple alarms because it's hard for her to get up. She will then go to the restroom, similar to Tom. She puts her contacts in since she does not wear glasses. After that, she eats breakfast. Linda likes to eat waffles for breakfast. She makes these with a waffle maker. She usually just eats them plain, but sometimes she adds strawberries. She then packs her lunch for school since she does not like the school lunch. She usually makes a sandwich. Sometimes she even makes one for Tom. She changes her clothes last."

Catherine wore a hearing aid as she was disabled.\nCatherine's new school was a private Christian school. She had to wear a uniform and pray between classes. Catherine was okay with praying, but she didn't like the uniform. She always liked expressing herself with clothes. Now, she could only wear the clothes she wanted on the weekends.\nAlthough there were no bullies, her classmates were hard to get along with. Catherine felt like her personality was so different from theirs. Her classmates were very studious, quiet, and kind of boring."

She went to the doctor to see if she could do anything about it. The doctor gave her a few tips but said that there was no medicine or cure for snoring.

She gave a list of books and websites that may help him and also referred him to some tutors. Another suggestion she made was to reach out to friends and form a study group.\nHe liked the idea of a study group because he felt more comfortable asking his friends for help. He asked his friends if they would like to form a study group. They loved the idea. They also were relieved since they were also struggling with calculus.

His friend overheard Robert saying he could not go. \"Robert, you have to go! Don't you want to spend time with us? We're all going to different high schools,\" Michael said. This was true. Maybe he can just go on the rides that are not roller coasters. Michael decided to go. He did want to see his friends one last time.\nAt the amusement park, his friends wanted to go on the tallest ride first. Robert felt his hands shaking. His friends all got in line. As they got closer to the front of the line, Robert's hands started sweating. When they reached the front, Robert couldn't move. \"Robert, come on! It's our turn,\" one of his friends said. \"I'm too scared. I can't,\" he said. \"Just try it, you might like it,\" his friend said. Robert took a deep breath and went on the ride. He closed his eyes and the roller coaster took off. Robert actually liked it! He loved how the wind felt rushing against him. When they got off the ride, he wanted to go again!"

Pamela immediately knew that she wanted to go to Harvard, but she was worried about money. Harvard was a private school, so it was expensive.\nTwo weeks later, she got an email from Harvard telling her what she got for financial aid. Pamela did not get as much aid as she hoped for. There are two types of financial aid: grants and loans. Grants are good because it is money given to you from the school that you do not have to pay back. For loans, you have to pay it back eventually. Harvard offered Pamela a lot of loans but not much grants. Pamela told her parents that she would not go to Harvard. Her parents told her that she should still go. Harvard was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\nAfter some thinking, Pamela agreed. She decided that she was going to apply for scholarships. She went to her school's college center and found several scholarships she was qualified for. She applied to a scholarship for history majors, one for violinists, one for Filipino-Americans, and one for female students. In the end, she managed to get $3000 from scholarships. This was a good start. She would get a job at Harvard while she took classes."

She thought it was too low.\nNicole's confidence was so low that her friends started to get annoyed with her. They kept telling her that she was fine, but Nicole would deny it. Nicole's mom encouraged her to join a sports team at school. Nicole did not want to, because she didn't want to get rejected. After days of convincing, Nicole finally gave in to her mother's request. Nicole decided to try out for the basketball team. She played when she was younger, but has not played in five years. It helped that Nicole was tall.\nWhen Nicole went to try-outs, she looked at all the people she was competing against. She started to compare herself to the other girls. They were all shorter than her, but they were more confident. Nicole tried to put them out of her mind. The coach asked the girls to shoot free throws, run short distance, and then finally, asked them to play a game. Nicole was doing well, and she was surprised. She didn't realize that she still had basketball skills. Nicole made the team and felt more confident about herself. She knew she was good at something."

Janice decided that she just wanted to go to a nice restaurant with her friends.\nJanice's birthday was on a Tuesday; she had class and work on Tuesdays. She always walked to class with her friend Austin. When she and Austin met up, she thought he would wish her a Happy Birthday, but he didn't. Austin has known her for years and he would always remember her birthday. Janice tried to drop hints. \"I wonder what today is,\" she said. \"Just a Tuesday, nothing special.\" Janice was upset. She ignored him during class.\nAfter class, Janice went to work. She expected a few birthday cards or a cake, but nothing. She was surprised, because employees would always get something for their birthdays. This made Janice upset. She didn't even want to go out to eat for her birthday anymore.\nWhen Janice got home, she questioned if anyone even cared about her. Her friend Liza called her. \"Hey, can you open the door, we're here,\" Liza said. \"I don't want to go out anymore,\" Janice said. \"Why not? Can you just open the door, we're already here,\" Liza said. Janice opened the door. \"Surprise!\" her friends yelled. They had a puppy in their hands."

Her hair had also never been dyed, so she had extremely healthy hair. Michelle was excited for her new look. She looked up pictures for reference to show the hair stylist.\nMichelle went to the hair salon the next day. She told the hair stylist exactly what she wanted.

        "content": "Wayne has a secret, a secret he has not told anyone. He recently found out that he had one week to live. Nobody, not even his parents, knows. He did not want to see people cry or feel that they have to do something for him. Wayne decided that he would just try to live life to the fullest. He would do things that he always wanted to do. He made a list. The first thing on his list was to go to Japan. Even though buying a flight ticket this last minute was expensive, it didn't matter anymore.\nHe was in Japan for two days. He got to see cherry blossom trees, eat great sushi, and hike Mt. Fuji. He went back to the U.S. He went to Laguna Beach with his friends. They played volleyball, tanned, biked, and more. They also had s'mores and watched the sunset. On the fourth day, he had brunch at a very expensive restaurant with his mom and dad. He was glad he didn't tell them about his secret. If he did, they would be crying instead of enjoying brunch.\nOn the last day, he made sure every hour was amazing. He saw the sun rise at Santa Monica pier. He had lunch with his best friends. He went hiking with his dog. He ate ice cream for the last time. Finally, he watched the sunset at home. A couple of hours later, the doctor called Wayne's parents about his death. They were totally shocked. Wayne had left a note for them thanking them and explaining why he did not tell them about his secret."

If you could finish the entire Extreme Burger in 10 minutes, you would win a $300 gift card. \"Hey Roberto, why don't you try the challenge?\" his friend asked. Roberto had certainly thought about it before. The truth was, it just seemed too much even for him. The Extreme Burger included 10 beef patties, chicken strips, hot dogs, chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, french fries, and much more. Roberto could probably eat half of that, but not the whole thing.\n\"Come on, Roberto! Do it! Are you scared?\" his friend teased. Whenever someone told Roberto he could not do something, he had to prove them wrong. Roberto called over the waiter and asked for the Extreme Burger. Everyone at the restaurant surrounded Roberto. He felt nervous. \"In 3-2-1 go!\" the waiter said. Roberto started eating. The first ten bites were good, but then he started to get sick. The crowd kept cheering and that motivated Roberto. Nine minutes had passed and Roberto was down to his last bite. He took the last piece and swallowed it. The crowd cheered. Roberto felt proud. He not only proved his friends wrong, but got a gift card for one of his favorite restaurants."

Yvonne decided to paint her nails to stop herself from biting them since she doesn't want to bite on the nail polish.\nYvonne was in class listening to a boring lecture, which made her want to bite her nails. She looked at her blue nails and stopped herself. Ten minutes later, she looked at her nails again. She started sweating and tapping her foot. The girl sitting next to her asked if she was okay. Yvonne couldn't take it anymore. She just had to bite her nails again."

She checked the website every day for one month, but the price never went down. She wanted the dress in the medium size. The website said there were only five more left. She did not want it to sell out. She finally bought the dress.\nA week later, it came to her house. Vanessa excitedly opened the package and the dress was perfect. It looked exactly the way it did on the website! Her cousin was throwing a party on a yacht that night. Vanessa wanted to wear the dress for that party.\nWhen Vanessa arrived, everyone complimented on how she looked. The dress was definitely worth it. \"Where did you get that dress?\" her cousin asked. \"tula.com,\" Vanessa said. Her cousin went on the website. There were only two more in the size medium and one more in the size small.\nThe next day, Vanessa decided to wear the same dress at her friend's dinner party. \"Hey Vanessa! Nice dress. I just bought the same one today. It was such a good price,\" Jan said. \"You mean you don't think $100 is a good price?\" Vanessa said. \"Oh no, it was only $35!\" Jan said. Vanessa's jaw dropped. If only she waited one day."

The temperature never goes below 0 degrees. People from Los Angeles can't handle cold weather. Paula was very used to the warm weather in Los Angeles. However, she has to move to Minnesota for school. It is very cold in Minnesota, especially during the winter. Paula is worried that she can't handle it.\nPaula is buying many warm clothing items and accessories to prepare herself. She has bought mittens, boots, rain boots, long coats, and jackets. Her first day in Minnesota was rough. Even though she was wearing five layers, she felt extremely cold. A stranger passed by her and said, \"You must be from California.\" \"How did you know?\" she asked. \"You're shivering even though you're wearing five layers,\" he said. The man was only wearing a single long sleeve shirt.\nPaula's body could not take the cold the first week. She got the cold. She called her parents saying she wanted to move back. They encouraged her to stick with Minnesota. After a couple of weeks, Paula started to get used to the cold weather. She started wearing less clothes and shivering less. That's the great thing about human bodies - they adapt so we can survive."

Getting into medical school is hard, too.\nWhen Adam told his parents that he wasn't going to apply to medical school, they were upset. They did not understand why. Adam had a high GPA, a high MCAT score, and great letters of recommendation. Adam explained that his heart was not into it. He knew he would probably get into some medical schools, but it wasn't worth it. He wanted to go to nursing school. He wouldn't have to be in school that long and he liked the work better. When he told his parents this, they said, \"Nursing is for women,\" they said. Adam expected them to say this. A lot of people have told him the same thing.\n\"I get why you would say that, but there are a lot of male nurses these days. They are paid well too, and don't have to work long hours,\" Adam said. His parents accepted his wishes. They weren't happy about it at first. After his first year of nursing school, however, they saw how happy he was."

The next day, he gathered up all the swim team members except Benjamin to meet him at the pool.\n\"Hey guys, I know you want to vote for Benjamin, and I think he's a great guy. The thing is, he would be a terrible captain. He always puts school first. He would rather study for a test than practice his breast strokes.

An employee checked her bag and pulled out the necklace from her bag. It turned out that there was a security tag."

He wanted to get into sports. He saw a flyer for soccer tryouts. Howard never played soccer, but he watched it on TV. Howard had one week to get ready before tryouts.\nHe watched soccer games on his TV for two hours. He bought a soccer ball and kicked it around at home and at the park. He bought the book How to Play Soccer. He asked his dad to play with him, too. Howard felt like he was a great soccer player! He was ready! He went to tryouts. There were at least fifty boys trying out. Howard got nervous. They all looked like they knew what they were doing. They could bounce the ball on their heads, juggle the ball with their knees, and kick the ball far.\nThe coach set up a game for the boys to play. Howard was on the \"red\" team. Someone passed the ball to Howard. Howard stopped in the middle of the field. \"What are you doing, man?\" his teammate asked. Howard took a deep breath and told himself he could do it. Howard got his head back into the game. He caught the ball with his foot and made a goal. He couldn't believe it; no one could. Howard made the team."

These terrorist attacks can happen anytime. We can't live life in fear. We must do the things we love.\nPeople are also scared to travel in general, because of plane accidents. Terrorists often bring explosives on planes. Some people are also scared of dying on a plane. All the passengers in Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 are missing. We still don't know what happened to them. Not too long after, all the passengers in Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 died. It was a very tragic event.\nIt is scary that our lives can end so quickly and suddenly. We need to live life to the fullest. We need to love the people around us and be thankful for every day that we live. There are always news stories about people dying before they should. It's not the best thing to hear about, but it makes us more aware of our own lives."

It is also bad, because the end product is usually not very good.\nSince studying is not very fun, students play video games, hanging out with friends, and eating out before studying. They end up studying the night before the test and do not get much sleep. This is bad, because eight hours of sleep or more is needed to do well. Students who procrastinate end up doing badly on tests. Teachers always encourage students to start early and do a little bit of studying every day.\nProcrastination does not just happen in school, it happens everywhere. People put off going to the doctor, applying for jobs, and more. Some people say that procrastination is just human nature. However, some people say that they do well when they procrastinate. They say that stress makes them work faster."

People were afraid of him, and Dean loved it.\nDean's world turned upside down when his brother passed away. He still went to class. His English teacher was talking about Shakespeare, whom Dean's brother admired. Hearing about Shakespeare reminded Dean of his own brother. His eyes started to water. He didn't want anyone to see him cry. He got up from his desk. \"Dean, you can't get up while I am teaching,\"  Mr. Chen said.\nEveryone stared at Dean. Everyone could see the tears in his eyes. They laughed at him. Dean ran out of the classroom. Mr. Chen followed him and sat down with him. \"Dean, it's okay to cry. Something tragic happened. Go ahead and cry.\" Dean put his head on Mr. Chen's shoulder and cried out loud. It was the first time he cried in front of someone. It was the first time he didn't act tough."

        "content": "While most teenagers had acne, a condition where one gets a lot of pimples, Melinda had great skin. Her skin was perfectly smooth with no flaws whatsoever. She thinks she got her smooth skin from her parents. She also might have smooth skin because she drinks a lot of water.\nHaving acne is tough because teenagers care a lot about their appearance and what other people think of them. Having acne can cause people to feel bad about themselves, shy away from others, and not go out. Melinda doesn't have this problem, but her sister, Ivana, does. Ivana didn't understand why she had acne, because no one in her family had it. Ivana ate fairly healthy, too. She felt like she was just unlucky. Because of her acne, Ivana felt insecure about herself. It was hard for her to be confident. She always tried to avoid attention. She barely talked to anyone.\nIvana decided to try ProActiv because she kept seeing it on TV. It ended up improving her skin. It was less red and bumpy. Meanwhile, Melinda got her very first pimple, and it was on the day of her big speech in class! It was horrible timing. That's the thing about pimples though, they just appear out of nowhere!"

She spent five days a week folding clothes or hanging them up on hangers. People who tried on clothes usually left them on the floor in the dressing room. They rarely folded them or hung them back up on the hangers. The store was only 15 minutes from her apartment, and parking was free. Also, she worked four nights a week at a restaurant. She was a waitress. She made good money from her tips. Usually, the customers were friendly and interesting. She liked her waitress job, but it was a 30-minute drive from her apartment. The restaurant closed at 10 p.m. She did not want to be stuck in the parking lot late at night if her car didn't start. Her mechanic wasn't open on weekends. She decided to ask her boss to give her a day off from the clothing store. Then she could still drive to the restaurant that night after her car was fixed. She would miss only one day of work."

She just finished the chapter where the main character falls in love with a patient who is dying of cancer.\nLaura's friends already finished the book, so she told them not to give any spoilers. Spoilers are parts of the story that reveal important details before a person gets to that part of the story. Spoilers ruin the fun of not knowing. It's like knowing how a movie ends when you are just starting to watch the movie. Laura's friend was about to say something about the book, but Laura stopped her. \"No spoilers, guys! I want to enjoy this book,\" she said.\nLaura was reading the book on the bus. A couple on the bus started talking about the book. Laura started to panic. She put on her headphones and listened to music throughout the entire bus ride. Laura continued reading the book when she got home. Her mom came into her room. \"That is such a good book! I'm so glad you're reading it. Have you got to the part when the main character is told she also has cancer?\" her mom said. \"MOM! I'm only halfway!\" Laura exclaimed. Her mom apologized.

Her plane tickets and living accommodation would be paid for. The bad thing about the internship was that it had nothing to do with her life goals. The internship required her to teach French children English. Brenda was okay with children, but she didn't love them.\nOne pro of the job offer at the hospital was that it was good for her end goal. Brenda's end goal was to be a doctor, and the job will teach her a lot about medical school. One con of the job offer was the location. The hospital is in a dangerous place where people have to be careful of being robbed and getting hurt.\nAfter a lot of thinking and looking at her list, Brenda decided to work at the hospital.

The truth is, everyone's vote matters! Secondly, they don't think that anything will change if they vote. Although, it's hard to see big changes right away, the presidential candidate you vote for affects many policies. Thirdly, people are lazy to go out of their house to vote. This is the worst excuse.\nPeople need to realize that voting is a privilege. Imagine if we couldn't vote. We would feel out of the loop. We would feel that our opinion doesn't matter.

He asked Junior what the new balloon looked like. \"It looks like a flying saucer!\" said Junior. \"It looks like a real flying saucer! Is there an alien inside?\""

Mr. Tan had to come up with another idea that was legal.\nMr. Tan decided to use online articles that were available for everyone to access. The students liked this idea, because they did not have to buy a textbook. The principal liked this idea, because it was legal. Mr. Tan liked the idea, because he felt that the articles taught a lot of interesting information. Mr. Tan won Teacher of the Year award.

She felt she had no time to cook or find healthy food. She often stopped at fast food places and got quick snacks. The unhealthy food often left her feeling tired. She did not have the energy at the end of the day and often felt sleepy. She decided she needed to alter her eating habits. She wanted to stop eating so unhealthy, but she did not know how.\nShe decided to start by cutting out coffee. At first it was hard since she drank coffee almost every day. By the end of the week, she felt better. She was also saving a lot of money by not having to buy a drink every day, which quickly added up.\nThe next step she took was to incorporate more healthy food into her diet. Instead of eating burgers and sandwiches so often, she decided to eat salads every other day. She found that salads were just as quick and cheap as burgers. This made her feel more refreshed and energized. She found herself less sleepy and more focused in class. The salad even tasted better than the burger.\nJessica felt so good with her diet change.

The governor and his wife were very sad. The governor didn't want other children to die. He didn't want other parents to suffer. He didn't want them to lose their children. He talked to the state lawmakers. He asked them to pass a new law to protect children. The lawmakers agreed. They were parents, too. They passed a new law to protect children. The governor signed the new law. The new law was a helmet law. Children had to wear a helmet when they rode a bike, or a sled, or a horse. They had to wear a helmet when they snowboarded or skateboarded. \"Texas is now a safe state for children,\" said the governor. \"Maybe we're safe,\" said one boy, \"but we're not happy. Helmets suck.\""

Natasha kept thinking about Kyle, and Benjamin thought Natasha was way too quiet. Kyle kept thinking about Natasha, and Mary was mad that Kyle wasn't paying attention to her.\n\"Give me a second, I'm going to see how Ben is doing,\" Kyle said to Mary. Kyle walked over to Benjamin. \"Hey, where's Natasha?\" Kyle asked. \"She's in the bathroom,\" Benjamin said. \"None of us are happy right now. Why don't we switch dates?\" Kyle suggested. \"That would leave me and Mary unhappy,\" Ben said. Kyle sighed. He knew Ben was right. The homecoming dance was just going to be a bad night."

As time went on, he started smoking 5 cigarettes a day. He stopped for a couple of years. However, he continued once he graduated from college.\nAt Nicholas's job, everyone smoked during the break. It was hard not to smoke. If he didn't smoke, he felt like he would not be accepted. This happened to one coworker. Lawrence did not smoke. Because of this, he didn't go outside with the other coworkers during the break. He missed out  on a lot of socializing and conversations about work. Lawrence did not have as many connections as Nicholas.\nOne day, Nicholas's mom visited him at work to surprise him with lunch. When she saw him, she immediately knew he smoked because he smelled. \"How could you?! You know your father died from smoking!\" she said. Nicholas's mom started crying and his coworkers stopped what they were doing and stared. Nicholas begged his mom to stop crying and promised to never smoke again."

With smartphones, you can not only call people, but you can also go online, download new games, calculate a math problem, organize your schedule, and more. Smartphones are really helpful. Even kids have cell phones now.\nPeople use their phones a lot these days, especially when they are waiting. People do not like to be bored, so they go on their phones. A lot of news reports are saying that people are looking at their phones way too much. People look at their phones when they are with others, and that is bad. Being addicted to something is never good.\nWhen you go into a restaurant and look at other customers, most of them have phones in their hands. They would rather text, play a game, or go online than talk to the people around them. Some restaurants have even offered a free meal or a discount if customers are willing not to use their phones for an entire hour! People also use their phones before they sleep. This is bad for them, because it makes it harder for them to go to sleep. The light from the phone tricks our bodies into thinking we need to be awake."

Everyone knows the smell of dead flesh. She knew that something in the dumpster was dead, but she didn't know what. Just in case it was a human (some people dump their babies into dumpsters), she opened the lid. She saw the cat. Flies covered most of it. They were enjoying their meal. She loved cats. She had two of her own. A week later at a restaurant, she ordered a hamburger. She took one bite out of it, and almost gagged. She spit it out.

She had trouble sleeping during the afternoon. She was upset that she had to miss out on social events her friends hosted.\nIt's still hard for Ophelia to adjust, but she is better at it. When she comes back from work, she goes to the gym for a few hours. Then, she practices her knitting skills. Afterwards, she would make herself a healthy meal. Night shift workers often eat unhealthier than day shift workers. After lunch, she would watch her favorite TV show. After that, she would sleep.\nThe hospital informed the employees that they could send requests to change the time of their shift. Ophelia was excited about this and immediately sent in a request to change her shift. A couple of weeks later, the manager gave Ophelia a letter. The letter stated that her request was rejected.\nOphelia was shocked. She went to her manager and asked him why. He said that many night shift workers who requested an earlier shift were elderly. Ophelia was only 25. The manager thought that the older employees needed an earlier shift more than Ophelia did.\nOphelia was mad at first, but she thought about the older employees. Their bones were aching and they're tired. They do need it more than her."
