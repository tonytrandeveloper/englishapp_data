We all waited in front of the school office.\nSoon a teacher came and led us to some classrooms. There we were put into four separate classes. This was when some children began to cry as the parents were not allowed into the classrooms. I did not cry because I had been to kindergarten before. Actually my mother went home soon after for she knew I would be all right.\n\nIt was an enjoyable time for me as I got to know my new classmates. The teacher was very busy writing down our particulars so we had plenty of time to ourselves.\n\nMeantime some children continued to sob while their parents looked in anxiously through the windows.\n\nSoon recess came. Some of us headed for the tuck-shop while the rest headed for their parents. I bought a drink with the money my mother gave me. Getting to know my new friends had made me thirsty.\n\nAfter recess we went back to out classroom and my new friends and I managed to coax two boys to stop crying. In fact, soon we were laughing and playing together. Once in a while the teacher had to tell us to keep quiet as we were making too much noise.\n\nStill some parents looked in anxiously through the windows.\n\nFinally the bell rang for us to go home. Some of us were very relieved to be reunited with our parents. I too was glad to see my mother waiting for me at the school gate. I had made many friends. It had been a wonderful first day at school."

        "content": "Everyday many people are involved in road accidents. Some are killed. Many more are injured or maimed. So it is important for us to learn to use the roads properly and safely. No sane person would like to be involved in an accident.\nAs the roads are very busy nowadays, we should be very careful when crossing one. It is safer to use a pedestrian crossing or an overhead bridge whenever one is available. Never cross a road by dashing across it. That is inviting trouble. If there are no crossings, then we must look carefully right and left and cross only when it is safe to do so.\n\nSome of us take the bus to school. It is important that we do not try to get on or off a bus while it is still moving. I tried to get on a moving bus once. It dragged me a short distance and nearly ran over me. I was lucky to escape with only some scratches on my legs. Also we must not fool around while in the bus. A suddenly lurch can send us knocking our heads against something hard.\n\nUsing a bicycle can be dangerous too. We must pay attention on the road and never cycle too far out to the middle of the road. We must obey all traffic rules. Also we must make sure our bicycles are in good condition with working brakes, lights etc.\n\nThese are some things we can do to avoid accidents. However there is no guarantee that we will never be involved in one. The important thing is to stay alert at all times while using the roads. We must know what is happening around us. In that way we can take necessary action to avoid danger whenever we see one. Road safety is very much up to how we use the roads. Use them carefully and we may be able to use them for a long time. Use them carelessly and we may never be able to use them again."

I told my mother about my toothache. It was obvious I could not go to school. So instead she took me to the dentist. I was horrified, but I had no choice.\n\nAt nine o'clock we waited outside the dentist's office. The nurse came and opened the door. I was the first patient. She wrote down my particulars and told me to wait a moment. The dentist had not arrived yet. Meanwhile the tooth still ached like mad.\n\nThe burly dentist arrived and I was ushered to the dentist's chair. Normally I would run away from the frightening surgery with all its horrible drills and pliers, but I did not. I had to get the offending tooth out.\n\nSo I sat down on the reclining chair while the dentist kept saying some reassuring words. I relaxed somewhat. He asked me to open my mouth. I did so. He said that the tooth had to come out. I nodded dumbly in reply.\n\nI felt a slight prick of pain when he gave me an injection, but that was nothing compared to the toothache. Soon, miraculously, all pain disappeared. The anaesthetic definitely worked very quickly. Then before I knew it, the dentist told me that I could go. I looked at him quizzedly and he told me he had already pull the tooth out. What wonder, I did not even feel it.\n\nThe dentist put a wad of cotton over the wound and he told me to keep my mouth shut for a while. I nodded, smiled and went out into the waiting room where my mother was waiting for me. The visit to the dentist was not too bad after all."

We hoped that the clouds would go away so that we could continue playing.\nOur hopes were dashed when suddenly heavy rain began to pour. In a few seconds we were all soaked to the skin. To make matters worst, lightning flashed dangerously close to us. The deafening thunder and howling wind did not help either.\n\nWe ran towards a large tree under which we had parked our bicycles. The tree provided some shelter from the rain and we were tempted to remain under it. However we knew that it was dangerous to stay under a tree during a thunderstorm. So we got on our bicycles and pedalled off.\n\nThere was no other shelter available nearby. So I, for one, decided to go home. Since I was already completely wet, I might was well to go home instead to seeking shelter.\n\nIt was just about the fiercest storm I had ever been in. The driving rain made cycling difficult as I could not see more that a couple of metres in front of me. A car flashed past me. It was too close for comfort. Perhaps the driver did not even see me. So I thought it was better to stop somewhere before I got hit by another car.\n\nLuckily I found a bus-stop with a roof. I hurried gladly under the roof even though I had to share it with a dozen other people who were also soaked to the skin. It was a bit of a squeeze but no one complained.\n\nFor an hour the storm lashed everything around us. We were silent spectators to an awesome display of power by nature. I felt very small and vulnerable, even afraid; but I could do nothing but watch.\n\nFinally the rain slowed down to a drizzle and the wind died down. I could still hear distant thunder but the worst of the storm was over. So happily I got on my bicycle and pedalled home."

Everyone knows that but still some of us do it.\nI had done it many times before until something happened to teach me never to do it again. It was not the police. Rather it was an unforgettable, and unpleasant, experience.\n\nIt happened one evening when my friend Segaran and I wanted to go and visit another friend who lived some distance away. I had a bicycle. Segaran did not. So, as usual, he sat side-saddle on the horizontal bar of the bicycle while I pedalled. We had done it many times before, so it should not be any problem.\n\nNear my friend's house, we got onto a gravel path made slippery by the recent rain. Still we managed to wobble along, thoroughly enjoying the rough ride.\n\nAs we passed by a stream, I made the mistake of going too near the bank. The rain had softened the soil and it could not hold our combined weight. One moment we were going along merrily, the next we were tumbling head over heels into the stream as the bank gave way beneath us.\n\nSplash! Splash! Splash! We plunged into the river bicycle first, followed by Segaran, then me. Normally the stream is only a few centimetres deep with clear water. When we fell in, it was a metre deep with foul black water. The water prevented us from getting badly injured but we also had to pay the price of gulping some of it. It tasted horrible. Segaran got the worst of it for being sandwiched between the bicycle and me, but it was not too bad. We had only a few cuts and bruises. Our pride was far more hurt.\n\nWe retrieved ourselves and the bicycle from the stream. We were both dirty and soaking wet. Obviously we were in no condition to visit anyone. So we decided to go home.\n\nWe walked all the way home. I had to push the bicycle because its front wheel was bent out of shape. From that moment I vowed never to carry anyone on a bicycle again. Never again do I want to be dirty and wet with cuts and bruises all over my body. Once was enough."

His voice is like that of a bull frog but volumes louder. It seems that he cannot talk softly. Actually he does not talk, he shouts. Perhaps his living with his family of ten children has something to do with it.\nIn this noisy bunch lives a boy who hardly ever opens his mouth. This is Padma, the boy who sits next to me. He is such a gentle and soft creature that one would think that he is a sissy. This is not so. No one dares call him one for he is a member of the school's Karate Club.\n\nThen there is Doris, our class monitor. She sits right in front of the teacher's table. She is such a model student that all the teachers love her. We all love her for she does not boss us around. She has given up doing that long ago. All she does is to make sure that the teachers have sufficient chalk and that the classroom is clean.\n\nRight at the back of the class sits our class sleepy-head. Mat seems to need more sleep than others. He catches cat-naps in between lessons. The astounding thing is that he can fall asleep almost instantly. The moment the teacher leaves after a lesson, Mat's snores start up and we know he is at it again. Remarkably he wakes up when the next teacher arrives.\n\nEvery class has a clown. Our class has Jack, otherwise known as \"Jacko The Clown\". He is always up to some prank or other, putting tails on the boys' pants, frogs in the girls' desks and powdered chalk on the teacher's chair. So when we hear a girl scream or see men-teachers strolling around with chalk on the seat of their pants, we know that Jacko has struck again.\n\nThe other classmates too have their own unique personalities. Each contributes his or her part to our class. All in all we are a group of young children who perhaps are a bit noisy at times, but on the whole are well-behaved and pleasant to be with."

I do not know them very well because they always appear angry. Never a day passes without hearing the children crying and the parents shouting at the top of their voices.\n\nOn the other side of my house, however, lives a very quiet and polite family. Mr. Verghese is a quiet man who seems to manage his family very well. Though he has four children, which is one more than the other family, I never hear him scold his children. So his children never cry. What a wonderful family they are.\n\nFurther down the road is a family whose radio is switched on most of the time, except late at night. His immediate neighbours must have a tough time putting up with the noise of the radio.\n\nThen there is a family whose members seem to live in a world of their own. Many times we have met along the road and not once has any of them even nod his or her head in acknowledgement. They are not blind or deaf. Yet they can walk straight past as if I am not there at all. I would not say that they are unfriendly. I guess they are simply not interested in knowing their neighbours.\n\nOn the opposite side of the road live Mr. Lim and his family. Mr. Lim is a bird-collector. So everyday a dozen or more birds sing melodious tunes right beneath his front porch. It is preferable to the blare of the other neighbour's radio. However the bird droppings can give off an awful stench.\n\nThese are some of the neighbours living near me. There are others that I have yet to meet. However I am careful not to intrude on their privacy. The friendly ones smile or raise their hands. The not-so-friendly ones look away. I have to live among them, friendly or not."

I just sit under my favourite rambutan tree and listen to these lovely songs.\n\nHowever I cannot just sit quietly all the time. My parents sometimes ask me to mow the lawn or help them in some gardening tasks. These I do gladly for the air is nice and cool. Working under a hot sun is one thing I do not like. In the evening the sun is soft and gentle. It is pleasant to potter around the garden then.\n\nOther times I might go out for a stroll or play games with my friends.\n\nAgain it is pleasant to stroll around or play games when the sun is not hot in the evening. In fact many people come out of their houses to breathe in the cool evening air and to relax a bit, unless it is raining. This is the time of the day when the playing fields, parks and other recreational areas are filled with people. I guess it is not only my favourite time of the day.

On the way we passed many interesting sights. My father promised to stop by on our way home. We had to visit our grandparents first.\n\nWe left Ayer Keroh and all its factories behind as we journeyed into the town itself. Like all towns, there were many cars and other vehicles. Also there were many tourists. Melaka has many places of historical interest and thus this was not surprising.\n\nFinally we arrived at my grandparents' house in Klebang Besar.

So after about an hour or so, my uncle told us to sit in the shade for a while. The sun was getting increasingly hot. So we reluctantly came out of the sea.\n\nIn the shade of some trees we built some sandcastles.\n\nTime passed so quickly. Soon we heard my aunt calling us to have lunch. We ran to her and helped ourselves to the delicious curry she had brought. Then we had several glasses of ice-cold drink from the Thermos flask.\n\nAfter lunch we played a while more in the sea. The sun was just too hot. So we walked over to one of the hotels nearby and washed ourselves with clean freshwater.\n\nWhen we returned, my aunt had already packed everything in the car.

I was not sure why we were looking for her but we all seemed afraid of her. Somehow we had to find her. So there I was, searching high and low for her in frightful places I had never been before. Sometimes I seemed to be flying while at other times I seemed unable to move. The whole atmosphere was one of fear, like a dreadful horror-movie in which I was a victim.\n\nAfter some searching I entered a darkened room and saw a figure sleeping on a bed. As I got nearer the figure suddenly threw away the blanket, got up and stared at me. It was an ugly old woman with shiny golden teeth. She raised her claw-like fingers and walked towards me.\n\nI wanted to run but was unable to. I tried to scream but found that I could not. In horror I struggled and struggled to get away from the frightful woman.\n\nThe next moment I gave a muffled yell and found myself panting on my bed. My goodness, what a horrible nightmare it was! For a minute or so I lay on my bed not daring to close my eyes for fear of falling asleep again and continuing the nightmare. Then I sat up on my bed until the horrible feeling passed.

Fortunately she cannot run very fast and gives up after a while.\n\nOne morning, as I crossed the road to avoid her, she tried to cross too. I started to run. She started to run too but tripped on her sari. She fell down hard on the road and lay there in a heap. I wanted to keep running but I saw that she was in great danger of being run over by a car. So I ran over to her to pull her to the roadside.\n\nAs much as I disliked it, I had to help her. The other passers-by did not seem to bother. So I held my breath and pull her by her arms towards the roadside. By now people and cars had stopped to watch. No one helped but at last I managed to drag her to safety.\n\nShe opened her eyes and gave me a smile. I could only stare at her dumbly.

For example, I do not have to catch a disease to know that it can kill me. I know the danger so I can avoid it. Also I do not have to go deep into the jungle to learn about the tiger. I can read all about it in a book.\n\nBooks provide the reader with so much information and facts. They have certainly helped me in my daily life. I am better equipped to cope with living.

So every week I watch him go about his antics only to lose in the end. He is such a character that many of my friends have even adopted his laugh.\nAnother favorite character of mine is Big Baby Huey in the show \"Casper The Friendly Ghost\". Huey is such a overgrown lumbering but innocent baby duck who goes around happily defeating the bad guys without really trying to. He is quite a sight to watch as he sucks on his milk bottle and then knocks the lights out of the sly fox who tries to take advantage of him. It is bad luck for anyone with bad intention, for soon Huey will show him that it does not pay to do bad things.\n\nThere is one more character who is my favorite. He is Yogi Bear who lives in Jellystone National Park. This lovable rascal and his little buddy Boo Boo Bear always seem to be getting into trouble with the park ranger. Yogi's favorite pastime is pinching food from the park's visitors. The ranger's unending task is to stop Yogi from doing it.\n\nAll in all, cartoon characters are great fun. They show us what people can get up to. I am sure all of us who watch these shows are entertained by them."

During weekdays I have to get up early or I will not get to school on time. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, it is so pleasurable to just lie in bed in the morning without having to get up and hurry to school. Again I tend to lie too long in bed and my mother has to come and tell me to get up.\n\nListening to the radio and watching television are also things I like to do.

We consume these fruits in great quantities.\n\nOther fruits like the papaya, pineapple, banana and star fruit are not seasonal. They are obtainable at all times.

Often the fruit-stalls are crowded with people waiting to buy a slice of papaya, pineapple or watermelon to quench their thirst.\n\nWe are lucky to have such a huge variety of fruits.

Cars and buses honked angrily at them.\n\nJust then I saw a young boy make a dash across the road. There was a loud blare of horn, a squeal of brakes and I saw a car knock into the boy. He fell as though his feet were swept from under him.\n\nFortunately the car was not moving very fast and the driver managed to stop the car before a wheel could run over the fallen boy.\n\nAll traffic stopped. I ran over to the boy and saw blood on the road. He was bleeding from a cut on his head. A man came and examined the boy. Then he lifted the boy and carried him to a car. They sped off, presumably to the hospital.\n\nMany people surrounded the driver who looked dazed and bewildered. A policeman came to calm things down.\n\nAs there was nothing I could do, I turned and walked down the road carefully. It was terrible to witness an accident. I certainly would not like to be involved in one."

It was a row of motor-workshops and they were burning furiously.\n\nThe police and fire department had already cordoned off the area. I watched from a distance. A crowd had already gathered and we gaped with amazement at the spectacle presented by the burning shops.\n\nThe fire rose to about twenty metres and it lit up the whole area even though the sky was already dark. The firemen desperately sprayed streams of water into the fire to control it. Now and then explosions can be heard as gas cylinders blew up in the intense heat.\n\nFor more than an hour the fire raged. I could see anxious people trying to get near the workshops only to be held back by the police. They were obviously the shop-owners trying to save their shops. Actually they could do nothing but wait for the fire to be extinguished.\n\nFinally the blaze died down and darkness enveloped us. The workshops were totally razed. Only red-hot embers remained where they once stood. The crowd thinned and I too got onto my bicycle and cycled home."

These two were robbers wearing dark glasses to conceal their identities!\n\nThe next moment Sam and his uncle were made to lie face-down on the floor. Sam heard the cash register ring and the drawer open. Then he heard a shuffling of feet, the roar of a motorcycle starting up and suddenly all was quiet.\n\nSam looked up. The robbers were gone. Sam shook his uncle who was still prostrate on the floor. They got up. Sam's uncle ran to the cash register. The robbers had taken every cent from it. The robbery had happened so quickly.

The five-foot ways were not big enough, so the hawkers and their customers actually spilled into the narrow street itself making it a hazardous place for drivers and motorcyclists. Every few seconds a horn sounded as the vehicles crawled cautiously among the throng.\n\nThere were so many people there that if I had not been with my father I would probably have got lost. My father knew his way around. So I held on tightly to his hand as he led me through the crowd. A number of times I nearly knocked into someone, or rather, someone nearly knocked into me. Everyone seemed to be in a rush and nobody seemed to care whether they trampled on another.\n\nWe were there to buy some cakes for the New Year. At the shop we had to wait a long time before we could pay for what we wanted. The shop was crowded with other shoppers.\n\nAfter our purchase, we made our way carefully out of the street. Once outside, the air felt so much fresher. Though we had to walk some distance to our car, it was so much more pleasant than walking among the crowd of frenzied shoppers along the busy street."

Every step in solving a problem is done logically. Other subjects like History and Geography require a lot of memory work. Remembering dates and other facts is hard work compared with the ease and simplicity of mathematical reasoning.\n\nWhile Mathematics is simple to me, some of my friends have great difficulty with it. I do not really understand why. They get stuck with simple problems and often give up. So I help them out when I can.\n\nThe one advantage I have in being good in Mathematics is that I do not have to spend a lot of time on it. Homework and tests are a breeze. So I have plenty of time left over to study other subjects. Sometimes I feel sorry for my less fortunate classmates who get scolded in class for not completing their Mathematics homework.\n\nAnyhow I have come to realize that human beings can be so different in their abilities while they look similar otherwise.

So we lay quietly in our sleeping-bags and hoped that the noise would go away. But it would not go away.\n\nActually it got louder and louder. Then it sounded like someone moaning. Jack hurried out of his sleeping-bags and switched on the torchlight. We could see nothing except the walls of the empty living room we were in.\n\nSuddenly there was a loud crash from upstairs and the moans turned to screams. We screamed too and ran out of the house as fast as we could, leaving behind everything that we had brought. The hair on the back of my head stood on end for hours afterwards.\n\nWe never dared to go back into the house, not even in the daytime. My uncle had to go and retrieve the things we had left behind there.\n\nSo, is the house haunted ? All I can say is that if you want to know, go and find out for yourself."

Fortunately I did not have to pay to get on my school bus. My fare was paid for monthly.\n\nWhen I told my mother about my loss, she was clearly angry.

She would not wear it.\n\nIn between bouts of crankiness, she sometimes seems normal. But this seems to get lesser as her disease progresses. So we do our best to keep her out of harm's way. We lock the medicine cabinet and doors and hide dangerous things from her. It would be disastrous if she swallowed a bottle of pills or got lost while wandering in the streets. The latter has happened before. A kind neighbour brought her home.\n\nIt is unfortunate the last years of her life has to be like this, but it is so. We can do nothing but to help her along as much as we can."

The sun was setting and the air was cool.\nJohn, Aileen and I sat down at a table. The stall-owner came and we ordered some fried mee.\n\nSoon the large plate of piping-hot mee arrived and we happily put some into our bowls and began eating.\n\nIt was delicious.\n\nJohn, the talkative one, still managed to say an unintelligible word or two between gulps of food.\n\nSuddenly John winced as his teeth came against something unchewable. Cursing, he spat out the contents of his mouth onto the table. \"What the heck!\" he cursed again.\n\nMuch to my disgust, John ran a finger through the half-chewed food. Then, uttering a cry of triumph, he picked up a staple from the food.\n\nAileen and I immediately stopped chewing and expelled the food from our mouths. The thought of eating staples was revulsive. I wondered if I had already swallowed some staples.\n\nWith a fork, Aileen searched through the rest of the mee on the plate. She found two more staples and a short length of raffia string!\n\nGoodness, I thought, what other rubbish was there in the food?\n\nWe summoned the stall-owner to our table. His smile vanished when we showed him the staples and string. Then he apologized for the matter, said that we did not have to pay and furthermore would make a fresh plate of mee for us, free of charge.\n\nWe got up, showed him our sour faces and walked off. I, for one, seemed to have lost my appetite."

The doctor said that what I needed was rest. He gave me a two- week medical certificate and some pills to keep down the fever.\n\nTwo weeks! I had to stay in the house for two weeks.\n\nVery quickly more blisters appeared all over my body. I even had some in the throat, which made swallowing difficult. To make matters worse, I began to get bouts of fever. At times when the fever was raging, I seemed to drift into a kind of limbo. Things became hazy and I was not sure whether I was dreaming or awake.\n\nI had a look in the mirror and saw that my face was grotesque. Red blisters covered the whole face. I wondered if I would be scarred permanently.\n\nSo I stayed in the house and did nothing. It was not too unpleasant except for the fever and the extra care I had to take not to break the blisters accidentally. Nobody came to visit me. I was forbidden to visit others. It was customary to remain out of sight when one had chicken- pox. I had no choice but to comply.\n\nThe days passed. Slowly the blisters dried into dark scabs which flaked off after a while, leaving behind little red scars. The flakes fell on the floor, on the bed and among my clothes.\n\nFor two weeks I remained confined to the house. At the end of the period, my appearance had improved enough for me to go back to school. The little scars remained there for a few more months but I was glad my enforced stay in the house was over."

Our monitor went out in search of her. A few minutes later, he returned to announce that Mrs. Singham was absent. We cheered. This was unexpected, but it was welcome.\n\nSo for forty minutes we literally fooled around. The monitor could do nothing. What a good time we had. The bell rang again. Forty minutes of fun seemed so short, but it was great while it lasted.\n\nAgain no teacher appeared. It was another case of an absent teacher. We cheered even louder because it was ,a double-period which meant we were free until recess.\n\nAltogether we had one hundred and twenty minutes -- two hours, of no lesson.

That certainly is not enough. So wherever possible I speak English with some friends and teachers who will or can speak English with me.\n\nReading book, magazines and newspapers are good ways of improving my English. On the whole they are grammatically correct. We may speak incorrect English and get away with it. Not so with printed words, they have to be correct. Through reading, I learned how to use correct English in writing and speaking, though at times I still speak the broken English that many of us speak here.\n\nWatching television and listening to the radio are two more ways of improving my English. English as it is spoken by the English, Americans, Malaysians and others are distinctly different.\n\nSo I continue to use English, that is, hear, read, speak and write it. Some of my friends only hear and read it. They can hardly speak or write it, but I will not be like them. I will try my best to master it."

Goodness, I thought, this was really unusual.\n\nOutside the sky was obscured by thick mist. Again this was unusual. On my way to school, my clothes actually got damp as moisture settled on me. It was cold and damp. The sun was well hidden. I could not even see where it was.\n\nMost of my schoolmates and the teachers had extra clothes on. The others shivered.\n\nAs the day progressed it became more pleasant. Mist still hung all around us. It was strange having lessons in the unusual conditions.\n\nOnly at about 12 noon did the mist clear and the sun shone through. Even then the atmosphere was pleasantly cool.\n\nIt was a freak weather but it was enjoyable while it lasted. It gave me an idea of how it was like in a cold country.

He shouts with such gusto and pleasure. I always laugh when I see him at it.\nThen there is this man in baggy snorts and Japanese slippers who rides his motorcycle with only the right side of his buttocks on the seat. The left side hangs out. This makes his motorcycle lean at an awkward angle as though he is about to fall, but he does not. Perhaps he has a large boil on the left side of his buttocks. Whatever the reason, I have seen him ride the way he does many times. He looks so funny, but dangerous.\n\nRunning a sundry shop near my house is a short and stout man whose body shape and movements resemble that of a penguin. I do not mean to be derogatory but he always reminds me of that bird. However he runs his shop well and I get a lot of things from him.\n\nFinally there is a dandy who dresses in the most outrageous outfits I have ever seen. The colour combination he chooses for his clothes are, to say the least, horrible. Only he dares to wear a purple shirt with green trousers and a pink tie. Often I see running around on his motorcycle wearing those loud clothes. He works as a salesman for some company. Perhaps those clothes help him to get, or maybe shock, customers."

Some are large while some are tiny, but they have one thing in common -- they bite. So we use mosquito repellents, coils, nets and sprays to keep them at bay, but somehow they still manage to get past our defenses.\nI am very sensitive to mosquito-bites, so I sleep under a mosquito-net. Some people seem quite unaware of their presence and do not seem to know that they have been bitten. Well, these are lucky people until they come down with malaria or dengue-fever.\n\nAnother persistent pest is the common rat. These animals are very active during the night, looking for food everywhere. They eat anything, even soap. So any food left uncovered overnight is likely to be contaminated by these pests. Furthermore rats make nests in nooks and corners of the house. They nibble into floorboards, ceilings and even electrical wiring. They are really a big nuisance.\n\nCockroaches too are pests. They have the habit of crawling all over the place. Sometimes they even crawl onto one's body. These dirty little creatures contaminate food too. They also emit a strong stench. It is never pleasant to encounter them.\n\nThere are other pests like flies, ants, moths and assorted bugs. It would be nice it we can get rid of them but it is obvious we cannot. They are here to stay. The only effective way to minimize them is to keep the house clean. In this way they have less places to breed and less food to eat.

Each of us contributed a small sum of money to buy cakes, drinks and other titbits. On that day we arranged the chairs and desks so that they surrounded an empty space in the middle of the classroom.\n\nSo began a round of eating, drinking and playing games with the teachers. Most of the teachers were very sporting and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It was so different from having lessons.\n\nThe other classes gave parties too. So the teachers had to move from class to class and participate in the fun. I would think that this was quite tiring on the part of the teachers but they managed it. After all it was their day to enjoy and have fun.\n\nOne class even gave a short play for their teachers. I did not get to watch it as I was busy tidying up the classroom after the party.\n\nAll in all it was a great day. The whole school was immersed in an atmosphere of gaiety.

The sound is so sweet and I just lie in bed listening to the songs until the bird flies away.\n\nAll through the day I see various birds come and perch on the trees and plants. Some come to sing or rest a bit. Others come to look for food. So it is always a pleasure to see them. I just sit quietly and they go about their business undisturbed. I have seen the oriole, spotted-dove, pigeon, yellow-vented bulbul, mynah, fan-tailed flycatcher and various other little birds which I cannot name. They sing, dance and display their beautiful colors. It is quite a treat. On the other hand there are those pesky little sparrows that come into the house to steal food.\n\nOne morning I saw a white-breasted water hen sunning itself just next to a mango tree. This normally shy bird must really be feeling the pinch of progress to take refuge in my garden. Sad to say, the surrounding area is being developed and the wildlife are being chased away or destroyed.\n\nSome people keep birds in cages to listen to their songs. I say it is far better for the birds to live freely. Then they sing, or not sing, their songs naturally. It is wonderful to see them fly freely among the trees. It is not so wonderful to see caged birds unable to move more than a foot in any direction."

I shouted \"Help! Help!\" with all my might. The dog looked confused but did not attack me.\n\nThe shopkeeper heard my shouts and came to investigate. The dog, which was obviously his, wagged its tail and folded back its ears. He quickly brought a chain and tied it to a post. I was so relieved.

He puts the food into his mouth as fast as he can, chews a couple of times and then swallows. It does not matter whether he is using a spoon, chopsticks or his hands. He is skilled with all. After finishing, he sits up, gives a couple of burps and rubs his belly. It is all very disgusting, but at the same time it is very amusing.\n\nAnother friend of mine, a thin one this time, hardly, eats at all.

The sounds echoed all over, making the jungle feel eerie and strange.\n\nI had no idea how Rahim could find a way through the bushes and trees. He said he was just following a path used by the aborigines. As far as I was concerned, I could not see any path. I realised then how easily an inexperienced person could get lost and perish in the jungle.\n\nNevertheless I followed Rahim as we trudged along slowly. The most uncomfortable thing about being in the jungle were the leeches. These little bloodsuckers never gave up. Despite thick boots and clothes, they still managed to bite me.\n\nFor the first time in my life I saw strange birds, insects, huge spiders, snakes, trees, flowers, vines as thick as a man's hand and various animals. The experience was unforgettable. I was awestruck by the might of nature.\n\nWhen we emerged from the jungle I felt as though a great weight had been lifted from me. The clear blue sky was a welcome sight. Outside, the world was definitely easier to cope with. The jungle made me feel hemmed in and helpless. It was a good experience but I would prefer to remain outside it."

Rathi, the prettiest girl in class, played the role of the farmer's wife. So I felt a little elated about my role.\n\nWe spent a whole week rehearsing the play. Learning the lines by heart was tedious. The first rehearsal was a disaster as we fumbled our lines again and again. After half a dozen rehearsals we managed to get things right. It was all very tiring.\n\nThe script required me to climb up a mango tree to pluck some mangoes. Obviously we could not put a mango tree in the classroom. So we improvised by hanging a mango by a string from the ceiling with a ladder below it. Those were the props, placed right in front of the blackboard.\n\nFinally the day of the play came. I went on stage, rather, in front of the classroom, with my fellow actors and actresses and performed our parts. Everything went smoothly. We never got stage-fright, thanks to our rehearsals and familiar audience of fifteen children. About half the class were the performers, the rest audience.\n\nNow, a few years later, I cannot remember a single line of the play. The only thing I remember clearly is that I enjoyed eating the mango during the play."

I really looked funny with a crew cut but I was forced to have my hair cut that way. It was my foolishness and my cousin's fault that it happened. Here is how it happened. The monthly ritual of visiting the barber to get my hair cut was tedious. Long hair was like a sin and mine was beginning to cover my ears. My cousin reckoned that he could save me some money if I let him cut my hair. He assured me that he knew how to do it properly. So foolishly I allowed him to use a pair of scissors on my hair. After five minutes of his handiwork, one look in the mirror told me that it was a disaster. His scissors had created havoc on my beautiful hair! I protested but he assured me that he had not finished and the finished product would be great. It became even worse. The cut was so uneven and haphazard that I had no choice but to visit a real barber to correct the damage. The barber laughed and said that the only remedy was a crew cut. So I reluctantly agreed to it. The final result was that my hair looked and felt like bristles, being only two or three millimetres long. At least it looked better than the mess my cousin made. I found that a crew cut was not too bad after all. I did not have to comb my hair and my head felt much cooler. As for the laughter and comments, they stopped after a while."

The ground floor was bright and lively.\nWe were at the foyer of the huge shopping complex. There were many people there. I could see a goldsmith's shop, two music shops, a pharmacy, two book stalls, a video shop, an optician's shop and a large super- market.\n\nTwo very old guards sat in front of the goldsmith's shop. They were nodding off. I wondered if they could cope if robbers were to come to the shop. It did not look like they could.\n\nA \"cheap sale\" of clothes was going on in the middle of the foyer. The crowd there was so thick that it was impossible to get near the clothes. We walked past the mad crowd and into the supermarket.\n\nThere were rows and rows of goods in the supermarket. We picked out the things we wanted and put them in a trolley. When we had finished I pushed the trolley to the check-out counter where my mother paid for the things we took. Fortunately there were few people in the supermarket. The cheap sale had attracted the crowd. So it did not take us long to buy what we came for.\n\nWe came out of the supermarket and passed the mad crowd. I noticed that one of the old guards at the goldsmith's was actually snoring! Anyhow we proceeded to the lift and left the shopping complex."

So I ran with all my might.\n\nAlas, I ran too fast for my legs to keep up. One moment I was running, the next I fell sprawling onto the tarmac road. The shock was horrible as I scraped along the hard surface of the road.\n\nThe pain was intense as I lay on the road writhing. My hands, legs and face were bleeding from the many parts where my skin had been scraped off. When my friends came to help me they were horrified to see me in such a bloody mess.\n\nAnyhow they summoned help and I was taken to the hospital. There they cleaned and dressed my wounds.

After that I had my bath and dinner. After dinner I watched television until it was time for bed.\n\nI got up late too on Sunday morning. For breakfast I had cornflakes with milk while listening to the radio. Then I spent the rest of the morning doing homework.\n\nAgain I took a nap after lunch. Then I finished up my homework.\n\nBy the time I was done with the homework it was already evening. So I took a stroll around the neighborhood. It was a great feeling to be able to relax after all the homework had been done.\n\nAfter dinner, I packed my books in my bag and went to bed early. I had to get enough sleep otherwise I would fall asleep in school the next day. Thus ended yet another weekend."

Over in a corner lay a heap of broken desks and chairs, the result of his handiwork. He had been caned twice in front of the whole school for his misdeeds but he remained unrepentant. I was sure that he would be sacked from school if he carried on like that.\n\nOne day Ah Keong's mother died. For a whole week he was absent from school. When he returned he was totally changed. I nearly did not recognize him. For a moment I thought we had a new classmate, but it was Ah Keong all right, well-groomed and neatly-dressed.\n\nNot only had his appearance change. His behavior also changed dramatically. He became the most well-behaved boy in class. No longer did he break chairs or anything else. The teachers and prefects were visibly shocked, but they were glad for it.\n\nIt was a miracle that Ah Keong turned over a new leaf. One day he confided to me that it was his mother's death that changed him. He realized how horrible he had been just before his mother died.

It was impossible to look at all of them. So I spent my time browsing mainly among the books on wildlife and nature, my favorite.\n\nAs much as the books were wonderful, the price was discouraging. I could not afford to buy any of them. I would have to ask my mother to buy one for me later on.\n\nTime flew. Two hours seemed like two minutes. Soon our teacher told us to assemble at the front door. There she helped those buying books pay at the counter at a special discount. Not many of us bought books. They were too expensive. I did not buy any.\n\nAfter paying for the books we lined up and marched back in pairs to school."

Lights, fans, radios and other appliances are kept on even when no one is using them. I make it a point to switch them off when I do not need them. It takes less than a second to throw a switch but to some people even this seems a difficult task. Anyhow, not wasting electricity reduces the bill appreciably. Thus we do not have to pay for the electricity we do not use.\n\nThe other wasted commodity is water. Leaky pipes and faucets plus the negligence of leaving taps running all contribute to this wastage. Fresh water is precious, so it is not to be wasted. It is only a simple matter of shutting off a tap after use. I make sure I do this.\n\nAnother big wastage is food. My mother used to cook so much food that much of it was simply thrown away. She knows better now. I pointed out to her about how we wasted food. She realised it and now cooks only what we can eat. The garbage bin used to be filled with half-eaten cakes, fried chicken and things we thought we could eat but could not. It is not so anymore. Besides, we do not waste money on food we throw away.\n\nWe waste other things like tissue paper, clothes, soap, talcum powder and aerosol sprays. All these cost money. In short, we waste the money we work so hard to earn.\n\nIt is definitely better not to be wasteful. I discover there is a simple method of not wasting things, which is -- use only what we need. Do not touch what we do not need. In this way we can stop being wasteful."

It is simply great fun.\nWe used to do this with two old toy rackets. Since then our father had bought us two real, although cheap, rackets. I must say we enjoy the game even more. Sometimes even my mother comes to join in the fun when she has the time for it.\n\nThe other game I like to play is table tennis. We have an old table, two bats and some balls. So on some days we play table tennis instead. This is a game that requires more skill. We cannot even hit the ball onto the table half of the time. This can be frustrating. So we go back to badminton which is far easier and more fun.\n\nSince we play outdoors we are at the mercy of the weather. We often have to pause when the wind is too strong. It is difficult to hit the shuttlecock properly when the wind blows it away. Sometimes it rains, making it impossible to play.\n\nI do play other games in school like basketball and football.

        "content": "Teenagers today must be ever vigilant to the many distractions and dangers that surround them. Knowing what these pitfalls are will help teenagers avoid trouble and have a happier teenagehood.\nFirst on the list are those distractions that take them away from their studies. Students owe it to themselves and their parents to put in their best efforts in their studies. At all times therefore, teenagers must make it a point to be conscious of the fact that their studies ought to come first. This strategy will help them get their priorities right. Complete that piece of homework or revise those chapters for the examination before you decide to hang out with your friends. Studies must come first.\n\nNext, let's talk about parents. Parents are wonderful people. They always have the best interests of their children at heart and they will do anything to prevent their children from getting hurt. However, teenagers often think that parents do not understand them and they are unable to communicate with their parents. So these teenagers are rude to their parents and become utterly selfish at times. If teenagers are a bit more appreciative of their parents and try and put themselves in the shoes of their parents, they will then be able to know how their parents think and feel - of their fears and dreams for their children.\n\nNow let's turn to the topic of friends. Friends are wonderful to have. Good friends are always there for you, just like parents. But there are friends you who may turn out to be bad influences and can lead you astray. Then there are friends who can inspire you and propel you to achieve great heights. So how do you distinguish the good from the bad ? In this respect, young people must learn to think for themselves. Reflect constantly on events, people and ideas. Learn to see through people. Hold on to sound moral values and principles. These will definitely help you discriminate the good from the 'bad'.\n\nBeing a teenager is not an easy thing. This is the time when there are many temptations and when you grow as a person. Therefore, sticking to the three points mentioned above would make life easier for you. First of all, concentrate on your studies because this will determine your future. Secondly, understand that your parents want the best for you. Lastly, choose your friends wisely."

        "content": "\"Studying smart\" is a phrase often used by students, parents and teachers to mean \"studying in an intelligent and effective way\"\n\nNot all methods of studying are intelligent or effective. For example, a person who does not pay attention in class or who does not do his homework on time is certainly not intelligent. He will not learn effectively and his grades will suffer. The result of this is that he will not be able to keep up with his peers. Even if he goes for private tuition he will be always trying to catch up, if he ever does at all.\n\nSo the first thing about studying smart is to pay fullest attention when a lesson is first being taught in class. Your learning will be quick and effective. Ask questions if there is anything that you do not understand. The teacher will be pleased to help. Do your homework and assignment on time and you will never have a backlog of work. You are ever ready for the next lesson.\n\nFurthermore, being up to date with your school work means you do not have to take private tuition on any subject. this saves money and you will have time for leisure or recreation.\n\nRevision books and guides are aplenty these days. Use them with care. Having more than one revision book per subject is waste of money. Also learning from too many books only serves to confuse you and take up precious time.\n\nFinally, know the format of the examinations and practice the previous years' questions to familiarize yourself with them. When the actual examinations come, you will know how to handle the questions."

His waist-length hair is matted and coiled. He wears what's left of a T-shirt, frayed and with many holes. One can only guess what the T-shirt's original color was. Now it is simply dirty brown. It is the same with his shorts.\n\nHe is a dark-skinned fellow but the filth on his body makes him look much darker. Combined with his clothes, he is just a walking piece of grime and filth. People give him a wide berth wherever he goes.\n\nWhile his appearance is bad, the body odor is worse. The stink becomes noticeable from about two meters. Anything closer than that will nicely fit the phrase \"stinks to high heaven\". For one thing, he will never ever find people crowding around him. He will have maple personal space wherever he goes. Nonetheless he does not get to go into buses, shops or public places where people gather. He gets shooed away, for obvious reasons.\n\nDespite his unpleasant appearance and smell, he is a pretty harmless fellow. He goes 'happily' walking around town every day. Blazing sun or driving rain does not seem to bother him. He could be dry as a bone on one day and wet as a drowned rat on another. A normal person would have suffered a heat stroke or caught pneumonia, but this madman seems immune to normal afflictions. Rain or shine, he can be seen walking on the streets, muttering to himself or taking with some invisible person.\n\nI suppose it would be a matter of time before the authorities round him up put him away somewhere.

Other types of publications include encyclopaedias, maps, novels, greeting cards, magazines and children's books.

No wonder there were so many people. Slowly I inched my way into the crowd to look at the items.\n\nAfter looking though the items, I purchased a CD entitled \"Our Solar System and Beyond\". It was a good buy.\n\nNext I moved on to less crowded areas and look at the books. There were many that I would love to get my hands on but alas my financial status did not allow it. So I browsed through as many as I could. In that way I happily whiled away a whole afternoon.\n\nTime passed quickly. My watch showed 5.00 p.m. and I had not even seen half of the exhibition. Anyhow I had to get home before my mother started wondering about me. I would have to come and visit the exhibition another day.

There are many vendors plying their wares at the night market, and it has become a regular thing for me to visit the night market.\n\nOne Thursday evening at about 7.00 p.m, my sister and I paid a visit to the night market. It was not completely dark yet but the vendors had already lit their portable fluorescent lamps. From a distance the lamps seemed to add brilliance to the living sea of human bodies that had congregated at the market.\n\nWe stepped into the market carefully as there were many people there. In fact, we had to be careful not to knock into the other shoppers. Our first stop was the food stalls. There were vendors selling cakes, biscuits, buns, dumplings, dim sum, noodles and many other local tidbits and delicacies. we bought some buns and dumplings for my parents and other siblings at home.\n\nWe then walked over to the fruit stall to buy some fruits. Next to the fruit stall, a medicine seller had set up shop and was talking himself hoarse extolling the efficacy of his medicine to half-interested shoppers. Poor man, if he went on like that, he might need the medicine himself, whatever it was good for.\n\nNext, we stopped and bought some vegetables at our regular vegetable stall. That was the last thing we needed to buy. As it was still only 7.30 p.m. we decided to walk around a bit and look at the things on sale.\n\nThere were people selling toys, pirated video CDs, clothes, belts, books, posters, mobile phone casings, balloons, crockery and all sorts of goods. Business seemed to be good for most of the vendors. There was no shortage of buyers. Everyone seemed to have something to sell or to buy. The sight, sound and smell of the market were really quite intense. So after spending another ten minutes or so in the market, I yearned for the peace and quiet of home. So I motioned to my sister to go home.\n\nTogether we walked carefully out of the night market and headed home."

        "content": "I first saw her standing by the roadside. For a moment she looked like a normal old lady wanting to cross the road. Then I noticed that she was hesitant about crossing even when the road was clear.\n\nQuickly I walked over to her and offered my hand. She took it. But as I tried to lead her across the road, she resisted and said, in English, \"I want to go to church.\"\n\nWell, I had assumed wrongly she wanted to cross the road whereas she wanted to go to a church on this side of the road. Still, why was she standing by the roadside appearing to want to cross ? I looked in the direction of the church and saw her problem.\n\nBetween us and the church's entrance was a kerb meant for pedestrians to walk on, but inconsiderate people had parked their motorcycles on the kerb making it impossible for anyone to walk on it. She was forced to walk along the road, and she did not seem to be able to cope properly.\n\nShe was at least seventy and showed signs of geriatric degeneration. Her steps were small and uncertain. She should not be out on her own. Anyhow I led her by the hand step by step along the road towards the church. On the way I suggested she get a walking stick. She replied that she already had one given to her by her daughter. She said that she was just too shy to use it in public. I would never have guessed that an old person could be shy, but I guess they are still human, despite their age.\n\nThe reason for her to go to church was to attend a function that was being held there that evening. It took about three minutes for us to walk the thirty or so meters to the entrance. There one of her church members recognized her and came over to greet her. The old lady thanked me for helping her.\n\nI nodded my head, released my hold on her hand and headed off to where I was going originally before I encountered her."

        "content": "There is no mistaking the sound of the approaching garbage truck that comes thrice weekly to collect the garbage from the houses in our area. The roar of the diesel engine compounded by the puffing sound of black smoke from a broken exhaust pipe is a clear signal for residents to bring out their garbage. Furthermore, the local dogs add to the din with their confounded barking each time the truck comes.\nThe yellow garbage truck comes almost half-loaded with garbage already collected. I remember that it was new about a year ago but constant usage makes it look old and filthy. I guess it cannot help but be filthy for all the garbage it holds. The yellow paint is now a dirty brown. Five men are perched on its side.\n\nThe truck stops near my house. The men alight and go about collecting the garbage bags from the houses. They dump the bags into the back of the truck. The driver then operates the device that compresses the garbage deep into the middle of the truck. It is a wonder how much garbage the truck can hold.\n\nWhen the garbage is being compressed, foul-smelling liquid leaks onto the road as a result. This is a small inconvenience that we have to put up with. Anyhow the garbage is compressed within a minute. The men hop on the truck and off they go to another part of the housing estate to continue their garbage collection.\n\nIt is a small but important event in our lives every time the garbage truck comes because it takes away the garbage that would otherwise clutter up our living space. There were occasions when the truck did not show up as usual and we know how bad things can get. Bins overflow and the foul stench of rotting garbage is quite unbearable. Dogs, crows and rats rummage through the rubbish and distributing it all over the neighborhood. The return of the garbage truck s like heaven sent. We breathe a sigh of relief when it comes.\n\nStinking and dirty it might be, but the garbage struck is a very necessary part of our lives."

Cathy, Shelly and I intended to catch the 12.30 show.\n\nWe met at the entrance to the shopping center at about 11.30 a.m. The complex had opened about an hour and a half ago and already it was teeming with people. Most of them were youngsters like us. We were out in town to have some fun and enjoy the weekend.\n\nOn the ground floor was a huge stage that was being prepared for some charity show later on in the evening. Workers were busy decorating the backdrop and setting up the props for the occasion. Someone was testing the public address system and the sound coming from the giant speakers was very loud. So we moved away from the stage and rode the escalators up to the top floor where the Cineplex was.\n\nA long queue had already formed in front of the box office. Cathy volunteered to get the tickets. Shelly and I agreed and we gave her our money. So while Cathy joined the queue, Shelly and I went over to the food stalls and bought some popcorn and drinks.\n\nThe crowd on the top floor swelled and the queue grew longer. we were glad that we were early. Judging by the length of the queue, there was a possibility that some of them were not going to get tickets.\n\nCathy still had some people in front of her, so we decided to visit the shops nearby. We wandered into a bookshop. The shop was having a sale and many items were offered at 20 to 70% discount. I looked at some novels but decided I could not afford any of them despite the discount. Shelly picked up some stationery but decided to put them back when she saw the long queue at the checkout. The movie was going to start soon and there would not be enough time to pay for the stationery.\n\nWe left the bookshop. It was already 12.25. So we walked to the entrance of the Cineplex. Cathy was already there with the tickets.\n\nWe gave the tickets to the usher at the entrance. With popcorn and drinks in our hands, we walked into the Cineplex to watch the movie."

        "content": "To date, only some astronauts have been to the moon. Certainly I would like to spend some time on the moon, but that seems to be impossible for the moment. Anyhow, based on what I have read about the moon, I can imagine what it is like to be on it.\nThere is no air on the moon. The implications are obvious. I will always nee to wear a spacesuit that has its own air supply. Never will I be able to walk around in T-shirt, shorts and sandals. Without a spacesuit, my eyeballs and other organs will possibly explode because there is no atmospheric pressure to help maintain their size and shape.\n\nSecondly, there is no water on the moon. So there are no rivers, seas, ponds, rain, snow, clouds, thunder or lightning. The moon is a pretty desolate and silent place. In fact, it is lifeless as no living organism as we know it can survive there. So there will not be any other animal or vegetation on the moon, just rocks an sand.\n\nAnother consequence of the absence of air and water on the surface of the moon is that the sky will always appear black. There are no clouds and air to produce the effect of a blue sky that we so familiar with on earth.\n\nThe force of gravity on the surface of the moon is about one-sixth of that on the surface of the earth. This means that I will only weigh one-sixth of what I weigh on earth. Thus I should be able to jump much higher and further than on earth. I can imagine breaking the world's high-jump and long-jump records with every step I take. As gravity is low, movement will occur in actual slow-motion.\n\nIt would certainly be quite an experience to be on the moon. Things are quite different compared to those on earth. still I think I prefer things here on earth where my body is made for. I don't want to be wearing an oversized spacesuit and living in contained quarters indefinitely. It is far better back on earth where I am bale to run free on the beach, take a dip in the sea or simply lie back on the cool grass and look at the moon."

We expected the place to be packed with people but what greeted us at the shop was beyond expectation.\nThe twenty or so tables in the shop were fully occupied. There were at least a hundred people crammed in the shop and the sound of a hundred voices talking at the same time was reminiscent of the market place. The place had air-conditioning but it was obviously not strong enough to cope with the crowd there. I saw some diners wipe their faces with tissue paper as the hot food caused them to sweat. We waited outside the shop in the midday heat and sweated as well.\n\nIt took about fifteen minutes before we could get a vacant table. it was a small table placed against a wall but it was better than nothing. Gratefully we sat down but had to wait again for a waitress to take our order.\n\nThe shop was clearly short-staffed. They had only three waitresses. But I could understand that it was their opening day and they had not expected such a crowd. The waitresses could hardly cope. So we sat down for another five minutes before a waitress came to take our order. Then we waited for the food to be brought.\n\nAnyhow there we were, sitting in a noisy, not-so-cool, air-conditioned chicken-rice shop. It was not exactly an ideal place to have lunch but we just wanted to try the food.\n\nEventually our order arrived and we set about having our meal. The chicken rice was only average. We had expected it to be something special after reading about the 'special chicken rice' in the newspaper. It was not excellent, but it was not bad either. Certainly it was nothing special. So we quickly finished our meal, paid for it and left the shop.\n\nAt the entrance there were still people waiting to have a taste of the 'special' chicken rice. Well, we have had our taste and they would have theirs in due course."

Regular exercise will not only keep your body trim and fit but it will also reduce your risk of developing heart disease and diabetes. Exercising on a daily basis for at least 30 minutes per day will do wonders for your health.\n\nYou should sleep for about 7 to 8 hours a day. Doing so will help your body to replenish itself. Lack of sleep will make you feel tired. It will also affect your concentration. Take part in recreational activities. There should be a balance between work or study and leisure. Remember, \"All work and no play makes lack a dull boy\".\n\nA the same time, keep away from unhealthy habits and activities. Stop smoking as it is harmful to health. Not only doe smoking cause life-threatening diseases like heart disease and lung cancer, it will also cause wrinkles and lead to premature aging.\n\nPeople who live a healthy lifestyle tend to be healthier, live longer and are happier.

The housing estate in which they lived in was relatively quiet and it was quite safe to ride their bicycles on the road, but as young boys go, they can tend to get a bit reckless sometimes, too reckless for their own good.\n\nThe residents of the area were usually careful when they drove their cars. Even so there were several near misses as the drivers had to avoid the reckless young children on their bicycles. The children had no knowledge of traffic rules and they did pretty much as they pleased. Their parents never educated them about road safety. In effect, the young cyclists were just accidents waiting to happen. It was just a mater of time before something tragic happened.\n\nOne evening as a group of five children was tearing down a road on their bicycles, a van suddenly shot out of a side road right in their path. The driver was obviously a stranger to the area and did not see the danger until it was too late. He braked hard and swerved his van in an attempt to avoid hitting the young cyclists. Tried as he did, he could not avoid hitting the leading cyclist. The front end of the van collided with the young cyclist with a sickening crunch. The boy was flung onto the road.\n\nThe van stopped and the driver opened the door, but he did not get out. Instead he closed the door, reversed his van from the fallen boy and the wrecked bicycle, engaged a forward gear and sped off. He did not want to hang around to deal with the angry residents knowing full well that he might be bashed up or perhaps even killed.\n\nIt was just as well that he fled for soon the residents ran out of their houses and onto the scene of the accident. the boy was still alive. One of the men lifted him up, put him into a neighbor's car and took him to the hospital.\n\nFor more than an hour after the accident the angry residents milled around the area uttering curses. However nobody had noted down the number of the van. All they knew was that it was driven by a young man, nothing more. To this day the identity of the hit-and-run van is unknown. The accident victim is alive but walks with a limp. Although the incident was not a pleasant one, it at least has a positive effect. The young cyclists do not ride recklessly around anymore. Their parents do not want a repeat of the accident."

It does so by killing or damaging cells of the body's immune system.\n\nIn the early stages, HIV infection may have no symptoms or just symptoms of a flu-like illness. However as the disease progresses, the symptoms become progressively more severe. This may take several years to manifest.\n\nAIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is the advanced stage of HIV infection. The body's immune system has been largely destroyed and it is susceptible to many life-threatening diseases and certain cancers.\n\nHIV infection reached world wide epidemic proportions since emerging in the 1980s. Transmission is mostly done through unprotected sex, the sharing of syringes or needles, and from infected mother to baby during pregnancy or birth. However there is no evidence that the infection can be spread through saliva or casual contact.\n\nIn the final stages of disease where the body has practically no immune system, all sorts of opportunistic infection can affect the body. The inevitable result of this is death.\n\nPrecautions that can be taken to prevent HIV infection include having no unprotected sex especially with someone you do not know well even if he or she shows no symptoms of infection. Also do not share or repeat the use of needles and syringes. The best thing to do is to not to have multiple sex partners and not to take drugs. AIDS is a killer.

Going to town on weekends or holidays is never enjoyable because of the perpetual traffic jams that choke the streets.\n\nThe inability to move freely is already bad. To make things worse, there are irresponsible or poor drivers who cut across lanes without signaling, stop suddenly or generally do not seem to be aware of the danger they cause to others or to themselves. Then there are idiots who talk on the mobile phones while driving, or kids who stick their heads out of the window, kids who sit on their daddy's lap, and one day I saw a man  actually shaving in his car while we crawled along !\n\nThe top offenders are definitely the motorcyclists who weave in and out of traffic without a care for their own safety. No wonder they top the list of road fatalities.\n\nFinally reaching our destination brings no joy either because usually there is no place to park. So when we go to town, we go in pairs, one to drive and the other to get down to do whatever is necessary. Otherwise we stay home and avoid the irritation.\n\nThe second most irritating thing is inconsiderate people. Examples are people who throw rubbish on sidewalks, roads and out of moving cars. Out of sight and out of mind for them, but how about others who have to put up with the rubbish or clean it up ? Sadly the worst offenders are occupants of luxury cars. God knows what is behind the tinted windows, probably some spoiled brat and their indulgent parent.\n\nMobile phones ringing in public places are also very irritating, especially when the owner suddenly become oblivious to their surroundings when they answer the call. More than once I have been bumped into by phone-wielding buffoons who seemed to have become temporarily blind. And they don't even apologize.\n\nAs the world's population grow and grow, it is inevitable that irritations will also grow as we fight for living space. There is really no permanent solution, only a temporary one and that is to keep way from the sources of irritation as much as possible."

A one-ton truck carrying the troupe arrived at the premises at 9:30 a.m. The troupe had two lions, one red and the other yellow. The performers were young men and boys from a local Chinese association.\n\nquickly the performers donned the lion costumes. Each lion costume had two performers inside it. The big drum rolled and the cymbals clanged. The lions started dancing to the pulsating beat. They performers were very skilful as they pranced around in mock combat. The thunderous beat of the drum soon attracted a sizable audience in front of the shop.\n\nThe dance went on for about ten minutes as the drum kept the tempo going. The performers must be really fit to keep the action going at the frantic pace.\n\nMy friend had hung two red packets at a height of about three meters above the door of his shop. These red packets were prizes for the lions. They will have to reach up and take the packets. So after the round of dancing, the red lion reached up to take one of the packets. this was accomplished by having the front performer stand on the shoulders of the back performer. It was by no means an easy feat, but they performed well in getting a red packet. In similar fashion the yellow lion reached up and took the second red packet.\n\nAfter claiming their prizes, the two lions stage a final round of dancing. When the dance concluded, the spectators gave them a hearty round of applause. It was a fine performance.\n\nThe members of the troupe then had snacks and drinks that were prepared for them.

It was definitely not good for us to breathe it in.\n\nThe men went from house to house fogging the compound and the inside of each house. As all the occupants had to come out, some elderly residents were helped out by younger ones. So for about half an hour, all the residents in our neighborhood stood or sat outside while they watch the men fog their houses.

He imagined that he was the best driver around and he was immune to accidents.\n\nOne day he overtook a tanker but got too close to it. The rear end of his car touched the tanker and his car was sent somersaulting into the crash barrier in the middle of the expressway. Aaron's car was a complete wreck but miraculously he survived the horrendous accident.\n\nThey took him to hospital where the doctors treated him for cuts and bruises. There was one thing they could do nothing about. His spine was broken and he was paralysed from the chest down.\n\nThe accident marked a major turning point in Aaron's life. From then on he could no longer run around as he pleased. He had to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. He had to sit still whether he liked it or not.\n\nThe first three months of his new enforced living was the hardest to bear. He sank to the depths of depression. Everything has changed. He lost his job, his car and the life that he was used to. He ahd to face up to reality and adjust his life accordingly. It was not going to be easy but he had no choice. He had to get out of his self-pity and take whatever action to make his life worth living again."

We need energy for transport, industry, lighting, warmth, cooking etc. Without sufficient energy, the airplanes will stop flying, industry will grind to a halt, cities will be plunged into darkness -- in short -- the world as we know it will cease to exist.\nThere are many types of energy sources. Our ancestors used wood and other combustible material for burning in order to generate heat and light. Today we make use of fossil fuel and we harness solar, wind, water, chemical and nuclear energy for powering the many devices that we have invented.\n\nMost of these energy sources are non-renewable, that is, they become depleted in time. An example is fossil fuel. Its supply is limited and it is a matter of time before it runs out. An example of a renewable energy source is wood. Trees can be grown but the process takes a long time.\n\nThe use of some of these energy sources causes pollution. The burning of wood and fossil fuel produces smoke and other gases. Harnessing energy from nuclear fission produces dangerous by-products that are difficult to manage. By contrast, hydroelectric power, solar energy and wind energy are examples of non-polluting energy sources.\n\nAs the population of the world keeps increasing, there is an urgent need to find and use more renewable and non-polluting energy sources."

Nuclear energy has enormous potential as an energy source. There is almost limitless supply of energy. However, radioactive by-products and waste post serious health and environmental risks.\n\nThe atomic or nuclear bomb is the uncontrolled release of nuclear energy. The tremendous power and deadliness of this is evident when Hiroshima and Nagasaki was destroyed by atomic bombs at the end of World War II in 1945. The devastation was enormous, nothing like what human beings had seen before. it is not something to be repeated. Even so, the major powers of the world now possess enough atomic bombs to wipe out the entire population of the world. It is a chilling thought that human beings are now able to wipe themselves out. We can only hope that they have the sense not to.\n\nIn a nuclear reactor, the release of nuclear energy is controlled. This energy is used for various purposes such as for generating electricity and driving submarines. However, the reactor has to be maintained carefully. An accident is potentially disastrous. The leakage of radioactive substances can cause death to living things and pollution of the environment, such as that which occurred at Chernobyl.\n\nAs it is now, nuclear energy bolds enormous potential as an energy source but it is not totally safe to use. Perhaps one day, with more research and knowledge, human beings will learn how to harness nuclear energy safely."

The show was held at the foyer of their complex building.\nDisabled and underprivileged children from several homes in town were ferried to the complex where they were seated in chairs in front of the stage that was decorated for the occasion. Also present were some local dignitaries, parents and members of the public.\n\nAt 8:30 p., the concert kicked off with a rousing dance routine by members of a dancing school. These young dancers danced and pranced with such skills and coordination that left the audience wanting for more. At the end of the dance, the thunderous applause from the audience showed how much they appreciated the performance.\n\nBy then the foyer was filled to capacity. Shoppers and visitors stopped to watch the show.\n\nNext were songs by some local singes and members of church groups. they performed remarkably well and got the audience, especially the young children, to sing along with them. The spirit of Christmas was well and alive a the show.\n\nAs in all Christmas celebrations, Santa Claus made his appearance. Few people would have guessed that the jolly old gentleman was, in real life, the rotund complex manager Mr. Dennis Ong. He really played the part of Santa Claus well. Dressed in a red costume and sporting a huge cotton beard, he came on stage with sacks of toys and gifts, much to the delight of the little children who clapped their hands in appreciation.\n\nOne by one, the children were ushered onto the stage where they received a gift each from Santa. Two of the children were on wheelchairs but that did not deter them from joining in the fun and joy. As there were many gifts, Santa also invited young members of the public to go on stage to receive the gifts. Soon all the gifts were distributed.\n\nFinally all the performers cam eon stage to sing \"Silent Night\". Many members of the public sang along as well. It was a short but meaningful show. For the disabled and underprivileged children, it was indeed a happy occasion."

In such a company, sooner or later the youngster will be exposed to activities that are possibly unhealthy, unwholesome, antisocial, dishonest, illegal or even criminal. Once exposed, the negative effects can last a long time, perhaps for a lifetime.\nThe company you keep will determine largely what you do, how you think and where your life will proceed. In other words, keeping bad company will eventually ruin your life.\n\nBad company is not hard to spot. For example if your friends smoke, then chances are you will catch on. If they take alcohol or drugs, chances are you will be tempted to give them a try. One try leads to another and it will not be long before you are hooked. Alcoholism, lung diseases, AIDS or a miserable life may in store for you. So for your own wellbeing, it is better to avoid such friends. There is no need to make enemies of them. Just avoid them.\n\nIf you mix around with friends who vandalize public property, shop-life, scratch cars or extort money, then it is time to call it quits with them. Such behavior will lead to more serious offences and it is a matter of time when you are on the wrong side of the law. Get out quick before it it too late.\n\nMake friends with good and decent people. keep away from bad company."

        "content": "Neither a borrower nor a lender be -- so goes the famous saying from Shakespeare. How true it is. Being in debt is one of the heaviest burdens for anyone to carry. The borrower of money, no matter how small or large the amount, owes the lender. And until the debt is paid, the burden weighs down the borrower, sometimes terribly.\nWhen my father was young, he bought a house after he got married. He took a loan from the bank to pay for the house, and for the next thirty years, he had to work hard to repay the loan. There was a period when he was out of work, and our family had to dig deep into whatever savings we had to service the loan. Those were difficult days, and I could see my parents age visibly. My mother had to find work in a factory to help make ends meet. Anyhow the days are easier now with my eldest brother and sister working. My father says it will take another five years to repay the loan completely. What a relief that would be when the time comes.\n\nThere is an uncle of mine who is perpetually borrowing money from anyone who would lend him. It is not that he does not work, but somehow he misuses the money by spending it on unnecessary things. The terrible thing is that he almost never repays his debt. Our family has to bear the burden and this is really unpleasant.\n\nOnce he borrowed money from some moneylenders and missed out on the repayments. The loan sharks came looking for him and threatened his life. We again had to dig up whatever we can to pay these people off so as to prevent any serious thing from happening to him. We hope that he has learned his lesson. If this sort of thing should happen again, I doubt that anyone can help him out. He has practically exhausted what we have saved.\n\nDespite the problems of being in debt, borrowing and lending is still necessary in this world. Banks give loans to borrowers to set up their businesses or to buy houses and cars. The government and other bodies give loans to student to further their studies. Family members help one another out in times of financial need. So borrowing and lending is part and parcel of living. The important thing is to repay whatever that is borrowed. Only when repayment is done are the problems over. Certainly it is best not to be a borrower or a lender, but then who can be sure that they will not become one ?"

As he had found a place to park and the air had cooled down, he decided against getting out fo the car. His nephew knew where to find him.\n\nThe road that passed by the railway station was a busy one but there was a single lights-operated crossing that periodically turned green for about ten seconds for the pedestrians. As if by magic all vehicles stopped before the crossing every time this happened.\n\nPresently Samuel saw a blind man walking very slowly on the other side of the road. There was no one else on the other side. On reaching the traffic lights, the blind man stopped. It appeared that he wanted to cross. Samuel was curious to see how a blind man managed a crossing like this.\n\nThe lights turned green for the pedestrian and the vehicles stopped, but the blind man did not move. Ten seconds passed and the vehicles sped off again. Three times in a row the lights turned green for the blind man to cross but he did not. Obviously he was not going to make it on his own.\n\nSamuel got out of his car and crossed over to the other side of the road at the next change of lights. He asked the blind man whether he wanted to cross the road. The blind man nodded. So when the lights changed again, Samuel quickly helped the man cross the road. It took more than ten seconds but the waiting vehicles did not move until the duo had crossed safely.\n\nOnce across, Samuel asked the blind man where he wanted to go. The man said he wanted to go to the canteen. Canteen ? He must mean the canteen in the railway station. So Samuel took the man by the hand and led him to the canteen. On the way he met his nephew Tony. On seeing his uncle with the blind man, Tony offered to take over the task of leading the blind man.\n\nAt the canteen, the proprietor came out and took over. The blind man was one of his relatives. He thanked the helpful duo and led the blind man inside.\n\nHaving done what they could, Samuel and Tony headed towards their car. They were glad they could see. Being blind was certainly a big handicap."

        "content": "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.\n\nToday I want to talk about the importance of road safety.\n\nMany people think that accidents only happen to other people. They talk as though they are immune to it. But accidents can happen to anyone, and when it happens on the road, the consequences can be severe or even fatal. An experienced road-user has this to say. \"You may take a thousand risks and get away with it every time, but it takes only one accident, just one, to cause you injury or death.\"\n\nHow true this is. I once had a friend who was a daredevil motorcyclist on the road, risking his life and that of others with his reckless attitude. Well, he must have cheated death more than a thousand times but it took only one accident to end his life.\n\nMost accidents are caused by the errors of the road-users. Very infrequently does vehicle defect or mechanical failure cause an accident. Usually it is the person using the vehicle who is at fault. A person who is under the influence of alcohol or drugs is not fit to be using a vehicle because his or her judgment is compromised. The person may behave erratically or dangerously on the road and hence the increasing the chances of causing accidents. Many drivers involved in accidents tested positive for dugs or alcohol. So do not drive if you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and do not sit in a vehicle driven by such a person. Better still, keep away from drugs or alcohol. They are not of no benefit to you at all.\n\nKnow all traffic rules and obey them. If you see people speeding recklessly, jumping queues, jumping red lights, parking illegally etc., please do not follow their example, or try to teach them anything. Leave them alone or make a report to the police. Don't try to deal with them on your own because that would likely create conflict. There have been cases of driver bashing up others because of a misunderstanding. Don't become a victim of such  conflict. If you are involved in an accident, remain calm and don't argue with the other party. Just call the police and let them handle the situation.\n\nIn a more serious accident, injuries or death may have occurred. Again remain calm and call for assistance if you are able to. Otherwise wait for assistance to arrive.\n\nThe best policy however, is to avoid accidents, for in an accident, it does not really matter who is right or wrong. What matters is who is left.\n\nRead safety is your responsibility"

        "content": "Traffic lights are important components of the road systems of a town or city. Their importance becomes obvious when they stop working. When this happens, the junction at which they operate is then reduced to chaos as drivers curse and swear to try to get across.\nDespite their importance, some traffic lights, especially older ones, are not 'smart', meaning they turn n or off at fixed predetermined intervals regardless of whether it is midday or midnight. It is fine at midday when the roads are packed and waiting for one minute at a red light is normal. However waiting for one minute at a red light at midnight when here are no vehicles around seems like forever. One is tempted to beat the lights.\n\nFortunately in my town, the planners have installed 'smart' traffic lights that change their lights according to the absence or presence of cars near the junction. This works very well, especially in the night. One does not have to wait forever for the lights to change.\n\nThe 'smart' traffic lights have detectors buried just under the road just behind the line where vehicles stop at the lights. The detectors are hardly visible but if one is observant, one can see a rectangular box on the road about the same width and length of a car behind every line. Each detector can detect any vehicle that stops on top of or passes over it. When this happens, it indicates to the control box to change the lights to green as soon as possible. So the lights stay red or green according to the traffic volume registered by the detectors. It is pleasing to arrive at an empty junction to see the lights quickly change to green when one stops behind the line. One does not have to wait long.\n\nThe only setback to this system is that many drivers are not aware of the detectors. Some stop beyond the stop line or before it and wonder why the lights do not change to green for them. The detector did not register their presence so the lights do not change quickly.\n\nI suppose 'smart' traffic lights require smart drivers as well. My parents know the drill well. So we never have problems at the 'smart' traffic lights."

Even though they are merely pictures, the beauty is conveyed. How wonderful it would be if I could be there in person, seeing the mountains with my own eyes, and experiencing what it is like to be in such a wonderful place.\n\nIt was my uncle who actually stirred my interest about Switzerland. he goes there from time to time as part of his work. He told me about skiing on the mountain slopes and how exhilarating the experience is. You ride the ski chairlift from the bottom of the mountain to the top. At the top you look down at the bottom several hundred meters below, put on your skiing gear and off you go down the slope reaching up to 100 km per hour at certain stretches. With wind brushing against your face and snow spraying outwards from both your skis, the feeling is quite intoxicating. Certainly there is a danger of losing your balance and breaking a limb or two, but with proper training the danger is minimal. My uncle has fallen several times but never had any limb broken.\n\nI read up everything I could find about Switzerland, in books, magazines, brochures and the Internet. I found out that beautiful mountains and skiing are not the only things Switzerland has. It also has beautiful lakes, vineyards and centuries-old buildings that are untouched by the ravages of war. Switzerland has always been neutral and thus has been spared the horror that wasted most of Europe during the two World Wars.\n\nOther things that the Swiss are famous for are their high quality watches and their punctuality. I suppose these two go hand-in-hand. My uncle says their trains and buses are punctual to within a minute. Stand at the correct train platform at the right time and you can be sure that the train will arrive on time. This is something I have to experience for myself.\n\nIn time when I have the means, I will surely visit Switzerland and find out for myself all the wonders that the country has to offer."

As my favorite TV shows come on at specific times, I make sure that I finish my homework and chores well before the shows. Otherwise I will have to miss them. Mostly I manage to watch the shows but sometimes extra homework or chores may cause me to miss a show or two, but it is rare. Anyhow if I know that I am definitely not able to catch a show in time, I will just set the video recorder to tape the show so that I can watch it later.\n\nAnother thing that I do in my free time is potter around in the garden with my mother. She plants a fair bit of flowers and I enjoy helping her take care of them. It is a pleasure to feel the soil, prune the plants, remove the weeds and do the little things that help the plants grow better. It always fills me with wonder to watch seedlings germinate, sprout leaves and eventually grow to produce beautiful flowers.\n\nPottering around in the garden also taught me many things about the insects, butterflies, snails, caterpillars, centipedes, millipedes and other small creatures that inhabit the place. These creatures are mainly harmless and watching them go about their 'chores' always fascinates me.\n\nIn the evening when the weather is fine, i sometimes go for a stroll around the neighborhood with my friends. This is the time when most the neighbors have come home from work or school. We say hello to those whom we know. They are mostly friendly people and they acknowledge our greetings. Once in a while we come upon unfriendly neighbors but we just ignore them and carry on.\n\nIn the night, I usually do a bit of reading before going to bed. Books are like little treasure chests. A lot of information and knowledge are to be found in them and all it takes is a bit of time spent reading them. This is certainly a very beneficial way to spend my free time.

What more, there are a dozen other people rummaging through the garments as well. Worst still is that you have to buy two garments in order to qualify for the half price. In effect you end up buying something you are not particularly interested in.\n\nThe interior of shopping centers are usually attractively decorated and the air is cool. However as modern shopping centers are so huge, it would be an impossible task to visit even a fraction of them in one day. Furthermore, parking costs escalates the more time you spend in a shopping center. Time is money -- money flowing out your pocket the longer you leave your car in the car park.\n\nA great displeasure occurs when you want to get something but do not know where to get it. So you consult the map that they display in the premises. It takes time to go through the map and finally when you find the shop you want, you discover it is four floors from where you are. So you trudge along up the escalators until you reach the shop only to find that what they have is not exactly what you want.\n\nThe most displeasurable part of shopping is checking out. Often there are long queues of people all wanting to do the same thing. So you select what seems to be the fastest line only to find some idiot ahead is having problems with the cashier.\n\nFinally when all the shopping is done and you have got very good deals for the things you have purchased, you lug your heavy bags to the car and go home. That is not the end of the story though. On reaching home, another story begins. You will have to unpack the stuff you just bought. That is another displeasure and another story."

He is in his sixties now but still goes out to work wherever he finds it.\n\nHe is not tall but his limbs are exceptionally long and his hands and feet are exceptionally large. I suppose it is this combination that gives him exceptional strength for I have seen him carry two bags of cement, one in each hand, with apparent ease. A normal man would be struggling with just one bag. Often his workers would reap his wrath when they are unable to keep up with his work, or his strength. Four-letter words and the worst profanities under the sun would come out in torrents. The workers just keep quiet for none of them would dare to stand up to him.\n\nHow his wife and children tolerate him is a mystery to me. He and his wife lives together in the same house with his son and family. There are altogether six people in their three-room house that is just opposite mine. Frequently his harsh voice would come across as he chastises a family member, or the family dog. No one argues back. They know it is futile.\n\nMost mornings I see this grouchy man get into his beat-up old car on his way to work just as I go to school. Wishing him good morning is a waste of breath for he never answers. So I have given that up. It is better to leave him alone to scowl as much as he wants. Perhaps one day he will stop his grouchy ways, who knows."

Rick's is a whiz with mathematics and he helped me complete the homework in record time.\n\nAs it was getting towards dinner time, I decided to head on home about two kilometers away. Outside the house I could see thick black clouds and flashes of lightning in the eastern sky. There was huge storm going on there. So I got on my bicycle to get home before the storm struck us.\n\nRick's mother came out, saw the distant storm and told me not to cycle home. She said that she would send me home in her car. It was better not take the risk of riding the bicycle on the busy main road in the middle of a storm. It was dangerous. I declined her offer, thanked her and pedalled off before she could say any more.\n\nJust as I got on the main road, the storm struck. Raindrops came thick and fast. In seconds I was soaked to the skin. I looked for shelter but could see none. Fortunately my books were in a plastic bag and they should be fine. So I decided that since I was already soaking wet, I might as well go all the way home on my bicycle.\n\nThe road was fairly quiet as it was out of town. Some cars and lorries passed me kicking up spray. I could not get any wetter so I did not mind. I had only one thing on my mind and that was to get home.\n\nIt was foolish of me to do cycle under such dangerous conditions as visibility was very low. One moment I was going along quiet nicely, the next I found myself lying in a puddle of water beside the road. The road was covered with water and I did not even realized that I have left it and had fallen into a hole. Fortunately the hole was not very big but it was very wet. I picked myself and the bicycle up and groped in the pool for my books. No plastic bag would have saved the books. They were wet through and through. I should have listened to Rick's mother's advice. now I still have more than a kilometer to go in the rain. As it was dangerous to cycle, I pushed my bicycle all the way home."

So I figured that I would not have to wait long for my turn.\n\nSuddenly I heard someone shout behind me. instinctively I looked around and was shocked to see two gunmen brandishing handguns and telling everyone in the bank to get down on the floor. I obeyed quickly. I was too stunned to feel any fear. I just lay down on the floor like the other customers.\n\nI could not see anything except the floor tiles next to my face but I heard harsh voices shouting, the sound of someone being hit and some death threats being uttered. It sounded like the robbers would not hesitate to shoot anyone who did not comply.\n\nFrom the corner of my eye I caught the sight of a pair of moving boots. For the first time I felt fear. The boots must be that of one of the robbers ! Anyhow the boots disappeared from view for a moment, reappeared and then disappeared again. I heard the trampling of feet and I knew that the robbers were making their escape. It did not take them long to do their dirty business.\n\nI raised my head and had a momentary glimpse of two figures running out of the bank door. Another figure flashed past my view and I realized that it was a security guard. He was holding a pump gun in his hands ! I got up to have a better view.\n\nThe security guard ran out of the bank just as the robbers were making their getaway on a motorcycle. The motorcycle sped off just as the guard leveled his gun and fired at the fleeing duo.\n\nEven in the bank, the sound of the shot was deafening. From my position I saw the shot hit the pillion rider smack on his back. There was a spray of blood and the body went limp. As the motorcycle accelerated, the pillion rider was flung backwards onto the road in a lifeless heap.\n\nThe guard fired another shot at the remaining motorcyclist. The shot missed the target but shattered the back screen of a car nearby.\n\nBy then I was out of the bank watching the real-life action. So were other customers. It was just like in the movies except that it was for real. The guard ran up to the robber that he had shot and examined the slumped figure. There was no sign of life. The guard then picked up a bag that the robber had dropped. No doubt it contained the loot.\n\nI watched the scene until the police arrive about ten minutes later. After I went home as there was no point hanging around I could do my banking at another time."

He had bought 3,000 shares. Multiply that by $0.46 would net him a profit of $1,380. Wow again ! He had made that amount in just one day.\nThe share market had been bullish for several weeks now and many people like Paul was getting a piece of the action. Rumors were rife that shares would keep rising indefinitely. It was the chance of a lifetime to make some serious money. In order to buy more shares, Paul took out a loan of $200,000 from a bank using his retail business as collateral.\n\nFor the whole of the following week, Paul joined hundreds of speculators in the stock exchange, buying up shares that kept rising. Paul's wife warned him about the consequences of a fall in the share prices, but Paul was confident that he could make his bundle and get out before the prices dropped.\n\nPrices kept rising. Paul estimated his profits to be in the region of $300,000 already. if the trend continued, he would have half a million in two weeks and a million in a month. He was confident that he would be a millionaire in a month's time.\n\nTwo weeks later, indeed Paul's total shares were worth more than half a million dollars, and the share prices were still rising. His wife advised him to sell and take the profit, but he refused. Just two more weeks and he would be a millionaire, two more weeks !\n\nThe drop cam every suddenly one day. At first Paul thought it was just a temporary fluctuation in the share prices. He held firm, confident that the prices will rebound upwards. it did the following day and Paul regained confidence. Then the prices fell again, and again. In three days, he had lost all his profits plus part of his capital. If he sold then, he would have made a dreadful loss. No, he would hold on. the prices would rise again.\n\nOne month later, Paul had lost almost everything. Share prices had reached an all-time low. There was despair all round.\n\nIn his greed for riches, Paul lost all his savings and now owed the bank to the tune of $200,000. Fortunately he had his retail business to fall back on. He would have to work extra hard to pay off the bank.\n\nSome speculators were not so lucky. They were reduced to bankruptcy. Such is the price of greed."

        "content": "In the light of the explosion of human population on earth, population control is definitely necessary. From one and three quarters billion in 1900, the population of the earth has multiplied to more than six billion in 2000, and no end to this growth seems to be in sight.\n\nGo to any town or city today and there are the ubiquitous traffic jams, long queues and crowded shopping areas. In such a crowded environment, it is not surprising to hear of accidents, clashes and friction between people.\n\nOn the employment scene, jobs are harder and harder to come by. In the times of my grandfather, a person with a primary education can easily find work and earn a decent living. secondary and education is rare and anyone who can make it that far is looked up on as a great person. Today there are many unemployed university graduates. A person with just a primary education is practically unemployable, except for the most menial of tasks. The sheer number of people vying for limited jobs has created this difficult situation.\n\nMore people mean more need of everything -- more jobs, more houses, more cars, more road and more problems to be solved. The strain on the earth's resources is unprecedented. Land is cleared to build more houses for the masses. Jungles and forests disappear as human beings encroach into them. There is less and less space for natural fauna and flora. Many of them are driven into extinction.\n\nThe disappearance of our jungles, forests and other natural habitats causes a change in the global climatic conditions. Already there are signs of global warming and other drastic changes to he earth. natural disasters strike without warning as these changes occur.\n\nLiving on earth is now a struggle for all but the very rich. Everyone has to work just to get by, if they can find work at all. Those who cannot find decent work resort to other means, usually illegal. Crime, organized or otherwise, is a problem in all nations.\n\nThere is a dire need for the world's population to be controlled, or at least, maintained at a sustainable level. As it is, the population keeps increasing and no effective effort is done to control it. If this continues, the day will come when the old earth can no longer sustain the human population. This means that many or most will die, probably because of nuclear wars that would have broken out in our struggle to survive. Or perhaps, human begins would have learnt to control their population some future time and thus avert the possible annihilation of the human race. It is entirely up to us to determine our destiny."

        "content": "Computers play a huge role in the modern world. We can get an idea of how huge a role this is if we examine some of the things in the modern world that we rely on and mostly take for granted.\nTelecommunication, transport, banking and finance -- the most important features of the modern world -- are heavily dependent on computers in order to function. A computer failure in any of these areas can incapacitate it, and perhaps the other areas too. The consequences can be anything from inconvenience to disaster. You may have experience the inconvenience of being unable to withdraw money from a bank because its computer is 'down'. So you wait until they fix the computer and you can withdraw money again. What happens if the down time should last several days ? The inconvenience could turn to indignation for you and disaster some businesses.\n\nCan you imagine what can happen if crucial computers fail in the transport systems, for example, the airlines ? Flight schedules can be severely interrupted, passengers can miss flights or board the wrong ones, or worst of all, accidents can happen. Air-traffic controllers rely on computers to direct aircraft landing and taking off. In a busy airport, aircrafts take off and land within seconds of each other. This is clearly impossible without computers.\n\nAnother area in which computers are very important is telecommunication. Today we communicate with one another via the telephone, fax machine and the Internet. The ease and speed of communication is unprecedented in the history of mankind. All we need is to press some buttons or log on to the Internet and we get to communicate instantly with each other. Physical distance matters little. Satellites, fiber optics and other devices make sure that we can communicate from the comfort of our homes, anywhere in the world as long we have the equipment to do it.\n\nCertainly this is all fantastic, but what can happen if the computers stop working, even if it were to be for a short while. Have you ever felt the exasperation of being unable to ring your friend or retrieve an email ? We are literally plunged straight back to the days of our forefathers when messages took days and weeks to reach their destination.\n\nComputers are here to stay and their importance is undeniable. In fact, they are indispensable. More and more they become part of our lives. Without computers, living will be like a hundred years ago -- no email, no ATM machines, no credit cards, no Internet and no video games. For us in this modern world, that would be unimaginable."

        "content": "Today, many men, women and children are overweight. This is the direct consequence of our modern lifestyle where many physical chores and activities are taken over by machines and energy-saving devices. No longer do we have to chop firewood, fetch water from the well, wash clothes with our hands, or get on our hands and knees to scrub the floor. These are all taken care of by gas stoves, piped water, washing machines, vacuum cleaners etc.\nAlso we do not have to hunt for our dinner, toil in the field, or herd the sheep. Modern machines and farming methods have mostly replaced physical labor. So many of us, without the physical exertions that burn up energy and keep us lean, become overweight.\n\nAt first glance, overweight people may not appear to have any problem, but behind their chubby faces and pot-bellies, they are just medical time-bombs waiting to go off. An overweight person has increased risks of falling prey to hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, cancer and many other debilitating diseases. These potentially deadly conditions are in addition to the sheer weight that the person have to lug around every day, making it hard to walk for a distance, climb stairs, or even just to get up from a chair.\n\nI know some overweight people and very one of them already has some kind of physical or health problem. One of my classmates is grossly overweight. While we run and play in the field, he just sits under the tree because he cannot keep up with us. He gets breathless easily and has to rest. My overweight uncle spends most of his time in front of the idiot box munching yet another box of snacks. He is a real 'couch potato'. Already he ahs had a couple of toes amputated because of his diabetic condition. Yet he does not exercise or do something to reduce his weight.\n\nBuying clothes off the rack is also another problem for the overweight person. They usually have to have their clothes specially tailored. This incurs greater expenses. Furthermore the range of clothes they can choose from is limited to the skill of their tailor.\n\nBeing overweight is certainly no fun, and is definitely hazardous to health. Unless the person has some kind of illness that causes him or her to be overweight, it is possible to reduce one's weight with proper diet and exercises. It is better to keep within the normal range and stay healthy as much as possible. We do not need weight problems. Living is much more pleasant and enjoyable without them."

The inevitable result of this congestion is the increase in the number of road accidents. Every day many road users get injured or killed. The dangers on the road are many. It is wise to know what they are and how to avoid them.\nIn towns and cities where the congestion is the greatest, pedestrians are the ones with the highest risks. Flesh is no match against metal or plastic. To be hit by a vehicle almost certainly means injury, or death. Sow hen crossing the streets, it is always better to use the pedestrian crossings that are usually located at junctions, regardless of whether the crossings have light or not. Even so be sure to observe the vehicles on the road before crossing. There are some drivers who do not stop at pedestrian crossings. Cross only when you know it is safe to do so, not because the light is green for you. If there are overhead pedestrian bridges, better still. Use them even though it might be a bit inconvenient. It is better to be safe than sorry.\n\nDashing across the street anywhere you like is a dangerous act. You might get away with it a thousand times, but it takes only one accident to put you down, temporarily or permanently. The consequences are terrible, as accident victims will testify to.\n\n\"Speed kills\", as the warning signs on highways say. How true it is. Accidents occurring along the highways are frequently fatal. Sometimes entire families are wiped out in a single accident. The vehicles are reduced to unrecognizable mangled heaps of metal. It is common to read about how the fire department \"took an hour to remove the bodies from the wreckage\". Do not speed on the road. This is the lesson to be learned.\n\nDespite the horror, many road users have not learned the lesson. They continue to speed and behave recklessly. This is especially so with young motorcyclists. With their devil-may-care attitude and their illegal midnight races, they not only endanger themselves but other road users as well. You will be well-advised to stay clear of them.\n\nWhen on the road, know the dangers and avoid them. In the first instance, do not endanger other road users with irresponsible behavior such as jaywalking, using the mobile phone while driving and beating red lights. Irresponsible road users are the greatest danger on the road. Do not let yourself be one."

I would highly recommend that all of you read this book.\nFirst, the plot is very touching. A young girl of five was left with her gruff and friendless grandfather up in the Alps. However, there grew a bond between the two of them. Heidi loved running around in the mountains with her friend, Peter, the goatherd and the goats. Then one day, her aunt came back and forcibly took her back to the city to stay with the invalid daughter of a rich man. Heidi pined for her grandfather and home in the Alps.\n\nI also like the way the characters are drawn. I can feel Heidi's joy in running around the mountains and her sadness being confined in a huge house. The other major characters are Grandfather, Peter, Clara and Grandmother and Dete. The author describes each character so that you can picture them in your mind.\n\nDespite being intimidated by the strict and rigid housekeeper, Heidi manages to retain her own identity and beliefs. This is a major theme of the book.\n\nAnother theme is the generosity of Heidi as seen against the selfishness of her Aunt Dete as well as the housekeeper. The author's message is not to impose our ideas of what is proper or right on others.\n\nThough there seems to be a lot of emphasis on the importance of prayer, the story is fast-moving and you will get immersed in Heidi's activities and problems. The story is well written. Dialogue used is very effective. Johanna Spyri understands the world of the young and the elderly.\n\nFinally, this is one of the best novels I have read. I would recommend it to anyone of any age. Find out for yourself what happens to Heidi."

Moreover, before the morning is over, students are tired and drooping. How can any learning take place when we cannot even keep our eyes open?\n\nSecondly, teenagers who have insufficient sleep cannot do well at school. We all know that sleep is food for the brain. Teenagers need at least nine hours of sleep each night to function best. Being sleep-deprived, their brains cannot absorb information. They cannot solve problems. They are grouchy and grumpy. Traditionalists may say this is just an excuse. School has started at 7.30 a.m. since ages ago. Just go to bed earlier. However, sleep specialists have researched that hormonal changes in teenagers keep them awake until quite late. Biological sleep patterns shift later and later for adolescents. It is natural for them not to be able to sleep before 11.00 p.m.\n\nThirdly, many teenagers miss breakfast to get to school on time. We all know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and should not be missed. In addition, teenagers can have bonding time with parents if school starts later. They can take their time over breakfast with their parents. Many working parents come home late. By which time they are too tired to want to do more than have a meal and rest.\n\nIn conclusion, authorities should not be afraid to make changes.

Asraf is Azreen's friend and the Old Lady agrees to help him, although she is greatly misunderstood and mistreated. However, after a few days, Asraf's grandmother passed away.

Before she dies, she tells Azreen to remember all that she has taught her and learn to forgive. The Old Lady remains calm even though she is trapped under a beam and manages to still give Azreen some words of advice.\n\nAsraf later regrets his actions, which he knows are caused by grief, but it is too late. If Asraf had remained calm, then he would not have listened to the villagers who were frightened by old rumours. The villagers are quick to look on the negative side of things and accuse the Old Lady of wrongdoing. Asraf should have taken some time to think and remember the Old Lady's kindness instead of acting irrationally.\n\nThis event has shown me the importance of staying calm and being in control of our thoughts and actions so that we will not regret later."

Children need love and care for they are dependent on their parents during their growing years. They think that their parents will be there for them always and when parents go their different ways or newcomers come into the family, they feel let down and sad.\nRichard is quite devastated when his father dies and his mother marries the cold and harsh Reverend Coldstone who turns out to be mean and wicked to him. He feels left out while his sister tries to adjust to the new situation. He feels that he cannot do the same. He feels that his mother is also not there for him and so he runs away from home.\n\nClaudia feels miserable to see her parents fighting and is bitterly hurt when her parents break up. No doubt she adjusts to the new situation after a while but others do not react the same way as she does. Colin likes his stepfather but his mother takes him away from him and so Colin ends up suffering a great deal. He spends his life longing to be with his stepfather again.\n\nRalph, on the other hand, enjoys the love of his many stepmothers and siblings. There is much disorder in his family but the fact that there is care and love among the members keeps him and the family going. Pixie has to struggle through some emotions and make adjustments to understand that she is loved by her father and stepmother. Robbo accepts his stepfather more readily than his sister does. His sister does not care for their stepfather and she returns to her father. All these examples show that children instinctively look for love and care and need lots of reassurance. When that is missing, they feel devastated and are likely to suffer and face great difficulty in adapting to a changed family situation."

At times, Minah and her brothers had barely enough food to eat.\n\nPerhaps it was seeing her parents working so hard without any complaints or the sight of her brothers sitting with their books late at night, but whatever it was Minah was determined to do well in life. Minah's parents loved their children and encouraged them to work hard at school. Her older brothers managed to complete their secondary education but Minah had a dream. Every time she walked past the university in her town, she told herself that she would get a degree. It was a burning desire that she nursed in her heart.\n\nMinah did well in school and passed the exams with good results. Her teachers encouraged and advised her to apply for a scholarship. Minah did exactly that. To her joy, she managed to get a scholarship to study agriculture. It was a field that was close to her heart and it was no surprise that she did brilliantly in the university. Minah took a job that paid well and was able to help her family considerably.\n\nSome years later, Minah started a research centre in a rural area and was able to employ other people to work for her. Her centre did well and she was often invited to give talks to people interested in this field. She presented papers on various aspects of agriculture and was soon recognised as an authority on the subject. Minah had made it. She was a success."

        "content": "The domestic cat or house cat is a small domesticated animal that is beautiful and confident. It is often kept as an indoor pet. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rats, lizards and all sorts of household pests. A genetic study in 2007 revealed that domestic cats are descended from African Wildcats circa 8000 BCE, in the Middle East.\nSince cats were cult animals in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to have been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic. According to research, cats are the most popular household pet in the world, and are now found in almost every place where people live.\n\nCats have strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws and teeth that are adapted to killing small prey. They are predatory in nature. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice. They can see in near darkness and have an acute sense of smell. Like most other mammals, cats can't see colours the way humans can.\n\nDespite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and cat communication includes mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as other types of cat-specific body language.\n\nJust like dog shows, there are cat shows for pedigree cats. Breeding here is done in a controlled manner, where only the best males and females are bred for a limited number of times. However, failure\nto control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering can cause serious problems as cats breed very rapidly. Furthermore, the abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control."

She was the top student in her class.\nUnfortunately, her father suffered a heart attack and was confined to their home, unable to tend the fields. Her six siblings, three boys and three girls were too young to understand. Sarimah knew by the look on her mother's face that she would have to take over. At the young age of sixteen she decided that she would not let her family suffer poverty. She forged ahead with the harvest and made sure the livestock was well fed.\n\nShe got help from the local Mardi and Felda officers who gave her the financial and practical backing. Despite her busy and complicated life, she still managed to continue with her schoolwork. Her mother sold cakes and tended to the fruit orchard that supplemented their income in the dry season. As she worked, Sarimah didn't neglect her siblings. She paid a kind teacher in the village some money to tutor them. She started selling handicrafts obtained from the local villagers at the weekend markets in K.L. There were times when she would cry herself to sleep.\n\nSoon she could manage the farm, orchard and her studies as she had engaged some Siamese odd jobbers to tend to the fields. This gave her time to study and look after the family. Her business evolved and she managed to study agribusiness in UPM. Nevertheless she returned to the village and saw her siblings through college. Today, all of them have successful careers of their own. Her father and mother now live a simple but comfortable life. Sarimah today is happily married and has three children of her own. As she looks back on her past, she can't help but wonder where she got the strength and resolve to do all that she did. She said to me once, 'I am amazed at what people can achieve when they are forced to.'"

I am honoured and happy to speak to you about the benefits of the Interact Club.\nAs you know the Interact Club was formed to support the international aspirations of Rotary International, a well-known establishment that has carried out various social programs to promote better understanding among people. Rotary's programs for students and youth can change the lives of those who participate. Through these programs, young people can earn scholarships, travel on cultural exchange, or help a community through a service project.\n\nFirstly, you should join the Interact Club because it promotes understanding among people of diverse backgrounds, cultures and religions. This is vital in a plural society like Malaysia. Then, there is social responsibility. Our club visits orphanages, homes for the aged, and conducts other activities such as clean-ups in public areas. This is to inculcate a love for our environment which is being threatened by the ignorance and selfishness of the majority.\n\nAs I mentioned in my introduction, the Interact Club promotes sharing and caring through networking. The captains of industry, businessmen and women, professionals and other working adults from the Rotary community provide a strong network that spans the globe in supporting young people with activities that promote sharing knowledge, culture and opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel that the Interact Club is a beneficial club to join with many advantages. So on a parting note, I bid you welcome. Thank you."

It will be a place where happy children will be excitedly involved with learning activities which will benefit them greatly. They will be studying in a healthy and clean environment.\nThe school building will be clean and inviting. Students will enjoy many facilities that technology has brought them. Shuttles will take the children from one building to another. There will be sky bridges connecting buildings and, therefore, students and teachers can access all the different facilities easily.\n\nAll the classrooms will be equipped with facilities of technology so that learning will be an exciting experience. There will be a chance to gain hands-on experience as students will get to go on field trips regularly. Children will learn at their own pace and thus there will be less pressure to keep up with others. A vibrant learning environment will make school an attractive place of children.\n\nTeachers will be facilitators and will assist children to acquire knowledge as robots or machines cannot replace the human factor. Naturally, teachers will still be needed to teach human values and emotional growth as machines cannot be a substitute in that aspect. Only human beings can impart feelings and ensure that students understand their role in the world as caring and responsible inhabitants of this planet.\n\nThe school of the future will make sure that the students leave school with the necessary skills to fit the employment market and be good citizens of the country. Students must understand that they have a role to play in this world. When they leave school, they must be good human beings of whom the country can be proud."

Her hair is always swept neatly back into a bun, not a hair out of place.\nMak Cik Salmah lives just next door to us. When we first moved in, she was the first to come over and introduce herself, holding a hot plate of meehoon in her hand. Her warmth and joy was a welcome change from our previous neighbors. Since then, she has become a regular visitor to our home.\n\nWe soon discovered that Mak Cik Salmah did not have any children and so, she doted on us like we were her own. She insisted that we call her Opah and we became her first Chinese grandchildren. When I was young, I used to look forward to her visits as she would always hand me some goodies which she keeps in between her sarong belt.\n\nMak Cik Salmah is never content unless her hands are occupied. Whenever she comes over for a chat, she always brings along some chores to do. Her favorite is to peel anchovies. The more interesting the conversation, the faster she would peel. In no time, her lap would be filled with anchovies. Then, she would get up and dust her sarong the minute the clock strikes six. \"It's late. I have to go. Pak Din will be expecting dinner soon,\" she would proclaim. However, she always lingers for another fifteen minutes or so, as if she was reluctant to go back to her lonely home.\n\nOur day is never complete without Mak Cik Salmah's stories about the Japanese Occupation. She was just a little girl then but she remembers her time spent in the jungle vividly. She keeps us mesmerized with her stories, which are often scary as well as hilarious. As I grow older, I often wonder whether she makes up all those stories. Nevertheless, the children love her.\n\nApart from her ability to spin stories, Mak Cik Salmah is also a great cook. Her acar timun and otak-otak is well-known in our neighborhood. Whenever there is a wedding feast or kenduri, she is called upon for her services.\n\nThe most wonderful thing about Mak Cik Salmah is her ability to see some good in the worst character. So, whenever I got into trouble with my parents, I would turn to her for advice. She would listen without condemning me but at the same time, she would help me see my parents' point of view. In a way, she has been a great influence in my life and I am very fortunate to have such a great Opah."

She had taken me aside after a church choir practice last Thursday and slapped me with an appointment with her. I shouldn't have opened my mouth so wide while singing.\nSuddenly, a nurse called my name. I felt like a sheep to be slaughtered as she ushered me into the room. Dr Tan was smiling sweetly but she looked intimidating in her white overcoat. \"Just tell me when you are going to take it out,\" I pleaded nervously. She donned her mask and looked downright serious. I opened my mouth to show her where the affected tooth was. She made some small talk but I could only nod in response. Then, she injected some anaesthetic. \"Does it hurt?\" she asked. I was stunned momentarily by the ant-bite sensation. Then, she ushered me to a chair. \"Wait here till the medicine takes effect,\" she said.\n\nWhile waiting, I felt my lips growing bigger. Dr Tan continued her chit-chatting with her patient while drilling his tooth. Dentists are weird. They ask you questions that need more than a one word answer and at the same time they are working inside your mouth. This was the first time I saw the other side of her. However, I did not have time to dwell on that as another more pressing matter was before me. By the end of the ten minutes I was pretty sure everyone was looking at my lips.\n\nI was back on the chair again. She knocked on the affected tooth. \"Does it hurt?\" she asked again. By now, I couldn't feel anything. \"I'm just going to loosen the tooth a bit first,\" she continued. I felt her moving here and there. \"Now, rinse your mouth,\" she said. After that, I sank back into the chair reluctantly. \"It's done,\" she announced. \"Here is your tooth,\" she said as she shoved a little dish into my hands.\n\nI could not believe my eyes. The tooth was huge although one of its roots was gone. I slipped out of the chair, still dazed by it all. I waved goodbye and she patted me on my back. Before I could say anything, she had already nodded at her next patient. On my way out of the room, the nurse gave me some painkillers and some cotton. \"Remember your appointment next week,\" she reminded. How could I forget? The drill would be waiting for me next week but the thought that Dr Tan would be attending to me somehow made it seem less frightening. I would certainly be in good hands."

In my town, the night market is held once a month along the street in the middle of the town. The whole street is closed to traffic on the first Saturday of every month. This is the only night when the town comes alive.\nThe first to arrive at the site are the hawkers, stall owners and wholesalers who come in lorries and vans to unload their goods. The next hour is spent arranging their wares on their makeshift stalls. Soon, the whole place is transformed into a big shopping centre, brightly illuminated by flourescent lamps and colorful bulbs.\n\nMany shoppers flock to the night market to get their vegetables. There are a few vegetable stalls offering fresh vegetables at affordable prices. Housewives would quickly snap up the fresh vegetables after some bargaining. Later in the night, one can buy these vegetables at discounted prices as vendors try to finish their stock for the night. It is funny to see them trying to outdo one another, shouting on top of their voices, \"Satu ringgit, tiga ikat...\"\n\nApart from vegetables and fruit, there are also food stalls. The aroma of freshly fried chicken, ayam panggang, yong tow foo, fish balls, and laksa is enough to tempt any fussy eater. As for children, there are ice cream stalls, burgers, and sweets of all shapes and sizes.\n\nAt the other end of the street, there will be a few textile stalls. There is also a famous second-hand stall which sells cheap jeans and jackets. For those who cannot afford to get a new pair of jeans, this is the place to shop. There is also a famous makcik who sells trendy clothes, colorful scarves and tudung of various patterns and colors.\n\nShoppers who flock to the night market come from as far as the nearby towns. Some are here to shop and hunt for bargains while some are here to take a leisurely stroll on a Saturday night. The youngsters would take this time to hang out with their friends, enjoying the fiesta-like atmosphere.\n\nSome nights, one can come across interesting personalities who try to sell their wares with a microphone, encouraging and urging buyers to choose any three items for RM10. One can also come across the medicine man, crouching mysteriously in one corner, selling medicine to cure some illnesses or to increase one's strength.\n\nBy 10.30 p.m. the crowd slowly dwindles. Usually, there is litter everywhere. Our night markets are quite different from the flea markets of Europe. They offer not only cheap items for sale but also a variety of goods. One can call it a 'one-stop shopping centre' of Malaysia."

The sun was beating mercilessly on my back and I could feel my sweat trickling down my spine. I have often wished that my mother would allow me to ride a motorcycle to school. She says that I am not ready but we both know that she is terrified that a car would knock me down.\nWhen I reached the bus station, it was nearly empty except for a handful of boys. Mohan and I strode to a bench near the stationmaster's office. I could feel the tension on my shoulders as the straps of my school bag ate into my shoulders. \"Where is the bus?\" I sighed to myself. An elderly woman came and asked me where I was going. She started a conversation but gave up after my monosyllabic answers.\n\nSuddenly, someone shouted and I saw a bus swerve into the station. I got up, thankful for the chance to escape from the woman. It was Mohan's bus. The group of boys were jostling each other to get into the bus. \"Masuk! Masuk!\" shouted the conductor but nobody seemed to be moving. The black fumes made me nauseous. All of a sudden, people started appearing from all directions to board their bus. In no time, the passengers were packed like sardines in the bus. It started to move, leaving some unfortunate passengers behind. I waved at Mohan when I noticed him dangling on the steps of the bus. The bus swerved out of the station again. It left another trail of black smoke.\n\nI decided to go to Panjang's ice stall nearby. The iced sugarcane juice soothed my parched throat as I sipped slowly, all the while keeping an eye out for the bus. Then I saw the bus heading towards the station. I paid for my drinks. \"See you tomorrow,\" I waved to Panjang.\n\nOnce more, the crowd began to swell near the bus. I noticed that the elderly woman was being shoved around by the boys. She started hitting them with her umbrella. Then, I saw Raja, my classmate at the back of the bus. I hurled my bag through the window and he caught it. By the time I got into the bus, it had already started moving. I got into my seat and told myself that I must really try to convince my mother about the motorcycle again."

We went to our usual hangout with the gang. He ordered his usual teh tarik and I noticed that he looked a little under the weather. He brushed it aside as 'exam fever'. Little did I know that it would be the last time I would see him alive.\n\nLater that night, I received a call from Aunty Grace. She told me that Charles had been admitted to the hospital for suspected dengue fever. Then, she paused for what seemed like ages and said in a tearful voice, \"Charles has left us. He slipped into a coma and never regained consciousness.\" I do not recall how I spent the rest of the night. I only remembered calling our friends and we went to Charles's house.\n\nI looked at my friends who were writing furiously and I wondered whether they were struggling like me. I glanced at my watch and realized that it was already 10.30 in the morning. We would be going for the funeral service in about an hour. How was I going to say goodbye to my dear friend, my mentor and my counselor? He was there for me when my father passed away three years ago and he had always been like a big brother to me. I could still hear his jokes, his clowning around with us after the exam. How could I not know that he was sick?\n\nThe examination hall was unusually quiet. Miss Jeya signaled us to get into her car. Tears blurred my vision. I suddenly remembered the last time we were together in her car. We were going for a debate and Charles was our first speaker. He made us laugh at his antics till our sides ached.\n\nAt the service, Aunty Grace looked calm as we took our places. Then, it was time for my presentation. I took a deep breath. I wanted to say a few words before my song but I choked. Aunty Grace looked at me and smiled encouragingly. Then, I sang 'Amazing Grace', Charles's favorite song. \"I once was lost, but now am found, was blind but now I see.\" As my voice soared, I knew Charles was listening and I felt at peace, Goodbye, my friend, till we meet again. I shall never forget this day for the rest of my life."

Students are required to join at least one uniformed unit and a club. In my opinion, these activities play an important role in a student's life and are therefore not a waste of time and money.\nFirst and foremost, co-curricular activities provide a broadening experience for students to learn about themselves, other people, and the community at large through the various activities organized such as camping, school trips, games, project work and campaigns. For example, when students go on a study tour, they are given a chance to encounter situations and opportunities in the real world, beyond the school gate.\n\nApart from that, co-curricular activities provide students with a chance to develop other aspects such as music, sports and other living skills. Some students are unable to shine in the classroom but they are superb athletes and musicians. Confined to the demands of their studies, they are unable to develop their talents and may be branded as failures. Co-curricular activities help these students to become fulfilled individuals.\n\nBesides that, these activities provide leadership training for students. They get a chance to learn how to lead a team. They learn organizational skills such as planning, budgeting and problem-solving, all of which the classroom situation may be unable to provide. They learn discipline and co-operation, tolerance and understanding.\n\nIn addition, co-curricular activities provide an outlet for students to rest and relax after a hard day's work. Students get to play, laugh and release their tension through the various club activities held, such as quizzes, treasure hunts and various games. As there are many types of clubs and societies, there is almost something for everyone. For those who do not like outdoor games, they can always join a chess club or a cookery club. For the active and restless, they can join the football club or the netball club. Various competitions and selections are held and some students are picked to represent their schools.\n\nCo-curricular activities certainly play an important role in a student's life. They complement the activities of the classroom. In a nutshell, a well-planned co-curricular program helps students become wholesome individuals. Thus, co-curricular activities are definitely not a waste of time and money."

        "content": "Teachers play an important role in a person's life. Throughout my life, I have come across many types of teachers. Many of them have inspired me and influenced my life. Some are good at their job but some have made my life downright miserable.\nWhat makes an effective teacher? First and foremost, he (or she) must be knowledgeable in his (or her) own field. Pupils quickly lose respect for teachers who are unable to answer a simple question or solve a simple problem related to their field. They should also be honest with pupils if they do not know the answer and make efforts to improve themselves.\n\nApart from that, an effective teacher should also be able to impart his knowledge to his pupils. I once had an Additional Mathematics teacher who was a genius but he could not tell us clearly how he solved mathematical problems. Such a teacher is of no use to pupils. An effective teacher is able to simplify a difficult concept and help pupils to understand them. He is able to teach even weak pupils.\n\nFurthermore, he should also continue to keep abreast with the latest developments in his field and the world in general. It is rather embarrassing when pupils seem to know more about what is going on in the world than the teachers who seem contented using the same notes year in and year out.\n\nMoreover, an effective teacher is also a fair teacher. He does not show favoritism among his pupils. He treats everyone equally regardless of creed, race or intelligence. There is nothing worse than teachers who pay extra attention to pupils who are more intelligent.\n\nFinally, an effective teacher is also one who does not allow his personal life to interfere with his work at school. He is able to put aside his worries and concentrate on the task at hand in school. If a teacher is constantly worried about his personal problems, he cannot be totally committed to his pupils and such teachers are more ineffective.\n\nTeachers play such an important role in a pupil's life. An effective teacher is someone who is a role model - who not only educates his pupils but also ignites and inspires them towards becoming wholesome individuals."

After so many months of preparation and studies, it is time to face the examination.\nHow do you face such an important day? Firstly, prepare a test kit for the duration of your examination. In your bag, collect all your supplies such as 2B pencils, several pens and other important stationery, a calculator, your geometry set, the important identity card and your examination slip. Put the bag and everything else that you might need, including some notebooks, in one place. This will help to reduce your worries in the morning.\n\nMany students find difficulty sleeping especially if they are facing their first examination. Allow your body to get back to its normal cycle at least a week before the examination if you have been staying up late. Listen to some relaxing music or your favorite radio station before you sleep. Try to relax and remember to set your alarm clock.\n\nBe determined to arrive early at the examination hall. You have enough to worry about in the morning of the big day. When you arrive at the hall, surround yourself with friends who are supportive or just go through your notes quietly. If you do not know the answer to any topic, do not go round asking frantically for the answer. This will just upset you and send you into panic mode.\n\nWhen you are at the examination hall, follow these steps. Before the examination starts, make sure your question paper is complete. Read the instructions carefully. Do not worry if you cannot answer the very first question or if your mind goes blank. Tell yourself that it will all come back. Tackle the easy questions first. Divide your time carefully for each question and move on to the next question even if you have not finished the first. Plan your answer and try to be neat.\n\nFinally, after each paper, go home and rest. Do not worry about what you could have done or did not do. Try not to discuss the answers with your friends. You should not allow anything to upset the rest of the examination."

        "content": "Stress is defined as a person's response to his environment. Symptoms of stress include exhaustion, loss of/increased appetite, headaches, crying, sleeplessness, and oversleeping. Feelings of alarm, frustration, or apathy may accompany stress. Working adults often face work-related stress. What is even more alarming is that more and more children are also suffering from stress.\nThere are many ways in which we can reduce stress in our lives. Firstly, get up fifteen minutes earlier each morning. That gives you a little more time to eat something, run back to get something you may have forgotten, or enjoy a cup of coffee before heading out the door. If you drive to work, a 15- or 20-minute head start may mean facing less traffic, thus making the journey less stressful.\n\nThe next thing that we can do to reduce stress is to confide in someone we trust. Don't keep things bottled up. Talking with someone helps you to put things in better perspective. Who knows, they may even have solutions to your problems. Do not be afraid to seek professional help if you feel you have reached breaking point.\n\nBesides that, learn how to relax. Meditation and breathing exercises have proved to be very effective in controlling stress. Practice clearing your mind of disturbing thoughts. The quickest and most effective way of eliminating feelings of stress and panic is to close your eyes and take several long, slow, deep breaths. Breathing in this way calms your whole nervous system. Simultaneously, you could give yourself some mental pep-talk by mentally repeating \"I am calm and relaxed\" or \"I know I will be fine\".\n\nFinally, learn to set your priorities right and do not over-commit yourself. People who are over-committed tend to feel overwhelmed and suffer. Reduce the number of events going on in your life and you may reduce the circuit overload. Set realistic goals for yourself and put it in writing. Do not worry over the small stuff but reward yourself when you have been successful in achieving even some small goals.\n\nSome say that a little stress is good for you as it pushes you to react and achieve your goals. On the other hand, when stress is prolonged, it causes physical and emotional problems that may damage both your health and your performance. Thus, it is important for us to learn how to handle our stress."

However, my favorite actor is Tom Cruise.\nTom Cruise first shot to fame with his portrayal of Ethan Hunt in the great hit movie Mission Impossible. The movie's success was credited mostly to its engaging storyline, high-tech gadgetry and Tom Cruise's talented acting. The success of Mission Impossible resulted in the release of two sequels to the film which did equally well worldwide. All these movies presented Tom Cruise's ability to perform gravity-defying, gun-wielding stunts himself which almost rendered the stuntman obsolete. The only other actor who performed dangerous stunts was Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones.\n\nBesides acting in high-octane action movies, Tom Cruise has also acted in heartwarming movies such as Jerry Mcguire. His role in the movie as a lawyer and executive was executed to near perfection. I can remember nearly succumbing to tears as I watched his role facing repeated failures before achieving victory. The movie garnered much support from both fans and critics of the actor. Tom Cruise then, much to my delight, went on to win an Oscar for his performance in the movie.\n\nTom Cruise's personal life is just as extraordinary as his acting career. Most of his friends are celebrities who include David Beckham and Oprah Winfrey. He had been seen going out with most of Hollywood's A-list actresses before finally tying the knot with Nicole Kidman. The couple adopted two children before going their separate ways. Tom Cruise then married Katie Holmes, another up-coming actress.\n\nHe has been in the movie scene for almost two decades but shows no sign of retiring. He has never ceased to enthrall audiences with his acting prowess and I, as well as millions of fans round the world, hope to see more of his movies in cinemas worldwide."

        "content": "The massive flood that started on 22 of December will be forever etched in my mind. The floods destroyed and caused heavy damage to 700 homes and displaced 90,000 people in my village. With the area having only a population of 25,000, it was a significant number of flood victims. The immediate problems that had to be addressed were water, sanitation and health issues. As many of the district health centers had been destroyed or damaged, water-purification tablets and water tanks were urgently needed. Various humanitarian bodies distributed anti-malaria medication and insecticide-treated bed nets.\nAlthough these were essential in maintaining the general health of the victims, the grief openly displayed in their faces was more worrisome. Some just did not want to be consoled or even counseled. The loss of loved ones, babies, husbands and siblings snatched by the fury of the rising waters were too difficult to even consider. As food supplies trickled in, victims stampeded the volunteers. Brute force was needed to keep the desperate at bay in order to give every victim the opportunity to receive the required aid. Relief efforts were also hampered due to the lack of communication and greed of some profiteers. Their greed in times of distress sickened me to the core.\n\nThe flood had been traumatic for many children. They felt isolated because of the deep mud left by the floods. Many were not able to leave their homes, play outside or go to school. Their usually cheerful faces were replaced with forlorn faces that had not quite grasped the extent of the devastation. Many others were also traumatized by the water, refusing to leave their homes. I had to beg and cajole to get them to leave their mud-caked huts to join us in the sampans that would carry them to relief centers.\n\nI am grateful that I survived the flood without losing any of my family members. We lost our home and belongings, but nothing can replace the life of a loved one. This traumatic experience taught me many things. Among the most important were to cherish my family and to be strong in all adversity."

        "content": "My family and I are football addicts who crave for football day and night. The obsession for football began since my grandfather played football for Selangor during his youth. During the school holidays, my father bought two tickets to watch the Selangor versus Perak match. There was a sea of people waiting to collect their tickets an hour before the match. My father and I were uncomfortably sandwiched between them but managed to enter on time.\nThe stadium was packed like sardines when we entered. People could be seen jostling through the excited crowd to get to their seats. There were even a few people who were armed with umbrellas, ready to deploy them upon sight of rain. As my dad and I were looking for our seats, I could see a few voluntary policeman stationed round the stadium to control the frenzied crowd.\n\nSoon, the match kicked off and I watched the game with interest. My father had bought a bandana and scarf bearing Selangor's name prior to the game. I wore them proudly and cheered for my team happily. The spectators screamed and yelled each time their teams gained and lost possession of the ball. Caught in the moment, I too yelled as loud as I could with the expense of a sore throat the next day. Fortunately, my enthusiastic cheering was not a complete disappointment as Selangor scored its 1st and 2nd goal in the first 20 minutes of the match.\n\nHowever, skill and luck seemed to shift to the Perak side as the team scored another two goals. This left the score at 2 all at half-time. During the half-time break, my father bought a few drinks to moisten our parched throats due to excessive cheering. The match resumed just after we finished our burgers. We were delighted to see our team doing their best.\n\nThe game ended in my team's favor as Selangor clobbered Perak 5-2. The stadium then emptied almost as fast as it was filled. I had a whale of a time watching the match with my father. The experience was amazing and I am sure my brothers are green with envy as they had to study for their examinations instead."

My first thought was that there was a power disruption due to the thunderstorm brewing outside. Instinct led me to the kitchen cabinet where I could remember my mother storing some candles for emergencies.\nAfter a considerable amount of groping, the tips of my fingers came into contact with a waxy candle. I grabbed it immediately with relief and quickly lit it. Then, I noticed that my neighbor's lights were on. This\ndiscarded my first notion of the power shortage due to the storm. I began to ponder what could be the cause of the blackout. Then, I remembered my father showing me a lamp in his room which used to cause the electrical supply in the house to go haywire for some inexplicable reason.\n\nI rushed to my father's room and inspected the lamp but found that it was disconnected. The sound of something being moved round upstairs instantly diverted my attention. The hairs behind my neck stood on ends. To ensure I was not seen by whoever was in the house, I quickly blew the flame off my candle.\n\nI furtively moved under the kitchen table and remained as quiet as a bat. The intruder went out of sight but I could hear his faint footsteps on the wooden staircase. Thoughts of me getting kidnapped crept uneasily into my mind. No more than a second later, I saw the garage door ploughed down by my neighbor, Mr Vasu. As the lightning flashed, he saw me hiding and hastily led me out of the house and into his.\n\nEverything seemed to happen at lightning speed. Mrs Vasu tried to calm me down and explained to me that Mr Vasu happened to see the thief rummaging the bedroom facing theirs. Apparently my parents had asked him to keep an eye on me while they were away.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, my parents were at Mr Vasu's house thanking him for rescuing me. From their conversation, I gathered that the thief managed to flee when he heard Mr Vasu storming through the door. Nevertheless, I was extremely grateful to Mr Vasu and will forever be indebted to him."

However, I was never bold enough to actually be a contestant in these competitions. The fear of forgetting my story, stuttering and stammering during my speech or failing the impromptu sessions frequently haunted me.\nAll the same, my English teacher, Mrs Ho, wheedled me into trying my luck at the district level public speaking competition. I was a little unnerved and stifled at first, but after some encouragement I felt I was up to the challenge. I practiced hard each day with the intention of claiming top honors at the competition. I did not want to give in to my foibles, but rose up to the occasion.\n\nSoon, I was on my way to the public speaking competition venue which was a a stone's throw away from my school. My prepared speech played endlessly in my head. I knew I had to execute each word with utter perfection. After some time, I started to feel a little more confident in my ability to memorize the story and was certain that I could clinch the first prize.\n\nThe hall I entered was filled with students and teachers, all of them looking intimidating. Looking up at Mrs Ho, she comforted me by smiling and advised me not to worry. I was the final contestant for my category. The waiting was sheer agony as I watched each contestant make their painful exit.\n\nHalf an hour later, a teacher told me it was my turn. Without delay, I got up on stage. The large crowd made me cringe a trifle but I managed to begin my speech flawlessly. Into the third minute of my eight-minute speech, I started forgetting my lines. Tiny droplets of perspiration began to trickle down my neck. My hands began to quiver. Suddenly, I was completely blank and the words of my story began to elude me. As people started pointing and looking at me, I quickly ran off stage and into the car park.\n\nMrs Ho quickly rushed towards me and tried to console me. She told me that what had happened was not something uncommon. Many students often go blank and freeze on stage. Nevertheless, that moment will forever be branded in my head as the most embarrassing moment of my life."

        "content": "Every year thousands and thousands of young adults leave the comforts of their homes to study in a foreign country such as the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia. There seems to be an\nelement of glamour involved. On the contrary, studying abroad has more benefits than just that. However, for every pro there is a con.\nFirst, let us look at the pros. Living in another country means leaving behind all the comforts of home and having to do everything for yourself. You would need to do things you may have never done in your home country. These include cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, washing clothes, figuring out transportation and making living arrangements. Many students go home proud that they have become very independent individuals. Achieving all this also improves self-esteem and builds strength of character. You will become more confident than ever. Your life will be forever changed.\n\nStudying in a foreign country also means having to speak English even more than what you are used to. Everywhere you turn, you will be exposed to the language - on the streets, in the stores, on campus - you can't get away from it. You will be forced to interact with the local people there in English apart from writing and reading the language on campus. The plus point here is that your English language proficiency will improve by leaps and bounds. The best way to learn or improve on a language is by using it daily. Studying abroad also has its cons. Almost everyone will experience some homesickness. You will probably miss your family, friends, food and everything familiar. Apart from that, there is culture shock. You will need to get accustomed to new attitudes and ways of life.\n\nOn the other hand, living in a different culture helps you to realize there are different ways of doing things. You will also discover that at the end of the day, we are all human with the same emotions. The friendships you form will help you reach a new level of maturity.\n\nDespite the disadvantages of studying abroad, the overall outcome is a positive one. What you can gain from this experience far outweighs the negative because there is no price for personal growth and realization."

        "content": "The day we learn to talk and socialize is the day we start making friends. As we grow up, we discover that there are many types of friends. Some are more of an acquaintance and a select few are confidantes. To me, the word `friend' is sacred. It means more than just a companion who goes for movies and have laughs over nothing with. A friend is someone I can turn to when I am down and will always stand by my side through thick and thin. What qualities do I look for in a friend?\nFirstly, my friend should always be caring. This means taking an interest in my problems no matter how big or petty they are. A friend gives me encouragement even when everyone else is against me. Many people say they are friends, but most of them run away the minute I am not cheerful or funny. A real friend sticks by me no matter what mood or predicament I am in. After all, isn't friendship about accepting and liking people for who and what they are?\n\nApart from that, a friend should be honest. This quality is crucial to me, because honesty builds trust. An honest friend will not lie and I must be able to trust the person with my secrets. Apart from that, sometimes I need an honest opinion about myself or an issue. If a friend is honest, I can trust that his or her opinion is not biased. This is very important to me, because although the truth may hurt it will help me to improve. Only an honest friend will be able to do that.\n\nBesides that, a friend must also be able to share the same humor with me. Humor plays an important role in making your day more lively and enjoyable. Friends who can joke and laugh over similar things make life so much more fun. As they say, laughter is the best medicine and brings much joy on dull days.\n\nI welcome everyone as my friend. However, I look for certain qualities which would make him or her a meaningful friend and someone I can count on. Among them would be honesty, a warm heart and the\nability to share and participate in the same humor."

Some don a long cane while others opt for the typical ruler. In general, the discipline teacher is said to be too strict. However, I find that the discipline teacher in my school is not.\nMr Tiva is a far cry from the typical discipline master. He is a tall and lean man who has held the discipline teacher position for the last two years. His concept of instilling good moral values into the delinquents of my school is not by force, but by communicating on the same level as them. His uncanny ability to understand why a pupil reacted a certain way has more than once surprised me.\n\nMoreover, he is a very friendly and compassionate teacher. Students never cease to enjoy his Mathematics classes as he never forgets to incorporate jokes into his lessons. However, he always knows when to divert his student's attention back to the subject. He uses unorthodox teaching methods to persuade us to study such as playing Mathematic games and organizing Maths carnivals. By doing so, he gained the respect of most of the students from my school.\n\nBesides that, Mr Tiva takes the liberty of visiting the homes of students who have disciplinary problems. He tries his best to analyze their surroundings and determine the root of the student's behavior. This technique often brings him success and he has helped many students overcome their problems. Parents have on many occasions, ridiculed him for blaming them for their children's bad behavior but those accusations are not true and can be substantiated with evidence.\n\nAll in all, Mr Tiva has contributed a lot to my school. After his takeover of the discipline teacher's position, there has been a sharp decline in truancy and vandalism. Many students here listen to Mr Tiva out of respect and not fear. They know that what he does is for their own benefit. Thus, I do not think that my discipline teacher is too strict."

        "content": "Being in a position of power means having the ability to make some major changes. If I were to become the next principal of my school, I would make some changes to the school infrastructure and facilities. First and foremost, I would build a functional and interactive computer lab. In this IT era, being well-versed in computers is a must to be one step closer to success in career advancement. This lab would be of great use to students who do not have a computer or whose family cannot afford to have one. Since this is the age where they learn new things quicker, it is the best time for them to learn about computers.\nNext, I would have extra classes over weekends and school holidays prior to major examinations. Extra classes will be conducted by teachers who are dedicated to helping weaker students. This would be of great help to poorer students who cannot afford to go for tuition.\n\nThe learning environment for students is also very important. The chairs and tables of some classrooms are in very bad condition. Some are old and some have been broken by irresponsible students. Thus, I would provide new and more comfortable tables and chairs. Nobody can study peacefully with a creaky chair and shabby desk. This would help them to be more comfortable and increase their attention span in class thus, indirectly improving his or her performance in school.\n\nThe next thing I would do is improve the quality of food served at the canteen. Currently, the type of food served is not very nutritional, very limited in choice, unhygienic and not tasty. Insects and fine pieces of dust can sometimes be seen floating on the beverages served. As the principal, I would impose more stringent rules on the cleanliness and suggest more variety in the choices of food. I would have a survey to determine the types of healthy food that should be served and make sure the canteen operators follow this guideline.\n\nSports play an important part in our lives. Hence, I would improve the quality of sports equipment and facilities in the school. This would give students, who are not very good academically, to explore and develop their sports talents. If they perform exceptionally well in sports, I might discover yet another Nicol David !\n\nThese are a few things I would do as a principal. Making the changes stated above will change how students perceive school and become more motivated to excel in their studies and in life."

        "content": "Education plays a crucial role in molding the future of our youths. Schools are painstakingly at work in producing bright young students. However, the current generation of students would rather gain popularity than to work hard. Loitering is becoming rampant among them. Some even skip school to loiter. How do we address this?\nFirst and foremost, we cannot undermine the power of education. Parents should teach their children the importance of education. In school, teachers ought to instill the importance of studying hard for the sake of a bright future. Often, students do not understand the relevance of their actions in the present. Perhaps by listening to both parents and teachers, students will be able to realize that persevering in their studies will undoubtedly improve their lives in the future.\n\nBesides that, schools must increase the number of discipline teachers. Discipline teachers should also be given the green light to punish students who disobey any school rules or regulations. By doing so, students will be afraid to loiter and choose to stay in the classroom instead.\n\nMoreover, teachers should strive to include new methods of teaching in their daily lessons. Their teaching technique should always be upgraded to suit the changing needs of students. By doing so, the lesson in class becomes more enjoyable and students will be more interested to study. Interactive methods of teaching such as using computers and LCD will attract the attention of today's tech-savvy students.\n\nLast but not least, schools and the community could organize more interesting activities after school hours. If something interesting is happening, many youths would be attracted to participate. For example, if there is a talent contest or a dance competition, I am sure many of our youths would have no time for loitering. Co-curricular activities in school should also be more relevant and interesting in order to captivate their attention.\n\nThe problem of loitering has plagued many schools for a long time. Loitering can be solved if steps are taken immediately to curb it. The youths are our nation's future leaders and should be taken care of to ensure a prosperous nation."

        "content": "Water is one of the most vital natural resources for life on Earth. The availability and quality of water determines not only where people can live, but also their quality of life. Even though there is plenty of fresh water, it is not available when and where it is needed. Only five per cent of the world's water is deemed fit for consumption and this figure is shrinking by the day. Thus, it must be treated as a limited and precious resource.\nWithout water, all human activity would be affected and come to a standstill. Water is essential for commercial use which includes fresh water for motels, hotels, restaurants, office buildings, other commercial facilities, and civilian and military institutions. Domestic water use would be for drinking, food preparation, bathing, washing, flushing toilets, and watering lawns and gardens. The other uses would be for industries such as power generators and for agriculture.\n\nThe availability of water dictates where and to what extent development can occur. Water must be in sufficient supply for an area to develop, and an area cannot continue to develop if demand for water outstrips supply. In the twenty-first century, the demand for water has to be managed more effectively within the available supply instead of simply building more dams.\n\nThe demand for water increases year by year as the human population grows bigger. However, the supply of clean, useable water does not. Instead, it shrinks due to pollution, deforestation and global warming. If a balance is not obtained, our source of water will diminish very fast.\n\nThere are several ways in which an individual can save this precious commodity. When washing dishes or hands, don't let the water run while rinsing. Run your washing machine and dishwasher only when they are full and you could save 1000 gallons of water. Minimize evaporation by watering plants early in the morning when the temperature is cooler. Replacing the traditional shower head with a water-saving one could save about a gallon of water each time.\n\nIt is said that one can survive a week without food, but only a few days without water. Since water is the source of all life, it is time great importance is placed to conserve."

        "content": "Drug abuse used to be a phrase commonly used for adults, but now it is becoming common among teenagers. Why does it occur among teenagers and what can be done about it?\nThere are psychological and social reasons. Some individuals have a genetic predisposition to becoming depressed due to stress and it is undeniable that teenagehood can be one of the most stressful stages of life. Such a psychiatric disposition could lead to drug addiction because drugs give the abusers relief from stress. Having tried it once, the sense of feeling high spurs the user to get a second fix and so on. Poor stress management and a low self-esteem could also trigger the use of drugs as the person simply wants to escape reality. The social reason comes in the form of peer pressure. In order to be accepted by a group, some teenagers succumb to peer pressure and get hooked on drugs.\n\nFollowing that, how can one help reduce the risk of teenage involvement in drug abuse? Getting to know a teenager's friends and their parents on a first name basis will also help a parent know what their teen is up to. Networking between parents of teenagers is essential. Keeping connected to their teens is also important. If a parent cannot be home with their teen, call and leave notes. Have another adult supervise him or sign him up for an after school program. If these things are not possible, establish a routine for the teenager to keep him busy.\n\nParents often avoid talking of drugs. They should. However, it must be reminded that these are conversations, not lectures that would bore teenagers. Instead, unite the family against drugs using strong family beliefs such as religious teachings. Establish that the family does not use drugs and there are other healthier ways to enjoy life and fix problems than escaping into a drug haze.\n\nIn doing so, the risks teenagers face against drugs, peer pressure to take drugs and the curiosity of taking drugs can be minimized, thereby creating a harmonious and healthy living environment for teenagers to\nthrive and excel in."

School life can be an enjoyable experience for some while a torture for others. However, everyone needs to experience school life as education is compulsory in Malaysia and it is an offence if we do not attend school.\nMost children enjoy going to school in the early years of schooling. It is the time when they are exposed to people of all walks of life and diverse cultures which they will not be able to experience at home. During their early primary years, children will learn the basics in reading, writing and arithmetic while getting to know new friends. As they progress to later years in primary school, the students will be exposed to more complex subjects like History and Geography. This is to help them to understand the world better.\n\nIn secondary school, they are expected to be independent in their learning. However, it is during this time that they will experience changes physically and emotionally. The teenagers will need to adapt to these changes well as they have school projects and major examinations like Penilaian Menengah Rendah and Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia. It is during this time that they will make major decisions like choosing which stream to study as their decisions will influence their life career.\n\nSecondary school life will expose them to extra curricular activities that help them develop as an individual. Participation in dubs, societies, uniformed bodies and sports activities will develop their leadership skills and stimulate their interests in these activities. These skills and experiences will stand them in good stead in working life. After they complete Form 5 or Form 6, they have to prepare themselves to further their studies in university or college.\n\nSchool life is the time when students discover themselves while gaining skills and knowledge that would prepare them for the real world.

You are the first person I thought of after receiving my SPM results. You have encouraged me to read a lot and to improve my command of English. I was not that fluent before, but you have confidence in me. I read a lot and learnt a lot of new vocabulary. With that, I could write better and managed to achieve 1A in English Language and English in Science and Technology.\n\nI would also like to thank you for motivating me throughout my two years with you. You are my role model. You have given me endless inspiration. You also took me to motivational camps. There were two camps which I could not forget. Those were incredible camps. They were the Summer Camp and the other one is the Science Camp. I benefited tremendously from those camps and I am extremely grateful that you had taken me there. I have developed my self-confidence, discovered my abilities, and am not afraid to go beyond it. Thank you, teacher.\n\nTeacher, you are always there for me. You gave me sound advice when I was having problems. You always listened to my problems, my doubts and my uncertainties. I appreciate it so much. I remembered the time when I did not see eye to eye with Anis, you were there to help us patch up. Thanks to you, we are now the best of friends!\n\nMy mother once told me that a good teacher would not have second thoughts about making sacrifices for their students. I always doubt that. However, you have proven how wrong I was. You sacrificed your money and time for me. You paid my SPM fees when my father couldn't deliver the money on time. I was deeply touched at that time. You were willing to sacrifice your time to cheer me up when I failed my Biology and Chemistry papers in the trial examination. I was stubborn then, and refused to listen to anybody. Nonetheless, you made me listen to you. How could I ever repay you? Only God can.\n\nI plan to go to university and do Pharmacy. It has been my dream since I was small. I love being in the midst of wonder-working drugs, dispensing medicine and helping patients recover. I am sure the course will be challenging but I promise you, I will give my very best and will study extra hard to achieve my ambition.\n\nOnce again, my dear teacher, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to be the best and to be somebody.\n\nYours sincerely,"

I lost count of the number of pictures she took of the animals. she told me that she has several albums, all with pictures of animals !\n\nNext, we went to the Butterfly Farm which is in another part of the city. There, we saw many butterfly species. I was told there are about two hundred species. Wow, that's really lot !\n\nOn Sunday, we went to Prince Shopping Complex. Eun-mi wanted to buy souvenirs and T-shirts for her family and friends. We spent the whole afternoon shopping ! We browsed through practically all the shops and boutiques. By evening, she must have bought a whole cartload of gifts. That night, we had a seafood dinner at a nearby restaurant. the prawn and lobster dishes were really delicious.\n\nI wish you had joined us last weekend. By the way, Eun-mi sends you her regards. I have to stop here. Do write often and tell me how you spend your weekends over there."

I want to share it with you.\n\nThat day, Betty and I were walking home from school. We were passing through a village and taking a short cut. While walking, we heard the crying of a baby. It seemed to come from the bushes. At first, we could not believe our ears. What would a baby be doing in the bushes ?\n\nWhen we got to the bushes, we saw a newborn baby, wrapped in a towel, lying on the grass. It looked so pathetic. My heart felt like breaking into pieces seeing it lying there. Very quickly, I took the baby boy up and carried him. He did not look dirty. His mother or whoever must have just left him there.\n\nAfter some discussion, we decided to bring him to the nearest police station. There, we told the police inspector where we had found the baby. Then, we handed him over to the policeman.\n\nWhen we got home, we related to our parents what we had done. They were proud of us. Mother told us that we had done the right thing instead of leaving the baby there. In fact, we had saved a life. These words made my sister and I feel so happy. Betty told me that that was the happiest day in her life.\n\nWhat about you ? Have you ever saved a life ? If you have, you must tell me what happened. I have to stop here. Goodbye\n\nYour friend,"

In your letter, you asked me about the people and religions in my country.\n\nI am happy to say that my country is a multi-racial country where there is religious freedom. It is home to people of different religions. The different religious groups have very different practices and religious festivals.\n\nThe Buddhists, for instance, observe the first and fifteenth days in the lunar calendar as religious days to offer prayers to Buddha. They go to the temples as early as five in the morning to pray. On these two days, they also fast or observe a vegetarian diet.\n\nAs for the Hindu devotees, they celebrate Thaipusam and Deepavali. When making a wish at the temple, they go through the ritual of praying and then breaking a coconut on the ground. Every day, they light a lamp at the altar of the gods as part of the ritual.\n\nThe Muslim males must attend prayers at the mosque on Fridays. On other days, both males and females pray five times a day. They do it in such a manner that they face the direction of the holy city of Mecca. During fasting month, they exercise self-discipline and fast while preparing for Hari Raya.\n\nAs for the Christians, they attend church for prayer and worship on weekends. Some groups hold Bible classes once a week. they celebrate Christmas in December every year.\n\nI hope I have given you some idea about the different religious groups in my country. Perhaps, you can tell me about yours in your next letter. Goodbye.\n\nYour friend,"

You are thinking of enrolling for this course.\n\nI have read about this course. So based on what I read, I can tell you what I know. Veterinary science is a medical profession that deals with the control of disease in animals. The primary responsibility of a veterinarian or doctor of animals is to look after the health and welfare of animals.\n\nThe demand for veterinary doctors has increased tremendously. More and more people are keeping pets, both for companionship and protection, than ever before. When their pets get sick or injured, they need to go to the veterinarians.\n\nVeterinary doctors diagnose the disease, prevent and control animal diseases, treat sick and injured animals, prevent the transmission of animal diseases to people and advise owners on proper care of their pets.\n\nA veterinarian should have a genuine love for animals. He must also be physically fit as working with large animals requires physical stamina and quick body reflexes. Other qualities are the ability to inspire confidence in animals, power of observation and self-reliance. So you need to ask yourself if you have these qualities before signing up for the course.\n\nYou can read up more about it online. I have to go now. You take care and all the best.\n\nYour friend,"

All your shirts and trousers are too tight now. Your weight gain has made you sluggish and lazy. I'm not surprised that you feel this way.\n\nWell, I have to tell you that you must stop putting on more weight. At your weight now, you are 25 kg overweight. This is going to cause you many health problems.\n\nIt is not difficult to get rid of some weight. All you need is to exercise some discipline. You will also need tons of willpower. Follow a strict program of healthy eating and exercise. Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables for they are a rich supply of vitamins, minerals and fiber. At the same time, you have to go easy on foods that are rich in fat and oil. Avoid sweet food like chocolate and cakes. Such food contains a lot of sugar and this will make you gain a lot of weight.\n\nEating healthy food must be accompanied by good eating habits as well. Take three meals a day at regular times. Eat a low-calorie breakfast. It can be toast and a glass of milk. For lunch, you can have a sandwich and an apple. Cut down on dinner for this is the last meal of the day. You don't need energy to sleep now, do you?\n\nAnd of course, you need to exercise. Take up walking, cycling or swimming. Exercise burns calories and builds up muscle.\n\nI hope you will follow my advice. It is guaranteed to help you lose weight. Do tell me if you have lost some weight. I am waiting to hear the good news. Take care and God bless.\n\nYour good friend,"

We couldn't believe our eyes when we saw the way the seals balanced balls on their noses. They looked so cute. Of course, we were thrilled and at the same time, very amused.\n\nThe next performance was by the monkeys. Guess what they did ? They rode bicycles around a ring of fire. Wow ! They looked so smart in their black and white uniforms. We really enjoyed looking at them. Now I know why many claim monkeys as intelligent beings.\n\nThe most enjoyable performance of the night was the clown act. They sang and danced, performing funny skits. They were so hilarious that we could not stop laughing. we later had picture taken with them.\n\nI have an idea. Come and visit me this weekend and we will go to the circus together.

As an effective means of solving this perennial problem, the government intervened and the GreatKL buses made their debut, replacing the problem-ridden Indreekota bus services in 2004.\n\nIndreekota charged bus commuters RM1 fare for quite a long trip to KL from suburban residential areas. However, GreatKL charged a flat rate of RM2 for the same route. This is double the old fare.\n\nIn the beginning, the bus service of GreatKL was good and punctual. The new buses provided a comfortable ride. Bus commuters were willing to pay the extra fare though it incurred more expenses on transport.\n\nBut all that was soon over. Currently, even though the buses are considered still new, punctuality-wise they are erratic and are getting worse by the day. those who depend on public transport, mainly buses, are left with no choice but to suffer in silence, having to bear the higher fare and suffer great inconvenience at having to wait too long for buses. The reasons often given by the operators are that there are not enough buses or the bus has broken-down somewhere.\n\nGiven this negative scenario, one wonders how the public, particularly the lower-income group, is now going to face up to the reality of having to dig deeper into their pockets. This will happen in view of an imminent fare hike which is bound to happen after the withdrawal of subsidy given to GreatKL Bus Service.\n\nBus commuter,"

We as members of the public should give our whole-hearted support to such an important campaign.\n\nThe main objective of our recycling project is to reduce the amount of garbage in our community. A secondary objective is to encourage the residents in our community to recycle.\n\nOne such recycling program is the Kitar Semula program. Through this program, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government has placed more than 1000 recycling bins and established 65 recycling centers all over the country. The rubbish bins are found in public places like schools, petrol stations and shopping malls.\n\nSadly, there are still many people in our country who are not willing to go through this little inconvenience. To them, it is so much easier to chuck the recyclable materials into the garbage bin. And what is happening? Out of 30% of the solid waste generated by households that can be recycled, only 5% is being recycled. This is discouraging.\n\nPerhaps we should do what is being done in some parts of the United States. If the people do not recycle their recyclable waste, their garbage will not be collected. Moreover, they have to pay per bag of waste generated.\n\nI'm proud to say that the people in my area, Taman Cemerlang, have demonstrate their great support for recycling. We not only recycle but we have also managed to cut down on the amount of waste our community generates.\n\nSo, let us all do our part in this recycling drive. That is by cutting down usage and waste on one hand and recycling on the other. Together we can make our world a better place!\n\nRecycling supporter,"

Our Ministry of Education has introduced the use of Computer Assisted Learning programs in many schools.\nThe use of videos and television certainly improves the learning process among students. Generally, young children and teenagers learn better and faster ,from the small screen than from the printed word. They absorb more from the screen. It does not matter what educational program they are reading or watching.\n\nThrough the Internet and the multiple formats communicated over the web, students have access to new and exciting ways of learning. The computer allows the incorporation of animation, moving pictures and sound into lessons. These multimedia resources present materials which encourage the learner's interaction with the subject matter. Pictures and animations help bring to life principles and content of the subjects they are learning. By so doing, students can take a more active role in their learning.\n\nOne of the advantages of using multimedia resources is they convey information quickly and effectively. In this way, they make students more interested in learning. Moreover, they can learn at their own pace and convenience. All they need is a computer or television and some CD-ROMs.\n\nThe use of multimedia resources in education is widespread today. Its greatest benefit is that it enables a wide range of resources at the learners' disposal. What is happening is for schools to use a combination of class lessons, texts and multimedia resources during lessons."

And others prefer to go for a job that promises elements of glamour and excitement.\nJournalism is actually an interesting and challenging career. It suits those with strong language skills and a passion for writing. Many journalists find great satisfaction in their work.\n\nHere are some guidelines to help those who are thinking of becoming a successful journalist. Firstly, there must be a strong commitment to the job. When joining the company, be it a newspaper or a magazine, trainees during internship must be willing to take time to observe and learn from experienced journalists.\n\nThe period of internship can be a trying one. It is during such time, interns are given the opportunity to demonstrate their talents and skills. To their frustration, they can be required to do trivial tasks such as photocopying, faxing and answering phones. When given writing jobs, they might require researching at home after office hours and writing stories on weekends.\n\nBig or proper writing jobs usually do not become available at the moment they want them. Many successful journalists do freelancing until the right opportunity comes along.\n\nAs journalists, do not just limit yourself to newspaper journalism. You can try out for a job in broadcasting. Most journalists hop between print, magazine and broadcasting many times in their career. Journalists have been known to host their own shows on television while continuously publishing features in the press."

Some people even believe that sending of SMS has become an addiction among them.\nUnlike in the past, people had to arrange an outing beforehand. With SMS, this is no longer needed as it is instantaneous. People are now no longer as difficult to reach as before. Users do not have to arrange for meetings or activities much earlier. Now, they just have to send an SMS to their friends. The message will inform their friends of the meeting, time and place of the meeting.\n\nAs it is so prevalent among youths, there are bound to be many repercussions on them. This is particularly so in the use of language. It is the norm to use short forms in typing an SMS text. Spelling out the entire word or sentence would take up more space. More words increase the cost of sending. Hence short-forms and abbreviations are often used.\n\nSending messages like \"See you tonight at 8.30 p.m.\" could be replaced by \"c u tonite, 830\". In this respect, SMS can have a negative effect on language. Students make use of too many short-forms. Some even carry on with the usage of short-forms in their daily school work and essay answers.\n\nMany youths are addicted to sending or receiving SMS texts. A survey disclosed that some send about fifty or even more every day. This incurs high expenses on the phone bill. Despite these disadvantages, SMS is here to stay. This is due to its benefits of cost, convenience and saving time. It has definitely become a culture among the old and young alike."

However, just as in other forms of communication, some basic etiquette must be followed.\nFor instance, if you ask for something in your e-mail, you should say `please'. Similarly, if someone does something for you, do reply and say `thank you'. Moreover, include enough information in your mail if you send in a question to which you expect an answer.\n\nAfter sending an e-mail, do not expect an immediate answer. Very often, we have to wait for a while before receiving a reply. Just because you do not get an answer from someone in ten minutes, it does not mean that the person is ignoring you. So there is no cause for offence Never send another e-mail to tell the person off.\n\nWhen composing an e-mail message, make sure you read it over before sending it. Spending time on making your e-mail clearer is time well spent and worth your effort. If the sentences are unclear or ambiguous, you have to take some time to rephrase to make them clearer.\n\nLastly, always use a signature for your mail. The signature identifies who you are. You do not want the receiver to wonder who has sent the mail.\n\nBy observing these rules, your e-mail is likely to be well received. The outcome is that you will receive courteous and satisfactory pleasant e-mail too."

Working till late at night, sixty to seventy hours a week is to be expected.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some benefits. Besides enjoying their work, many people in a sports career can get extended time off. For example, those who work as sports masters or teachers in schools have vacation breaks between semesters or during the long holidays.\n\nIf you are interested in checking out a sports career, you have to undergo some type of training first. This is important. This is true in specialized areas such as sports journalism, coaching and sports administration.\n\nTo obtain basic preparation, we have to sign up for an appropriate college program. Many colleges offer courses in sports management, sports medicine, physical education or other related areas. while pursuing the course, it is a good idea to take on a volunteer or part-time role in a sports organization.

There were a ridiculous number of knots to be tied and it was all so complicated. We could smell the salty odor of the waves as the restless tide continuously pounded on our ankles.

Thanks also to the teachers for helping us have such a fun Discovery Week. Without a doubt, going to Pulau Redang was a worthwhile trip. It was full of fun, adventure and self-discovery."

        "content": "It was a bright Sunday morning on 22 April 2014 when 20 members of the Social Society set out by school bus to Taman Cheras for a good cause: to visit the orphans in Rumah Sayang. The Teacher-Advisors who accompanied these caring students were Jenny Ling and John Khoo.\nThe school bus arrived at the venue at about 10 a.m. The Matron, Mrs Edwards, was there to welcome us. The orphans had lined up in the hall waiting for us. The welcome we received from them was very warm and touching.\n\nWe started off with an ice-breaking session. Then, we taught them how to make paper cranes which were stuffed into a lovely glass bottle. It was a lot of fun especially towards the end. As for performances, we witnessed one the orphans, June, dancing to a hip-hop song and 7-year-old Barry sang a Japanese song.\n\nThe children were really adorable. There was a little boy named Rick, who stuck to June and liked sitting on her lap. There were other volunteers there on that day too. There was one group of people who gave them haircuts. Another group of volunteers gave them tuition lessons.\n\nThe trip ended with a lot of hugs, goodbyes and a huge group picture. Overall, it was a great and enjoyable experience and I think some of us are already thinking of visiting them again soon."

        "content": "A workshop related to the science topic 'Know Your Body' was held on 18 May 2014. The science workshop was an experience of a lifetime. In fact, it was a bucketful of fun. It made us understand how precious our body is and how we must take care of it to live a healthy and happy life.\nThe workshop participants were divided into 4 groups consisting of eight members each. We were assigned to accomplish two activities. They were :\n\n1. Body Mapping\n\nThe students in this group were instructed to trace one of their group member's body onto joined sheets of brown paper. From there, they drew the external body. the other group drew an internal body map. They made it scientific and educational by labeling the sketch. Both groups exhibited good skills. The facilitator, Mr Choo, made jokes while they did the drawings.\n\n2. Role - playing\n\nAfter the body mapping, Mr Choo gave the third and fourth groups a specific topic and instructed them to compose a role-play on that topic. Some of the suggested topics were :\n\n i. AIDS - the definition and prevention of HIV/AIDS\n\nii. Effects of a healthy diet on our body\n\niii. How boys and girls change during puberty\n\niv. Plastic surgery\n\nv. Heart Diseases\n\nFirst, each group was given a topic and guidelines to prepare an activity in twenty minutes. Then, the groups had to present their activity in ten minutes to the rest of the students. Their performances were informative and interesting. After each performance, a short explanation was given by Mr Choo. This was to increase our knowledge and understanding.\n\nOn the whole, the time that we spent at the workshop was educational and entertaining. The attendees were kept actively involved. Everyone agreed that it was a great workshop indeed."

A group of students sitting at the front tables were reading.\nThere was a queue of five students at the counter. They were waiting to borrow books. A librarian was attending to them.\n\nSuddenly, two boys from Form Four Alpha started shouting at each other. Their names are Kenny Loo and Fred Tham. They were in the queue too. From their expressions, it was obvious they were feeling angry with each other.\n\nOne of them shouted out some insulting words at the other boy. Soon the two boys started punching each other's faces. The girls who were seated nearby got scared and started screaming.\n\nI was walking along the corridor when I heard the commotion. So I ran to the library. Seeing the boys fighting, I tried to stop them fighting. Meanwhile, the class monitor of Form Four Alpha, Lee Meng Meng, ran to call the Disciplinary Teacher. The teacher, Encik Ahmad, came in and warned the boys never to fight in school again.\n\nOne of the boys, Fred, was hurt in his head. It was bleeding profusely. Encik Ahmad helped him to his car to take him to the clinic. Kenny borrowed a book and got out of the library. The Chief Librarian, Lily Soo, requested the students to be quiet and continue their reading.\n\nReported by,"

        "content": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease often linked to allergies, heredity and environment. It causes airway inflammation resulting in recurring attacks of wheezing, coughing, chest constriction and shortness of breath.\nTo prevent your sister's asthma attacks, you and your family must do your best to ensure that your sister's living environment is clean and well-ventilated. It is good to use exhaust fans or open the windows when showering and cooking. Remind your mother and maid about this when they are cooking. This is to let in fresh air.\n\nDust mites live in sheets, blankets, pillows, mattresses, soft furniture and carpets. So wash your bed sheets and blankets once a week. The same goes for stuffed toys. Wash them every week. After washing, dry them completely.\n\nAs for the carpets, rugs and furniture, tell your maid or whoever does the cleaning, to vacuum the house often. This is to prevent mites around. Mites can cause the children an asthma problem or it can aggravate your sister's asthma.\n\nDo you have pets? If you do, you have to keep them outside. Having a cat or puppy indoors can cause your sister to have an asthma attack easily. Using cleaners, paints, adhesives and air fresheners is not advisable. This is because the chemical irritants found in these products can aggravate asthma. The best thing is to use these products less often and also use them when your sister is not around. If you use these products, try to make sure that the windows or doors are open and that you use an exhaust fan.\n\nBy following these instructions, you can prevent your sister's asthma attacks. In this way, you help her to recover from the illness."

The machine mixes and kneads the dough. Next, turn the dough out of the machine.\nAfter that is done, you have to prepare the walnut filling. For the filling, combine walnuts, brown sugar, margarine, oats and apple pie spice in a small bowl. Mix them well. Then, grease the square baking pan. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 16 x 8-inch rectangle. Next, sprinkle the walnut mixture evenly over the dough.\n\nNow, starting at the long end, roll the dough up tightly. Then, cut the dough crosswise into twelve slices. Place the slices in the prepared baking pan. Before baking, let the rolls rise in a warm place until almost double in size, for about 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 350°F.\n\nFinally, use the reserved 1/3 cup oat mixture and mix it with the flour. Then, sprinkle the mixture evenly over the rolls. Now you are ready to bake the rolls for thirty minutes until they are golden brown. After taking them out of the oven, cool them for five minutes on a wire rack. Serve them warm. As for the other rolls, store them tightly wrapped.\n\nBy following my instructions, you will bake fantastic oatmeal swirl rolls. And now, happy baking!"

It was believed to be the worst flood ever to hit this town area.\nThe roads leading to and out of the housing estate were flooded too. In fact, the whole place looked like a lake. In the morning, when the water level was just starting to rise, children came out from their homes to play in the water. Some daring boys were swimming in the `lake'. Many residents could not leave their homes to go to work. Their children too had to skip school too.\n\nWhen the water was too high for safety, the residents had to evacuate to higher ground. This was in the late afternoon. Rescue boats were sent to transport them. As the boats were insufficient to transport all the victims, some men waded in the shallower parts and walked away from the flooded parts.\n\nAlong the main roads, many cars were stalled in the water. Apparently, water had seeped into the engines. In front of house gates and within the house compounds, cars were stuck there too. The owners had to leave their homes without the vehicles.\n\nThe flood victims were put up at a hear by school which is on higher ground. At times of crisis, the charitable spirit of the community becomes ever more evident. People from other areas came to offer the flood victims help. They donated food and other essentials.\n\nFortunately, the floodwater subsided the next morning. The affected people were seen returning to their homes."

Like many others, I long to hear the sounds of the waves crashing on the beach and feel the soft golden yellow sand under my feet. I simply love the beach!\nMy favorite beach resort is Batu Ferringhi. The scene on Batu Ferringhi beach is something I would love to capture on paper one day. I can see many activities going on in the sea and on the white sandy beach. There are people taking walks, or having picnics under shady trees, children are collecting seashells on the beach and some are building sandcastles. Regardless of what they are doing, everyone looks relaxed and in high spirits.\n\nFor some of them, there is nothing more relaxing than to close their eyes and sunbathe. They just lie in a deckchair, read a book or listen to the radio. Some just want to do nothing. In the clear blue sea, many exciting activities take place. There are people rowing canoes, swimming and fishing. The more adventurous would sea-dive or surf. Along the shoreline, mothers play in the water with their little children.\n\nThe beach is the most crowded in the evening when the sun is setting. As one stands on the shoreline, one can see the horizon and sunset. It is really such a beautiful sight. At night, it is common to see beach parties or barbecues full of happy people. They are dancing, singing and eating, all at the same time.\n\nThe beach is one place I can't seem to get enough of. To me, it is the best place to retreat to after the hectic life in the city. It is there I get my piece of mind and rejuvenation."

        "content": "Good morning, teachers and my fellow students. I have been asked to speak about a new reference book that has been very useful to me in my studies. I trust it would be to you too, which is why I am here today. The book is titled Science Made Simple written by Sharifah Shazana. It is published by Bunga Publications. The author is a famous scientist-turned-teacher who has been a scientist for 10 years before she started teaching in schools. Ever since then, she has taught in secondary schools for 15 years. Her experience as a scientist has enabled her to know the intricate details of science and how to make it simple for learners, coupled with her years of teaching experience.\nLet's move on to talk about why I find the book useful for myself and for secondary students. First of all, the book caught me right from the start through its beautiful cover design. While we are often told not to judge a book by its cover, one could not help but be drawn to this book as the cover design was very well done.\n\nThat aside, I must say I was very delighted to find that the contents of the book is even better than what the cover design portrayed. The author provides very clear explanations for all the concepts and theories given. Theories which are usually viewed as boring and difficult to understand never seemed simpler. The author has the gift of making complex truths simple to understand for the learner. The clear explanations complemented well with the attractive presentation of diagrams and illustrations which made science not only simple but loads of fun!\n\nAt the end of every chapter, there is a variety of exercises to test the concepts and theories the students have learned. These exercises are handy and great for reinforcement of the knowledge the students have acquired. The exercises are also followed by practice question papers which are written in SPM-format to familiarise students with SPM questions. Sample answers are also given as a guide for the students to write their answers in the best format and style.\n\nNot only that, the book also comes with useful tips that are spread out sporadically throughout the whole book. These tips will help students to identify common errors made in examination and how they can better tackle a question.\n\nThe book was also top on the list of bestsellers in our local bookstores. I believe that this is good enough to consider buying the book!\n\nAll in all, the book really speaks for itself. It is an excellent book you would not want to miss out on. I would highly recommend the book to all of you. You can get the book at our school bookstore at just RM9.80 per copy. I am sure you would enjoy the book as I did.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "The wayang kulit or shadow puppet play is performed primarily as a form of entertainment in small towns and villages. In the past, it was usual for an individual or a group of villagers to erect a hut-like stage on which the dalang (puppeteer) performed the shadow play. The dalang had to obtain a performing license from the local police authorities for the performances on specific dates and in the given location.\nThe wayang kulit is an open air performance under the stars. A temporary bamboo platform is constructed in the village square. It has a raised stage on which the puppeteer and musicians sit cross-legged. This `traveling cinema' was popular in villages during the 1970s. A high cloth fence was temporarily erected in a given locality of the countryside, a large screen put up and some admission was charged. The cinema would play in one place over a period of one or two nights and then move on to another location until its planned circuit was completed.\n\nThe dalang is a highly venerated artist who displays enormous physical and mental endurance. He is an orator who must be able to repeat many lengthy texts word for word. In addition, he has to compose and sing songs as well as direct the orchestra that accompanies him. Besides all this, he is a poet-playwright who shares new wisdom in a way that satisfies public taste.\n\nA feature of the performance structure was the ritual opening of prayers and food offerings presented to the spirit world. Following customary practice, the play usually began with incantations and prayers asking for safety and help in avoiding danger. However, this practice had been banned because it is not in accordance to Islamic teachings. Wayang kulit performances are now held solely for entertainment purposes."

Since I was twelve years old, his advice and words have influenced me a lot in the way I look at life and people.\nUncle Bob is a good-looking man with a charming smile and friendly brown eyes. Besides his good looks, he is also very kind and a caring person.\n\nThree years ago, when both my parents were involved in a serious car accident, uncle Bob took on the role as a parent to me. I lived with him during that trying period. He allowed me to stay with him even though his home was not really big. He showed his care and love for me by continuously caring about my health, education and the things that I needed at that time.\n\nI really appreciated the time he spent with me. We used to go on trips together for we have the same love for the sea and sailing. So we would just spend days lazing on the beach playing our guitars or reading our favourite car magazines. Since then, I have always felt grateful towards him. He was like a father figure who would always give me encouragement and advice in order to face any challenges in life.\n\nMy uncle is a special man. He and my father come from a big family of eight children. Knowing that his parents would not be able to afford to send him overseas, he studied hard to obtain a scholarship to get a law degree. While in university, he paid for his books and fees by giving private tuition to primary pupils.\n\nAfter graduating with his law degree, he joined a big legal firm. Through hard work and perseverance, he went on to open his own small firm. Today, he is a successful lawyer who owns a large legal firm with three partners. He is also well respected and known as a kind and compassionate lawyer who fights for justice for the unfortunate."

All of us gathered there were terribly shocked as there was a loud explosion soon after three firemen had entered the building. I was surprised when I heard one of the firemen talk to those who had entered. He was telling them in clear and unhurried tones to go on ahead as the explosion they expected was over. Only then did it strike me that the fire brigade knew more about the fire in one look than anybody gathered there.\n\nAlthough the flames were more than thirty feet high, to my utter surprise, it was brought down within just ten minutes. I noticed that they had a systematic way of attacking the fire and breaking windows to open up safe channels for the fire to be directed before being attacked with the hoses.\n\nThe professional finesse and well-trained casual manner of the firemen really opened my eyes and mind to how much of preparation and guidance they have.\n\nCongratulations on a job done exceedingly well. Please convey my hearty appreciation to the driver.\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely,"

My dissatisfaction leaves me no option but to report this matter for your kind attention and action.\n\nFirst of all, there is a problem of discipline. Those given library duty regularly leave their work stations ahead of time. This denies the students the use of the facilities that become unavailable because of this negligent attitude.\n\nThe quiet required in a library is to facilitate easy undisturbed reading. Sadly, it has become the norm for many students to chat albeit quietly. Nevertheless, the voices carry in the large reading area, becoming a nuisance that denies avid readers the peace they need. Ringing phones and message tones are almost a permanent feature in the library.\n\nMany students may be seen using their mobile devices with scant respect for the sanctity or facility of a library.\n\nI sincerely hope that these minor but serious offenses may be corrected so that the library can fall back to its declared intention, which is to be a place of research, reading and learning."

        "content": "A recent appraisal of conditions at the mamak stall near our school has revealed the following conditions that are a real danger to the students. Being close to the area where parents' cars and the school buses part outside the school, it is a favourite place for students to congregate while waiting for their transport home.\nThe plastic chairs and tables at the stall are not just an eyesore they are also badly in need of washing. Curry spilt while serving and eating are wiped with a dirty smelly rag which badly needs washing. Without a shadow of doubt, it may be assumed that that single piece of cloth can spread unknown germs to the students who eat or drink there. Most of the glasses and plates used are chipped. In their state, it would not be surprising if some student were to inadvertently swallow a piece of broken glass or plate. The danger this is in causing internal injuries can never be taken lightly.\n\nThe cleanliness of the place is appropriately declared by the number of rats, flies and cockroaches that may be seen enjoying life there. When this is noted together with the uncovered food displayed in the glass display shelf, it leaves little to the imagination. The cleanliness issue is further compounded by the fact that the plates, glasses and other utensils are all dip-washed in two large basins and before a final dipping in a smaller basin. Washing without running water raises further health concerns.\n\nThe cook does neither wears an apron or any sort of covering on the head. The servers (it would be blasphemy to call them waiters) in clothes that look badly in needs of washing makes the observant shudder in disgust. The utter disregard for hygiene can be the cause of allergies and diseases. Cases of allergies and diseases from this unhygienic place do not feature in any reports simply because there has been no informal retrieval.\n\nThe place is popular with many school students. It is common to see them have a snack while waiting for their cars or buses. To the observant, this place looks like a disaster waiting to happen. It is sincerely hoped that this report is taken with the same seriousness with which it is written."
