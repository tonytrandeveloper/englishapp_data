        "content": "Why think of road safety at all? It is because of the accidents that occur everyday on the road, in which all sorts of vehicles and human beings and even animal are involved. These accidents mean loss of life and loss of property and more often than not obstruction to traffic. In this age of speed and fast moving vehicles and with the congestion on roads, these accidents have became almost an everyday affair. So unless everybody is educated on the importance of road safety, the loss and the sorry spectacles cannot be avoided.\nPrevention is better than cure. This holds good even in the matter of road accidents. Accidents are due to many causes and may occur under different circumstances. The simplest but at the same time dangerous perhaps is people slipping down on the road caused by an orange or a banana peel. Without meaning any harm, quite innocently a person may throw away the orange peel or the banana skin on the road or the sidewalk. When a person, walking briskly, steps on, it he or she will slip down ending in fracture of bones and sometimes even more dangerous than that. So people must take care they do not throw the pealings on the road but should deposit them in a dust-bin. In some countries the offenders are severely punished. The second cause of accident is due to careless crossing in busy roads. While crossing one must look to the right and left for moving vehicles and then cross.\n\nWhere there are Zebra crossings on the road for the pedestrians to cross, one should cross along them. One should keep to the margin of the road while walking and the vehicles must keep to their lanes in busy streets.\n\nIn the case of accidents involving vehicles there are many causes. One is trying to overtake and very often taking risk. Another is wrong judgment in crossing. Sometimes it may be not caring for the signals. In crowded streets accidents may take place in a snap second because one does not care for the signal. \"Stop, look and go\" is the best precept; it will save vehicles from accidents. But where one takes a foolish step, the result is the inevitable accident. Jay riding may be another cause. Riding two or three abreast is always dangerous. Especially one must be aware of this. Scooter riders become victims of road accidents. But if they just wear the helmet as required by law they could easily avoid fracture and hence death.\n\nVery often the cause of accidents is the failure of the brake system which means the owner of the vehicle does not bother to keep the machine in good condition. By attending to the vehicle regularly a lot of miseries could be avoided.\n\nRoad safety is a matter of education in which the school can play a significant role. Through scouting, Red Cross and social education classes, children can be taught the importance of observing the rules of the road. Children must be taught their limbs and lives are very valuable and they must not take risk, especially when leaving the school. As soon as the bell goes children rush out and accidents do happen. Under the circumstances the teachers must feel it their duty to regulate the traffic near the school. The police can cooperate with the school in this respect.\n\nTo make the people road conscious, the mass media can play a useful role. The newspaper, the wall poster and the cinema and now the TV come in handy. Shots in the cinema or TV emphasizing the importance of road safety can be highlighted. There may be speeches over the radio by the police officials. During peak hours in crowded areas, the police may direct the traffic and ask people to keep to their lanes."

        "content": "Living next to next is the principle of a neighbor. Good neighborliness is the ideal to be aimed at and pursued. People live in the same neighborhood for many reasons. Sometimes it may be aesthetic and very often convenience. It may be the nearness to one's office of work, school, traffic centers and so on. As the saying goes, no man is an island; he has to live with his neighbors. To make life tolerable and bearable one must cooperate with one's neighbor.\nOne's neighbor may be temporary as in the case of traveling by bus or train. Here the neighbor is with one for a few minutes or few hours. Even here if there is understanding between the neighbors the travel will be pleasant. Good neigborliness generates good company and especially during travel it helps to take away the boredom. There are cases when such travel has culminated in longstanding friendship.\n\nWhether one likes it or not, one cannot do without neighbors. Even where houses are isolated as in the case of bungalows there is inevitably the neighbor. Normally one may think one can do without neighbors because one can command all comforts and services, so the services or the need for a friend may not arise. However serviceable the radio or the TV may be in providing the recreation, they cannot supply the human elements. The sympathy, the admiration and the appreciation which a neighbor may offer will have a great humanizing influence. To share one's view and sometimes even one's sorrows one needs some neighbors. Because man is gregarious he cannot live in isolation.\n\nBut all neighbors are not always keeping the cordial relationship. Stresses and strains develop because of misunderstandings. The cause may be very trivial or flimsy, still tension develops ending in animosity and feud. Jealousy may be another cause for such a tension. The neighbor may be doing fine, has earned a lot of money, his children are doing well, he gets quick promotions, these and such others may create jealousy. Once this is generated, this leads to non cooperation and petty quarrels. Very often children may be the cause for strained feelings.\n\nChildren may quarrel drawing the elders into the fray. The neighbor's son may pick a flower or a fruit from your garden and an argument may erupt. Again he may throw his ball at your window pane damaging it. These are not unnatural so far as the younger one is concerned but it is for the elders to view at them with equanimity and make up for it. This may read easy on paper but not so in practical life. But with some broad outlook one must be able to tolerate.\n\nAnother reason for tension may be the animals. Your neighbor's dog may be a real nuisance or his poultry which would come into your garden and eat away the young saplings.\n\nIn all these cases to keep up good neighborliness some understanding between the neighbors is important. Small differences can be easily patched up or ironed out. Care can at times play the good samaritan and helps the neighbors in a small or big way. Nobody is perfect and it is better not to speak disparagingly of your neighbor.\n\nA cheerful word or a nod or a casual enquiry will strengthen the feeling of good neighborliness. Negatively, one must not pry into what the neighbor is or what he does.\n\nTolstoy speaks in one of his stories how neighbors should behave. A child was wearing a new shirt and the neighbor's child threw mud on it and thus spoiled it. Women folk started the quarrel and men folk entered into the fray ending in a few heads broken and so on. By then the children forgot all their quarrel and were playing. Tolstoy draws a moral from the story namely neighbors must be quick to forget small wrongs done.\n\nNeighborliness is not only for individuals but it is important also in a great measure between neighboring countries. History has got a lot to teach in this respect. Unless countries learn to live as good neighbors, there cannot be peace on earth. So children must be taught at home and in the school to cooperate with the neighbors and be friendly with them. The basic principle is to give and take and to develop a sense that the other man has as much right as you have and some degree of tolerance is very necessary."

        "content": "Perhaps the single greatest invention of the century is the computer. The computer is essentially a machine that enables humans to complete tasks that may be time consuming or very repetitive in nature. This it achieves by imitating human thought processes. In much the same way that humans think using pathways in their brains that conduct minute electrical currents, computers too use tiny electrical circuits which tell it what to do. The difference being that computers do this at incredible speeds.\n\nIn this modern age man has grown to be heavily dependent on computers to carry out all kinds of jobs that were done manually before. In banking for example computers allow for millions of transactions to be carried out involving large sums of money which would otherwise require thousands of bank tellers. Computers do the job in a much shorter time and practically free of any errors. Computers are responsible for air traffic control and the running of trains to ensure that travel is made as smooth as possible. In factories nowadays computers operate mechanical devices that produce goods we require for everyday living, in such quantities that would be otherwise impossible to achieve if these factories were run by humans alone.\n\nPerhaps the greatest advancements have been made in the field of communications. All of us are by now familiar with the 'Internet'. The internet is a collection of computer systems and individual terminals linked up worldwide through telephone lines and other channels. It offers a cheaper alternative to communicating with people within a country and internationally through computers. It has also been described as an immense pool of knowledge just waiting for applications it has given rise to a new means for countries to carry on trade with each other through 'E-Commerce'.\n\nIt must however be kept in mind that as useful as computers are. They are not capable of independent thought and still require human input. In recent times scientists have developed' Artificial Intelligence' in computers that may enable them to function independently of man in the future."

        "title": "The pleasures of reading",
        "content": "Animals may have moments of pleasure but only man has got a lot to do with it. It is through our sense organs that we enjoy pleasure. The sense of smell, sight, hearing, touch and taste each brings pleasure. Even the baby as soon as it is born feels the pleasure of sucking and the comfort of being cuddled in the wads of cloth in the mother's lap. But for the pleasing smell we will not be able to enjoy our food. We are thrilled by the sight of ice capped mountains or the roaring water falls of the Niagara. So they are the senses that help us to get pleasure.\n\nThere is no end to the sources of pleasure. But reading for pleasure belongs to a higher order and stands as a category by itself. While external things bring pleasure to the sense organs, reading brings pleasure to the mind. Greater the mind is cultured, greater will be the derived from reading for reading makes a full man.\n\nReading is the end product of writing. Unless there is something written one cannot read. So good writing is a concomitant of reading. Man alone can write, in other words put his ideas in black and white. In fact even before printing came into being man was writing and it is as old as modern civilization. Man can preserve his thoughts and ideas through writing. Thus the whole world of literature is there far one to read.\n\nNow reading material is available for all tastes. A scholar may go through serious writing for the sake of enriching his knowledge. Another may read a magazine or a picture book for whiling away the\ntime. One chooses the reading material according to his moods, his literary background, the time at his disposal and the purpose if any. A teenager may like stories of romance and an old man may prefer books on philosophy and religion. Some gifted with imagination and the faculty to reflect may read poetry.\n\nOne who takes pleasure in reading always tries to build his library. Very often a good library may serve the purpose.\n\nThe greatest advantage in reading is when one comes across great minds. Whether you agree with what is there to read or do not agree there will not be any quarrel. You may pronounce your judgement on the writer. There will be no harm if your judgment is silent and not published.\n\nGiven the proper atmosphere like a good silent place, soft light and comfortable seat, one can read and read and enjoy it.\n\nThere are great masters of writing in all great languages of the world. English Language abounds in such great authors. Again it may be poetry, novel, fiction, drama, travelogue, and letters. Biographies and autobiographies, form a sizable part. In these days of rush good magazines supply the material for reading. For example, one may cite the Reader's Digest.\n\nIn order to enjoy reading, one must cultivate that habit. Reading is not the 'be all' and `end all' of life. Yet, it can be ennobling. There is dignity in reading habit."

        "title": "Obedience to parents and elders",
        "content": "To be obedient is to obey the orders of one's elders and superiors. There cannot be order unless there is obedience. One has to obey the laws of the country, otherwise the society cannot exist. The laws may be irksome, but, for the overall good of the law one must obey them. For instance, the laws to be obeyed on the road ensures road safety. The laws pertaining to property help society continue without hitches and hindrances. Even in our body our limbs obey the commands of the brains unless they are diseased. Obedience is essential for the enforcement of order.\n\nObedience includes obedience to one's parents and elders. Parents are the best well wishers of their children. From their experience, they know what is good for their children. They would never mean ill for them. For the sake of the well being of the children, parents insist on obedience. Obedient children grow into fine children. They are not only loved by their parents but also by others connected with the household and by the neighbours. When children obey parents they are happy.\n\nCircumstances as they may be, parents may set certain norms. Children may not understand their implications, but if they obey, very often they will steer of dangers. For instance, the parent may warn his son of bad company. If the son obeys, he will grow unscathed. The parents may insist on personal cleanliness, keeping things neat and tidy, being regular in studies and so on and so forth. If the boy or girl obeys the parents in such and other things, he or she will surely grow into a finer one.\n\nOf course the parents' example may be forceful enough. If the parent shows how he is obedient, the son will naturally be obedient.\n\nThere cannot be a better story than Casabianca on the deck. The father had asked the boy not to leave the deck until the parent returned. The ship was on fire, the father was dead and other sailors asked Casabianca to leave the deck and escape for life. But the boy would not leave, for father had asked him not to. The fate of the boy could be conceived but Casabianca has become immortal because he obeyed his father.\n\nBeing obedient to parents and elders will have to be followed in life. An obedient servant is always liked and respected. But for the unquestioning obedience of servants big establishments cannot be run. Unless one knows the value of obedience and has been practising it, suddenly he cannot become obedient. Servants who are obedient are preferred to clever ones.\n\nOne may argue that blind obedience won't do good. Where one can prove the other is wrong, strict obedience can be waived. This happened sometimes; a junior may have a brilliant idea and without infraction of obedience he may put up his idea in the appropriate manner.\n\nObedience, just like charity must begin at home. Parents have a duty in bringing up children to be obedient and loving."

        "content": "Soccer is my favorite game. Ever since I joined the school, I have been playing soccer. The luscious grass field is very much suited to run, to roll over and kick.\n\nThe game is played between two teams of eleven players each though sometimes lesser number like six or seven may be there in a team. Among the players of a team, some may be forwards, others mid-fielders and defenders, and one goal keeper. Unlike the other players the goal keeper can handle the ball as the situation calls for.\n\nAs it is a team game, all must cooperate. The forwards must be fast, able to take the ball through the legs of the opponent. The midfielders help not only in defense but also help the forwards in clearing and supplying the ball. Defenders must offer strong defense. The goal keeper must be agile, quick to see, correct in anticipation and should kick the ball high and far.\n\nThere are well established rules and foul play will be penalized. The referee's job is tough and there have been instances when the poor referee has been man handled by the onlookers. It is the bane of the game that the audience turn partisan.\n\nAmong the great soccer nations Argentina, Brazil, England, Russia and Germany are a few. The name of Pelee, the great footballer of all times has become a household word among the soccer fans.\nFootball is a manly game so I like it. Whenever I find time in the evening, I never fail to play for an hour or so. I take the forward position because I feel there is more fun in pursuing and heading the ball.\n\nThose who do not know much about the game say it is a rough game. Of course there are cases of broken heads, muscle twisting and sometimes even fractures. But these are caused when one does not play according to the rules. Of course they are inevitable in a game like soccer. Nowadays people protect themselves with guards. But for the risks the game is all right. If it is all soft then there won't be any game at all."

        "title": "Life in a high-rise flat",
        "content": "Man is the only home making animal. He alone can enjoy the warmth of his hearth and family circle. Man has evolved from tree dwelling to the modern flat. Primitive man was the master of his hut and it was his castle. Till recently the house had been a complex affair. There were the gardens, barn, poultry, cattle shed and so on. The house itself was having different portions spacious enough for all the family members to move about. These villas till recently were popular. Even today we may come across these villas in the countryside.\n\nThere was good neighborliness. In sorrow and joy the neighbor shared. They were helping each other in many of life's needs and operations. They had enough leisure. They had time to sit over a pipe or glass of drink and gossip. In short everybody was known to everybody and the society was in one sense self contained.\n\nBut those days are gone though there may be vestiges in remote places. The onslaught of Industrial Revolution and the growth of industries as a result have caused the birth and growth of towns and cities. Though even in ancient days there were cities, they were the capitals of kings and emperors, otherwise there were not many cities. Any student of history could appreciate this point. So the growth of cities is a modern phenomenon, concomitant to the growth and concentration of industries.\n\nIn an industrial area space becomes scarce and as more and more families pour in they cannot find space for houses. Not only the space but also the cost becomes prohibitive. So an average office goer or a worker cannot have the luxury of owning a house. Still they want some shelter to lay their heads down when they have returned from their office or factory. The answer has been the high rise flats of several floors. They are either built by building societies or by the Housing Boards of government.\n\nThese flats are provided with all facilities like water, electricity, good drainage, airy rooms and so on. In every high rise flat there may be even lifts to take people up and down. In the flats the tenants may be independent.\n\nBut there are more disadvantages in living in a high flat. The movement will be restricted and conditioned according to the circumstances. One may have to live with all sorts of people, the homogeneity which was the rule rather than the exception will be wanting. One does not know who his neighbor is, so though living in the midst of many one may feel lonely. Since all facilities are artificially controlled any breakdown in them would paralyze life. For instance, if there is any defect in the water system, life will be upset. For want of space, one must plan carefully what one must own. Whereas in olden days people had enough space to entertain guests and relatives. It is the children who would suffer most for there won't be enough space for them to run and play about. Unless one has the facility to take them out, they will develop complexes of closed space. Since the cannot easily mingle with other children, there may be blind spots in their character. Living such artificial surroundings may even tell on their health and growth. In short they will feel like caged birds. This may be true of even grown ups.\n\nFurther if there were to be accidents like fire or the breakout of epidemics, the high rise flats will suffer most. From aesthetic point of view also the flats do not add to the beauty of the city.\n\nIn short one may conclude that life in a high rise flat is necessary evil in a big city."

        "content": "What we call life is a very complex affair. It is not simply eating, reproducing and finally dying. Every creature does these. But in the case of man he has to lead a highly complicated life. It is like going through a maze and coming out. He is an economic being and a social animal. He has to earn, make a home, look after his people, attend to his obligations to the society and the Government. So in order to be successful, in all these, he has to develop certain qualities.\n\nWhat do we mean by saying a man is successful? If in his occupation he can do satisfactorily both for himself and others then he is successful. He must be able to look after his people and bring up good children. If he becomes a professional man like an engineer, doctor or lawyer, making money should not be the only criterion; he must also be able to satisfy his clients and be honest at it.\n\nIn order to be successful one should develop certain qualities. At first he must realize his purpose; in other words what he would like to be. This is the crux of the problem, for the choice does not come to him. Parents decide it very often for them. Let us suppose he decides to be somebody in his life. Once having decided he must work for attaining certain standard in that line. Only hard work would make him fit for the job. It is rightly said that it is 5% inspiration and 95% perspiration. One must deserve before desiring. One must remember one's education does not stop with the school or college. it is a life long process. Professional people must keep themselves up to date.\n\nThen one must get on with others. In the chess board of life one may find himself in any position; it may be the all powerful queen or simply a pawn. It must be remembered that given the chance, even a pawn can destroy a queen. This means in a complex society, everyone finds oneself in a particular position; there may be some above and some below. One need not be favoring and flattering those above and be arrogant with those below. \"What can I do for you' is the correct attitude and having done it go about your duty. In getting on with others sweet temperament is really an asset; then only others will like to transact with one. One must not be easily irritable nor give irritants to others. Then one must be reliable. One may be clever but if he is not reliable, he cannot achieve success in a great measure because others will have very little to do with him.\n\nAnother important quality that would make up for success is doing things then and there. Procrastination is the thief of time. Postponement of doing things means swelling of work for the next day. A small chink may be easily closed today but tomorrow it may be late. If we analyze the life of successful people we could easily see they have been through and never postponed doing things.\n\nStill another quality is not to argue. The other may be really wrong. By pointing out that he has been wrong you are not going to improve matters, on the other hand you can help him correct. Arguing not only takes away precious time but also causes irritations. Especially one's superior may not like situation something like this. 'You may be right, sir', or 'This is all right', but 'what about our alternative' and so on.\nOne must be capable of learning from experience. One must be able to learn from the mistakes of others. Only when nations and individuals fail to learn from the past mistakes, they are ruined. History is replete with examples."

        "title": "Precious water",
        "content": "Water is one of the things we need most besides air, and thank god water is plenty generally speaking, because three fourths or so of earth's surface is covered with water. This is only a general fact and not all places on earth are having enough water and healthy potable water is a rare commodity. Rivers may bring water and lakes may be having it. From the health point, they may not be fit for drinking. Most of these waters are contaminated and may contain mineral as well as organic impurities, and sometimes epidemic spreading bacteria like those causing cholera and typhoid. Nowadays the chances of contamination of water sources are quite common with industries coming up and sending out their effluents indiscriminately. So to make these waters potable they must be treated before being supplied to a population.\n\nTreating water and supplying it to a town or city means cost. The water has to be filtered for suspended impurities and then chlorinated and then pumped to a storage tank from where the water is distributed through pipes. So one must remember that when one draws water from the tap, one is actually buying or paying for water. This has become inevitable with the growth of cities and towns.\n\nOnce we bear in mind we will be careful in using water. There are many ways in which water is wasted. The tap may be leaky whereby water may be spilled. That means some periodic attention must be paid to the plumbing and leaky taps. The tap may be open and the water running out and nobody would care to stop it. Unless there is need, the tap must be kept closed. This must be particularly remembered when one leaves home on holiday, otherwise throughout their absence water may be flowing out. Just as we see if the electric mains are off when we are away for some time so too is the water tap.\n\nMajor part of the water is used for bathing, washing, and cleaning. In all these needs water must be prudently used, Take bathing for instance; when one is scrubbing or applying soap to one's body the shower need not be running. Water economy must be remembered in the use of bath tubs. One need not be a Rhino to be in one's bath for hours on end. This prudence in the use of water may be practised in washing and cleaning. Since these consume a lot of water, the municipal corporation, if it is affluent and water is in plenty, can have a separate system supplying water for washing and cleaning alone.\nThe industrial houses must not be allowed to draw from public water system for their industrial use except perhaps for drinking water.\nOne must bear in mind when one wastes water one is depriving another of his share of water.\n\nGood water may get scarcer in days to come. With the advent of rapid industrialization contamination of water sources poses a threat. So the industrial people must feel it their duty not to add to water pollution. In areas of acute water scarcity steps may be taken for recycling water.\n\nRemember one of the casualties of the so called modernization is that we have to pay for nature's goods of which water is one."

        "content": "Let us cite some examples of accidents at home. Cutting, burning, scalding, hurting to cause fractured, bones and getting electric shock are some of them. These may happen anywhere, in the kitchen, in the bathroom, or on the staircase.\n\nThese accidents may lead to temporary disablement or permanent ones. Sometimes they may prove fatal. So as in many cases in life it is always better to prevent them; hence the proverb 'prevention is better than cure', but one must be aware of the cure also.\n\nLet us consider the preventive aspect first. One must be careful in using cutting instruments in the kitchen. One must learn from those who have experience how to use the knives, manglers and so on. Care must be taken in handling hot things. Use good tongs to remove hot vessels from the oven. Hot things must not be placed anywhere, otherwise one would get scalded. Steam causes a greater injury than hot water so one must be careful where steam is involved. Since pressure cookers work on steam one should be careful when removing the lid of the cooker. So too with hot oils. Here care must be taken not to add water to hot oil when it is on open fire because it will catch fire.\n\nFalling down by false step is another accident. Bathrooms, poorly lit landing places, ill fixed mattresses on the staircase are worst offenders. Oil drops or soap bits must not be dropped down in the bathroom as these may help slipping down. The staircase must be well lit so that no false step is possible. The mattresses must be well fixed. Fall from ladder and stools are common. Unless there is somebody to hold or unless the ladder is well fixed, one must be very careful in using ladders. Trying to reach a higher point from a ladder always results in slipping down. So too with stools; broad based three legged stools are to be preferred to four legged ones because of the stability of the former. Electrical wiring must be periodically checked. Frayed wires must be removed. When handling electrical equipment it is always advisable to have the mains off. Too many leads may not be taken from a single pin point as it results in heating and hence some accidents. Electrical appliances must have insulated or protective handles. When using the electric iron it is better to stand on a rubber sheet or dry wood plank. No wet cloth must be hung on any electrical wire for, in case of any leakage, it would prove fatal.\n\nMedicines must be kept away from the views of children and kept under lock and key. Otherwise they may be tempted to swallow or drink the wrong medicine and may prove dangerous. Youngsters must be taught how to use knives and other sharp instruments. Nowadays gas is being used for cooking. It must be seen that there is no leakage of gas lest there would be some explosive accident. Children must not be allowed to play with the valves for even breathing of the gas is dangerous. Beware of leakage of gas.\n\nIn all these cases by being a bit careful, many an accident can be avoided."

        "content": "A sick man is a nuisance for himself and a nuisance for others about him. A sick person cannot go about his duties efficiently. He will not be able to work hard and he may not be mentally alert also. If he is regularly sick others will suffer in many ways. Indirectly it is a strain on the government because it will have to run more hospitals for the sick. Economically a nation whose people are often sick cannot be strong because the hours of work will suffer. Look at the Europeans and the Japanese. They are hardy and are capable of longer hours of work, which means more wealth to the nation. That is why even after being beaten in a devastating war Germany and Japan have become rich nations once again within a period of thirty years.\n\nOf course climate may be one reason why certain people are not keeping fit. It may be due to hot moist climate, or mosquitoes and other pests. But where man cannot improve upon natural causes he can try to keep himself fit by trying overcome them. For instance by eradicating malaria, one can be healthy in such areas where malaria was once prevalent.\n\nLet us now look into the ways of keeping fit. First and foremost is the diet. Unless one takes a proper, balanced and nutritious diet one cannot be healthy. It is said that a large part of the population in the third world suffers from malnutrition which means wrong diet as well as insufficient diet. While this may sound a social problem, it is also an individual problem. One must take care what he eats and how he eats. One must plan to diet in such a way that it is well balanced, meaning it should contain the necessary quantity of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, vitamins and so on. He must keep his surroundings clean and neat, which is called environmental sanitation. He must be regular in his personal habits like answering calls of nature, bathing and so on. Even one's clothing contributes to keeping fit.\n\nKeep fit also means how a man lives, his hours of work, his sleep, rest and relaxation. While everyone has to work to deserve his food, it should not be all work. There must be hours of relaxation. It may be some reading, playing with children, taking a stroll or taking up a healthy hobby. Hobbies play a major role in keeping one fit.\n\nThe mental attitude also is greatly responsible for keeping fit. One must take to work like a fish to the water. One must be swinging like a wheel in his work. Work can be play and play can be work. So if one were to take to his work cheerfully then no worry about his keeping fit. Laziness, envy and jealously are some of the reasons which make one hate his work, and in the long run he becomes unfit.\n\nTo keep fit some physical exercise is necessary. This may be according to the age of the person. Some out-door exercises like running, jumping, swimming or climbing are for the hardy youth. Walking and jogging are good for the old. Some fruitful occupation like gardening may give the required physical exercise but also contributes to the mental satisfaction.\n\nAbove all, to keep fit depends on one's attitude towards life. If one can accept success and defeat equally then one is said to be a fit person. Even choosing company may contribute to keeping fit.\n\nFinally it means to avoid bad habits like smoking, drinking, doping and so on. One must be warned against these as they make holes in one's pocket as well ruin one's health."

        "content": "There are days in one's life when everything can go wrong. He can get into trouble at every move. I had one such day last week.\n\nIt was Friday when I woke up at 7 a.m. The sun was already bright. I had to be at the bus-stop at the latest 7.15 to reach school by 7.30 a.m. I rushed to the bathroom for a quick wash and turned on the tap. There was no water, it was dry! However, I managed with a pail of water, which my mother had left there the previous night. I quickly dressed myself up and slipped out of my house without mother's knowledge. I knew my mother would be angry for what I had done that day.\n\nI reached the bus-stop within five minutes. Alas! the bus had gone a few seconds before. I concluded as there were no students at the bus-stop. I had no choice but to call a passing taxi. I was lucky to get one and jumped into it. I cheered up thinking that I would reach school on time. When I put my hand in my pocket to pay for the taxi fare, I was horrified to find the pocket empty. I had no money! \"What shall I do?\" As the taxi stopped at the gate of my school, I met my form teacher. I explained to him my situation and he was kind enough to help me pay the fare. I was much relieved and ran to the class. I regained my spirit when I found that I had reached school before the bell.\n\nThen I noticed something peculiar. I was the only student around. \"Am I late after all?\" I quickened my steps, suddenly I heard a shout \"What are you doing here?\" I turned back and saw my principal standing in front of me. \"Why are you late for school?\" When I looked at my watch it showed 7.30 a.m. \"I am not, Sir,\" It is just 7.30 now. I realized then my watch was running ten minutes late. \"Your watch doesn't show the correct time, boy; you better hurry to your class now,\" I blushed at the thought of my blunders and cursed my luck. My teacher reprimanded me for being late for lesson."

        "content": "I believe that in this day and age when competition is rife among young people to get ahead in life, it is important to get an early start. One should know what one wishes to do with one's life. To this end it is wise to seek advice from one's elders as well as to research the areas of work you might have an interest in, inclination or aptitude for. The idea is to be exposed to as many views as possible. Professional counselling or 'Career Days' may be helpful in this regard.\n\nI am fortunate I suppose in that I am reasonably certain what I want to do with my life. I wish to. be a lawyer for I believe it to be a noble and dignified profession. It affords one the opportunity to be of help to others. To a large extent my uncle, who is a lawyer, is responsible for my choice of careers. My uncle has been practising law for the last twenty years and I find him to be knowledgeable in a great many things. My uncle is always fond of saying that a lawyer's trade always involves him having to know about what other people do as well. To put it another way my uncle may be described as a 'Jack of all trades'. Acting on his advice and that of my parents I have decided to work very hard in school so ultimately I will obtain results that are good enough for me to enter the National University. I will have to work hard as places for this course are limited and also much sought after.\n\nAt the moment however in Singapore there are a rather large number of lawyers and not everyone has a chance to work in the area he or she has trained for. This does not discourage me although it is a source for some concern for my parents. I am planning to take subjects in school that will be suited for my intended course of study in university. Although some may say that it is still much too early for me to narrow my choices or options in this way, I am committed to my goal."

        "content": "One of the symbols of civilization is the many gadgets which one finds in a modern home. Many of these are acquired for the sake of fashion; some really for the convenience as they are efficient and time saving. Nowadays even an average home of middle class family has many of these gadgets.\n\nTake the kitchen for instance, there is the gas stove which works on Liquid Petroleum Gas. The stove is efficient, smokeless and at the same time comparatively cheap. Only one must be careful to see that there is no leakage of gas which would prove fatal. There are wet grinders and dry grinders which take away the chores of the housewife. In highly sophisticated homes they may have even dish washing machines. Then there is the fridge. This comes very handy for keeping things cool, for avoiding things getting putrid or stale, for preserving things and so on. Thus milk, fruits, vegetables, meat and fish are preserved. There is the electric toaster for toasting bread.\n\nThen there are other gadgets of utility like the electric iron, and sewing machine. The electric iron is helpful in pressing things; otherwise one will have to wait on the laundry which is very costly nowadays. The sewing machine is very useful since the family's clothes could be made provided of course the housewife at home takes interest in sewing and stitching. With the machine, the work becomes easy and in fact with some modifications in the machine many types of stitching could be done.\n\nThen there are the gadgets of recreation, like radio, television and disc and cassette players. To know the daily news and for hearing music the radio comes in handy. The disc and cassette players have taken the place of the gramophone disc; one definite advantage being the disc or cassette could be made and unmade. Music or speech could be easily recorded on the magnetic disc or tape. While the radio could be played only during stipulated hours, the cassette player has no such limitation. Now the disc and cassette players and the radio are found in one.\n\nThe rage of the day is television. Since it has the advantage of sound and vision it takes the place of the cinema. One can enjoy a program from one's easy chair or couch and one need not take the trouble to go to the theater. The color television makes things more realistic. Video cassette recorder is another device to watch programs of one's choice, particularly movies.\n\nBut one big question that often comes to the mind is, if a man is really happy with all these gadgets. There is always the law of compensation which works inexorably. Without the coming of gadgets man may not find much use for his hands and creativity may suffer. Unless one knows to shoot the periodical trouble with these gadgets, simply owning them may mean costly."

        "content": "One of the human faculties which distinguishes him from others is that he is able to dream. However, one is not sure whether other animals dream; if at all they dream they have no medium to express it is just as the human. Every human being should have had dreams, some of them very pleasant, some of them bizarre and horrible; in the latter case a few have a hell of a life and they call it the nightmare. In a nightmare one may feel as if he is being choked or being drowned.\n\nIn a dream one feels all one does in wakeful hours, only the body does not move. Sometimes limbs may be moved and people have been seen to beat down their hands. Some cry and laugh, some shiver and weep. So dream is in a sense a semi-conscious state between sound sleep and wakefulness.\n\nIt should be interesting to know how dreams are caused but there are no valid theories. One thing is sure that something has been built up in the inner recesser of brains which get active accumulating concomitant interests. Very strange things appear in dreams for which there is no valid explanation. One thing is clear; some nerve center is stimulated, how God only knows, as a result many other nerve centers get into operation bringing in a chain of experiences. Things move fast and clear as on a cine screen and the subject taking part in it. The ancient belief was that some dreams foreshadowed the coming events. How far it is scientific we cannot say. Shakespeare uses dreams in his plays; for example in the play Macbeth.\n\nI too dream and had one recently, which may be of interest. I become a ruler of my country. Suddenly I find myself at the head of a procession, to be correct it is a motorcade and I am in a Cadillac. Huge crowds, men and women and children all in their fine dress line the route through which I am taken. There are victory arches and flags and festoons. Photo flashes burst and hundreds of photographers take pictures of mine.\n\nAt last I enter a massive mansion; the guards present me the honor. I am taken by well dressed courtiers to the throne. The reception hall is big and spacious; there are glittering windows and doors, and colorful chandeliers are hung from high roof. Colored light beams into the hall as sunlight filters itself into the hall thorough stained glass panes.\n\nAs soon as I sit on the throne, the courtiers cry 'long live the King'. Then a man approaches me; he may be the chief minister. He tells me respectfully that I must announce my concessions to the people who eagerly wait to hear me speak. I am a bit nervous at first but get over it soon. I tell them that the old system of paying one sixth of one's income as tax will come into use. I add that the tax may be paid in kind. I announce that there won't be any admission fee to go into theaters and the Government itself will run all the theaters and only healthy films will be exhibited. At one stroke I abolish child labor and education of children will be completely manned by the Government. I make it known that every town and village will have a play field where the young can play and the old can relax. The production of milk in the country would be stepped up so that everybody gets enough milk. I exhort the youth to develop robust health and sharpen their intelligence.\n\nThis dream did not continue long as my alarm clock began chiming, and it was time for me to get up and study. The sweet dream vanished like the snow before the morning sun but that was the best dream I ever had."

When a man returns after a travel to his country he must be bubbling with enthusiasm and his heart must be pulsating with joy to land on his native soil. We have heard of great martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the sake of their country. So it is only proper and fair that one should love one's country.\nThere are many things why one must be proud of one's country. It may be due to the climate, natural regions, its people and the government, its tradition and culture and manufactures. The relation which the country has with other countries is also a point to be considered.\n\nConsidering the above norms let me say why I am proud of my country. My country has an equable climate. We are having bright sunshine throughout the year and plenty of rain. There are virgin evergreen forests. There are some good rivers, and hills and valleys make the country beautiful. The sea coast is not straight but has bays so there are some good harbors.\n\nOur people are quiet, hard-working and peace loving. They know their land gives them plenty in the form of grains and fruits and so one need not be hungry. The forests have natural wealth and the plantations are rich producing money spinning rubber. Our mines produce valuable tin making the country rich. We are a developing nation and a lot of good things will have to be done.\n\nWe have a good government which is democratic in set up. We have had a succession of enlightened rulers who have taken measures for improvement. The upheavals we see in some countries are practically absent in our country and the people are law abiding.\n\nOur country has had a long history of several centuries. Several cultures have flowed in here and so there we see a mixed culture. This is reflected in the way people dress and eat; the buildings show the effect of these overriding cultures. Our country has very friendly relation with the neighboring countries and we are held in high esteem. Considering all these I am proud of my country."

        "content": "Fashion trends often dictate what we wear and how we act. When one thinks of fashion the idea of trendy clothes come to mind. However this is not the only concept of what constitutes a fashion trend. As an example in the nineteen sixties it was considered fashionable in America for men to wear their hair long, also people spoke in an altogether different manner using a lot of slang expressions such as 'groovy' or 'cool' to signify that something was agreeable to them.\n\nIn present day Singapore we can see that fashion trends have a dominating influence among our teenagers. Most of these trends originate from the West. Bell-bottomed trousers for both sexes once all the rage in the sixties are making a comeback on our shores. Platform shoes although very hard on the feet are very popular too, to complete the look. Perhaps most striking is the way the young people and some older ones have taken to dying their hair blonde, red and even green. Fashion trends in themselves may not be harmful unless taken to extremes, for example, piercing one's eyebrows or eyelids even. They are often merely a way for teenagers to express their individuality.\n\nWhat is sometimes insidious about these trends are that they help to promote a strong sense of wanting to belong which can have negative aspects. Peer pressure may be responsible for compelling young people to do things they would otherwise not indulge in if not for the fear of being a 'fashion outcast'. It is considered fashionable for young people to be seen at trendy night spots just as it is fashionable among some circles to consume the drug 'Ecstasy' because of it's ability to induce a feeling of non-fatigue.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that teenagers are at a very susceptible time in their lives when the wrong influences can easily take root and express themselves as hostile attitudes or rebelliousness. To a large extent we have to depend on teenagers to make the right choices based on the guidance we give them."

The school is lucky in having hard-working and intelligent members on the staff with an all rounder as Headmaster. In academic as well as sports our school has always been in the top of the list.\n\nFor National Day Celebrations, the Minister of Education was invited. He readily accepted the invitation. There was a tremendous preparation going on for a week for the celebration. A face lift was given to the school. Flags and festoons were hung up and in view of the Minister's visit invitations were sent to prominent persons of the town.\n\nThe festive day came. Our school hall where the guests were to be seated was tastefully decorated. The guests were received at the entrance by the Headmaster and the committee members of the school. The school band was in attendance. The Secretary of the school led the chief guest to the seat.\n\nAfter a formal prayer, the Headmaster read the welcome address in which he expatiated on the services of the honorable minister for education. One of the senior students garlanded the guest. Then the guest addressed the gathering.\n\nAt the outset he had a few words of praise for the school. He spoke highly of the members of the staff who had been working hard to make the students good citizens. Then he spoke of the greatness of the country which was shaping well in all fields. He advised the students to work hard and become great citizens because he said the future of the country depended on the quality of its citizens. So the students as future citizens must become big mentally, physically and spiritually. He exhorted the students to develop a national outlook and at the same time they must develop their faculty to appreciate the international situation. He asked them to be prepared to contribute their part for the well being of the country. He advised the teachers to look for the aptitude of students and develop their skills accordingly. He asked the students to spend more time in the laboratory, in the library and on the play fields. He said that an industrious nation would always flourish.\n\nOne of the senior members of the staff thanked the Minister for having come and for giving some valuable advice. He assured the minister that the teachers would play their part well and would not lag behind in doing their duty to the country.

Unlike the advertisements in the news papers, a fashion show has the glamour of music, color, light and all theatrical effects. Since live models are used, it becomes very realistic and the audience has got a chance to see, discuss and criticize, and have some fun at the expense of the models. So there is no denying the fact that the fashion shows have become the fashion of the day and they have become pace setters of a fashion.\n\nThus recently I had an occasion to attend a fashion show organized by the Textile Mills Association and the Garment Makers' Guild. This was held in the City Hall on a Sunday so that more people could attend. The hall was very tastefully decorated. The stage was set in such a way that the models could be viewed to advantage. The lighting was first class with concealed lights and provision for color lighting. Admission was by special invitation; otherwise the organizers could not control the crowd. Since my father received an invitation, we went to the show. Soft music was played to enliven the show.\n\nThe models were selected ones who had been taken for their attractive personality. There were men's, women's and children's models. One by one they paraded on the stage and when they came there and walked across the stage showing their dress to the audience, some salesman at the microphone would describe the fabric, the name of the mill that had produced it and the name of the fashion. At the same time, printed forms of the fashion was distributed to the audience.\n\nMen wearing office dress, casuals, hunting dress, sports wear and dinner dress appeared on the stage. The Olympics suit especially created for the Olympic games was shown. A team of athletes wearing the suit paraded on the stage. Women in all types of dresses both oriental and occidental were there. The materials of which their dresses were made varied from cotton to polyester. There were women wearing Indian sarees, Japanese Kimonos, Bikinis and swim suit and Maxi's. There was also a model who was wearing a casual dress made of paper. The announcer said that the paper dress was cheaper and disposable and it could be used in the operation theatres and so on.\n\nIt was not all a show of the grown ups. There were children between three and eight, both boys and girls who presented the latest version of children's wear. Some of the children who appeared on the stage were very smart and they enjoyed the fun.\n\nWhat attracted me most was the beach dress which when worn could give a camouflage effect. Besides it was said that the material was waterproof, non smelling and light.\n\nIt was a delightful show and the audience had an enjoyable evening. The fashions book which was for sale was in great demand. So there is no gain saying that I too enjoyed the show very much."

Our parents are a very loving couple who adore the company of each other. But we brothers and sisters felt that something must be done to celebrate the occasion of silver jubilee of our parents' wedding.\n\nWhen we broached the topic our parents smilingly brushed aside the idea; nor were they keen on the celebration. They seemed to feel to be a man and woman, a blessing of God and this fact need not to be trumpeted. But we insisted on having a celebration; only we needed their blessing. After some serious thought they gave us their consent to go ahead.\n\nOnce we got the permission, we had to prepare for our program. But we agreed that whatever we would do, it must be secret till the day so that there might be a surprise on the day.\n\nSo we sat and planned. My eldest sister said that we could present some memento in silver which would be apt for the occasion because we were going to celebrate 25th year of the wedding. She went even to the extent of suggesting what could be the article. It might be a carved silver plate or a silver tea set. She felt rightly too that the gift must be one which could be of some use instead of being confined to the showcase, as memory.\n\nBut I thought of throwing a party for selected friends and relatives. This would be an occasion for a get together and free mingling when we could hear our elders talk about the good old days.\n\nMy younger brother had some nice ideas to put forward. He spoke of arranging a picnic when we could freely enjoy nature's beauty while at the same time pay homage to our parents. As an alternative he said we could re-enact the marriage of our parents. That would bring great fun and perhaps my parents themselves could enjoy the joke. But we were doubtful how far our parents could comply.\n\nI had almost a novel idea and said that the money we hoped to spend might be made into an endowment, so that the income could used for some good purpose. However laudable the proposal was, all of us could not agree to it because the amount we hoped to spend might not be that big and then there was no meaning in getting the money from parents to be reinvested.\n\nThe discussion was long and nothing final could be decided because each one of us had our own views. Then we struck a golden means of taking something from each one's suggestion. We finally decided to give father a nice unbreakable brief case, to mother a silver framed mirror and a silver jug. We decided also that we could hold a small party of selected friends and relatives. The idea of picnic which the younger fellow so vociferously advocated was, not dropped either. It was clearly understood that we could go to a pleasure spot not far away from our town.\n\nHaving planned thus we unfolded it to our parents who felt very happy and promised us help in the execution of the plan."

Would it not be better perhaps to learn the languages more commonly spoken in our part of the world? In fact the most populous country in the world is China which accounts for more than fifty per cent of the world's population. the Chinese people don't speak English but rather Mandarin or their individual dialects.\n\nThe answer would be that traditionally the cultures of the world have come to be. broadly classified into two groups the Western and the Eastern cultures. English has come to represent the means of communication in the West. With more and more gateways being opened to Asia it is imperative that one language be adopted to suit our needs. As the people of Asia speak a diverse variety of languages it would appear that English would be the logical choice.\n\nIn Singapore, English is the National Language in a country with a mixture of races. Singapore is also a focal point for trade with the West in this part of the world. English is taught as a language in our schools to reflect it's importance in our society. If this were not so, there is a good likelihood that in time the strong influence of individual cultures here would result in people only being well versed in their mother tongues. However Singapore being a former British Colony and the present education policy have seen to it that most Singaporeans are bi-lingual, that is able to speak English as well as their mother tongues.\n\nAnother factor which has promoted the use of English as a medium of communication here in Singapore is the rather significant expatriate community here. The process of globalization is not restricted to trade alone but also covers all aspects of our life. The important thing to remember however is that we should not sacrifice or compromise on our unique cultural identity in order to keep up with the pace of globalization."

It is sheer arrogance not to admit our dependence on other animals. They contribute not a little to our welfare. Even the so-called wild animals have some part to play in our lives on earth. Now let us see how some animals help man.\n\nThe first and foremost is the cow. Who can deny that one does not enjoy a cup of milk? Next to the mother's milk, the cow's milk is the best for all, especially for children and the sick. From milk, butter, cheese, ghee etc. are made. Skimmed milk is also nutritive. Further, milk goes into the manufacture of sweets. The male of the cow, that is the ox has been used as draught animal from time immemorial. So the farmer uses it for ploughing his field, and for pulling his cart.. Milk is so valuable and in great demand that dairy farming has come to be one of the major industries. The animals are slaughtered for their meat. Some countries like Australia, Argentine and the United States have vast cattle ranches which supply world's meat.\n\nNext to the cow is the horse. Man's civilization has a lot to do with the horse. Till recent times, the horse was used for riding, ploughing and pulling carts. In olden days, armies were proud of their cavalries, that is horse troops. Even today horse races are very popular and perhaps a costly pastime. The race horses are worth thousands of dollars. The horse is a very noble animal and very sensitive too. The Arabian horses are famous even today.\n\nThen we may mention the sheep. In the matter of number and use, the sheep stands foremost. The sheep supplies man with wool for his clothing and meat for his table. In cold countries the sheep thrives very well and the wool is found very useful in the manufacture of warm clothing. The lamb is a symbol of innocence.\n\nThe list will not be complete without the mention of the dog. The dog was as wild as the wolf. How it came to be domesticated, is a matter of speculation. But one thing is certain, from the dawn of civilization, the man and the dog were friends. They have found each other's company useful. No other animal is so faithful and sincere as the dog. There are very many kinds of dogs. Some are good at hunting; some are vigilant and house-keepers. Some are beautiful and so kept as pets. The dog's sense of smell is so highly developed that it is used by the police in tracing criminals."

Why is it so? There are many reasons for such accidents. For instance, there are the fast moving vehicles. In big cities speed and greater speed seems to be the rule. So when one vehicle tries to overtake another, gruesome accidents may be the result. It is not uncommon to read in the news papers that on festival days, good number of accidents occur. As a result there will be a number of deaths.\n\nAnother reason, perhaps a major one, is the lack of road sense, among pedestrians. Every one must use the road but everyone should also know how to use the road. The pedestrian and the cyclist are often the victims of road accidents because they don't keep to their end of the road. School children must therefore be taught how to take to the road. The cyclists are very often the victims of their own folly. They indulge in gay riding, two or three abreast obstructing the vehicular traffic. The result is, as one understand the accident.\n\nAnother cause for road accidents, is the unmanned level crossing. The train may be coming. A car or a cab would try to cross the level crossing and would be hit. So a lot of precautions must be taken at level crossing. They should on all accounts, be provided with gates and perhaps also alarm signals.\n\nMechanical troubles may be another reason for road accidents. The motorist will not be able to control the vehicle, hence the accident. To avoid accidents periodical check up of public vehicles must be insisted on.\n\nAnother cause of the accidents is the poor vision due to fog. This very often happens in cold countries. To avoid this, warnings are being given about the fog condition and visibility. On wet roads sometimes, the tyres skid, resulting in accidents. To avoid accidents, as in the case of health, prevention is always better than cure."

        "content": "Vandalism is wilful and deliberate destruction of public property by anti-social and irresponsible citizens. It can be of various forms. It is not uncommon to see that the walls of buildings are defaced with scratches or ugly marks. Another target of vandalism is the bus shelter. Scratches on the newly painted seats or even broken seats at these shelters hardly escape the attention of those who wait there for the bus. If we travel by bus we will find that seats are often ripped open and the foam pulled out or vulgar writing on the back of seats.\n\nWhat causes this kind of behavior? The reasons are many. Some youths show hatred for the society and its values. These irresponsible citizens out of frustrations in life are tempted to do these undesirable acts of vandalism. They do not have a sense of belonging or loyalty towards their society or nation. In some cases it could be for drawing attention to themselves or just a desire to see their names written in prominent places.\n\nVandalism is not exclusive in our society in Singapore, it could be a social ill in other countries too. Although there are strict laws to prevent vandalism in every country it is rather impossible to enforce the laws strictly. One way to eradicate or reduce the rate of vandalism is to instill civic sense into the citizens, besides of course, the introduction of compulsory education up to the age of sixteen. Vandalism can be curbed to some extent if the government law imposes severe penalty on those caught in the act. But the permanent solution is inculcating the right values including respect for public property in all the young citizens. If people start regarding that public property is their property, they will not want to spoil it. Schools can provide a healthy atmosphere for children to form healthy attitudes and this in turn would make them realise the values of discipline in life.\n\nAll of us should realize that we deprive our children of their heritage if we deface beautiful things and damage public property."

It is filled with a crowd of mainly buyers.\n\nThe Central Market in Kuala Lumpur is not only a landmark but is also one of the best attractions in the city. It is really an experience to go round the stalls during their busy hours. If you happen to be careless about your wallet beware of the pickpocket.\n\nBusiness at the Central Market starts in the early hours of the day. Vans and lorries bring loads of fish and meat to the vendors. Usually nonperishable things are brought overnight. But green vegetables are brought early in the morning. The smooth and efficient working of the market is really appreciable.\n\nThis market is in a huge concrete building. The stalls are arranged in beautiful rows, They are also classified according to the goods they deal with. Fruits, vegetables, fish, fowls and meat; - all have their respective dealers. There are also the platform vendors who add to the confusion of the place. Each class of vendors also has a portion allotted to them.\n\nNice things are being sold in this market. Buyers and sellers, haggle and haggle over prices. They push and jostle to get the best offer. In addition it is also filled with the angry voices of buyers and sellers. Now and then, a fellow will come to you with an old pen or watch; be careful before buying. It may be a stolen stuff and you may be get into trouble with the police. In the midst of all these confusions, the sellers do a brisk trade.\n\nThe market is under city authorities. So health inspectors are responsible for its cleanliness. They have to see that the food stuffs that are sold are free from defects. Thus unscrupulous stall keepers and vendors are warned against selling rotten, unpalatable or poisonous food stuff."

For convenience, I shall call him Mr. Leo.\n\nMr. Leo has been teaching me English for the last two years. He is a very lovable person, soft spoken and good mannered. He is not a giant in his stature but it is very well made up by his intellectual attainments. He used to come, neatly dressed. There may not be anything gorgeous about it but he always dresses in an elegant way. He used to move about quietly, though he always bears an assured look of a scholar. Naturally therefore, everyone respects him.\n\nIt is a pleasure to listen to him when he teaches English whether it be prose or poetry and he would leave his mark on it. There, is nothing bombastic in his use of words, because he always uses very simple ones, so that even an average student could follow him. He has always been very methodical in his approach. He would never proceed further unless he has made everyone understand the passage. When he finds somebody has difficulty he would spare no pains to make the student understand.\n\nHis teaching of poetry has been marvelous. He would simply get into the spirit of the poet. Gifted with some histrionic talent, he would carry the whole class with him in the enjoyment of the poem. Whether it be \"Oh! Captain, My Captain!\" \"The Solitary Reaper\" or \"Patriotism\", he would impress the class, with his dramatic teaching. For all these things, he has been a very good coach so far as the examination is concerned. But he used to say, that examination is not everything.\n\nDuring his leisure hours, he can be found in the school library browsing among literary magazines. One can approach him easily and have doubts cleared. By his knowledge, character, and day to day life he leaves a profound influence on the intellectual and moral character of his pupils. He leaves the permanent stamp of his personality on their moral character. One great quality in him is that he never bears malice towards anybody. He is a model for all teachers. May his tribe increase!"

        "content": "During our last school break for the millennium my classmates and I decided to make the holidays one to remember by planning a visit to Sentosa Island. There were fifteen of us in all and we eagerly set down to discussing the trip. We decided unanimously that no girls would be allowed as this was a boys only trip.\n\nWe set out bright and early one Sunday morning for Sentosa by ferry from the jetty of the World Trade Centre. We could barely contain our excitement. The first thing we did upon landing on the pier at Sentosa was to make our way single mindedly to the monorail. We boisterously boarded the monorail for a trip around the island. The train took us along a narrow track through lush green foliage and valleys. We were spellbound by the scenic beauty all around us. Alighting at the terminal station near the jetty, we walked straight to the park where we strolled along the well worn paths for a while. Then we sat down for a while and talked over what to do next.\n\nWe first visited the Coralariums where we saw a variety of coral fishes and other marine creatures. The so called lion fish caught our attention with it's strange form and coloration. It was easy to see how it derived its name. Little did we realize that coral was a living organism! Our next stop was at the wax museum which displays life size figurines of men and women who have left their mark in history. The figurines were so life-like that one almost felt like reaching out and touching one and at the same expecting it to react. We recognized some of the figurines from our history books but were at loss as to who the others were.\n\nEqually exciting were our next two stops, namely Fort Siloso and the Insectarium. Among all the sights we experienced that day the most captivating was the Musical Fountain. We spent some time there just watching the surroundings and listening to the music wafting through the air so soothing to the ears. We began to feel hungry just then so we promptly wolfed down the sandwiches we had brought from home.\n\nLater that afternoon some of us went down to the beach for a swim. There were a number of tourists there, mainly Japanese, who were enjoying the beach as well. As it was getting late in the day we decided to go back home. Our launch brought us back safely to the World Trade Centre at about seven in the evening. We took along with us memories of beautiful Sentosa."

        "content": "In school a student has to study many subjects such as English, Mathematics, Science and Geography among others, in order to prepare himself for an examination. Not everyone likes the subjects he or she studies in school. Students have their favorite subjects and they tend to pay special attention to them in class. They are willing to go that extra mile, so to speak, where these subjects are concerned. More often than not they also perform better in these subjects during the exams.\n\nFor me my favorite subject is Biology, a branch of Science. This is because it teaches me about the human body, animal life and about plants. I like to learn and understand these subjects more than others. I learn with great interest the different parts of my body and their functions. It is important to know how human beings respire and how food digests in our bodies. We also learn about the bones, muscles and ligaments which make up our very form and aid us in our movement. How we come to experience pain and other sensations through a network of fine channels called nerves which conduct very small electrical currents. We then begin to realize the true complexity of the human body.\n\nThe study of animals also fascinates me. I came to know about the various breeds of mammals, birds and reptiles. Both big and small mammals that live side by side in the forest and grasslands. I am curious to know how they survive in the wild. Wild animals like lions and tigers prey on weaker animals like deer and zebra yet they co-exist in such lands. There are relationships between animals that are even beneficial to both parties and are called symbiotic. My desire to know more has compelled me to watch documentary films on animal life.\n\nScience also teaches us about the plant, life. It allows me to differentiate between species of plants. It explains how they produce their own food and react to external stimuli. Our class experiments have shown us the extraordinary ways plants adapt themselves to survive under different conditions. The practical nature of the experiments allows us to see first hand the science of Biology in action. I consider Biology as one of the most useful subjects for a student as it teaches him or her about the basic facts of nature. However this is not to say that one should neglect other subjects."

        "content": "Television is a very powerful visual medium. Practically every household has one. Unlike radio the messages and ideas that are conveyed to the viewer are further reinforced by visual images that accompany these messages and ideas. It is a fast and inexpensive medium by which to communicate with the masses. Satellite dishes and all kinds of other receiving devices enables us to not only to receive news and programs from within the country but also transmissions from abroad. In some countries viewers may have access to a hundred or more channels through their televisions.\n\nIt is however important to note that communication in this setting is one way and not interactive. Considering that hardly a day passes without watching TV, it indeed has the potential of having a strong effect on us. For the discerning viewer being able to differentiate between which programs have useful content and which do not, this may not be a problem. However when we are dealing with impressionable young minds it may be difficult for them to separate reality from make believe.\n\nResponsible censorship by the authorities and careful monitoring by parents is necessary to ensure that young people are not adversely affected by watching this medium. The phrase 'couch potato' has been coined to describe viewers who are constantly in front of their television sets. Their senses are continuously only subjected to the images they see sometimes for the better part of the day. Violence is a common feature in most entertainment programs to the extent that films have to be rated accordingly as most scenes are too horrific for younger viewers.\n\nTelevision is not all bad as there are positive aspects to it. Educational programs nowadays incorporate all kinds of ways to entertain as well as to educate. Programs such as 'Sesame Street' have a large following among children. Documentary films are informative and instructional. The expression that 'too much of anything is bad' applies here. The idea is for viewers to have a healthy balance of the different kinds of programs available."

For example, when one goes shopping on the eve of Hari Raya Puasa, Deepavali, Chinese New Year or Christmas, the experience is really exciting.\n\nShopping is not simply buying things for our needs. It is much more than that. First of all one must know what one wants to buy. He must know, where those things are available. In fact, this is not a problem in a small place but in a big city, one must know where different things are sold. There may be, chain stores, selling things at a higher price. The same things may be had at a cheaper price at a grocery. Then there are the genuine goods and the spurious ones. Unless one knows one is likely to be deceived. This reminds one of the famous chapter in the \"Vicar of Wakefield\". Moses went to the fair, to sell his mare. He was deceived by a sharper, who exchanged the mare for a gross of silver spectacles. When Moses returned home, he found they were not at all silver. This may happen to anybody unless one has the wit and wisdom. Shopping requires some experience of the market.\n\nShopping requires bargaining ability. It is not always fixed prices in all markets. So one must be able to bargain. It requires certain ability to choose the right stuff. For instance if one goes into a big cloth shop, one finds it easy, one must have made up his mind as to what stuff to get. He must be careful to see whether correct weights and measures are being used. It is here that very often people are deceived.\n\nShopping, during week end is really exciting. One has to wend through a stream of shoppers. There will be, the crowd of roadside vendors crying their wares. One must not be tempted to buy all and sundry, otherwise, he will find he has wasted his money. In fact shopping is a good school, where one can learn about men, moods and manners."

He had a good kennel in his house where he reared different breeds of dogs. Suddenly, he got transferred from the town and he wanted to dispose of some of the dogs. He was talking about it to my father. Then I told my father that we could have one of the puppies; though reluctantly, my father agreed. Thus, Rosy came into my possession.\n\nWhy it was named Rosy, I can't say. It is an Alsatian. She is of medium height. She is grey colored with dark spots near her belly. The dog has a bushy tail and glistening eyes which has grown wonderfully well and can easily be the envy of many.\n\nRosy, can be seen about our house when she is not engaged in playing or when she is not sleeping. She takes pleasure in sneaking about the corners when she has nothing particularly to do. She is as docile as a dog in our presence. When we are not there she will be in her mettle. None can easily come near our gate. Though she doesn't bite, she will bounce on the person and paralyze him. Since the postman regularly comes, she recognizes in him a friend and so does not do him any harm She will try to catch the sparrow and it will be a splendid sight to see.\n\nI give her a Spartan food. She takes some biscuits and milk in the morning and meat mixed with rice in the afternoon. Usually she is not given any food in the night. When we are at our table, Rosy keeps company with me but she shows no eagerness to touch even a crumb unless offered. So my father likes it. Rosy cries in a peculiar way. It is between barking and howling. Sometimes, she raises a cry like moaning. That means she wants to go out to relieve herself.\n\nWhenever I go out in the evening, she accompanies me. My friends are afraid of her because she doesn't like silly mischief of boys. She shows her displeasure by a big bark and that is enough to unnerve the boys. My father says, Rosy would soon become a mother. Then I will have a litter of nice puppies."

For one thing, the Japanese are a vigorous people. Height may be a disadvantage to them but it is not reflected in any of their activities. As a rule they are a very busy race. Nothing can equal their industry. Geographically placed as they are, they have to be industrious with pluck and courage. The Japanese islands are subject to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Very often the typhoon hits the country. So the people have developed a courage and perhaps a philosophical outlook of life. They have learnt to be industrious for survival.\n\nJapan can be said to be a modern nation for its recent history which starts from 1905. From then on Japanese have been progressing by leaps and bounds. They became a very powerful industrial nation competing with England and America. Their goods are found in every market. But they became ambitious and wanted to have territories overseas. This involved them in the second world war. At first, they were victorious but in the end they had to face a shameful defeat. But the wonder is they have been able to rebuild their country within twenty years so well. The secret is their industry.\n\nThe Japanese are said to be the neatest people on earth.\n\nThey want to keep everything about them beautiful. Thus even a small house will have a neat garden with artificial hills and pools. The interior will be decorated simply but elegantly. Their national dress also shows their sense of beauty. Even taking tea is almost a ceremony for them. So Japan is the country which interests me most."

But the truth of the matter is, there is some urgency in protecting wild life. Let us see what it is.\n\nWhat we call wild life, is it so wild? Man in his selfishness, or may be out of fear, looks upon some of these animals, as wild. As a rule, no animal attacks a person, deliberately. If one intrudes into the haunts of the wild animals, they attack and kill him. Simply because some of the animals live on other animals they should not be considered wild. If that were to be the standard, man who slaughters tens and thousands of animals for his food, must be wild indeed.\n\nEverything in nature has its part to play. Taken a broad view of things, nothing is superfluous and nothing is wasteful in nature. There should be a balance by their own right. If the tiger does not prey on the deer, the number of deer in the forest will grow out of proportion and will prove a menace to the plant life. The hare may be innocent but in large numbers it is also bad. The balance is set by the wolves and the wild dogs. Thus there seems to be a natural controlling mechanism in which the wild animals play a significant role.\n\nThe danger from them apart, most of the wild animals are very beautiful. What a beautiful thing is the tiger! How majestic is the lion! Even the sluggish hippo has got some power. Wild animals should include rare birds. There is a complaint that they are being destroyed indiscriminately. Even the snakes have a part to play. Where they have destroyed snakes, the rats are proving a menace. As the snakes live on the rats, the rat population is controlled. Man in all his selfishness tampers with nature's ways and ultimately he will be the loser. The wild animals have got a definite place in the economy of nature. They must not be destroyed but preserved."

I can always come to him for advice on any difficulties I may be experiencing and I value his advice as it is sensible and very practical. Everyone who knows Peter says that he is very mature for his age. It astounds me how much Peter knows on a variety of subjects. He is well read and never ceases to try and instill the reading habit in me. Needless to say it is Peter who helps me with my school homework when I encounter problems. I remember the time that I foolishly joined a few friends from school and experimented with cigarettes, Peter as a school prefect found us out and was duty bound to report the matter to the disciplinary teacher. All of my friends who were involved in the incident thought that Peter was simply being a tattle-tale but. I knew that Peter took his responsibilities seriously and only had my well being in mind. I often wind up in difficulties through my own doing and Peter is always around to bail me out without expecting any gratitude or explanation, his friendship is unconditional.\n\nOur teachers and friends at school have taken to calling us the 'Two Musketeers' as we do everything together. It seems that some of my interests have rubbed off on Peter as we are both in the school debate team. I quite enjoy public speaking but Peter dreads addressing crowds as by nature he is a very reserved person. I suspect he finally gave in to my constant cajoling and agreed to join the team. What Peter really enjoys is sports. He excels at football and track and field events. He has won numerous trophies for the school at inter-school sports meets.\n\nPeter is admirable as a friend and a person and is well spoken of by everyone who knows him.

All this is possible because of the care and sweat which my mother is able to bestow on the smooth running of the household affairs. This is almost true of all homes.\n\nNow let us look into a day in the life of my mother. She gets up quite early in the morning. She attends to the cleaning of the house. By that time the bread-van arrives. She receives the bread and starts the cooker for morning coffee. While water is boiling, she may attend to small duties. Young ones are to be attended to after their toilet. Now the water hisses in the kettle and she prepares coffee. Children are given horlicks or ovaltine. Elders are given their cups of coffee. There may be comments from the elders and cries from the children. For all these my mother stays calm. She moves about with a philosophic attitude.\n\nThen she prepares the breakfast. At the same time, she attends to washing of clothes and bathing of children. In between she will be attending to the vegetable vendors or giving directions to the maid-servant. Now it will be time for breakfast and it is always an ordeal for her to serve the breakfast in the midst of noise raised by children. Then children dress up for school. Even then, my mother will have to attend to them. Every day some scene will be enacted at that time and she goes about taking them as a routine matter.\n\nOnce the elders have left for office, mother breathes a sigh of relief. Now she can go about her chores in a somewhat leisurely way. She bathes and plans for lunch. When it is ready, she waits for us to return for lunch. After lunch she takes a little nap. She can do some stitching and tailoring. She mends children's clothes. If time permits and if her hands are free she may spend some in talking with her friends.\n\nIn the evening father returns home and we are served with tea. Again noise starts. While preparing the dinner, she attends to the younger ones in their studies, helping the one here and the other there. After the dinner, she has some time to talk family affairs with our father. Sometimes she may turn on the television, if there is any interesting programme. Children comfortably laid in their beds and doors secured, she is the last to go to bed, only to begin her arduous day the next morning. Thus she is a picture of patience and service."

The police alone however would not be as effective as they are if not for the public spiritedness of most Singaporeans. This plays a very important part in keeping the crime rate down in Singapore. Cooperation between members of the public and the police force in the form of information given by members of the public to prevent or solve crimes is vital. The Police on their part are always finding new ways to foster closer ties with the public through the formation of neighbourhood beat bases as well as orgarnising community functions.\n\nCriminals are often than not individuals who do not fit into society as they are unwilling to accept the basic rules that govern our society. Some of the reasons put forward by the experts are that these people often come from broken homes and do not have the benefit of being instilled with proper moral values. However the rise of white collar crimes in Singapore would seem to suggest that this may not be the only possible factor. Sometimes greed for material wealth may compel a person to embark on a life of crime despite his family background. Whatever the reasons may be criminals pose a real threat to the well being of our society.\n\nThis can clearly be seen from the rise in drug-related crimes over the last few decades. This is a real cause of concern for the authorities as criminals engaged in the trafficking and distribution\nof these illegal substances have targeted a very important segment of society, our youth. The number of young people addicted to drugs is on the rise. What is more disturbing is that some of these youths turn to committing petty crimes like extortion and shoplifting to support their habits.\n\nThe future of criminals in this country however is very bleak as our justice system will ensure that they are dealt with severely. Also drug rehabilitation programs instituted and run by the government have gone a long way to return some of our wayward youths to leading good productive lives."

People with Aids acquire it through contact with the body fluids of an infected person. This may occur in several different ways, through sexual intercourse, blood transfusions and the sharing of syringes as is the practice among drug addicts. Some people are merely carriers and do not suffer from any of the symptoms associated with Aids. In others the Aids virus lies dormant in their bodies for a period of several months before there are any outward signs of it's presence. In both cases the disease is capable of spreading rapidly due to non-awareness.\n\nAids is particularly lethal because the virus breaks down the natural immune defenses that the body has against other diseases which may be common or otherwise. An Aids sufferer with a case of the common flu may have it develop into something more serious and life threatening due to the absence of these defenses or anti-bodies. Such a person must be extra vigilant against any form of bacterial or viral infection. Our environment is saturated with these microscopic organisms and it would be practically impossible to avoid contact with them.\n\nPerhaps what is more painful to these people is the way they are treated by ill-informed members of the public even their family and friends. Contrary to popular belief the disease does not spread by casual physical contact as the Aids virus cannot survive for long outside of a human host. The fear of contracting or even being close to the infected person causes people to generally shun these\nunfortunate sufferers.\n\nThe government aware of the very real threat the disease poses especially among young people, has embarked on various programs to educate the people. The best cure is prevention, casual sex with unfamiliar partners is to be discouraged. Regular tests to be taken for sexually active people to detect the disease at an early stage. To this end all government clinics are equipped with this facility. People have to cooperate if we are to eradicate the scourge of this incurable disease."

        "content": "There are few hobbies, which are so absorbing as fishing. People say that old men only seek fishing when they feel lonely. I don't agree. After all I am not old, still I have so much liking for fishing.\n\nMy school work stands in my way, so I could find time for going fishing only on week-ends. During holidays, of course, weather permitting nothing pleases me more than fishing. I have a special bowler hat, a small fishing basket and my favorite fishing rod. I purchase the necessary worms from the market and put them in the basket. Usually I start after breakfast. I leave word at home that I will return only in the evening. Taking my coffee flask, and a few slices of bread, I walk off. My favorite fishing ground lies some two kilometers away from my house.\n\nOnce I reach the place, I sit comfortably on the bank of the stream with reeds all around me. Fixing the worm to the hook, I throw the line into the water. It requires a lot of concentration to have an eye on the plumb. Sometimes I succeed in landing one or two good fish. Sometimes I wait for a long day, before I could catch even a small fish. But that does not detract me from going fishing.\n\nSometimes I while away the slow moving time by singing some popular hits. I feel that I am the monarch of all I survey. There is nothing to win and there is not much to lose. There is nobody to converse and only nature keeps company. So one feels as though one is a Yogi. I enjoy the ripples in the water. I enjoy the shoals of fish. I take pleasure in seeing the king fisher. Now and then I may be rewarded with the music of a bird. In short, for those who can temperamentally enjoy loneliness, there is nothing like fishing."

But when the holidays come, many find it boring. After the first flush is over, many find it hard to spend time. It is all because they don't plan for a holiday.\n\nIt may be quite useful to plan for a holiday. But how one is going to spend them depends on one's facilities. As for me I cannot afford to spend money on long trips visiting places and seeing things. Still I plan always for the holidays. The following is one such plan.\n\nI will attend to some arrears of school work like copying of notes, getting the records up to-date and so on. Exercises which were not done in the class will be completed. I will go to the library regularly, both in the morning and evening and do some useful supplementary reading. After all one cannot always be reading. For a change I attend to some garden work. I am keen on gardening. It may be preparing the soil for a new plant or weeding out grass; it may be pruning the fence. The plants require regular watering, that I shall do myself. Now I have made up my mind to learn chess. I have already bought chessmen and a board for that. I will try to answer the problems on chess given in the newspapers. It is not always work for me. When I feel I must have a change, I mingle with my friends and enjoy some time in fun and frolic.\n\nThis time I want to learn some trade. I have made up my mind to learn watch repairing. So, I shall go and sit in the watch maker's shop. My father has promised to introduce me to one. I think it will take a good part of my time and it will fit me up to be a watch maker and repairer. Not that I want to take it as a profession but it is worth knowing such a trade.\n\nI have drawn up a very big plan but it remains to be seen how far I can fulfil it."

But any school today without a canteen has something curious about it. The school canteen serves students and members of the staff, with light refreshment in hygienic condition. Somehow children want to eat and when there is no provision in school, they buy things from street vendors and that way spoil their health. But they can get clean things from the school canteen now. The members of the staff also can have their cup of coffee or soft drinks. Yet there is objection from the parents that the school canteen encourages boys to spend a lot on eating. This should not be a very serious objection, when the overall advantages are considered.\n\nOur principal is a forward looking gentleman. He always welcomes new and good ideas. So when somebody suggested that there could be an improvement in the facilities available at the school canteen, he jumped at the idea. The result has been our present improved canteen. There the food is always fresh and clean, and served in disposable containers. The prices and quality are reasonable and there are sufficient types of food to cater for the needs of the pupils. Pupils' suggestion for more variety in the food is always welcome.\n\nThe canteen is run by different stall-holders. The food is cooked under strict supervision. Every effort is made to ensure that students get the best food at the cheapest rate. Fruits like bananas, oranges, and dry fruits are also sold. During the interval, there is a great rush but boys behave themselves and the service is not a problem. The prefects have worked out an excellent system for supervising pupils and for maintaining good discipline. The class prefects deserve to be complimented for planning the method which is working smoothly.\n\nThe canteen is also a place for gossip. When there is leisure time, members of the staff would be seen in the canteen sipping tea and talking over that.\n\nStudents stay in the school almost every day for five or six hours continuously, with little break during the time. Hence to have something to fill their hungry stomach in between is not a luxury but a necessity."

But I think only of the adventure it offers. To become a pilot, one requires a good physique, nerve and eye-sight. Before becoming a fully trained pilot, one has to do a lot of ground work and many hours of flying. He must be a good student in physics, especially in aerodynamics. The training is very hard indeed but the game is worth it. A pilot gets a fat packet of salary. He gets other privileges. If he joins an international commercial line, he will get a chance of visiting foreign countries very often. If he joins the air force, his services are very much required for saving the country's frontiers. Any system of modern defense, will be nothing, if its air wing is not highly developed. So the air pilot will play a prominent part in the defense of his country.\n\nThen, think of the thrill of being in the air. Modern jet planes, keep to a height of more than seven thousands meters. What a grand sight the pilot gets at the time, the earth below and the sky above! It can't always be fair weather piloting. There used to be tense and anxious moments. Sometimes, the plane will have to negotiate through an air pocket or through heavily charged clouds. Then, there may be the flat landing tyres. These are only a few of the dangerous situations. In all these, the pilot should know how to carry on his duty coolly and safely. Any wrong judgment would mean disaster to all.\n\nIn spite of all these, I like to be a pilot because the thrill of adventure is so much that I cannot resist it. After all one can die only once."

Even today we find the spirit of hunting in our children.\n\nHunting requires a lot of practice. One cannot become a hunter overnight. People who have to live in the forest by force of circumstances are better hunters than city dwellers. He has to hunt for his survival. As he lives in the midst of wild animals, he will have to protect his life. Hunters use different types of weapons. Thus the ancient man used the spear, the lance, the slings and the bow and arrows. These are used even today by primitive people. But modern man uses the gun.\n\nThe hunter's life is an adventurous one. He has to face the fury of animals. To be a good hunter he must know the haunts of animals, their behavior and their trails. Above all he must know the law of the jungle. Hunters usually go in a party. If it is safe hunting as in the case of a deer or a rabbit, it is simple and easy. But when one has to hunt the tiger, it requires a lot of preparation. The hunter must know where the animal dwells and where it comes for its water. He must carry his gun and there must be some cleared ground for the animal to be seen. In the case of the tiger, if one is seen nearby, the hunter ties a goat or a buffalo to a peg and leaves it there. The tiger comes and attacks the animal and leaves the carcass there. The tiger is sure to return the next night to finish up its food. In the meantime, the hunter will be ready with his gun. When the tiger is deeply engaged in having its repast, the hunter shoots at it. It requires a very good marksmanship to shoot at it. If he fails, the animal escapes and may prove a dangerous sport.\n\nAnother thrilling adventure is whale hunting. The hunters go in powerful boats. They can spot the place, where the animal is found by its snorting. Then they cover the ground and when the whale surfaces they harpoon it. A mere lash of its tail world be enough to upset the boat. There are other ways of hunting like laying a snare, decoying and so on. In hunting, dogs are found very useful. They are able to smell the animal and very often bring it to quarry. Falcons were trained and they were used in hunting birds. Even today boys hunt for birds' eggs. As a sport, hunting is the most manly game."

The villain of the piece may be a nail, a thorn or very often a discarded bullock's shoe. After all the bicycle is able to give a smooth ride because of the inflated (pneumatic) tyre. If a hole happens to occur in the tube the air inside escapes, the tyre becomes flat and so the bicycle cannot run.\nIt is not enough, if one owns a bicycle. Sometimes, he must be able to attend to its working and keep it in a good repair. One of the things he may often be called upon to attend is the puncture. Of course it can be attended to by a professional repairer but one should know how to do it oneself.\n\nFor repairing the puncture, the following accessories are needed: an air pump, two tyre levers, rubber solution, rubber patches, sulphur stick, a tub of water and a scraper or a sand paper. Now the punctured tube will have to be taken out of tyre. The tube itself is taken carefully out of the tyre with the help of tyre levers. Then the valve tube and the checkout are replaced and the tube is inflated with air. The tube is immersed in water and by trial and error, the punctured spot is detected. Round the spot a pencil mark is made. Then the air is let out. The punctured spot is dried, scrapped and rubbed with sulphur stick. A suitable size of the rubber patch is taken, the side to be stuck is scrapped and solution applied. The patch is applied to the tube over the punctured hole and pressed well. When it is dry the tube is dried and carefully placed within the tyre.\n\nIt is easier to write than to place the tube correctly within the tyre. This comes out of practice. Once the tube is in, the valve tube and the checkouts are replaced and the tube inflated. But it must not be fully inflated first; inflate a little and see if there is any twist in the tube. If so, the process of taking out and replacing must be repeated. Then of course, the tube can be inflated. So, it is better for those who own their bicycles to know to repair a puncture. They should carry their tools kit. Then they can attend to the puncture even in an out of the way place."

My mother prepared the usual medicament and gave it to me and made me go to bed early. the next morning I could not get up from bed. I was running high temperature and severe pain in the joints. People in the house suspected whether I might be getting small-pox or any fever like that. I was kept on diet. The same condition continue for three more days. So our family doctor advised my being admitted in he General Hospital. After the formalities, I was given a bed in the general ward and I was kept under observation.\n\nThe experience was novel to me but it was very irksome when a number of doctors, one after another came and examined me. Remember it was a general hospital, so there were many doctors, some trainees included. So I felt very much annoyed when I had to stick my tongue out for these doctors. In between there were the nurses who strutted about in their starched uniform. A chart was maintained about my health. My blood was examined and then my stools. Many were the surmises that were made. Some said it was a strange fever that started in Pahang. Some said it was paratyphoid. So they were pricking me with different types of injections. By this time, the novelty of being in the hospital wore away. I got fed up with the smell of dettol, the cheerless look of the ward and the monotonous scene of different types of patients lying there. somehow, the injections began to work. My temperature came down to normal. so I was advised to go home and take rest. What a relief from the boredom of the hospital after a fortnight there."

The train would be taking us to Penang as my father firmly believed that half the fun of a vacation was in getting to one's destination. My sister and I were very excited as this was the first time we would be going on such a long train journey. We would even have to spend the night on board the train.\n\nThe train arrived promptly on schedule. We found that our father had booked us two compartments on board the train. I had to share my compartment with my little sister while my father and mother occupied the other one. The bunks were rather hard, but who could sleep anyway ? We were too engrossed with staring out the window into the darkness that was punctuated only by the lights of all the little towns that our train passed through and sometimes, stopped at to pick up passengers.\n\nThere were a number of Caucasian tourists on board. We were unable to make out what they were saying as they seemed to be speaking languages other than English. We had our supper in the buffet coach and I must say that the food was delicious but  expensive. My sister and I decided to do a bit of exploring and made off on our own after promising our parents that we wouldn't wander too far. we ran into the train conductor who was kind enough to give us a guided tour. He told us that the train had twelve carriages and that the diesel driven locomotive pulled all of these along. some of the carriages contained compartments like ours, while other contained sleeping berths and ordinary seats. All the carriages were air conditioned and quite spacious.\n\nI could see my little sister starting to yawn, well so much for staying awake the whole trip. we started to make our way back to our compartments and were soon fast asleep. we were still asleep when our train pulled into the station in Butterworth from where we look the ferry to Penang Island."

They have to be kept away from the kitchen when mother is working. But it is not an easy task. If you obstruct them, they raise a cry and begin to weep. This disturbs mother. If one or two slaps are given their backs, they will cry as though the very sky has fallen on them. Very often, the elder one is asked to dress up the children. Tt is really an ordeal They prove very rebellious and make the task very hard and make one lose all patience. Quite often, they have to be taught; either they won't come at all for studies or prove very stubborn. The elder one has to be an image of patience. Still nothing can be taught. if the elder one were to lose patience, only he or she will be found fault with.\n\nAnother frustration is that the elder one cannot own anything, new or attractive. Immediately, the younger ones want to have it. It may be a pen, an instrument box or even a pencil eraser. The elder one may protest but ultimately, it will be the younger ones who win.\n\nAnother trying occasion is when mother is away from home. It may be to a movie or visiting a friend, very often the younger ones make a hell of that time. they quarrel among themselves, pick up a row, fly at each other's throat, they want to eat something and if that is given they want more. If not given, they will create a story and carry the complaint to the mother. the younger ones always spy on the elder one. They want to a accompany the brother or sister wherever he or she goes. If they are taken they will always be ready to carry real or imaginary tales to the mother. One difficulty with them is, they want to be with the brother or sister and at the same time they want to have their own way. there may be exceptions but the reality is always there."

The afternoon was just pleasant and I took my bicycle and was on my way to a village some six kilometers away where a relative of mine lived. The path lies through an avenue of trees with fields on either side as far as the eyes can see. But for one or two stray cottages here and there, there is nothing to shelter in the sky. It was threatening and I pedaled hard but before I had gone a few hundred meters, there was a sudden burst of thunder and a blinding lightning. It began to rain, cats and dos and the rain came down in big drops. The light was very poor and the road was bad. as the rain was lashing on my face I could not pedal hard at my bicycle. I knew it was dangerous, to go and take shelter under a tree, so with great fear I kept to the middle of the road. Suddenly the wind rose ad gained momentum. It grew wild and before its force, the trees simply danced. One could hear the howling noise of the stormy wind.\n\nI was soaked to the skin. My fingers were benumbed. I could not push hard. Now and then I could see the heavenly rage in the lightning flashes which appeared to hiss almost by my side. To add to my fear, there was a sudden thunderstorm and a big tree cashed to the ground. In this situation the will to live alone goaded me on. As the road was soaked with flood water, I could not ride the bicycle. Even pushing it along was an ordeal. There were potholes and swirling water, but it was not a question of abandoning. I prayed to Go to conduct me safely.\n\nAt long last, the flickering light from the village was seen and I was in my relative's house after a few minutes. What a relief to be under a roof behind closed doors in such a weather ! My relative gave me a change of warm clothing and I had never enjoyed a warm cup of tea as I did that day."

True, there are riots sometimes over the decision of a referee in a soccer tournament. Or again, it may be that a favorite team has lost. But these must not be taken as the criteria to decide whether sports should be compulsory in schools or not.\nThe aim of sports in school is not to create champions but to train the body and the mind of the youngsters. The sports events must be looked upon as a compliment to the class work. If the class teaching can develop the intellectual skills; the sports is sure to develop the physical skills. Many things which children cannot learn in the classrooms can be learnt on the field. The spirit of play is there in children and they like to take part is sports and games. A child who would not play has something wrong about him.\n\nTaking part in sports improves the nerves and muscles. It improves the physical skill, and general health. Moral qualities are developed by playing games. The child learns to play its part and thus to play the game. It is always the team spirit and not obeying orders.

It is to help the student to revise what has been done in the class. All schools set home work for students, some more and some less.\nHowever, bitter it may be, there must be some home-task given. Education and mastery of knowledge is a matter of skill. There are subjects to learn a skill and others just to acquire knowledge. Both these groups require drill and repetition. the teacher, to some extent, drills the student in the class. But in the classroom each individual student cannot expert the same amount of drill as each one may require. so the student will have to do that at home.\n\nHomework need not necessarily be repeating what has been done in the class. It may be more study. The student goes through references and acquires more and better knowledge. The world of knowledge is so wide that the class study cannot bring everything into the grasp of the student. So the student must take up some initiative of his own. This may be one of the purposes of homework.\n\nThe school also must see that the student is not overburdened on one day and left free on other days. the teachers must see to it that the homework is distributed throughout the week. Still there are subjects like mathematics in the lower classes which require daily attention. There are others which can be attended to during the week end, for example, map making, drawing diagrams and so on.\n\nSimply because there is difficulty for some students, the homework cannot be abolished. If some students find it inconvenient to do their homework, the school must come to their rescue. They must provide some facilities in school, so that the pupils can conveniently attend to their homework. Boys do not like homework because some of them are too playful to do them. In such cases, the teachers must come willingly forward to help such boys, who need encouragement.\n\nIt is not a question of abolishing the homework. It is a question of making it sweet and workable to the student. The teachers in good faith must solve this problem."

A well balanced diet would contain the three main groups of food as well as important vitamins and minerals.\nThe first group of carbohydrates are found in foods such as bread, potatoes and rice. They are essentially energy giving foods which power the muscles and other tissues in our body. The next class of food is the proteins which form the solid part in all living cells. They are commonly found in milk, met and fish, and are necessary for the body to build new cells and repair old damaged ones. For this very reason growing children require a greater intake of the different kinds of proteins as compared to adults. Lastly we have fats which are also energy-living foods but do not give it up as quickly as carbohydrates because their molecular structure is designed to render them ideal as storage foods.\n\nAs children are much more active than adults they use up more energy for their size and therefore require more energy giving foods such as carbohydrates. To this end fats are unsuitable. Moreover too much of a fatty food intake at an early age may lead to a problem with obesity in later life. In adults fatty deposits on the walls of the blood vessels in the form of cholesterol may lead to all kinds of heart ailments.\n\nIn addition to the foods above the body also needs small quantities of protective substances called vitamins and minerals.\n\nThey are normally present in a sensible diet. For example vitamins A and D are found in some fatty foods. Vitamin D is important along with the mineral calcium, found in milk, for the formation of bones. Vitamin B is found in the husks of wheat or rice ad vitamin C in fresh fruits such as oranges and lemons. Important minerals such as potassium, zinc and iron are present in traces n most foods too.\n\nTherefore it is  obvious that a well balanced diet would include all the necessary ingredients necessary for growth and good health."

One the other hand, if the village is underdeveloped with no facilities for a healthy living, then the village is not desirable. Because many of these things are wanting in a village, people go to towns for setting up homes.\n\nTowns as a rule, score many good points over the village. There are educational, medical and transport facilities. Essential things are easily available because there are big markets. The employment prospects are also better in a town than a village.\n\nFor those who seek entertainment, towns have cinema houses and entertainment centers. All other facilities like banking, postal and telephone are easily available in a town.\n\nBut it is not all rosy in a town. With its dense settlement and pollution, townlife is hell. the only reason that draws people to towns is the employment opportunities. If villages are modernized with some primary facilities, then villages may be preferred to towns."

It may be from the point of view of the parents or the youngsters who marry o from the commonsense.\nA parent wants his son or daughter married because he wants his species propagated. He wants his daughter married to a healthy person who would prove a good life partner and make married life tolerable. The parent cares also for the stock. In other words he wants to assure himself that the person with whom his son or daughter is married, does not suffer from any physical ailment. They must have a fair reputation in society. Very often, the financial status of the parties is taken into consideration. Because of the specific advantage to be gained financially, an alliance is made. Sometimes, the youngsters may not like such an alliance and so the marriages end in unhappiness.\n\nFrom the point of view of the youngster, he wants to marry as he likes. In his view, it may be the personal quality of the girl whom he wants to marry that matters. In the first glamour of love, he is likely to overlook many other factors. Because the youngster is not experienced and worldly-wise, his choice need not always be correct. Because of such wrong alliances, there are more misunderstanding and divorces in Western countries. Under the wrong notion of love marriage, there have been more illicit connections and children born before marriage. so wisdom tells that youngsters would better think twice before they get married. They would not lose anything by consulting their parents and taking their advice and blessing."

        "content": "It is often deceptive to judge a person by his dress. People who dress very well need not always be decent, good or honest. But the world generally judge a person by his dress. There are many rogues who dress very neatly but they commit worst of crimes. In cases where confidence is used to deceive a person, very often the deceptor dresses himself in a comely way.\nStill the world expects a person to dress according to his status. If one does not dress according to his rank, he is often held to ridicule. It doesn't mean, one should dress, in a gaudy manner. It will show a sense of taste. But one should be dressed neatly and elegantly. In elite societies people attach importance to dress. Thus people in important positions have advantages. One can distinguish between a lawyer and a judge. The uniform adds to the dignity of the profession and helps one to know the person from his dress. Thus in the police and army, various ranks are easily known by their uniforms.\n\nAs mentioned before, dress may not be a good index of one's character. Simple dress need not mean want of character. There were eminent people who dressed themselves in a very simple way. For instance, Gandhi wore only a simple dhoti. Some people often called him 'half naked fakir'. But his dress, in any way, did not reduce his character.\n\nSometimes people are deceived by dress. Once a great scholar went to a party. As he was simply dressed, he could not find admission inside. So he returned home and put on his best.\n\nHe went back to the party and he was given a warm reception. In the course of the dinner he did not eat but was addressing his clothes. The host came there and enquired what the matter was. The scholar told him what had happened. Since he was admitted only for the sake of his dress, he was addressing his cloths. The host felt ashamed and sought pardon of the scholar. Though dress may be, to some extent, helpful to judge a person, that will not be the only yardstick."

Education not only helps them to evolve themselves in such a way that they can fit themselves into useful life. Education is, in short, provides for the future of the child. So education is being looked upon as essential.\nSince education is very important for every individual, governments are trying to make it compulsory. Modern governments, generally speaking, work on democratic lines. In order to run the government efficiently, the citizens must be educated enough. Not only should the representatives of the people be educated but the electors also should be educated. Only then they can make the wise choice.\n\nThe life's needs are many and to get at them requires education. Thus education brings to the student the knowledge of men and things. They must be able to interpret the written and the spoken words. World's knowledge is found between the covers of great books. In order to get to those treasure houses, children must be educated. The law of the land must be known by the citizens. How the government is being run must be known by any average citizen. For all these education is necessary.\n\nPeople do not send their children to school, merely for the sake of knowledge. Unless children are educated in their formative periods, they cannot learn later on in life. So, where the parents fail, the governments must interfere. So every civilized government has made education compulsory. In spite of it, if people are not sending children to augment the family's income. So while children may be expected to help their parents, they are compulsorily put to school. Illiteracy is a bane on any society and it must be done away with; the sooner the better."

Some of the latter block the progress of a community or even a nation.\nLet us see in what ways some of traditions prove an obstacle to progress. Look at the purdah system. How it started, history alone can say. But today it is meaningless. Is it out of jealousy or suspicion that mean keeps his women under purdah ? They are denied the benefit of sunlight and fresh air. So among purdah women there are some who suffer from skin diseases and even pulmonary diseases. It is high time people revise their notions about purdah.\n\nUntouchability is prevailing in some form or other in many countries. It is a pity that some of our own brethren should be considered untouchables. There was a time when their proximity was supposed to pollute water and vitiate the air. If it was because of certain habits of theirs that they were considered untouchable; it is a great pity indeed. Some jobs are nasty but, for that matter, people engaged in such jobs should not be considered untouchables.\n\nLook at the color bar being practiced in certain countries. It is sheer accident that some are born fair skinned and others dark. Again it is sheer accident of history that some people became slaves and others masters. To base one's judgment on such a tradition and to deny the colored one his legitimate rights is something unfair.\n\nThere are many more things like this which stand as an obstacle to progress."

Horatius offered to defend the bridge while the city fathers pulled down the bridge. Taking another as his companion, Horatius went and stood at the outer end of the bridge. The enemy soldiers were standing before him. The rebel leader laughed when he saw the two men standing on the bridge against a big army. He sent the giant of a man from his army to go and fight Horatius. Horatius stabbed him to death. Some more came from the enemy side and Horatius killed them all. Now the enemy leader was in doubt whether to proceed further on.\n\nIn the meantime the demolition work of the bridge was almost over and the bridge shook at the pillars. Horatius asked his companion to run for safety. Now the bridge fell down with a big crash. Horatius did not mind it. But he jumped into the river, and though he was fully armed and with deep wound on the thigh, he swam across the swirling waters of the Tiber and reached the other shore safely. A cry of surprise and joy arose from both the friends and the enemy. Horatius was honored by the country. In memory of him a statue was raised later on. Thus Horatius defending the bridge, has become a classic hero."

We have to make a conscious effort to ensure that we do not lose touch with our cultural heritage. One of the important features of a cultural identity is the ability to speak one's mother tongue. One's mother tongue would be the language spoken by members of the same race. As examples among the Chinese there are several dialect groups such as Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien. Cantonese and Hokkien being by far the common dialects spoken. However the Chinese people also have the common language of Mandarin. The Indians too have their separate dialect groups such as Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi among others. The Malay language is the same for all Malays except that pronunciation may vary depending on where they are from.\nThere may be some who may argue that it would be better if everyone spoke the same language so as to promote communication and closer ties between the different peoples of the world. However I feel that although this i a desired ideal, it may be achieved  in other ways that do not involve abandoning the art of a language that may have taken centuries to evolve into it's present day form that represents the identity of a people or a community.\n\nA mother tongue spoken helps to bind a people together and promote the positive values of a culture. If we are well grounded and know where we come from and what kinds of behavior are deemed and acceptable in our community we would be equipped to resist external negative influences that may otherwise sway us. Also having a cultural identity of our own would help us to understand better how other people value their own language and traditions. We would not be so quick to fear what is unfamiliar to us but instead try to understand it.\n\nIn this changing world which is drawing closer together through technology in communication, English is generally the language adopted for ease of communication in sectors such as trade and education. However this does not mean that we should neglect our own mother tongue."

The target destinations for these vehicles are the neighboring planets in our own Solar System such as Mars and Mercury. So far the main obstacles to space travel remain the great distances between these planets and Earth. The millions of miles of cold and empty space would take a very long time to traverse and this would raise the question of how to support life on board these space crafts as space is a vacuum devoid of life giving oxygen. To date scientists have only been able to send unmanned crafts to these planets. The sole purpose of these missions is the gathering of information through aerial photographs and the testing of surface materials which are transmitted back to earth via radio waves.\n\nAnother obstacle to space travel is the prohibitive cost of such undertakings. The advent of the space shuttle has lowered the cost factor by allowing the same vehicle to be used over and over again. The Shuttle is able to carry passengers and cargo and after completing its mission in space it lands back on earth much like a conventional aircraft.

Discipline. Discipline means the training of the mind so as to make it accept willingly the control rules or orders. In many ways it is the most valuable lesson to learn.\nIt is only through discipline that living becomes smooth and peaceful. Law of a country is nothing more than community discipline. People who keep to the law accept the discipline of the state.\n\nFor one's moral life, discipline is necessary. Self indulgence is a natural temptation. Our senses crave for easy satisfaction. Don't give way to this craving. we must keep our passions under control.\n\nDiscipline features in every stage of a child's development. A child is taught discipline from its birth so that it will not turn into a savage.\n\nAt school we must submit to the discipline of the teacher. A school boy is given instructions in various subjects. He is trained in different ways to make him fit for adult life. To his repeated annoyance, he is subject to constant control.\n\nDiscipline is equally necessary in our intellectual life. It is also necessary in our spiritual life. Life will have its trials and disappointments and it is discipline which will enable a person to remain cool and sensible amidst the stresses of life. Should a person fall, it is discipline which will set him on his feet again.\n\nRemember, discipline is not slavery. It has a higher object in view. True discipline lies in a conscious subordination of self to the achievement of some higher purpose. when we are inclined to rebel against discipline, we should remember, \"He alone can command who knows how to obey\"."

Travel has always been considered an important part of this process.\nEarly travelers were the Dutch, the Scandinavians, the Portugese and the British. What were the motives behind them ? They were exploration, conquest, trade and commerce and diplomacy. They considered themselves teachers. Travelers with a scientific outlook become explorers, others 'empire builders' and adventurers.\n\nAmong the great names of travelers, Clive of India, Sir Stamford Raffles of Singapore, Huen Tsang of China and Marco Polo are worth mentioning.\n\nNow we look at another purpose of travel; it is for the love of 'culture'. Italy and Greece are living reflections of ancient classical love. The 'educated' young man, rich and sophisticated, is not considered completely 'finished' until his classical education has culminated in a 'Grand Tour' of Europe.\n\nTraveling teaches many things. It makes history real. It also gives us a true idea of the industrial, agricultural and mineral resources of a country. By extensive travel one is able to learn the geography of many countries. It creates in us the desire for investigation, exploration and discovery of many countries of the world.\n\nThe theory of travel in the modern age is completely different.

To some extent nature itself advertises her ware; for instance, he color and smell of flowers is nothing but advertisement to attract the attention of insects and birds and the promise of honey is the gift.\nAdvertisement is one of the media to draw the attention of the public and to inform them regarding a particular product. This may be called the psychology of persuasion and a way of converting people to a way of life or thinking. For example, a new drink may be introduced. It is not enough if the product is good but the public must be made to realize its existence. So the manufacturer adopts subtle ways of advertising. There must be appeal to visual and aural senses. Since advertisement has become very important and its methods are many, it has been professionalized and it is a trade today. In fact advertising agencies do good business. Since they employ specialists like artists and script writers, the advertiser can have expert service at a price.\n\nThere are hundreds of ways of advertising. Generally they may have visual, audio and audiovisual appeal. Leaflets and brochures are produced colorfully describing a product. Free samples are lavishly given. Even for established products they give free samples now and then so that new customers may be found for the product. Calendars are quite common and from very plain ones to pictorials are there. Some of the calendars are really so fine that they are being preserved. So calendar manufacturing during the season is a big business and there are people who hunt after calendars.\n\nPerhaps one of the most popular media of advertisement is the newspaper. Since newspaper reaches a very wider public, advertisement in the paper is a common feature. Some products are being advertised throughout the year and advertisements are the major source of income for the newspaper. Here the pictures and the script play a very important part.\n\nNowadays small gifts like key chains, purses, table ware and so on are used to advertise various products.\n\nAn advertisement cannot be useless. After it ahs achieved its purpose the general public may think it is useless. when an advertiser uses a lot of paper for printing his advertisement, the common man may question the wisdom behind it. If you go on throwing some mud on the wall, some is sure to stick; so too with the advertisement. the advertisement acts as a middleman in the trade bringing the prospective buyer and the product man nearer. with the complexity of the market and with dozens of products competing, advertisement is one of the ways of winning the market.\n\nOf course there are advertisements which are really misleading. Some medicines that are advertised claim to be panacea for all bodily ills. But very few could claim that honor. Some of the consumer products are not of that quality as claimed by the advertisement. take for instance, some tooth pastes. They claim to give all protection to the teeth but they prove the other way. In America this subtle way of persuading the public has been questioned when a number of products advertised could not stand the test of proof.\n\nWe can conclude in spite of its limitations, advertisement is an institution that has come to stay."

It means real headache for mother, for sometimes we choose the material which we cannot afford. then we will have to be convinced. Since the season is buys there is the trouble with the tailor who never keeps his promise which means knocking at his door often.\n\nThen we plan how to celebrate. We start with carol singing. On the eve we set up the X'mas tree and illuminate it. Christmas gifts are hung on the wall of living room. Though we get good stuff like cakes from the best bakery in town, some delicacies are prepared at home.\n\nWe never fail to go to the church and take part in singing. At home also it is all singing and dancing for some hours. Mother once in a way plays on the old piano though she is out of tune because she has been out of touch. We pretend to enjoy it for fear of displeasing her. The best part of the day is the dinner. Cakes and pastries, jams and marmalades and other nice things are freely thrown around. we have visits throughout the day and we return the visit. Older people talk of the good old days. Children count the gifts they have received. they hear good stories.\n\nOf course the Christmas ends up with the New Year. The New Year service in the church is a solemn affair and we all pray for the prosperity of the world in the coming year. Then there is stock taking. parents find time to go leisurely through the greeting cards sent and we reply to them where we haven't already done.\n\nI feel that such celebrations have becomes a part of the family and they cement the love and affection among our family members."

        "content": "Till the end of the last century, when the family was the unit, and bringing forth and rearing of children were a healthy trend to strengthen the family, women's place was at home. She played many roles, none of them demanding. She was the housewife, mother, manager of the household and the first educator of children, though the last was recognized but not mentioned.\nBut those days are gone and nobody who is educated and civilized looks upon a women as a doll to be kept at home at the will and pleasure of men folk. Of course, there are exceptions in certain societies where the in-laws play the villain. But days are changing and with the education of women and the change in economic status, women are enjoying a lot of freedom. There are many upcoming women and the world has been in recent times great women in politics, being prime ministers in some countries.\n\nThere has been a strong resentment among the women, about the way women have been treated. There is what is called the women's liberation movement and one of their major demands is equality of status as men; the other being equal pay for equal work and security for women.\n\nSome old societies still treat women as chattels who could be easily disposed of. In very primitive societies even today women are treated as commodity which could be bought and sold and even loans are raised on the security of women. These are far and few between. At the other end of the scale some women want complete freedom to live as they please; they don't want to be bound by wedlock. They would change their man as one changes his shirt. This is only an extreme view and not so common even among those who vigorously fight for women's freedom.\n\nWomen have been all along treated as a weaker sex. The connotation changes from person to person. Physically of course they are not as hardy as men but this doesn't mean that they don't have a strong heart. In fact they are stronger than men in certain aspects in that they are able to stand physical hardships. In their make up they are equipped for certain nature's ordeals which men are not subjected to. Whether they like it or not, generally women have more to do with children especially in their infancy and early childhood. This makes women distinctly different from men; their being soft and kind need not be taken for their weakness. If they appear weak sometimes it is to maintain the dignity of family life, so that children do not become a bad copy of the mother. Motherhood is so sacred that trying to tamper with it in the name of liberation movement would make society wild and disorganized."

        "content": "He had a humble beginning. His parents were ordinary people and his father was looking after the family lands. Of course once in a way he used to lend money. But he was very careful to whom he lent and was very strict in getting back the money. Those were the days when there were no banks, and cooperation was an unheard of word in that area. So the father with prudence and hard work built up sizable funds which the son inherited in the natural course.\nUnlike the father, the son was far more shrewd and enterprising. With the money he entered the cotton market and became a cotton broker to a mill owned by an European. This relationship of the broker and the mill owner continued for long and after some years the European felt that he could not continue for long in an alien country. There was national consciousness emerging. Workers became antagonistic and the day to day management was in peril and the European's life was in danger. So he felt it was wise to dispose of the mill and go away. The time was propitious for it because the mill was a going concern and nobody questioned about its profitability. The European mill owner thought of his friend, the cotton broker as a prospective buyer. For one thing he had money and secondly he was a shrewd business man. So, when the mill owner broached the subject to his cotton man, the later wanted time to decide. But the mill owner had already made up his mind to sell the mills and so he was willing make concessions. The cotton broker shrewd as he was bargained for a good price and got the mill by paying only half the price, but promised to pay the other half in small installments.\n\nThe broker turned mill owner and put his heart and soul into the business and built it up. Everything was going on very well; he opened many more mills. The more he earned the more ambitious he became. He began to play with his accounts and he became a suspect in the eyes of the authorities. They were only waiting to catch him and the snare spread widely. So one evening the learnt that the authorities were going to raid his office. He was sure that he could be caught red handed and knew he would be put behind the bars. There was only one way. His friend in a village could save him. So he took some important books with him and left for his friends' village. On the way he stopped his car and sent it back. He kept the bundle of accounts with him. Then he traveled by a bus to his friend's village. the friend was very much surprised but when he heard the story of his mill magnate to bury the books in a garden and the mill owner was given the shelter needed.\n\nOf course the mill was raided by the authorities. Nothing incriminating could be found. The enquiry did not help them to know where the mill owner had gone. In the meantime the friend used to go to the mills and through some confidential servants saw that the mill functioned properly. After a few weeks the case was withdrawn. the mill owner made his appearance again. As luck would have it there was a boom in the yarn market and the miller earned enormous amount of money. In his turn, he did not forget his friend who gave him shelter so he continued to help him faithfully till his last days. So a help done in time is greater than the word, as the saying goes."

Their small size might seem to be a disadvantage but actually the opposite is true. It is their very smallness which allows them to survive in the world heir sheer number of at least a few million different species also ensures their survival.\nTheir life cycles also ensure their survival. Often different species change dramatically in form and life styles as they grow. Brightly colored ugly caterpillars turn into butterflies. Mosquitoes begin as aquatic larvae. These changes allow insects food at different times of the year. Thus they are able to adapt to changes in their environment.\n\nFew insects are social but rather prefer to live a solitary life. In contrast other insects such as ants and bees are well known social insects. They live in colonies or hives and their society is very well organized with each individual member having a particular function to perform. Workers or drones do the job of building the nest as well as gathering food for the others. The soldier ants for example protect the nest and defend it against intruders. The queen ant or bee has the job of laying eggs to propagate the community. They are a living example of how effective teamwork can be.\n\nGenerally most insects adopt a form having three parts, a head, a thorax or chest and an abdomen. Insects also have six legs and most are equipped with antennae which are used to sense their surroundings. By far the most amazing thing about them is their eyesight, most have compound eyes which give them a field of vision of nearly 360°. That is why it is almost impossible to creep up on an insect. They also possess a very acute sense of smell as well as hearing, all these features help them to locate food or to find mates.\n\nInsects form an important part of the food chain. Fish, birds and small mammals depend on them as a food source. Their continued survival also guarantees the survival of other animal life, they are indeed indispensable to us."

He does not stop getting things at any stage saying this is enough. This sense of possession is at the back of many men's activities. Otherwise no man would work or labor hard. He undertakes many hazardous jobs because he can earn a lot of money. Man dives down into the deep sea because he can get pearls. Of all the cherished possessions of man, money is one.\nMoney is the commodity which gives a lot of power. Money has got the purchasing value so that one who has money can purchase anything. It was said of a great millionaire that, when he was denied a suite for rent in a posh hotel, he purchased the hotel overnight. Another purchased a real, live elephant when his young son cried for an elephant. So the power, which money places in the hands of the owner, is tremendous.\n\nThere is a saying that those who don't have money lose this world and those who don't have Grace of God lose the other world. What a mighty saying ! Money can be used for good as well as bad things. With money many good things could be done. As a wise man has said those that come by plenty of money, must look upon themselves as trustees and spend the money on good causes. There is no fun n possessing money but there is happiness in spending it in a wise way.\n\nMoney could be spent for helping others in need, it may be for one's relatives, kith and kin, or the public at large. Thus money may be spent for educating a boy, for getting medical relief for a relative or for getting things which the other cannot afford. In a bigger way it may be for building institutions like schools and colleges, hospitals, national memorials and libraries. Some create foundations for helping the advancement of science and technology. Research scholarships are common nowadays. The Nobel Prize is a classical example where money is used for honoring great people who have contributed to human welfare in different ways.\n\nMoney can be used for bad purposes as well. Bad people are supported by moneybags. Money is used to corrupt people and , as everyone knows corruption at all levels is a bane today. The giver as well as the receiver are guilty indeed.\n\nMoney is used for gambling and is also used to encourage guerilla wars. It was the gun makers and the manufacturers of military hardware who were responsible for the great wars. Elections are won by money power. Money is used to subvert officials and the spies are bought with money.\n\nOnly things is I don't have it. I don't know what I would do but that would be only for the good of the humanity. I will raise a housing colony where the poor will be accommodated for a nominal rent. I shall found a hospital with all modern facilities and make medical service cheap. I will spend money like ancient kings who spent all they had on good things. But there is a big 'if' namely 'Had I plenty of money, money enough and to spare'."

But my parents did not like my joining the team because they felt that it would interfere with my studies. Had I joined the team, I would have not only proved my mettle but it would have opened venues for my joining the police department later on.\n\nAnother opportunity I lost was at college. When I joined the university, I was in doubt to choose the right subject. I was not sure whether I should take up mathematics or literature. One of my friends, a lover of language suggested that I should take up literature and study. Then I could dive deep into the world of thought and imagery and could have communion with brilliant minds. I took up literature and of course got a Bachelor of Arts degree but when the question of employment came I could not easily compete with those who had high first class with science subjects.\n\nAfter leaving college, I struggled for sometime to get an employment. I was recommended to the post of a traveling representative. But my mother opposed it saying that traveling would not suit my health. And that opportunity was lost. I could have enjoyed going places, and the prospect of earning a high salary with decent allowances was lost. Now I am struggling hard trying to find a suitable employment."

        "content": "Once in the stream of life, we are ground to paste as if it were by the pressures of work coupled with anxiety, apprehension and doubt. So the senses are benumbed and we become a cog in the big wheel. That is the price we pay for modernity. Ask any office goer or a factory worker, and he will have his sorry talk to tell about the same dull routine for six days in the week. Very often he has no time to talk to his parents or to look after his children. To take the edge out of it, there must be periodical vacations.\nBut the vacation to be of any meaning must be long enough. Ideally speaking it is not to idle away one must seek a vacation. It must be an occasion when something useful could be done. Of course it may not be out of compulsion or pressure from outside but one chooses the vacation so that a good thing may be achieved.\n\nWhat I have in mind is something like this. When somebody chooses a long vacation he must have a plan for spending it. One must go on a long pilgrimage visiting places of historic or religious interest, as the Muslims go on Haj pilgrimage. There he must travel in a leisurely way, seeing places and perhaps getting into the spirit of it, unlike a modern tourist. A modern traveler rushes in to the jet plane and hops from place to place, spending his waking hour between the hotel and airport. At leas the would take a few photographs. A vacation spent on tour must be different.\n\nAgain the vacation may be utilized for some useful study. It may be for specializing in any branch of the discipline in which one is interested. For instance one interested in archaeology may visit places of such interest. This may take him to historical ruins to familarize himself with the subject.\n\nMay be the vacation is taken for some constructive work. One may to to the village and look to the repairs of the ancient family house.\n\nWhile the vacation may be worthwhile it must be free from constraints; otherwise it loses the spirit of vacation. It is the spirit of the city child finding itself free to play on the sea shore. It is the mental attitude which is very important. When one returns after the vacation one must look fresh and full of life and not like a storm-beaten mariner returning home.\n\nAfter what all has been said and done the outcome must be a happy one."

        "content": "Teaching has been described as a noble profession. In the modern context a teacher's role has now taken on a more challenging and demanding aspect. They are now more than ever entrusted with the task of moulding their charges into productive members of society. To a large extent this involves the very character of the student.\nSchool going children, in the early stages are still in the process of physical and mental development. Teachers represent role models for them to follow especially given today's hectic pace of life. It is not unusual to find that working parents of children have limited contact with their children through the week. It is often the teacher who fills this vacuum as the authority figure, friend and advisor. Children spend the better half o the day at school during normal lessons as well as being engaged in extra-curricular activities on other projects after classes. Often tuition or school sports and activities also occupy their weekends.\n\nOwing to the great deal of time spent by the child in the school environment, the level of inter-personal relationship between the pupil and teacher is improved. The pupil will come to expect more from his or her teacher in terms of involvement and commitment. The teacher would be in a unique position to influence and guide his student. If the teacher performs his role well the student will come to realize the importance of the positive traits and values being imparted to him. Learning by example is one of the most effective forms of learning.\n\nTo meet the new challenges posed by the role of teachers, the individual must be dedicated and committed to teaching as a profession. Teachers must also be trained not only on methods or techniques of how to impart knowledge but also on how to deal with students on a more personal level. Teachers who are also counselors in their schools are also formally trained in this aspect of student relations and play an important part in ensuring that the school becomes a conducive environment for the intellectual as well as the psychological development of the child."

If a person suffers from paralytic limb, it is natural. On the other hand, if one has lost a purse during a travel it is because of circumstances.\nIn my case stammering is the biggest problem. I don't know how it has occurred but it is there and I have to grow with that. I am growing more and more conscious of it as I grow in age. Because I stammer I am not able to mingle freely with others of my own age. They react differently, most of them mock at me and very few have sympathy. While the ideas roll, words do not flow at the same speed. So very often I blink, which means I am taken for a muff. because of stammering I can't retort and my contribution in a company will be very little so I have to be very often an idle spectator. not that I can't give my ideas but I am unable to speak that fast. So it has developed in me an inferiority complex and nowadays I shun company.\n\nHow to overcome is the problem. I have heard of a great Greek Orator, Demosthenes who was a stammer as a child, was able to overcome it with some sort of exercise. It was told that he put pebbles in his mouth and standing on the seashore, used to cry aloud. Thus he overcame his stammering. But in my case I have not tried that. But what I do nowadays is to gather ideas and slowly put them without repeating a word. I am successful to some extent and I cannot say that I have overcome it completely. One thing is certain;  this stammering of mine has blocked certain employment opportunities for me; for instance, I cannot become a lawyer or a platform speaker. though i like music and enjoy it, I will never become a singer. A pity, isn't it ?\n\nI have come to the wise conclusion that one must put up with that which one cannot improve."

        "content": "It is entirely correct to say that being the only child would be better than having brothers and sisters. Being an only child has its advantages and disadvantages.\nLet us look at the advantages first. The parents can spend well in the upbringing of the child. The child can be provided with better food, nutritious and well balanced, which may not be possible in a big family. The child can have better and a variety of clothing.\n\nBesides these the child can get good education. He may go to a good school because the parents can afford to meet the expenses. Good education means good books, good teachers and good tools. For instance, where there are many children an average parent cannot find means to provide books for every one. Because of better attention to his education, the only child can hope to reach even university provided, of course, he has the brains.\n\nAnother signal advantage is that the parent can attend to the child personally. This will help the parent to shape the child's taste in dress and food. The parent can be helpful in the mental and intellectual growth of the child. There will be an intimacy which could help the boy or girl in later years.\n\nThere are also disadvantages in being an only child. The child will feel lonely, companionless and none to share his joys and sorrows. The parent cannot take the place of a brother or sister because of the age gap. Because he is the only child he may be petted and pampered and so he will easily become a spoilt child. He will develop more negative qualities like selfishness, pettiness and obstinacy. He won't have the opportunity to develop many human qualities. Love, affection, kindness, sympathy, appreciation and many such qualities cannot easily develop in an only child. Then again there will be few opportunities to give expression to those qualities.\n\nWhen they are not developed, he can't have a healthy growth and he can hardly become a well rounded personality. He may not understand the value of mutual help which is very important in life. He will become so selfish that he would like to have everything for himself. He cannot understand the importance of living with others.\n\nIn a society each member has to live with others, for the welfare of everyone. A big rope is after all a combination of many straws and its strength depends on how well it has been twisted. So too unless the society is made up of well seasoned members, it cannot stand the onslaught of bad powers. So the lonely child without friendship and understanding with others cannot easily fit in a society. So weighing all these considerations I would like to have brothers and sisters, not too many for that matter rather than be a lonely child."

He has a winning smile and would nod if he sees his students and if time permits would enquire about them Somehow he is interested in the welfare of his students. If a pupil is a footballer, he talks football to him. If one is a smart boy, he talks about studies. In fact I used to wonder how a small head as his could carry all the knew.\n\nAs a teacher he is exacting. No one can escape his eagle eye in the classroom or in the laboratory. If he sees that things are done properly he is not bossy. For instance, he would insist on everything in its place and every work on time. In writing the records he won't relax the rules. Work is work and it must be done properly and well. In this he himself is an example. He is always prompt in correcting the work sheets and records. To some extent he is fastidious in these things. He has a personal approach in these matters and he will call for each student, point out the mistakes and make him correct them.\n\nIt is a pleasure to sit in his class for he will explain his lessons with a lot wit and humor. One could easily see how widely he has read for he could quote from the classics to the daily newspaper stories. Nothing of interest can escape him. Under his treatment even the dullest lesson would become interesting. Though he would indulge in jokes, he is not a joker and would never go in for cheap jokes.\n\nAs a teacher he has never been vindictive. If he punishes it is not to would but to heal. If he feels that a student has taken it too much to his heart, he would have a private talk with him and would convince him that he deserved the punishment. His love for the subject and teaching is so apparent that nobody is offended at his punishment. By nature, he is one who would easily forgive and forget. every student is a nice fellow to him.\n\nHe is an amazingly wonderful man of knowledge. He can easily talk on any subject with an expertise, whether it be health, sports, astrology or politics of the day. He keeps himself up-to-date and his motto is once a scholar, always a scholar. He used to say, rightly too, that one's education does not stop with the school or the college. But for all this he is not a pedant and he is easily approachable. So many pupils used to meet him to get his advice which he would frankly give.\n\nSince Mr. lee is such a good combination of high qualities and all those desirable things in a teacher, no wonder I look upon him as my favorite teacher, there are other students too who hold him in great admiration."

The evils are gambling, stealing, murder, unchastity and rugs. The history of humanity is full of examples where people have been ruined by following the path of one or other of them. A whole nation was brought to disgrace because of opium.\nWhy then man takes to drugs ? Some think it adds to pleasure; some others think that it takes away physical weariness. Still others take it to forget their worries, while others take it in order to please the company. In cold countries they take it to keep oneself warm. While in very small dose, drugs may and do act as medicine, they can never bring pleasure. True they have the doping effect and hence at the spur of the moment the person may act more vigorously but only to find himself weaker later. taking harmful drugs in large quantities in time and out of time is addiction.\n\nFrom time immemorial man has known to make drugs. Today, various kinds of drinks like wine, brandy and whisky are common in the market. But consuming these drinks in moderate quantity is not harmful. Whereas opium in various forms are all drugs. These drugs affect the nervous system especially small brains which control the voluntary action. So a man under the influence of a drug is unable to walk and he staggers. Since it deadens the senses, the man under the influence of drug does not know what he does or speaks. Very often under the influence of a drug he does shameful acts. Continued addiction upsets the digestive system, especially the liver, leading even to death.\n\nA drug does not at all add to mental alertness; far from it. The mental faculties will be benumbed. In order to forget worries people take drugs because of their soporific effect but exactly the drug is not the answer to one's worry. Certainly the drug addiction brings moral degradation. The addict himself knows it and so he consumes them only in secret and , no addict openly will come forward to say he is an addict. It is against all religious sanctions. It leads to immoral and evil activities. Socially also an addict is looked down upon and people would try to avoid a drug addict. He would be a nuisance wherever he is, at home or in company. He would bring untold misery to his people and those around him. except in the company of addicts, he would be looked upon as a leper. His family also will share the disgrace because people will point the accusing finger at the family. Financially it ruins the addict. The money would go down the drains as it could be spent for the betterment of him or the benefit of the family. So to act wisely, one should by all means avoid drugs."

As water began to flow, the drains got their fill and the stream rushed through them carrying all the dirt of the road. The drain pipes were full and brought down water with a noise. The cars that dashed along the roads did splash water on all sides to the chagrin of the passersby who got drenched. In a good rain, the umbrella is no answer. Boarding the buses in such a condition was a problem and the streets were wet and flooded.

But for fear many things in the society would not have changed; for instance fear of punishment makes people law abiding. Fear of falling sick makes people take care of health and food. Fear of losing promotion and even losing the job makes an employee loyal, faithful and so on. Fear of death and beyond generally make people pious and God fearing. in general fear is essential for preservation.\nFear when persists becomes a fear complex. When there is legitimate reason it is good to have fear. But once it has developed into a complex, fear is there even when there is no cause for it. Take an instance; for an employee, fear of being dismissed may have developed to such an extent that when his boss calls him for ordinary business the former may shake in his shoes.\n\nAs it is fear is not there in us when we are children. Fear grows with us as we grow. Elders bring in fear in order to control sights. Fear of people, of animals all develop because of circumstances. Children in a city very rarely dare to get into the waters of a lake or river or the sea because they are literally bathroom bred. Many instances could be cited.\n\nIn my case, I am afraid of losing my rank in the class. I have been standing first in the class for some years, so I look upon any rival with jealously. After taking every examination I used to exercise my mind whether I would get the first rank. This has developed into a complex that everytime the results are announced I am afraid of the outcome.\n\nI want to overcome some of these fears but they stick on to me like a pitch."

        "content": "Forests with a quite repose, an air of placid calm and a pleasing natural scenery, since time immemorial, played an important part in the life of mankind.\nWhat do we learn about the African huts of the primitive days ? Wood has been the basic material used by them. Let us go as far back to the Merrie England' of the sixteenth century. Its beautiful black and white houses depended on wooden structures. Even in the modern age when steel plays an important part in the formation of the sky-scrapers, wood still forms an intrinsic part of the smaller modern buildings.\n\nSoft woods and hard woods are used for various purposes. Frames and doors are usually made of soft woods. Hard woods are used for furniture.\n\nFurthermore, wood has played large part in transport. The primitive man used wood for making wheels for horse carts which enabled him to move from place to place,; others were dependent on wood for making boats.\n\nWe can also see how great is the need of timber in the making of paper. The logs of soft wood are first turned into wood pulp. This undergoes certain chemical processes. Paper is the end project.\n\nNor are the uses of them in other fields less pleasing. Some forests provide useful oils, turpentine from the pine, palm oil from the palm and olive oil from the olive tree.\n\nForests play an important part in the prevention of soil erosion. Addition of huming and vegetable matter by forests, preserves the soil from degeneration. They also attract rain clouds.\n\nForests shelter wild animals and small insects. Climbing shrubs and creepers are protected by them. They provide men with beautiful scenery. One's eyes are charmed with the soothing luxury of colors, with the soft appeal of endless greenery."

        "content": "I enjoy gardening as a hobby and a leisure activity. Most of my friends think it odd for a young person such as myself to have such a hobby. They would rather be out playing football. I have tried explaining to them the great joy I derive from seeing something I have planted grow and thrive while being carefully nurtured. They believe that most things grow on their own naturally without any effort having to be put in.\nI suppose that to a large extent I owe my interest in gardening to my parents who are themselves avid gardeners. On most evenings, it is not unusually to see both my parents and I pottering about in the garden. As we live in a house with a rather large compound there is always plenty to do. During the months when rain is sparse all the plants have to be watered daily and during those months with heavy rainfall we have to take care that precious nutrients in the soil are not washed away. Healthy and nutrient rich soil is important as our garden is full of all sorts of trees and plants. In a constrained area this will lead to a depletion of nutrients which have to be replenished from time to time.\n\nOur neighbors often remark that our house is the most beautiful and resplendent one in the neighborhood. This is due to the fact that the variety of flowering plants we have are kept well pruned so as to promote flowering all year round. In spite of the fact that practically every square foot of garden area is taken up by some plant or the other, careful management of the available area has given our house an uncluttered look. Fruit trees are a favorite for my father. we have rambutan, mango and banana trees in our compound which my father has managed to grow to a certain height so as not to pose a problem to my immediate neighbors. As some people do not appreciate a garden all strewn with dead leaves.\n\nAll in all I find gardening to be a most satisfying and fulfilling pastime which can contribute to a greener Maldives."

        "content": "Pests and insects are often harmful to health as they are vectors or carriers of the germs of many diseases. Some of these diseases are lethal such as the plague which can be spread by rats or malaria and dengue fever spread by mosquitoes. Other ailments such as coughs and colds are allergic reactions due to the presence of tiny insects called mites. It is important therefore to keep one's home free such pests or insects.\nCommon household pests include also flies which are dangerous pests as they settle on all kinds of dirt and their hairy bodies pick up bits of dirt. These flies may then land on exposed food leaving the same food contaminated with this dirt. Flies are known to spread the germs of bacteria associated with many diseases and must be controlled by not leaving rubbish heaps or refuse lying around as these are breeding grounds for flies. Food should also not be left exposed.\n\nAnts are generally not disease carriers but can be a source of annoyance if present in large numbers. They are attracted to food left lying about especially food containing sugar. However white ants or termites which attack wood may be a real danger in the home by weakening wooden structures such as staircases.\n\nMost housewives are only too familiar with the pestilence posed by cockroaches which also spread quickly in the home as unlike other pests they eat almost anything such as leather, cardboard and as they like. As they are nocturnal feeders they are hard to eradicate.\n\nBed bugs too breed very quickly in beds and mattresses and very soon infest the whole house. These bugs feed on human blood and prolonged exposure to them can cause severe skin ailments. These bugs are tiny and therefore unseen and it is therefore important to have thorough and frequent cleaning of bed and bedding to keep their numbers in check."

        "content": "With the coming of popular governments in countries, general elections when people's representatives are elected, have come to stay. Even in those countries where dynastic rulers are reigning, elections are held. Elections are great occasions and grand ceremonies go along with them. Elections decide the fate of a country for a term which may be four or five or even six years. Even in the communist countries where the single party is the rule they have a semblance of an election.\nElections are called according to the rules of the constitution. Normally it may be held when the term of the Government is over. Or it may be caused when the Government in power is defeated. Again the Government in power, may resign and force an election in order to establish its strength.\n\nWhen the Government of the day resigns or otherwise, the Head of the State calls for a general election. The necessary notification is issued and the election follows. It is the duty of the Election Commissioner to plan and hold election in a peaceful way.\n\nThe electoral rolls prepared periodically show who the voters are. Now adult franchise is the order of the day and universal. All men and women beyond a certain age become voters. Though electoral rolls are revised periodically, just before the election, chance is given for the voter to see if his name is on the electoral rolls and if not to apply to the proper authority to have his name included.\n\nThe Election Commissioner announces the program of election, when to hand in nomination, when to withdraw, the date of the election and the date of counting. The electoral laws are made public.\n\nOnce the election is announced, various parties aspiring to get into the government choose their candidates. Nomination of a particular candidate may depend on many factors. It may be local influence, money, political power and so on. Once the nominations are scrutinized by the electoral officer and accepted, the candidates start their canvassing. to start with, the parties issue their election manifesto which may contain all sorts of promises. All kinds of advertisement media are used to draw the attention of the voters. The poster war starts and all available spaces in hoarding are filled with posters. Leaflets are freely supplied. The radio and the television are judiciously used. Public rallies are held where the candidates or their party leaders speak at length what they proposed to do if returned. Individual voters are contacted by volunteers.\n\nJust before the election, election booths are notified and election officials are appointed. Voting will be by secret ballot. How this is being done differs from country to country. After the elections are over, the next stage is counting. In America (the USA) counting is done mechanically and the results are computerized and so the results are known as the election progresses. Once the results are announced, the majority party may form the Government.\n\nElections are not always smooth in some countries. The rival party workers may clash and there will be riots. Sometimes the worst in the people surfaces during an election. However, elections are held and election is a tool in a modern Government."

The site is spacious allowing ground for the house and a decent garden. even from the beginning I wanted that my house must have an elegant and chaste look.\nThe house is a four -- room mansion with a well furnished kitchen and, of course with modern bathroom facilities. The living rooms are planned with comfortable seating in view. The furniture has been chosen with great car. The walls have been painted with soft colors to match the curtains. Each room is fitted with a loudspeaker so that one can enjoy the radio program from bed. The drawing room is elegantly furnished with sofas and chairs and a table in the center. The wall shelves are used to stack books. There is a niche for the television and the room is spacious for a small group to watch the programmers comfortably. All the rooms are air conditioned.\n\nThe kitchen is a beauty by itself. It is fitted with electric grills and things could be stacked neatly in specially designed cabinets. it is provided with modern gadgets for grinding or cutting.\n\nIn front of the house is an artificial pool with a fountain singing all the time for the sun, stars and the moon. One or two fish troughs kept in the portico add to the beauty of the place. There is a garage on one side of the house. In the backyard there are a few fruit bearing trees. Near the boundary fence of the house there are some coconut trees. In front of the house are certain bushes of crotons and flower plants. The well kept lawn with luscious green grass is very pleasing to the eye. There is also a small playground for children with a swing and a see-saw.\n\nPurposely I avoided putting up high storeys because in my case space was not a problem."

For example, one learns to swim when he suddenly finds himself in deep water and he has the first lesson in swimming.\nOf course it is a case of \"necessity is the mother of invention\" One day I had to make tea. That was the first time when I went into the kitchen. I have seen people making my tea and above all I have always enjoyed my cup of tea. But there is a vast difference between making tea and enjoying your cup of tea.\n\nThen once our Scout troop was camping away from the town and we were in a wood. That day we cooked food for ourselves. Our Scout master encouraged us to prepare our food. Our patrol was in charge of cooking. So naturally I had an active part to play. That day we cooked rice and prepared some curry was not so nice. Still we took it in the right spirit of a Scout.\n\nThereafter I took courage to prowl into the kitchen helping mother in the various activities. At first of course mother would not allow just to help her washing, peeling, slicing and so on In all her kindness she would show how things should be done. Slowly she showed me how to dress food, what ingredients and in what quantity they should be used and to what extent the item must be heated or boiled and so on. Now that mother has grown confident that I could do well in the kitchen. Now and then she leaves me in full charge of the kitchen wherever she has guests or other work to attend to. No wonder I am taking lessons on kitchen art now."

In each booth there were guides who explained the working of various exhibits. Illustrated booklets were freely available. To avoid jamming in any particular booth at a particular time, route was very well marked. At the entrance there was an information room. During the hours when the exhibition was on there was soft music played. there was also a restaurant serving snacks and soft drinks.\n\nIn the mechanical engineering section many types of machines related to different industries were exhibited. What interested me was a working bench for carpentry. It was power operated and many things could be made in a very short time.\n\nThe electronic section was the most popular. Many latest gadgets were there, from the simple calculator to electronic kitchen control. With the help of the electronic gadgets the housewife can be freed of many of her chores and cares. The watches and clocks section was very attractive. Here is an area where the Japanese genius is evident. Many types of watches in solid gold real glittering diamonds were displayed. There were funny clocks working in ingenious ways.\n\nThe agricultural section was highly representative from tractors, bull dozers and harvesters to various farming implements. The humble buffalo and the plough will become obsolete in a few years. Dairying was well represented. One could see how one gets his bottle of milk almost straight from the cow's udder. Food processing, preserving and refrigeration were shown on a sophisticated scale.\n\nIn short the exhibition very well showed the triumph of science and technology.

It is a memory that periodically comes and goes, but it is one of the most precious memories that I and my wife share. I am thankful that we can remember it together. It's a reminder that things are not what they seem and that angels come in many packages.\nWe live in College Station, Texas and we were on our way home from Houston, Texas around the Weston Lakes area one Saturday or Sunday morning. And when I say morning, I'm talking 1:00 to 2:00 in the morning. We were on our way home and decided to stop at a local gas station to get coffee and something to snack on since it was a good hour and a half before we'd reach home.\n\nWhen we were done, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a man standing outside in front of the building. You could tell that he was a homeless man. His clothes were tattered and worn and it looked like he had gone in and gotten him some coffee or something warm to drink since it was cold this time of the year. He must have not had enough money to get something to eat. That is not something I remember too well, because that is not what \"moved\" me.\n\nThe next thing I remember is a dog that walked up to the front of the building. Being a dog lover, I noticed that she was part wolf and probably part German shepherd. I could tell it was a she, because you could tell that she had been feeding puppies. She was terribly in need of something to eat and I felt so bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her puppies would not make it.\n\nMy wife and I sat there and looked at her. We noticed that people walked by and didn't even pet her, like most people do when they walk by an animal in front of a store. She might not have been as pretty and clean as most, but she still deserved better. But we still did not do anything. But someone did. The homeless man, who I thought did not buy himself anything to eat, went back into the store. And what he did brought tears to my wife and me. He had gone into the store and with what money he may have had, bought a can of dog food and fed that dog.\n\nI know that this story isn't as inspirational as most stories, but it plays a great part in our lives. You see, that was Mother's Day weekend. And a lot of people forget that some animals are parents too. And animals - not only we humans - are God's creatures too.\n\nIt would be a better story if I could remember all the details, but even without the details, I believe it still gets the message across. It took a homeless man, to show me what I should have done. He showed me to be better man that day."

Sensing that something was wrong, she gently pushed the door inward. The sight that greeted her made her gasp in horror. The apartment was in a a mess. The couch and coffee table had been overturned. the glass door of the display cabinet was broken and everything was strewn all over the floor. She realized that her apartment had been burgled.\n\nThe, a sudden thought came to her which made her heart thump with fear. What if the burglars were still in her apartment, in her bedroom ? She pulled the door again and left it slightly ajar. Then, she ran down the stairs as quietly as she could. Once on the ground floor, she used her cellular phone to call the police.\n\nThe police arrived in less than ten minutes. There were four policemen and they accompanied Wendy to her apartment. The police told Wendy to stay outside the flat while the four policemen, with drawn arms, centered the apartment. They carefully searched the apartment for the burglars but it was obvious that the culprits have left long ago.\n\nThe police then sent for the crime technicians. The technicians spent more than hour looking for clues and dusting for fingerprint. Then, the police asked her to make a careful inventory of her things and to report the stolen items and to give her statement.\n\nMany weeks passed but the burglars were never caught and Wendy gave up hope of ever recovering her stolen valuables. Still, she continued to stay at the same place, but she had taken better security measures and even installed  burglar alarm to safeguard her property."

The fire blazed even fiercely in other parts of the building when the fire in one portion looked about to be extinguished.\n\nThere were also cries and wails from women and men. These were probably the tenants or owners of the building. There were loud sobs and soft weeping by many. Others displayed a variety of emotions. Some were sad, some were angry and yet some other simply looked indifferent.\n\nJames could also see that there were also some casualties. There were three ambulances and James could see that the paramedics were busy transporting the injured onto stretchers and into the ambulances.\n\nThe police had also cordoned off the hazardous area and curious onlookers were kept at a safe distance.\n\nFrom where James was, he could feel the intense heat emitted by the inferno.\n\nIn another hour, the fire was finally contained but the shophouse was reduced to a smouldering ruin. The firemen packed their equipment and left the scene. the three ambulances had also sped off to the hospital with the casualties. Only the police were left.

Though there have been instances when man had to steal food in impoverished countries because of hunger, the bulk of thefts committed are for easy wealth. They rob to avoid hard work and want an easy life, thinking that they can get away with their crimes. Because such immoral people exist, we have to take proper security measures to safeguard our property.\nSingapore is a prospering nation and her people have become more affluent in recent years. Many have their homes and offices equipped with expensive pick-proof locks and some have even installed burglar alarm systems. Others keep dangerous attack dogs like the Doberman pinscher and the German shepherd. Those who are able to afford the price have employed stern and unsmiling security guards to protect their premises.\n\nMany people are also very careful with the amount of cash they have in their person, preferring to leave their money and other valuables in banks. The widespread us of ATM cards and credit cards have also paved the way for a cashless society. this is to prevent huge losses if one's pockets have been picked as the victim could call the necessary banks and financial institutions to cancel his cards before they could be used by the thief. There have been numerous arrests in recent years of thieve who have tried to sue stolen credit cards.\n\nIt is a sad fact that even in our progressive country, the threat of robbery and theft is still ever-present, as it is plainly declared in the crime prevention police posters: \"Low crime does not mean no crime.\"\n\nThe steps we have to take to safeguard our properties have become second nature to most of us. Indeed, most of us lock our cars, homes and offices automatically when not in use. Those that have been negligent in taking proper security measures to safeguard their property have only themselves to blame if they were to be robbed. To be negligent in matters of security is equivalent to putting out a sign that loudly proclaims: \"My property is not protected, please rob me !\""

He never shouted at us and was very patient with the slower pupils.\n\nOur class decided to hold a farewell party for this model teacher. But we needed to have the permission of the school's principal first. Zoe was given the task of writing to the principal for permission to hold the party as her handwriting was the neatest and her language skills were excellent. After the letter was written, all the pupils in the class signed the letter and a delegation of six pupils, myself included, went to the principal's office.\n\nThe principal was mildly curious when he saw the six of us in his office. We gave him the letter of petition and after reading it in silence, he frowned. He said that the request was very irregular but after the six of us beseeched him in earnest, he relented and gave us the permission. He allowed us to hold the party during the last period of the following Friday, which would be Mr. Yeo's last day of teaching in our school.\n\nThe whole class was excited after getting the permission. We gathered together after school and planned for the party. After some debate and discussion we finally agreed on the things we needed to do.\nOn the last period of school on the following Friday, our class monitor, Abdul Ghani, approached Mr. Yeo just as he was about to begin the next lesson.\n\n\"Sir, we have obtained permission from the principal to treat you to a simple farewell party.\"\n\nSome of the pupils then brought out the drinks and food that have been prepared by their parents. We have left it hidden in a corner so that Mr. Yeo would not see it as we wanted to surprise him. And surprise him we did! For an instant, he was speechless and his eyes took on a misty look. Then, he was back to his normal self again. He acquiesced to the treat and my classmate, Sujata, brought a paper plate of fried noodles and a cup of lemonade for Mr. Yeo. Everyone cheered and clapped as he took his first spoonful of fried noodles.\n\nAfter the meal, Mr. Yeo gave an impromptu farewell speech. He spoke for fifteen minutes, thanking the class for taking the trouble to hold the party and for being such caring pupils. His speech was also peppered with sound advice for us.\n\nJust before the school bell rang to signal the end of the school day, I was given the honour of presenting our farewell gift to Mr. Yeo. We knew him to be a great fan of mystery and detective novels and so we had bought for him the \"Complete Sherlock Holmes\" which contained all the stories and novelettes written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. When he unwrapped the gift, we saw two large beads of tears rolling down his cheeks. He was very deeply moved.\n\nThen, the school bell rang and each pupil shook hands with Mr. Yeo for one last time before heading for home."

While playing soccer with another amateur team, some players of the rival team taunted my brother, who played a defensive role in his team, after one of their teammates had scored a goal. My brother was hotheaded at that time and he replied to the taunts quite vehemently. This led to the exchange of insults and eventually a fight ensued. When he returned home that day, he had blue-black bruises on his face and body. He related the whole incident to my parents, after which he was severely reprimanded by my father for his behavior. My father advised him to be always level-headed and never to let anger blind him into doing senseless things.\n\nEvery once in a while, we read in the papers of youths and even adults involved in fights with dangerous weapons resulting in serious injury and even death.

After the usual falls and bruises, he finally mastered the skill of riding the bicycle in a few days. Since then, Kenny loved to cycle around the neighborhood in the evenings.\n\nAt first, his parents did not allow him to ride on the roads but as he grew older and more mature, his parents relented and allowed him on the roads and even acquiesced to his cycling to school some two kilometers away.\n\nAt school, Kenny's enthusiasm for cycling rubbed on to his close friends. Many of them pestered their parents to buy bicycles for them and soon, one by one, all his friends owned bicycles. The boys would come to school on their bicycles and after school, they would go for a three-kilometer ride.\n\nOne day, Kenny was in town where there was an exhibition of bicycle stunts. Champion riders and stunt performers showed a variety of skills on the bicycle. They could do 'wheelies', jump over ropes on their bicycles and `fly' through the air with the aid of a sloping platform. Kenny witnessed this exhibition in awe and was duly impressed by the performance.\n\nWhen he reached home, he could not contain himself and wanted to try out some of the tricks he had witnessed. He mounted his bicycle and rode to a vacant plot of land where he could practice. He tried to do the 'wheelie' and after some time, he found that he could do it. Kenny thought that he had mastered the skill and happily made his way home.\n\nJust a short distance away from his house, Kenny decided to do the 'wheelie' on the road. As he pulled the handlebars to lift up the front of his bicycle, he lost his balance and fell sideways, colliding with a motorcycle traveling on the lane beside him. The motorcycle also lost control and both Kenny and the motorcyclist ended up sprawled on the road. The motorcyclist was not seriously hurt but Kenny was bleeding from his head and the skin on his arms and legs were scraped.\n\nLuckily, the motorcyclist had a mobile phone and he quickly called an ambulance. Kenny was rushed to the hospital where he was treated and warded. There were lacerations on his head, body, arms and legs. He had also fractured his left wrist. Kenny spent two weeks in hospital and took more than two months to fully recover.\n\nKenny had learnt a valuable lesson on that day. The road is not a place for stunts. He still enjoys riding his bicycle but he has realized that stunts are only for trained professionals."

        "content": "Pests and insects like the houseflies, ants, mosquitoes, cockroaches and lizards are a nuisance to health and comfort in the home. Though many people use generous amounts of insecticides in its many forms - sprays, coils, nets, etc – it seems that it has little or no effect on these creatures. The only way to ensure that our homes are pest-free is to make our surroundings as non-conducive as possible for their breeding and presence.\n\nMosquitoes are parasites which live on the blood of man and other animals and they are also carriers of deadly diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Mosquitoes breed in stagnant water. So, we should never leave any water stagnant for a long period of time. We have to ensure that water does not collect in any area surrounding our homes and make it possible for mosquitoes to breed. Likewise, drains and pipes should be cleaned regularly.\n\nSpiders like to spin cobwebs in dark corners inside and outside the house. Therefore, it is wise to clean these corners once in a while so that these infrequented corners do not become homes for spiders and other creepy crawlies.\n\nHouseflies breed in rubbish. Many people leave their rubbish in open garbage bins which attracts flies. The flies will then swarm over to the kitchen and infect the food left open in plates and pans. The best way to keep flies away is to keep food covered at all times. Rubbish should be disposed in plastic bags tied securely with a knot before putting it into the garbage bin. The garbage bin should also be always covered.\n\nAnts and cockroaches search for bits of food lying about in the house. Cockroaches also thrive in filth and dirt. Therefore, ensure that the house, and especially the kitchen, is swept and cleaned everyday so that no particles of food are left on the floor. All eating and cooking utensils should be kept in pest-proof containers. Drawers and cabinets should also be checked periodically to ensure that ants and cockroaches are not breeding within them.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that our homes are pest-free, we have to adopt cleanliness and hygiene as our way of life."

        "title": "My Favorite Author",
        "content": "One of my favorite authors is Michael Crichton. He has written several best-selling novels such as \"Jurassic Park\" and its sequel \"The Lost World\", \"The Andromeda Strain\", \"Eaters of the Dead\" and \"Rising Sun\". He is also the creator of the award-winning television series \"E.R.\"\n\nMichael Crichton is a wonderful storyteller. He spins his tales with true-to-life characters and his intricately woven plots are realistic. It is obvious that Michael Crichton does a good deal of research for all his science fiction novels are based on known scientific facts and sound theories. He does not invent unbelievable fantasies, like some others whom I do not want to name, to attract readers.\n\nFor example, in \"Jurassic Park\", Michael Crichton painstakingly portrays the means which the dinosaurs were cloned. The scientists first look for preserved blood-sucking insects from the Mesozoic Era trapped in ambers, that is, the hard translucent fossilized resin originating from extinct coniferous trees. Next, they look for traces of dinosaur blood in these insects. The tiny amounts that they extract from the insects are then used to clone the dinosaurs.\n\nOne can discern that Michael Crichton's knowledge of palaeontology and medical science is truly astounding when they read his two dinosaur novels.\n\nIn \"The Andromeda Strain\", Crichton tells the tale of a deadly micro-organism brought to Earth by a satellite. The bacteria kills people in seconds by clotting their blood solid. Again, his immense scientific knowledge comes into play when he writes this novel about how five scientists race against time to find a solution to nullify the effects of the 'Andromeda Strain'. This was his first book written in 1969 and after more than thirty years, it is still in print and remains in great demand by readers all over the world.\n\nMany of Michael Crichton's novels have been made into box-office hits. It is undeniable that this master storyteller is able to attract readers and audiences alike regardless of the medium, be it books or movies."

        "content": "Most major cities and towns in the world are overpopulated. This means that too many people are living in the same area. The reason is quite simple. Folks from the country move into the cities in the hope of getting better employment and enriching their lives. But what has this led to?\n\nTrees and plants have to make way for skyscrapers to house the hordes of people that migrate into the cities. Hundreds or even thousands of motor vehicles travel on the roads at all times emitting harmful gases into the atmosphere polluting the air we breathe. The city has been stripped of its natural beauty and has become a concrete jungle!\n\nOverpopulation has also led to the rise in crime as the city's economy is not able to support everyone and there is bound to be unemployment. This in turn results in the rise of crime and corruption. Robbery, prostitution and peddling of drugs are prevalent in most cities.\n\nFinally, scientists have devised ways to make crops and animals grow faster by unnatural means such as the use of growth hormones. This has become necessary to feed and sustain the ever-growing population. But what is the price of these synthetically enhanced foods? Recent studies have shown that there are certain side-effects for the consumers.\n\nAs can be seen, the effects of overpopulation are manifold. Health and morals have deteriorated and nature has been sacrificed in the name  of scientific progress."

        "content": "I had a terrible toothache that night. I took a couple of Panadol tablets but they were of little use as the relief was short-lived and the pain returned with greater intensity. I tried rinsing and gurgling with Listerine but that was no help either. I could not sleep a wink that night as the toothache also caused the left side of my face and head to throb with pain.\n\nWhen morning came, I took a very quick shower and made for the dentist. There were a couple of patients before me and I had to wait my turn. I registered at the counter and took a seat near the dental surgery. I took a magazine and flipped its pages but trying to read was out of the question. The words simply did not register. All I felt was the excruciating pain. I closed my eyes and tried to concentrate on the soft music being played over the speakers hoping that it would distract me from the pain I felt. But the pain obstinately remained.\n\nAlmost an hour later, my name was called. I stood up and walked slowly into the surgery. I noticed the reclining chair fitted with all the usual dental equipment: the dental drill, the syringes, the dental pliers and a host of other gadgets whose names I do not even know. The dentist asked me what was wrong and I told him of my toothache. He then indicated the reclining chair and asked me to be seated.\n\n\"Open your mouth wide and relax,\" the dentist ordered. I did as was told and he peered into my mouth with the aid of a small mirror on the end of a stick. After the examination, he shook his head and told me that the tooth cannot be saved and had to be extracted. The dentist then filled a hypodermic syringe with a colorless liquid. He told me that it was Novocaine, a local anaesthetic, and he would be injecting it into my gums to numb the area where the extraction would be done.\n\nShortly, I felt the prick of the needle and then in seconds, my toothache was gone and I felt the numbness in my gums. The dentist was very skilful and soon he had painlessly extracted my tooth and put a wad of cotton on the wound.\n\nI got up from the chair and thanked the doctor as best as I could for my gums were still numb and there was a wad of cotton in my mouth. I left the surgery and paid the fees at the counter. Then, feeling much better than when I had stepped into the clinic, I walked towards home."

No voices or screams though, no hitchhiking ghost with an axe to grind for a life that would never be lived.\n\nThe road was darker than she had even remembered. The trees were weighted down with green leaves, not barren and naked as they were now, and there was a moon that night that hung from the sky like a huge yellow balloon. They had been drinking, making their way home from a party. Mike chided her, took his eyes from the road one too many times. They were laughing, joking, in the midst of blasting music.\n\nThe car veered towards the shoulder, skidded in the light rain. One moment they were laughing and the next a pole came charging out of nowhere, slid into the windshield with such force that everything that was hers was forever lost. The boy whose ring she wore about her neck as if it were a Pullitzer gone, a future unplanned, uncertain but more than once dreamt about, also gone.\n\nShe loved coming to this same spot every now and again, to see what little remained. There was a crudely made cross where the pole had been, where people sometimes liked placing small clumps of flowers. This time of year the blossoms there had all but withered.\n\nShe studied the glass shards still on the road and wondered why they were there after all this time.\n\nShe wheeled herself back to the van and onto the lift. Positioned her chair and turned on the ignition. Her head shot to her right for a last look. She wouldn't be coming back again, suddenly the pilgrimage seemed to serve little purpose. What was done was done and would not be changed. Driving away they glittered out at her from there in the darkness, those small bits of glass an omen to remind her that drinking and driving are a bad mix."

        "content": "Once when I was a teenager, my father and I were standing in line to buy tickets for the circus. Finally, there was only one family between us and the ticket counter. This family made a big impression on me. There were eight children, all probably under the age of 12. You could tell they didn't have a lot of money. Their clothes were not expensive, but they were clean. The children were well-behaved, all of them standing in line, two-by- two behind their parents, holding hands. They were excitedly jabbering about the clowns, elephants and other acts they would see that night. One could sense they had never been to the circus before. It promised to be a highlight of their young lives.\n\nThe father and mother were at the head of the pack standing proud as could be. The mother was holding her husband's hand, looking up at him as if to say, \"You're my knight in shining armor.\" He was smiling and basking in pride, looking at her as if to reply, \"You got that right.\"\n\nThe ticket lady asked the father how many tickets he wanted. He proudly responded, \"Please let me buy eight children's tickets and two adult tickets so I can take my family to the circus.\"\n\nThe ticket lady quoted the price.\n\nThe man's wife let go of his hand, her head dropped, the man's lip began to quiver. The father leaned a little closer and asked, \"How much did you say?\"\n\nThe ticket lady again quoted the price. The man didn't have enough money.\n\nHow was he supposed to turn and tell his eight kids that he didn't have enough money to take them to the circus?\n\nSeeing what was going on, my dad put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a $20 bill and dropped it on the ground. (We were not wealthy in any sense of the word!) My father reached down, picked up the bill, tapped the man on the shoulder and said, \"Excuse me, sir, this fell out of your pocket.\"\n\nThe man knew what was going on. He wasn't begging for a handout but certainly appreciated the help in a desperate, heartbreaking, embarrassing situation. He looked straight into my dad's eyes, took my dad's hand in both of his, squeezed tightly onto the $20 bill, and with his lip quivering and a tear streaming down his cheek, he replied, \"Thank you, thank you, sir. This really means a lot to me and my family.\"\n\nMy father and I went back to our car and drove home. We didn't go to the circus that night, but we didn't go without."

I entered the house cautiously. The porch light lit up the living-room quite well. Nothing seemed amiss. No, wait! The television stand was bare. The burglars had carted away the television. I checked the bedrooms. All had been ransacked. Clothes were thrown higgledy-piggledy all over the floor. The cupboard doors were open. Drawers had been pulled out and their contents emptied. Pillows had been cut open and their cotton stuffing scattered about.\n\nI moved to the kitchen. The back door was open and Salim was just stepping inside. The kitchen had not been spared either. The contents of the cabinets were strewn all over the place. The floor was sticky with spilt flour, rice and what looked like oil. It was a terrible mess.\n\nThe burglars had done a thorough job. Grimly, I went to tell the owner the bad news."

Uncle Husni took us to one of the Turtle Islands, Pulau Gulisan.\n\nWe took about one and a half hours to go by boat to Pulau Gulisan. The Turtle Islands lie 40 kilometers north of Sandakan in the Sulu Sea. As we approached Pulau Gulisan, we noticed that the water was crystal clear and we could see live coral on the sea-bed.\n\nPulau Gulisan is the cleanest island I have been to in Malaysia. The white beach, with sand like fine powder, looked very inviting. The main attraction of Pulau Gulisan are the hawksbill turtles. They come here to lay eggs throughout the year.\n\nAs the Park was created to protect the natural environment of the turtles, the coral reefs and other marine life, visitors have to obey strict rules. A Park Ranger is there to enforce these rules. Collecting of plants and living or non-living items is strictly forbidden. Building campfires, singing, dancing or playing music are also forbidden. Night photography is not allowed too, unless there is special permission from the Park Ranger.\n\nThe Park Ranger informs the visitors when there are turtles laying eggs. Visitors must watch them from a distance. We were lucky to be able to watch the turtles that night, although we had to watch from afar.\n\nI shall never forget this visit as I learnt something very important here -- how to respect and care for the environment."

The walls are covered with attractive pictures and the children's drawings. There are toys and games stacked in the corners.\nAs the children troop in, the teachers and volunteers greet them cheerfully. Each child has his own instructor. Down's Syndrome children have flat features and are smaller in size than other children. Although they move rather awkwardly, they are lively and responsive.\n\nThe Center has a library for the children to play computer games or watch videos in. It has lots of books and teaching materials for parents to borrow.\n\nThe Center is run by a private organization on donations from its members.

You will notice this the moment you approach the main entrance. The marble floors, pillars and walls keep the temperature inside cool. A courtyard fountain turns the building into a welcoming oasis.\n\nThere are four levels and each one has open galleries serving special functions. For example, one gallery exhibits replicas and models of Islamic monuments, mosques and other structures. Another gallery shows Chinese Islamic artifacts. Besides the galleries there are a workshop, library, an auditorium, restaurants and others. You must not miss the Ottoman Room that features the interior of an Ottoman house of the 18th century. It has authentic carvings, lacquered panels and chandeliers from that period.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, a visit to the museum will convince you that it is truly a place that educates people on Islamic Arts and preserves and restores it for present and future generations."

We arrived in this quaint city in Eastern Europe on May 1, 2004, the day Slovakia, together with 10 other European countries joined the European Union.\nYoung-at-heart Aunt Pauline noticed that Bratislava is a youthful city. This is because there are many universities here and about 60,000 of the population are students. On the other hand, because of its long history, it has many old castles, churches and streets. It also used to be a coronation town, and the site for the Hungarian king's crowning in the old days. Throughout its existence, it has been a cosmopolitan city, home to Slovaks, Germans, Hungarians, Russians, Jews and others.\n\nIt was a public holiday and both tourists and the local people were out to enjoy the day. Many were dressed in their regional costumes. The streets were festooned with flowers and colorful flags. Music filled the air as small citizen bands were playing at street corners.\n\nThe city has a strong music tradition because Mozart, Beethoven and Liszt often performed there. Caught up in the joyful and festive mood, Aunt Pauline joined in the reveling. She merrily took part in the singing and dancing. However, I was a bit too shy to join in. Later, we sat down at a roadside cafe where we quenched our thirst and sampled Slovakian food.\n\nAfter resting for a while, we followed the scenic walking route clearly marked out for tourists. It was an interesting stretch that led to an ancient castle atop a small hill overlooking part of the picturesque Danube. Together with a couple we had befriended on the train to Bratislava, we sat on the slope to rest and to enjoy the scene while snacking on the drinks and tidbits we had brought with us.\n\nAfter the short rest, we took a winding path back to the romantic cobbled-streets of the old city, stopping along the way to marvel at the beauty of the city's cathedral and the old houses built several centuries ago.\n\nAunt Pauline had made it possible for me to go to East Europe.

It occupies an area ten times the size of my house. A row of pretty angsana trees was chopped down to accommodate the new building. The small road that I used to take as a short cut to school has disappeared.\n\nEvery day lorries and bulldozers go to and fro carrying building materials.

Dust travels from the site and settles on our vehicles, floor and furniture and even our food, if left uncovered. The noise of the pounding, drilling and churning is deafening. We have to put up with this noise from dawn to dusk. Work goes on six days a week. It is only on Sundays that the site is quiet.\n\nThis construction will take months to complete.

The fire department and the police were summoned immediately. It took them four hours to capture the python and take it away.\nAccording to the neighbors, the house has been neglected for as long as they can remember. It is not certain who the owners are. It is a double-storey mansion that is at least a hundred years old. The basic structure still looks strong and solid but the walls are covered with mould and fungus. In some parts, the wall is not even visible as it is overgrown with creepers. One can see broken pipes on the outside walls of the building. The tiles of the roof are broken in many places. One can see small plants growing in the crevices of the building.\n\nThe grounds are overgrown with weeds and tall grass. There are even some bushes which have hidden the windows from view. Even the electrical wires are covered with creepers. There is no doubt that the grounds are crawling with rats, roaches and other pests.\n\nThe fence that surrounds the house is in ruins. The wooden posts of the fence have rotted away and there are large holes in the fence through which one can see broken pots and wires, a fish-pond covered with rotting leaves and garbage. There are rumors that strange-looking characters have been seen entering the house through the broken fence at night. Who knows who these people are?\n\nIt is no wonder that the neighbors are nervous and full of fear. Some believe that the house is haunted, but I do not think it is. Perhaps it is used as a hideout by drug addicts or a gang of criminals. Still others feel that it should be pulled down as it is a threat to the health of those living around because it is infested with insects and pests.\n\nIt is not certain why this old house has been abandoned while other buildings of historical value have been restored. It may be too late to restore this old mansion now. Although it is a shame to tear down the building which has been there for over a hundred years, this might be the fate of the abandoned house at No.9 Brick Road."

He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.\nHe was born in 1918 to an aristocratic family. His father was Chief of the Tembu tribe. In his childhood, he listened to tribal stories depicting wars for freedom fought by his ancestors. These tales must have imbued him with strong feelings for freedom.\n\nNelson Mandela went to the University of Fort Hare and Witwatersrand. After earning a law degree in 1942, he joined the ANC (African National Congress) in 1944. From 1948, he was actively engaged in resistance movements against the South African government's apartheid policy that discriminated sharply against non-whites, especially blacks. During this period, Mandela advocated violence to attain their anti-apartheid aims. He fought for the setting up of a military wing within the ANC. Not all supported his idea, but members who did were allowed to join his campaign. In 1960 the ANC was officially banned.\n\nIn 1963 Mandela was tried for plotting the violent overthrow of the government. His statement from the dock was broadcast and received international publicity. The impression he gave was that of a fierce revolutionary, a firebrand. In 1964 he and eight others were sentenced to life imprisonment. For 18 years, Mandela lived in a small cell on Robben Island, sleeping on the floor, using a bucket as his toilet and receiving only one visitor a year. He was then moved to Pollsmoor Prison until he was released. In Pollsmoor Prison, he held his newborn grandchild whom a friend secretly brought to him.\n\nWhile in prison, Nelson Mandela learned and practised self-discipline. He carried himself with dignity and charmed many who met him. He was still defiant but no longer advocated violence for his cause. In fact, during his imprisonment, he held secret talks with the government to free South Africa from the apartheid system. His reputation grew, and his movement gathered strength, winning wide international support.\n\nAfter his release in 1990, he continued working hard towards his goals. Finally, in 1994 he was elected President of South Africa.\n\nNelson Mandela is admired for his relentless struggle to free black South Africans from a cruel system that practised racism and forced them to live in poverty. He was not weakened by his 27 years in prison but retained his dignity and became a finer and wiser politician."

He was bright but did not do well in school. He had always been hyperactive which is not part of the normal process of growing up in a child.\nAs he grew older and entered primary school, Gobi did not change. Unlike other students, Gobi would lose interest in any classroom activity after a short time and look for something else to do.\n\nHis teachers complained about his behaviour to his parents who tried their best to help. However, Gobi did not respond well and had difficulty being promoted to secondary school.\n\nGobi had great difficulty getting started or getting interested in any work. It made matters worse when the teacher or his parents got angry with him for not trying hard enough. He focused on many things at once and did not know which one to concentrate on.\n\nHe was distracted by any little sound or movement. At home, sounds like the telephone ringing, the doorbell chiming or even a toilet being flushed disturbed him. He constantly felt a weight pressing down on him.\n\nThe counsellor advised Gobi's teachers and family to help him cope with this problem. `He should not be pushed too hard but neither should his problem be ignored,' said the counsellor."

If you ask me to name an outstanding characteristic of his, I will have to say it is his posture. He stands straight and tall for a person his age. `Posture is very important' is one of his favourite sayings.\nGrandpa's routine is to wake up before daybreak before anybody else. Then he has a cold shower and does yoga for half an hour. After that, he takes a walk in the garden. He bends down occasionally to pick the weeds. Then he spends the rest of the day indoors, reading his religious books. He eats all kinds of food but in small portions.\n\n'Moderation', he says, `is the key to good health.' He seldom watches television but listens to the radio. He goes to bed at nine o'clock sharp.\n\nGrandpa is a rather handsome man. He is almost six feet tall. His hair has grown completely white. He looks stem when he is not smiling. He has a deep voice that sometimes sounds like a bark. Some of my friends are afraid of him but I always tell them, 'Grandpa's bark is worse than his bite'.\n\nBut things were not always like this. Grandpa came to live with us shortly after grandma passed away. We all felt her loss. But my grandfather was devastated. He locked himself in his room for nearly two months and would not speak to anyone. He lost almost ten kilos. He remained fairly healthy but we were worried he would have a breakdown. We tried our best to make him feel better. My father bought him a computer and a CD player but he showed little interest in them. This continued for nearly a year.\n\nOne day, I heard the sound of whistling from the garden. It was Grandpa! He smiled at me, his favourite grandson, and said, 'Vikram, your grandmother came to me in a dream last night and scolded me severely for not doing my yoga anymore. She told me to stop feeling sorry for myself and look after the garden again. Just like her, still bossing me around!'\n\nWe were all very happy. Just as I left to board the school bus, I heard a familiar voice, saying, 'Stand straight, Vikram. Don't hunch!' I grinned. It was good to have Grandpa back to his usual self."

She has performed in Thailand twice and I went to both her concerts. At both concerts the audience clapped wildly and danced in the aisles. Would you believe that most of what she played was classical music?\nHer full name is Vanessa-Mae Vanakorn Nicholson. She was born in Singapore on October 27 1978, sharing the same birthday as Paganini, the Italian pianist who was born 196 years earlier. Vanessa-Mae's Chinese mother and Thai father divorced when she was only four. Mother and child then moved to London. Nicholson is the name of Vanessa-Mae's stepfather, a British lawyer her mother later married.\n\nBeing a pianist herself, Vanessa-Mae's mother influenced her greatly. In fact the daughter started piano lessons at the age of three. She then took violin lessons and progressed rapidly. At the age of eight VanessaMae was the youngest student of Professor Lin Yao Ji at the Central Conservatoire in Beijing. Following this, she went to study at the Royal College of Music in London.\n\nThe child prodigy was only ten years of age when she made her debut in London, playing a Tchaikovsky concerto. Two years later she was making international concert tours. Her mother was her manager. In 1996 she was the first instrumentalist and classical musician to be nominated for Best Female Artist in the British Awards.\n\nAt the same time she released best-selling albums. Her debut album is Violin, recorded in 1990. She is the youngest artist to record the Tchaikovsky and Beethoven concertos. In 1992 she played on an electric violin for the first time. Her first pop album is The Violin Player. The others are Red Hot and Storm. A recent classical album is China Girl.\n\nSome music lovers criticise Vanessa-Mae for betraying classical music by turning it into pop. However, most critics think she is highly talented and mature beyond her years. As for me, being her fan has made me appreciate classical music."

I felt uncomfortable in his presence. In fact he frightened me. I hope he will not try to talk to me again.\n\nFirst of all he looks like some kind of insect. He has a huge head and small body. His neck does not support his head well, so his head is constantly wobbling. I am sure he does not enjoy good health. Moreover, his color is too pale, as if he does not get enough sun. But what frightens me most about him is his eyes. They are pale grey and they peer from his round spectacles in a nervous manner, as if he is about to do some crazy things.\n\nI nearly jumped out of my skin when he called my name. His voice was high-pitched and loud. He was holding a box and had earphones over his head. I had been cutting roses and he asked me to cut another one. He was behaving nervously. After I had cut another rose he acted as if I had cut his throat. Then he said something that really alarmed me. He said I was murdering the roses and each rose I killed screamed in the most dreadful way. Then he babbled on about plants being alive and having feelings. I excused myself and ran quickly into the house.\n\nWhen I complained to my husband about the neighbor, he said, 'Don't mind him. He's just a mad genius! Maybe I could write a book about him.' My husband wants to talk to our neighbor, maybe invite him over or even visit him. But I certainly do not wish to have anything to do with him."

This ensures a constant supply of power to the engine.\n\nThe body of the car is built with a special insulating material. No air conditioning is required. Above the dashboard is a special monitoring device that sets the inside temperature at a comfortable level.

Describe some of the exhibits you saw.\n\n \nLast year, the Japanese Embassy in Kuala Lumpur held an exhibition of products made from paper. The exhibition was on for three days. The exhibits were brought all the way from the famous Paper Museum in Tokyo.\nThe most outstanding exhibit was a full-length lady's kimono. It was made entirely of rice paper or washi. It was a formal kimono consisting of three layers. It was about a hundred years old and had been worn many times. The material looked like very fine cloth. There were beautifully painted chrysanthemums and Japanese cranes on it. I could not believe it was made of paper and that it could be worn!\n\nOn a shelf, below the kimono, was a pair of Japanese sandals called zori. These too were made entirely of paper. The paper even had an elastic quality for the sandals to fit comfortably on the feet. I knew this because we were allowed to touch the sandals. The sandals looked well-worn, too.\n\nIn another section of the hall were items of furniture made from cardboard and paper. Stiff cardboard from cartons had been used to make chairs, tables and shelves. Many layers of cardboard were pasted one on top of the other. Strong glue was used to stick the layers together. I am sure it required a lot of patience and time to make these items of furniture. The surfaces were so smooth that it was difficult to think that they were multi-layered and that the material was just cardboard and paper. The topmost layer consisted of decorative rice paper. This was also varnished and lacquered to give a glossy look.\n\nThe most interesting aspect of the exhibition was a live demonstration of this traditional craft. An elderly Japanese man actually demonstrated how jewelry cases, trays and miniature chests of drawers are made. I admired his patience and skill. A large crowd gathered around him to watch him at work. Some of the items he made were sold to visitors.\n\nI found the exhibition very interesting. The paper furniture looked a bit gaudy to me but I was impressed with their strength and durability. I learned that paper is used extensively by the Japanese. I also learned some ways to recycle paper and cardboard. It is interesting to know that the Japanese knew how to recycle paper many, many years ago."

So what do the experts think of the earth's future ?\nDr Paul Jones, an environmental expert, thinks that the earth's future is bleak as long as developed nations do not do enough to stop pollution. This is because the pollution caused by these nations affects the whole world.\n\nDr John Kim, a Department of Environment official, also holds a pessimistic view of the earth's future. He thinks there is little hope for the planet. There is an increase of carbon dioxide and methane in the earth's atmosphere. As a result of this and the thinning of the ozone layer, temperatures will rise. In fifty years' time, the polar ice caps will melt, raising the sea level and causing islands and coastal areas to disappear.\n\nA world-famous economist, Dr Faridah Sulaiman, agrees that pollution is a serious threat to human life. For example, polluted water is killing marine life which affects the food chain. Destruction of forests also causes climatic changes which in turn affect the production of food.\n\nNations must co-operate to stop pollution. Otherwise, the earth is doomed."

There is a small group of us who try to outdo each other in the `tricks' - the more dangerous, the better.\nI started skateboarding at a very young age. My father bought me a skateboard when I was nine, and I took a great liking to it. At first I `walked' more than skated on it. Then I gathered courage and actually skated. There was a skating rink in my housing estate for those who rollerblade and the smooth paths helped me become more confident. Then my mother drove me to a public rink and I saw young boys performing braver stunts. I was hooked. Soon I was jumping over obstacles and riding down ramps. My mother did not like it. She thought it was dangerous but she bought me safety gear anyway - a safety helmet, knee pads, elbow pads and good shoes.\n\nI started watching extreme sports shows on television. I also bought video tapes and magazines, and finally joined a small group of skateboarders. We called ourselves `The Flyers'. We picked up new tricks like half back flips and pole jams. Some of us even tried dance steps on skateboards.\n\nI like skateboarding because I find it exciting. A little danger adds to the thrill. Skateboarding is also a good form of exercise. I sweat a lot. I get a good workout and at the same time, have a good time. I also enjoy the attention I garner. Small crowds of admiring teenagers regularly come to watch us do our tricks.\n\nMy parents are not too keen on my hobby. They would rather I do something safer like jogging or cycling. When I talk about taking part in extreme sports festivals, they protest strongly. They do not like what they see on television. I do not blame them. I have fallen many times and once sprained my ankle. Recently, I even broke my arm. Yet, I still enjoy the skateboard! I am a little crazy, I guess."

It tones the muscles, strengthens the bones, and makes the heart and lungs work better. Exercise also helps to relieve stress. The most beneficial type of exercise is aerobics. Aerobic exercises, in the form of jogging, cycling and lap swimming, strengthens the heart. It is important to choose a form of exercise you enjoy. It could be dancing or just walking. As long as you do it regularly, you will be fit. People who are fit enjoy life more because they can join in any kind of activity.\n\nTo maintain a healthy life, it is necessary to develop good dietary habits. Eat more whole-wheat grains, fruits, vegetables and fish. Decrease intake of animal protein and fats. Use less salt and take at least 1000 mg of calcium a day. Non-fat milk is a good source of calcium. Do not forget to drink at least seven glasses of water a day. Avoid eating junk food or processed food which is high in sugar or salt content and has little nutritional value.\n\nDeveloping good health habits is important if you want to keep healthy. Don't smoke, avoid excessive alcohol intake, and keep moderate hours. Go to bed early and wake up early. Work hard and play hard too. Avoid stress by exercising and developing hobbies. Have a positive attitude towards people and work. Half-yearly dental check-ups are also necessary to maintain dental health.\n\nBeing overweight can lead to a lot of health problems. You can suffer from heart disease, high blood pressure, varicose veins and gall bladder disease. Weight control requires conscious effort and self-control. Diet and exercise play the most important role in weight control. Make sure exercise is part of your daily program. Watch the amount and type of food you eat. Complex carbohydrates are important in a healthy diet.\n\nHealth is pleasurable; ill health is miserable. There are other threats to health but if you remember the points mentioned above, you should enjoy good health."

I have been involved in several of them.\nThe most popular way of raising funds among young people is to organize sports events such as jogathons, walkathons or cyclethons. Sponsors pay students who take part in the events. For example, a sponsor may pay a student five dollars to run five kilometers. This is a good way of raising money because one does a good deed the healthy way.\n\nAnother way, which is popular with adults, is the fund-raising social event. Donors pay a lot of money to attend film premieres, dinners and dances. Such functions often attract the rich and famous. They get publicity and do good at the same time. These events usually succeed in raising a lot of money for some charities.\n\nAn easy way to collect money is to send letters of appeal through the mail. Large, well-known organizations, such as the US Association for the Blind, Monfort Boys' Home and the Kidney Foundation get their funds this way. However, only the popular charities succeed because their activities are well-known. Many people just throw away these letters.\n\nAnother form of appeal is through the media. Many desperate people have appealed directly to the newspapers. The US citizens are very generous and have responded positively to many appeals. The public is especially generous to young children. Sometimes people do not donate because they are not sure where the money will go. The government is trying to improve such methods of collection.\n\nBodies like the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides raise funds by doing work for a small sum of money. Many adults approve of this method because they feel the volunteers appreciate the donations given for work done.\n\nI try to support honest fund-raising campaigns. I think it is the duty of those who are more fortunate to help others in need. I always help whenever my school organizes fund-raising events."

Thousands of athletes from all over the world take part. Several million attend the Games and many more watch them on television.\n\nAnother thing that makes the Games impressive are the ceremonies. The opening ceremony begins with the march past of athletes, followed by all kinds of performances and finally the lighting of the Olympic torch. Thousands of people are involved and millions spent to make each Game more special than the last. The preparation for the opening and closing ceremonies alone may take years. While the opening ceremony is known for its grandeur, the closing ceremony is remembered for its touching moments.\n\nThe Olympic Games is also important for its record of various human achievements.\n\nFirstly, the Games is the best example of human efforts to achieve peace and co-operation through sports. The first Olympic Games was held in Greece to stop the different states from fighting. The, Games was started with the aim of promoting world peace and unity through sports. It is indeed a noble idea and up till today, sportsmen all over the world continue to aim for the same ideal.\n\nSecondly, some of the finest performances in sports have been recorded during the Olympics. No one will forget the perfect scores of the young gymnast, Nadia Comaneci, the seven gold medals of Mark Spitz in swimming or the four gold medals of Carl Lewis in track and field events.\n\nThirdly, the Olympics provides some of the finest examples of human courage ever demonstrated. Wilma Rudolph won three gold medals in spite of years of suffering from childhood polio. Abebe Bikila, who had trained in Ethiopia without a coach, won the marathon, running barefooted.\n\nIn my opinion, nothing can take the place of the Olympic Games as the most important sports event in the world. I hope it lives forever."

Outside the United States, 'football' is used to refer to the game that the Americans call 'soccer'.\nIt is believed that the game originally began in Greece and was adopted by the Romans. The object of the game was to kick a ball beyond a line drawn behind an opposing team. But according to British tradition, the game began in Britain in the eleventh century. The game was very rough and violent and caused a lot of damage to property. Later the game was played in an open area marked off to form a sort of playing field. By the middle of the twelfth century, it was already called 'futballe'. By the seventeenth century, it was played in almost every town in England. It became an organized game in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe football craze in Britain knew no bounds. Today, football is played in most boys' schools and there are amateur clubs all over the country. It is a professional game in England and Wales. The game is watched by millions on Saturday afternoons. The football final at Wembley Stadium is watched by thousands at the stadium and millions more in Britain and the rest of the world.\n\nThe game gained popularity throughout the Commonwealth nations which were once ruled by the British, followed by the rest of the world. It is today the most popular game in the world. In Malaysia it has also become a professional sport. We have our own semi-pro league. Amongst sports events, football matches draw the world's largest crowds and football players are among the highest paid of all athletes.\n\nOne of the most famous footballers in the world is Pele from Brazil and one of the most popular teams today is Manchester United.\n\nWhy is the game so popular? One reason could be its simplicity. Football rules can be learned in one minute. A football game requires little more than a ball. It can be played on a field of any size. The play is swift and continuous making the game an exciting one both to play and to watch. The sport allows for both individual talent as well as team work.\nI like football because it is such an exciting game. I love the action, and I find the atmosphere in a crowded stadium very thrilling."

I should have known you would only write if you ha some favor to ask but I'm still glad I heard from you.\n\nI'll get right to the point. What is twinning ? Twining is the term used to describe the link-up of a local college with a foreign university or college. Students of the affiliated college are considered students of the participating university because they follow the same syllabus and sit for the same examinations. Twinning students who successfully complete the first or second year courses at the local college are guaranteed transfer to the second or third year at the foreign university.\n\nDoing a twinning program has many advantages. It is at least 25% cheaper than going abroad for the entire course. Besides, our parents prefer to keep us at home longer. Many people also prefer a foreign degree because for some reason many big companies prefer to hire those with foreign degrees.\n\nHowever, be careful when choosing a twinning program. Some of my friends had problems when they tried to transfer their credits. They were told their work was not up to standard. Some parent universities do not send out their best lecturers. The fees in some colleges are so high that doing the twinning program is almost as expensive as doing the entire course abroad. Accommodation can be very expensive so think about the location of your college.\n\nWhat should you do? Find out more information before making a decision. Write to the Public Services Department for a list of universities recognized by the government. Ask around. I can help you with this. Make sure you know the fees for the entire course. Check out the college first before signing up.\n\nSince you can afford it, I'd advise you to go straight to a prestigious university overseas. I'm working hard and doing well. You're welcome to come and take a look at my college anytime you want. I'll be glad to show you around. Give my regards to all our friends. Say hello to your sister and your parents.\n\nAffectionately,\n\nBale"

He becomes conscious of the entrance of the goddess into this secret recess; and with profound veneration attends the vehicle, which is drawn by yoked cows.\n\nAt this season all is joy; and every place which the goddess deigns to visit is a scene of festivity. No wars are undertaken; arms are untouched; and every hostile weapon is shut up.\n\nAt this time, only peace abroad and at home are known. At length the same priest conducts the goddess, now weary of mortal intercourse, back to her temple. The chariot, with its curtain, and, if we may believe it, the goddess herself, then undergo ablution in a secret lake.\n\nThis ritual is performed by slaves, whom the same lake instantly swallows up. Hence arises a mysterious horror and a pious ignorance of these events, which are beheld only by those who are about to perish."

The crushed glass is called cullet.\n\nIn the next stage, the crushed glass is melted down. Sand, soda ash and limestone are added to the melted glass.\n\nThen the melted glass mixture is heated to about 2800°F to form molten or liquid glass. The molten glass is now ready to be poured into moulds of different shapes and sizes. The final products are new glass containers.\n\nWhy recycle? Recycling saves a lot of energy and natural resources like sand, limestone and soda ash. Recycling is good for the environment as there is less quarrying. It reduces the cost of water disposal. And best of all, recycling means less litter on the earth."

        "content": "Explain the steps you take to plant the hydroponics way.\n \n\nHydroponics refers to the science of growing plants in a soilless medium. It is one of the newest crazes in gardening.\n\nThe first step was to look for a suitable container. A simple device I chose was a large, ordinary jar. It acted as an attractive flower pot. I decided to grow a tomato plant.\n\nNext, I fitted the top of the jar with a wooden cover. This cover was painted with bitumen paint to make it resistant to light. I then bored two holes into the cover, one round and one shaped like a keyhole. I pushed a glass tube through the round hole but kept the other hole open to support the plant. I pushed the baby tomato plant through the keyhole and packed the space around it with glass wool. The tube allowed air to circulate in the jar. I then wrapped brown paper around the outside of the jar. The roots were thus protected from light.\n\nThe next stage was to add the plant food or nutrient. A nutrient in powder form came with the set. It contained minerals and elements in the right proportions for plant growth. I used a half-level teaspoon of powder per litre for water. I only had to feed my plant once a week.\n\nSince then, I have grown many other vegetables, using a large planter. I have grown spinach, Chinese kale and mustard leaves the hydroponics way. My spinach looked rather poorly and my okra did not develop at all! I have learned that not all vegetables can be grown the hydroponics way.\n\nI think vegetables grown this way are better for health because they do not contain dangerous pesticides. My family also enjoyed producing some of our own food."

You have been given the honor of giving a speech during the assembly.\n \n\nA very good morning to Mrs Woo, teachers, boys and girls. It gives me great pleasure to talk to you this morning. The topic of my speech today is 'Be careful'.\n\nWhat should you be careful about?\n\nLet me refer to the recent newspaper article about the school girl who went missing and was feared to be kidnapped. It was later discovered that the sixteen year old girl had run away to be with a boy she had 'met' through an Internet chat room. She is just one of the many cases we read about these days. What are some of the reasons young people run away?\n\n \n\nWhen I talked to some troubled teenagers, some common reasons given were:\n(a) My parents do not understand me. They expect too much from me.\n\n(b) Teachers demand too much. They are killing us with excessive homework and tests.\n(c) Life is a bore. School is boring, parents are boring. I need more excitement in my life. I think I have more fun at cyber cafes.\n\nBoys and girls, last week I had a shock when one of my students told me that she planned to go to Penang to meet a youth she had `met' through a chat room. Her parents are under the impression that she is going for a holiday to visit her grandparents. I advised her against this and told her of the worst things that could happen - kidnapping, rape, murder etc. I hope I dissuaded her from going.\n\nPlease be wiser. Do not trust people you meet through the Internet. Be honest with your parents. Tell them the truth. Listen to their advice. As the old saying goes 'Older people have tasted more salt'. They have more experience and some of their tips are really useful.\n\nDear boys and girls, when I first wanted to go on a date, I remember my father telling me that there is a time for every purpose. My main priority when I was young was to study.\n\nI realized there would be time to have boyfriends/girlfriends later on when I was financially more stable. That is why you should all pursue active, healthy activities. Go swimming, boating, hiking, cycling and explore the good fun sites on the Internet. It is great to be young!"

I am here to give you some advice on how to stay healthy during the haze. I shall begin by telling you briefly what haze is.\n\nA hazy condition occurs when a concentration of particulates such as smoke, gaseous pollutants and dust get trapped in air which is not moving. The current haze is made worse by forest fires in Indonesia.\n\nWhat should you do? First, pay attention to the air pollutant indices (API). If it reaches dangerous levels, stay indoors. This is especially important if you are suffering from respiratory illnesses or if you have allergies. Wear a mask if you have to go outdoors. Next change your clothes often and bathe at least once a day.\n\nTo strengthen your immune system, eat plenty of vegetables. For protein, it is better to eat fish than meat. Meat has more toxins which might be more difficult for the body to discharge. Eat balanced meals with plenty of complex carbohydrates. Drink at least eight glasses of water a day. Avoid spicy food.\n\nWe can help to get rid of the haze. Report all cases of open burning. Avoid using motor vehicles. Before I end, let me wish you all the best of luck."

My talk today is on waste and waste disposal. Every society has to deal with waste. Usually waste is collected and transported to a remote place to be disposed of by either dumping or burning.\n\nThe kind of waste we are most familiar with is domestic waste. There are three other sources of waste-mining, industry and agriculture.\n\nWhere does all this waste go? About half goes to open dumps. Nine per cent is burned in incinerators. Countries facing a shortage of land bury the waste in the ground. This is called the landfill method. Sadly, about twenty five per cent of waste is left uncollected. This is common in poorer countries. About one per cent of waste goes to the sea. This may seem very little but it is enough to cause a lot of damage to marine life.\n\nMany countries face a problem with waste disposal because of population growth. Recycling is one solution to this problem.\n\nThis is where you all come in. We hope you will participate in our recycling campaign. Start by separating your garbage. There are three bins outside the school-one each for bottles, papers and cans.\n\nThank you for your support."

Make a speech to the members of your club protesting against the latest development.\n \n\nGood evening, ladies and gentlemen. Last month, I received information that a new resort is going to be built at Cape Rally. We must take action to prevent this.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, Cape Rally is a turtle-laying sanctuary. Every year, turtles swim thousands of miles to our beaches to lay their eggs. However, in the last ten years, the number of turtle sightings has been greatly reduced. Why?\n\nOne reason is the pollution of the seas. This affects marine life. Fewer turtles survive to adulthood. Another reason is the dragnet method of fishing used by our fishermen which destroys turtle feeding grounds on the ocean floor. Some turtles, which are caught in the nets, are killed. Perhaps the major reason for the decline of turtles is the encroachment of the turtle sanctuary by humans. Development of the beaches destroys their nesting places.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, is there a need for another beach resort? The developer wants to draw tourists to see turtles. This is ridiculous because turtles hate loud noise, bright lights and human activity. The resort will drive them away.\n\nI urge all of you to join me in this campaign to stop the development of Cape Rally beach.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "Give a speech to your Computer Club on the advantages of the Internet\n \n\nGood afternoon, fellow members of the Computer Club. I am very happy to be here today to give a talk on the advantages of the Internet. The Internet is today linked to over 100 million computers around the world.\n\nI think by far the biggest advantage of the Internet is it helps me to find information on almost any topic I want to know about. It has helped me cut down my `research' time tremendously. Now all I have to do is access my favorite web sites and type in the relevant topics and I get more information that I can deal with!\n\nAnother advantage is the Internet enables me to run programs I do not own. Many programs are too expensive to own. I not only can run these programs but I can also copy them for later use.\n\nFriends, through the chat rooms, I can now talk to anyone around the world. I have now found friends around the world. I not only chat with them but I also write to them through electronic mail. I find e-mail to be an extremely useful tool. Now I can write nearly every day to people I want to. It saves me a lot of time going to the post office and buying paper, envelopes and stamps. The convenience is wonderful.\n\nGood friends, another aspect I have thoroughly enjoyed from the Internet is the ability to join groups that cater to my special interest. For example, I am interested in learning about the origins of famous nursery rhymes. It was not enough for me to get information. I joined an Internet Club for people with this unusual interest. Now I can subscribe to a special newsletter and I am kept up to date on the latest findings.\n\nI can see from your faces that I do not need to convince you about the wonders of the Internet. However, I think it is fair to give words of warning to those who lack experience. Please be careful of illegal information posted on the Internet. You can be arrested for spreading harmful rumors. Furthermore, do not entertain abusive users. Lastly, do not become addicted to the Internet. There is a real world out here and real people to have relationships with. Have a real life!\n\nThank you."

        "content": "As an Education Officer of the Worldwide Fund for Nature, you have been invited to give a talk on the protection of wetlands to secondary school students. Write the text of your talk.\n \n\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank the Principal, Mr Welan, for inviting me to give this talk. I also wish to thank all of you for being here to listen to my talk. The purpose of my talk is firstly, to tell you what wetlands are and secondly, to explain why they are important.\n\nWhat are wetlands? Wetlands are large bodies of water which can be broadly divided into two categories: coastal and inland wetlands. Coastal wetlands are marshes and mangrove swamps. Inland wetlands or non-tidal freshwater wetlands are those found along rivers and lakes. The good news is that we have many examples of both types of wetlands here in the United States.\n\nHowever, the bad news is that rapid development has already destroyed a lot of wetlands and many more areas are under threat. This is not good at all. Wetlands are very important for our economy and the environment. Let me explain why.\n\nFirstly, wetlands is nature's way of preventing floods. It is our first line of defense against flooding. They act like sponges as they soak up rain and store excess floodwater. When they are destroyed, the result is floods.\n\nSecondly, wetlands act as natural filters that purify our water. They clean our water by removing sediment and toxic substances. Furthermore, wetlands serve an important role as a cleansing mechanism that helps prevent pollution especially from farms and factories.\n\nAnother reason to protect wetlands is because they are the primary habitat of animals and fish. They are biologically productive lands. When wetlands are destroyed, the fishing industry is endangered.\n\nFinally, beaches, islands, lakes and rivers are popular recreational destinations. Popular activities such as fishing, boating, hiking, bird-watching and wildlife viewing will be affected by the destruction of wetlands. The tourism industry will be affected.\n\nIn conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that all of you are now convinced of the importance of our wetlands and of the need to do everything possible to protect them from destruction. If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "You are a population growth expert. You have been invited to give a talk to a Ladies Club on 'The Problems of an Increasing Population'. Write out your talk.\n \n\nGood afternoon, ladies, the topic for today - The Problems of an increasing population - should be of some interest to all of you. Malaysia at present has a population of 23 million. We are not overpopulated as yet but our population is increasing at a good rate. Our neighboring countries, though, like Indonesia, China and India face many problems because of over-population. How did this come about? Well, there are three main ways a country's population can increase: large scale immigration, a decrease in death rate and a rapid increase in birth rate.\n\nAn increasing population makes. it difficult for the government to raise the standard of living. There will be a greater demand for goods. Production must increase or goods must be imported. Imported goods means a rise in the prices of goods. When people have to pay more, they have less money to spend or to save. Therefore, the standard of living drops.\n\nAn increasing population also means an increase of social services and amenities. For example, there must be more schools, teachers and playgrounds. If there are not enough of these then the quality of\neducation will be affected. Classrooms will be crowded and teachers will be overloaded.\n\nIf food and medical supplies are insufficient for the growing population, the health of the population will suffer. The first to be affected will be children and old people. It may not be easy to provide sufficient health facilities like clinics and hospitals if the population is large.\n\nHousing is also a big problem as the population continues to grow especially in urban areas. Space is limited so rentals are high. Slums will develop in the cities. All kinds of problems associated with squatters would arise. Land may be cleared indiscriminately leading to environmental problems.\n\nLastly, there will be unemployment. Unemployment will lead to social problems like robberies and riots. These will cause political unrest.\n\nTherefore, ladies, it is clear that an increasing population growth, which is not controlled, will lead to overpopulation with all its disadvantages and problems. An overpopulated country faces political, social and economic problems. It is best to maintain controlled growth.\n\nThank you."

There are many types of neighbors one might have. We really cannot choose them.\nMy definition of a good neighbor is one who is helpful, friendly and yet unobtrusive. Although i say my neighbors keep to themselves, I must say that they do have the characteristics of good neighbors. They are always pleasant when we meet. Once, when we needed to send a relative to the hospital, my neighbor helped to call for the ambulance and even waited along the main road to guide it to our house.\n\nOn the other hand, my grandmother's neighbors are quite awful. They are very noisy. They have the radio on loudly at all times of the day and late into the night. They have loud quarrels very often and they like to borrow things-sugar, pails, hammers and even the telephone! They are also very nosy. Whenever my grandmother has visitors, they are sure to pop in to see who they are.\n\nMy father always jokes that just as we cannot choose our relatives, we also cannot choose our neighbors. We had lovely neighbors when we were young. Then they sold their house and moved out. The new neighbors did not have a television set so every evening the whole family came to our house to watch television. Very often they wanted to watch programs we were not interested in. At times we even had to stay up late because their show was not over yet.\n\nI learned from my parents that in order to have a good neighbor you have to be one yourself. My father was a good neighbor. Every year during the floods, he gave shelter to several families living on lower ground. He tried to help anyone in trouble. He also stopped my mother from gossiping about our neighbors\n\nNeighbors are very important because we seldom live near our families these days. We have to treat them like extended families because we have to look out for each other."

        "content": "A pet is an animal which is kept as a companion rather than for food, security or sport. In Malaysia, the most common pet is the cat. The cat is small, affectionate, and relatively easy to look after. Other common pets are dogs, birds and fish. Some not so common pets would be rabbits, hamsters, terrapins, mice and monkeys.\n\nMost people do not have clear reasons for having a pet. This is unfortunate because keeping a pet is a commitment. Some people are attracted to cute little kittens and puppies, but they forget that the little creatures soon grow into not-so-cute adult animals. Some people like to follow trends. For instance, the latest craze is to keep strange lizards. Many people who buy these expensive lizards soon get bored with them. Yet others have pets because their children want them. Of course, many people keep pets simply because they love animals.\n\nIf you love animals, keeping a pet has many benefits. Most animals are capable of giving us back love and attention. For example, the dog has been described as man's best friend because it is a faithful companion and is loyal to its master whom it will protect with its life. Animals are also known to be able to help sick children, mentally-disturbed patients and lonely old people. Pets can give us joy and keep us entertained with their antics. Some dogs, cats and even birds can be taught to perform clever tricks which are very amusing to watch. Looking after pets also teaches us responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, keeping pets has its disadvantages. Looking after a pet is not an easy job. Pets depend on us to feed them, clean them and play with them. Pets can get lost, get hurt or get ill, causing us much worry. Treatment for a sick animal can be expensive.\n\nPersonally, I like animals. I have two cats. They give me a lot of joy but they also cause me a lot of trouble. I dislike the job of cleaning their litter tray. But I would not give them up for anything."

First of all, I enjoy a change, any kind of change, every now and then. My family lives in the busy city. For a change of scenery and pace of life, we would travel up to the cool, green highlands or stay at the seaside at least once a year. When my mother and I went to England to attend my aunt's wedding, I thoroughly enjoyed the change in climate. It was snowing and I experienced what it was like to be numb with cold. It was fun!\n\nAnother reason I like to travel is because I am curious about how people in other parts of the world live. I would like to experience for myself the cultures of different peoples.\n\nThe third reason I like to travel is because I enjoy meeting people and making friends. I would like to have friends from as many different countries as possible. It would be interesting to exchange views on all kinds of issues with people from other lands. I know I could do this through the mail or the internet, but I think it is better to meet and talk to people face to face. Having foreign friends would also help me to learn other languages.\n\nOf course, there are disadvantages in traveling. I dislike packing and unpacking which is part and parcel of traveling. Unpleasant things could happen when you are traveling, like getting lost in a strange place where no one speaks your language, losing your passport and money, and missing your flight. Traveling abroad is also costly.\n\nIn spite of the risks, I intend to travel as often as I can. My dream is to visit every continent on the earth. If ever man can travel easily to another planet, I will definitely be one of the early space travelers. It would be such a fantastic change of scenery, I know."

Trudging around from shop to shop carrying heavy packages and shopping bags is not my idea of fun. Ever since I was a child, I have dreaded shopping. Unfortunately for me, my mother takes no notice of my protests. She always takes me along with her for her weekly shopping sprees because I am her only daughter.\n\nI dislike shopping because I find it a very boring activity. Unlike most girls, I am not the least interested in looking at clothes, shoes, or bags. My mother takes a long time to make up her mind about anything she wants to purchase so shopping means hours of walking and waiting. What can be more boring for a young person like me?\n\nIt is worse when there is a sale. Like everyone else, my mother would happily plunge into the crowd to hunt for good bargains at a sale. But I just want to find a quiet corner where I can escape from being shoved and elbowed. The noisy crowd plus the noisy music blaring from the public address system really gets on my nerves.\n\nThe only time I find pleasure on a shopping trip is if I get to browse at the bookshop. That is one place which is usually quiet and peaceful. I get to look through books and magazines without the obligation of buying any. Sometimes, I try to persuade my mother to let me wait for her in the bookshop while she does her shopping. I do not mind spending hours in a bookshop.\n\nNot only women like to shop. Some men love shopping too. Take my uncle and his son, for instance. The two of them accompany my aunt whenever she goes shopping and they even go shopping on their own. They do not mind carrying shopping bags and spending a whole afternoon hunting for a particular pair of shoes or cooking pot.\n\nIn the end, I guess that anyone can enjoy shopping if he or she has the freedom to choose where to go and what to look at. As for me, I would still prefer someone else to do the shopping for me while I laze in my comfortable bed with an interesting book to read."

I am even afraid to look at pictures of these savage-looking creatures.\nIt all began when I was ten years old. My older cousins asked me to go with them for a movie. I was so excited that I did not even ask what movie they were going to watch.\n\nI cannot recall what the movie was about but I will never forget the scene in which a shark devoured a man alive. The sinister background music and the victim's horrible screams made my blood run cold.\n\nFor months after that, I had nightmares in which I was eaten alive by a shark. I was afraid to go to the toilet on my own at night. One of my sisters or brothers had to accompany me. I refused to go to the seaside and even stopped going fishing with my father.\n\nAt first, my family members teased me and called me a coward. But when I continued to wake up screaming in the middle of the night, my parents grew very concerned.\n\nAlthough they tried to help me, I could not forget what I had seen. The nightmares disappeared eventually, but the fear remains with me to this day."

As we started to protest, he said angrily, `We hardly talk to one another these days. Everyone is glued to the TV! What is happening to our family?'\nWe did not dare argue with Father. He announced that watching TV was to be banned for a weekend. We could not believe our ears.\n\nSo on Friday night, we were not allowed to switch on the TV. Mother suggested that she and Father do something together after dinner - the dishes!\n\nThen we listened to music together and read interesting bits of news to one another. It was enjoyable. After this, my brother challenged Father to a game of chess. The rest of us watched.\n\nOn Saturday, it rained all day, so we stayed indoors. By the afternoon, we were quite bored. Fortunately, visitors arrived in the evening and we had something to take our minds off the TV.\n\nBy Sunday, we had already got used to the ban. My siblings and I even tidied up our rooms. We were very pleased to see how nice our rooms looked! Father and Mother did the gardening together. We were really having a good time!\n\nThe TV ban turned out to be quite a success. So Father decided to have a TV ban one weekend each month."

But to my surprise, one of the first things she wanted to do was to take a ride on a city bus! I thought this strange.\nI agreed to accompany her although taking a ride on a K.L. city bus was not what I would call a friendly experience for anyone, much less a tourist. But Yoriko was quite determined to take a bus and even suggested doing it by herself. My parents were horrified at the idea, of course.\n\nOne morning, we caught the bus which would take us to the Central Market. The bus was not crowded but there was only one seat left. I asked Yoriko to sit but she, polite as usual, insisted that I take the seat. While we were arguing, a young man got into the bus and plonked himself down on that vacant seat. I glared at the young man who did not seem to realize there was anything wrong. Yoriko saw the funny side of this and laughed.\n\nAt the next stop, a couple got down so we had seats. Yoriko looked out the window at the passing scene and asked me questions every now and then. The bus stopped for more passengers and was soon packed. It was a hot day. Although the bus was air-conditioned, it was humid because there were so many people. Since Yoriko did not complain, I kept my mouth shut.\n\nI had heard many stories about rude and impatient bus drivers. Happily for us, the bus driver that day was quite a gentleman. I was especially glad because I did not want my visitor to think poorly of my country.\n\nNear the Central Market, I rang the bell. The bus slowed to a stop. We had to squeeze through the crowd to get to the exit. But before we could get, off, the automatic doors closed and the bus started moving again. Another passenger who also wanted to get off banged the side of the bus to get the driver's attention. However, he was completely unaware. Anyway, the bus was now too far from the stop and could only let us down at the next stop. I groaned. Now we would have to walk to the Central Market in the hot sun.\n\nYoriko and I looked at each other and grinned. I asked her what she thought of the ride. She said that it was quite enjoyable and that she would like to take the bus home after shopping. It was true. The ride\nturned out better than I had expected."

Mother said that Grandma was beginning to forget things and it was not safe for her to be alone. Ever since my grandfather passed away two\nyears ago, Grandma seemed to have lost the desire to go on living.\nOn the first day she arrived, I was sad to see her looking so unlike herself. She used to be so full of life. Now she hardly spoke and was not interested in anything. Mother told my brother and me to try and make Grandma happy. There were times when she seemed like her old self. But she was like the weather - sometimes sunny, sometimes gloomy.\n\nOne afternoon, I returned from school to find a note that said that Grandma ha been admitted to the hospital. I was terribly worried for Grandma. What was wrong with her? Would she die?\n\nThat evening, Aunt Lina arrived from Kuantan. With her was a young Indonesian maid. Her name was Kak Yati. We went to the hospital together. I was relieved to see Grandma alive. However, she was now unable to walk and to use her right hand. She could not feed herself or even button her own blouse. She refused to even look at any of us. She was so depressed. Kak Yati took over. She refused to give up and continued talking cheerfully, telling Grandma her name, where she came from and all about herself. At first, Grandma ignored her but when Kak Yati went on and on, I saw her look at Kak Yati with surprise. She allowed Kak Yati to help feed her and dress her. Mother and Aunt Lina looked relieved.\n\nAfter three days, Grandma returned home. Taking care of Grandma was a round-the-clock affair. But Kak Yati was a gem. She never complained or grumbled even though Grandma gave her no rest. Very\noften Grandma would lose her temper and shout or feel sorry for herself and weep. Kak Yati ignored her outburst and cheerfully cared for her.\n\nAunt Lina decided to let Kak Yati stay with us and went back to Kuantan. What we would have done without her, I do not know. It was Kak Yati who coaxed Grandma to learn to walk. After four months, Grandma was able to walk for short distances without support. She continued to get better day by day. Best of all, she became her old cheerful self, laughing once again and telling stories of her younger\ndays.\n\nA year later, Kak Yati had to return to her own family in Indonesia. On the day she left Solo, there was not a dry eye in the house. We all went to see her off at the airport. Grandma came along. She was very sad to lose Kak Yati. Even though we may never see Kak Yati again, she will always be in our hearts."

He explained that team spirit meant the willingness to act for the good of the group rather than for one's personal benefit.\nKee An was a new player in the team. He was a talented player. The team had played two matches that year against fairly strong teams and had won both games with Kee An scoring the most goals. Each time he scored, people cheered loudly. It made him feel like a hero.\n\nThe third soccer match was the most important one. They were playing against the district champion team. The Warisan Team trained hard to prepare for the match. Kee An worked harder than anyone else.\n\nOn the day of the match, Kee An and his team-mates felt ready for any challenges. `Score as many goals for us as possible, Kee An!' his team-mates told him. Just before the match was to begin, Encik Muda reminded his players again of the importance of team spirit.\n\nThe Warisan team started off very well. Kee An scored the first goal after 10 minutes of play. A loud cheer burst from the spectators. Kee An's team-mates hugged him with joy. Play continued. The Warisan team tried to pass the ball to Kee An as often as possible in the hope that he would score. But their opponents were smarter now. The defence players stuck close to Kee An. Since it was harder for him to score now, he should pass the ball to one of his team-mates. But Kee An badly wanted to score another goal himself. He kept the ball and tried to rush to the goal but, each time, his opponents would snatch the ball from him. Once, he even snatched the ball from his own team-mate! Encik Muda was dismayed to see Kee An playing for himself instead of his team. By half-time, the champions had scored a goal too, and they were now equal.\n\nDuring the short break, Encik Muda pulled Kee An aside. What he said to the young player, no one knew. But at the end, Kee An brushed away tears from his eyes as Encik Muda put an arm around his shoulders and sent him to join the rest of the team.\n\nIn the second half, both teams were cautious. One thing was clear - Kee An was playing with team spirit now. Each time he got the ball and saw the opponents rushing towards him, he would pass the ball to\nanother team-mate at once. In fact, he played intelligently and was able to help his team-mate to score the second goal for the team. They were overjoyed. Kee An found to his surprise that he was just as happy even though he was not the one who kicked the ball into the goal.\n\nThe Warisan Team defeated the champions with a score of 2-1. Encik Muda was very proud of his team and especially of Kee An, who had learned the importance of team spirit."

It is an Afghan film, the first film made in that country since the fall of the Taliban.\nInspired by a true story, the film is set during the brutal regime of the Taliban. The main character is a twelve-year old girl who is disguised as a boy and named Osama. Under Taliban rule, women are severely oppressed. They are not allowed to appear in public unaccompanied by a male relative. Osama's mother is a widow whose husband died in the Afghan war against the Russians. Although she is a doctor, she, her mother and daughter live in abject poverty. In desperation, the widow and her mother decide to cut short the young girl's hair and disguise her as a boy, dressing her in her dead father's clothes. Osama has to go out and work to keep the family alive.\n\nFirst her mother takes her to a man who had been in the army with her father. She persuades him to give Osama work in his tiny shop. He himself is very poor. Although he tries to protect Osama, she is taken away one day by a Taliban officer who has been rounding up young boys to be trained in a religious military school. From this point of the drama, suspense is built up, as Osama is thrown into one dangerous situation after another. In the school, a beggar boy befriends her and tries his best to prevent others from seeing through her disguise. In spite of his efforts, many of the other boys become suspicious and begin to taunt her mercilessly. Things come to a head when she climbs a tree to prove that she is a boy. She is overcome with fear and cannot climb back down. For this act, she is punished cruelly by the teacher. Her body is strapped up and hung down a deep well. Terrified, Osama cries for her mother to come and rescue her. No one helps her. Moreover, physical evidence exposes her to be a girl.\n\nOsama is put in prison to await her sentence. She is pardoned by the judge but given in marriage to a very old teacher. He already has other wives whom he keeps as prisoners in his house. Ultimately, there is no escape for Osama. Her nightmare continues.\n\nThis film is superbly played out by amateur actors who portray the characters very realistically. I applaud them and the director for making this film a most memorable cinematic experience."

Like us, they were taking advantage of the long Deepavali break. Unlike us, they wanted to get home to their loved ones.\nThe train rattled into the station at midnight. The crowd elbowed and shoved to get on board. In the coach, we were greeted by a mixture of unpleasant smells and sights - diesel, sweat and whatever else,\nand people sleeping in the aisle. There were no seats left so we had to stand.\n\nThe train pulled out of the station 10 minutes later. Some young men, in torn jeans and baggy shirts, kept walking up and down the aisle. Each time they came by, we had to make way for them. Why won't they just stay put, I grumbled to myself. The trip was beginning to look more and more like a big mistake. I wanted to kick myself for suggesting it. It was then that I caught sight of the baby. In the midst of tired faces, it looked fresh as a daisy. The baby drooled and made funny faces at a sleepy man. From then on, I looked at things differently. If the baby could make the trip, why couldn't I?\n\nAfter five hours, we reached Gemas. Just as I hoped, half the passengers got off to go south. I got a seat at last. Soo Beng and I had supper. After the meal, I fell asleep.\n\nI felt as if I had slept for a long time. But when I awoke, we were still in Gemas. Soo Beng was nowhere to be seen. I looked around for him but my eyes rested on the baby instead.\n\nMore and more people got on board at the many stops along the way. Soon, the train began to look like a market on wheels as passengers carrying vegetables, chickens and ducks boarded the train. Just as we were nearing Kuala Lipis, a horrible odour made me cover my nose. `It's the smell of one-day-old scrap rubber,' said an elderly man seated beside me. I learnt that for the people there, the train was the only mode of transport. Schoolchildren had to leave their homes at dawn to catch a train to school and return home by train, too! I felt ashamed for grumbling.\n\nAfter almost 21 hours, we reached Wakaf Baru. The. baby was still on board when I got down. I waved and the baby gave me a sweet smile in return. Now each time I feel overwhelmed by my little difficulties, I think of that trip."

From the time he was born, Fran was kept out of sight of others by his parents. They did this because Fran was physically impaired. He was born without legs.\nFran's parents loved him even though he was not like their other children. However, they felt ashamed and guilty about his condition. The people of their village saw Fran as a punishment from their gods. They could be very cruel and unkind. To protect Fran from being hurt or abused, his parents kept him in the house all the time. One day, a visiting priest heard about Fran and went to see him. Fran was a year old then. He was a healthy child even though he had stumps in place of legs. The priest felt sorry for Fran and his parents. He offered to look after Fran. So Fran went to live with the priest. His parents\ncould visit him any time. They were happy to see that he was looked after.\n\nFour months later, a visitor from Jakarta came to visit the priest. She was a very special person who loved to help others. She met Fran and was very taken up by the child. She told the priest that she would like to take Fran to Jakarta with her. She believed that she could give him a new life and also the hope of walking like other children.\n\nThe priest talked to Fran's parents and they agreed to let Fran go with the lady to Jakarta. They would miss him. But the villagers were relieved that Fran was leaving their island.\n\nThe kind lady took Fran to the Jakarta Hospital. There, doctors fitted Fran with artificial legs. Fran learned to walk on his new legs. Within six months, he was moving about like any normal toddler of his age.\nHe was delighted and so was his kind benefactor.\n\nAfter six months, the kind lady took Fran back home. His parents could hardly believe their eyes when they saw their son. Word about Fran's return spread like wildfire. The villagers came to see him, curious to know about his new legs. They were filled with amazement to see Fran walking and running about happily.\n\nFran's parents were no longer ashamed of their son and no longer had to hide him. They were forever grateful to the lady whose act of kindness changed their son's life and theirs."

        "content": "Write about the most embarrassing moment of your life.\n\n \nI was a member of my school drama club. At the end of the year, we were going to present a play based on a famous book called Jane Eyre. I was to play the part of the main male character, Mr Rochester. Our play was going to be performed before parents, important guests and the whole school. So, we wanted to make sure that everything went smoothly.\nTwo days before the actual performance, we had a dress rehearsal. It went off very well. Hasnah, who was playing the part of the main female character, Jane, seemed anxious. Hasnah said, `Oh dear,\nthey say that if everything goes smoothly during the dress rehearsal, things will go wrong during the performance itself!' We hoped that was not true. The night before the performance, I felt a bit nervous. I kept going over my lines again and again, although I knew them perfectly. My family members were quite tired of hearing me practising.\n\nOn the day of the performance, all the performers had to be in school several hours earlier to put on our make-up and costumes. Some of us went over our lines again. Mrs Wong, the drama club adviser, encouraged us and told us to just do our best.\n\nThe parents, guests and school pupils arrived. Soon, it was time for the curtain to go up. This was it, I told myself. This was the moment I had spent months preparing for. Everything went well in the first half\nof the play. It was a rather solemn play with hardly anything comic to laugh at but the audience looked interested.\n\nThen came my most important scene in which the disguised Mr Rochester was supposed to throw off his cloak to reveal his identity to Jane. I had never had any trouble with this scene during rehearsals.\nBut now, as I was flinging off the cloak and saying, 'Jane, it's me!', the cloak wrapped itself around my face. As I tried to get the cloak off, I repeated, `It's me, Jane!' but my voice was muffled, of course.\n\nThe audience roared with laughter. To top it all, Jane started to giggle. I simply could not remove the cloak and when I took a step forward clumsily, I tripped and fell! The audience laughed harder than\never. At that point, the curtain came down, thankfully.\n\nMrs Wong rushed on to the stage to free me from the cloak. I was so embarrassed I could have cried. Mrs Wong comforted me and said the show must go on. She almost had to push me on to the stage for the next scene. The moment I appeared, the audience started to chuckle. Somehow, I managed to go through the remaining scenes.\n\nAlthough my parents and my fellow students comforted me and even commended me for making the play so entertaining, I still go red each time I think of the most embarrassing moment of my life."

He gets along well with the other employees and his boss calls him his `star' worker.\nWhen Ah Wen was one and a half years old, he was diagnosed with a mental disability. His parents, shocked and aggrieved, felt completely hopeless. The doctor had said that their son would never be normal. Cousin Ah Bee, who was only six years old at that time, was furious when she heard this. She looked at the cute little toddler smiling up at her and said, 'Ah Wen has many sisters and brothers. We will all take care of him and he will be like us!'\n\nIndeed, Ah Wen grew up in the warm care of an extended family, surrounded by adoring grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles and cousins. From the start, his cousins shared their toys with him, taught him their favourite games, and made him feel loved. He is always included in social events, school activities and family outings. Everyone is protective over him, but carefully avoid spoiling him and making him feel that he is the only special member of the family. Therefore, Ah Wen has not grown up with an attitude problem. No one can deny that he has a very pleasant personality.\n\nGrowing up has not always been smooth and easy. There were times when Ah Wen sank into a depression, threw uncontrollable tantrums or just withdrew into himself for hours. His family learned how to cope with these episodes which were regarded as natural stages of his development. They never gave up, although sometimes Ah Wen's problems seemed insurmountable. Ah Wen himself learned how to cope with the bullying that he sometimes experienced in school. He also had understanding teachers who treated him like a normal child.\n\nCousin Ah Wen has been an inspiration to us. Through him, we have discovered that `normal' takes many forms, sizes, colours and shapes. He has also taught us the importance of being a big, close-knit family. Together, we can overcome all odds."

One of them was a river cruise to see rainforest creatures like the proboscis monkeys.\nWe were a party of eight including the two guides who were also the oarsmen. The boat was a very simple paddleboat with a canvas cover for shelter from the sun and rain. We sat on rough benches on each side of the boat.\n\nOur cruise started at a small tributary of the Panjang River. After half an hour we rowed into the main river. There was jungle on both sides. It was thrilling to hear the sounds of the various animals. They\nsounded mysterious, especially when we could not see the creatures making those sounds. However, now and then we caught glimpses of colourful birds and scampering tree animals. Proboscis monkeys swung skilfully among the trees. There were also river otters in the water. The guides assured us that there were no crocodiles.\n\nAt tea time we stopped by a bank and ate some snacks. We had been cruising for two hours. It was time to turn back. An hour and a half later we entered the tributary leading us back to where we had started.\n\nIt was disconcerting to find that the water in the tributary had gone down to a much lower level than before. In fact there was not enough water for the boat to float. It was so shallow that the boat touched the\nrocks jutting up the river bottom. The oarsmen jumped into the river and pushed us along. The two other men in the party joined them. It was very slow work as the boat had to be manoeuvred over rocks and through twists and turns. Moreover, the poor men had to fight off leeches that attached themselves to their ankles. To add to our worries, it was getting dark very rapidly. The jungle sounds became threatening. Finally, after two hours we saw the lights of the jetty.\n\nWe were back safely. Surprisingly the boat had not been damaged. We had not been attacked by any wild animals and on looking back, I have to say it was an exciting cruise!"

My parents have adopted a three-year-old orphan girl!\n\nAs you already know, my mother helps out at the Rumah Sayang Orphanage, as a volunteer. Sometimes I tutor some of the orphans. During festivals, we have invited the children to our house. But I never thought that my mother would be interested in adopting one of them.\n\nWhen my parents first told me about their plan to adopt a child, I was really shocked. I had been an only child all my life. How was I going to get used to having a sister all of a sudden? My parents understood my feelings. They assured me that they loved me and that nothing would change that. They were not adopting another child because they were dissatisfied with me. In fact, they were very proud of their only child. I felt comforted and yet, I was uncertain.\n\nMother took me to the orphanage to meet the little girl who was soon going to be part of our family. She turned out to be a very sweet child. I liked her. She was shy at first, but became more talkative after a\nwhile. Mother told me a little bit about her life. Her parents had died in a road accident and none of her relatives wanted to take care of her. I wondered how they could be so heartless. My heart melted. My parents were relieved and happy to see a change in me.\n\nIn fact, I found myself getting excited about becoming a big sister. Together, we prepared our home to welcome Sheila - that's the name of my little sister. I chose the bedclothes and the curtains for Sheila's room. I bought sweets, chocolates and cookies which a little child would love. Oh, I had such fun shopping. My mother and I also bought Sheila a whole cupboardful of new clothes and lots of storybooks and toys. We were going to spoil Sheila, that's what everyone said. But we couldn't help ourselves.\n\nI couldn't wait for the day when Sheila would join our family. When Father and Mother brought her home, I gave her a big hug and a kiss. Then I showed her her room. She was very quiet and fearful at first. It took her many days to realize that our home was also hers. We were gentle and loving towards her and not long after that, we were rewarded with her happy smiles and hugs and kisses.\n\nI have discovered that it is wonderful to have a little sister. She looks up to me and thinks I'm wonderful. But you know what? I think she's wonderful, too, for bringing so much joy and laughter into our home.\n\nPlease do visit us. I want you to meet Sheila.\n\nYours sincerely,"

Both Ponniah and his wife were amongst them.\nOne day, his eldest son, Manik, told him that he was prepared to leave school and look for a job. Ponniah felt desperate. He had such high hopes for Manik, who was a bright student.\n\nPonniah met an old friend, Tiong. Ponniah was amazed to see a well-dressed Tiong driving a new car. Tiong told him about his friend who could help him get rich quickly and easily. `In just three week I made RM5,000. I only put in RM1,000,' Tiong told Ponniah. Ponniah was all ears. He agreed to meet Tiong's friend.\n\nTiong took Ponniah to a coffee-shop and introduced him to his friend, a well-dressed man. Ponniah understood very little of what Tiong's friend said. All he knew was that for RM1,000, he would get RM5,000 in return. Ponniah discussed the get-rich-quick plan with his wife.\n\n'Are you sure about it, dear? It sounds too good to be true,' said Mrs Ponniah.\n\n'I know Tiong. I am sure he is not going to cheat us. He knows how hard life is for us. If we invest RM5,000, we'll make a profit of RM25,000. This is our only chance,' said Ponniah excitedly.\n\nSo Mrs Ponniah sold all her jewellery and took out almost all of her life savings of RM2,000. With a heart full of hope and RM5,000 in his pocket, Ponniah went to see Tiong's friend.\n\n'I'll see you here in three weeks. You'll get your money then,' said the man. Then he drove off with the money.\n\nAt the end of the third week, Ponniah went to the coffee-shop to get the money promised to him. Neither Tiong nor his friend was there. Ponniah became worried. `Perhaps I should come again tomorrow,' he thought.\n\nFor three months, Ponniah searched for Tiong and his friend, but they were nowhere to be found. One day, Ponniah saw Tiong from across a street. Ponniah followed him to a sundry shop. Tiong turned and saw him.\n\n'Ponniah, I feel so sorry for making you lose all the money,' said Tiong before Ponniah could say a word. `I've lost everything too. My friend is in prison now for cheating so many people.'\n\nPonniah and his wife were very sad to have lost all their money. They realized that there were no short cuts in life. Their greed had been their undoing. Now they had to start saving all over again. It was a bitter lesson to learn."

Finally, we heard that he was coming home. We planned a special welcome for him.\nThe special day was a Saturday. We got up early to help with the preparations. Each of us was given a task. I was in charge of decorations since I was good at art. My sister helped my mother with the cooking. My two brothers tidied up the living and dining rooms and the compound.\n\nSuddenly, someone screamed from the kitchen. `The taps are dry!' That must have been my sister. My mother appeared, looking dismayed. Having no water on a day like this was most unfortunate. There was still a lot of cooking and washing to be done. We checked with the neighbours -- their taps were dry too. My grandfather tried to telephone the water department but there was no answer. So we had no idea whether the water cut was for a short period of time or not.\n\nMother had no choice but to leave the food uncooked and the dishes unwashed. We decided to finish the decorating and cleaning up. But it was difficult not having water to wash after dusting, mopping and\ndecorating.\n\nMy older brother was sent to buy bottled water and our lunches. He said jokingly, 'Father might decide to return to Bosnia when he sees the state of our house.' After my brother came home, it started to rain\nheavily. Mother was now really worried. So was Grandfather. We did not want Father to arrive in bad weather.\n\nThen the fans stopped. We now had no water and no electricity. No actually, we did have water - it was coming through a leak in the roof above the dining table! The boys moved the table and we placed a huge bucket underneath the leak.\n\nWe were so busy that we forgot the time. It was Grandfather who pointed out that Father's plane had already arrived. This time, Mother screamed. It was then that the tap started running and the fan started\nturning. Water and electricity were back. The rain also stopped and the sun came out. The telephone rang. It was Father. He had arrived safely and was wondering why there was no one at the airport to welcome him home. Half-laughing and half-crying, Mother told Father briefly what had happened.\n\nFather came home by taxi. We ran to hug him, all of us talking at the same time and no one listening. We were so thankful that the most important event of the day did not go wrong -- Father's safe arrival home!"

Being a stage actor is also more rewarding because I can see and hear the response of the audience.\n\nDuring our childhood, my brothers, sisters and I loved to act out stories and plays. Our parents and relatives always enjoyed our performances. Sometimes, the adults would join in.\nI would always fight to be the lead actor. I found that I could act quite well, especially the role of the villain. It is the only time one is applauded for being nasty and cunning. I love applause and being in the limelight. This was how I realized what I wanted to be when I grew up.\n\nI remember how I used my talent to play tricks on my family. Once, I pretended to have a terrible headache. My family was fooled by my excellent acting. My father was about to take me to the hospital when I burst out laughing. They were very angry with me. In this case, my talent got me into trouble because, after that, none of my family members believed it even when I was truly feeling unwell!\n\nThroughout my school life, I grabbed every opportunity to be involved in anything to do with the stage.

My elder brother and sister doubt I will get far, not because they think I am not talented enough but more because plays are not that popular in Malaysia.\n\nWhat my family members do not know is that I have great plans for my future.

I agreed, thinking it would be an easy way to earn some extra pocket money. When I arrived at the house, I was introduced to the child, Kris.\nAfter the parents left, I asked Kris what he would like to play. `Train,' came the answer. So I brought out his train set and helped him to put the tracks together. After a short while, he must have got bored and wandered off. I was concentrating on setting up the train set properly and did not notice his disappearance.\n\nSuddenly, there was a loud crash. I nearly jumped out of my skin. I was terrified to see that Kris was nowhere in sight. I ran to look for him and found him in the kitchen. He was standing in the middle of a big mess. Tins and containers of every size were all over the floor. A bag of flour had spilled its contents on to the floor. 'I'm hungry,' said Kris.\n\nIt was not yet his dinner time. But I decided to let him have his dinner while I cleaned up the mess. There was a bowl of porridge for his dinner. Kris stared at it and said he was not hungry. `But you said you were hungry just now!' I said in frustration. 'I want egg sandwich,' Kris announced. I told Kris firmly that he had to eat the porridge. He seemed to give in and began to eat. With a sigh of relief, I started to clean up the mess.\n\nOne tin had rolled under the table where Kris was eating his dinner. I bent down to get it. Something wet and sticky landed on the back of my neck. It was the porridge! Kris grinned mischievously. I counted to ten slowly to control my temper as I wiped the porridge off my neck, my hair and my clothes. Kris also had porridge all over his face and shirt. I had to give him a bath.\n\nKris refused to have a bath. I had to carry him, kicking and yelling to the bathroom. In the end, I was as wet as he was and feeling bruised all over. When Kris refused to change for bed, I lost my patience and smacked his bottom. How he yelled, screamed and rolled on the floor. What a performance! I watched him and said nothing. He peeked at me and decided not to waste his time. He was tired out by then. I put him in bed and read him a story. We were friends by the time he fell asleep.\n\nWhen the parents arrived home, they were pleased to see their son sleeping peacefully. They asked if I could baby-sit Kris again. I said, 'No!'

'Make sure you hold on to Govin's hand when you are inside,' my aunt\nadvised. We bought four tickets and joined the queue. Our turn to enter the Haunted House came after a long wait. As the door shut behind us with a loud creaking sound, we found ourselves in total darkness. It was deathly quiet. I gripped Govin's hand tightly. Arul's sister, Sharmini, giggled nervously.\n\nA dim greenish light shone on our right. Something brushed against our faces. At the same time, we heard a blood-curdling scream. Yelling with fright, the four of us ran towards the green light. We saw a wooden bridge across a pool of some sort. As we crossed the creaking bridge, a horrible-looking creature suddenly came out of the water. We ran across the rest of the bridge. I felt Govin's hand slip out of mine. 'Govin! Where are you?' I shouted. There was no answer. Now, I was really scared. Arid and Sharmini were also very worried. 'We've got to find Govin. He might be frightened to death being alone in this place,' I told my cousins.\n\nWe held hands and moved forward, calling Govin's name. A skeleton jumped out from behind a gravestone. We were too worried about Govin to be alarmed. Then something grabbed me from behind. I struggled and tried to shake it off. That something or someone laughed like a madman and clawed at my face. I pushed it hard and it fell to the ground. 'Ouch! That hurts!' cried a familiar voice. 'Govin! Is that you?' I cried in relief. 'What were you trying to do, giving us such a fright?'\n\nArul helped Govin up. In the dim light, I could see his white teeth -- he was grinning. 'Scared you, didn't I? I bet you thought a monster was attacking you,' he said proudly. Arul, Sharmini and I laughed. 'No,\nyou little rascal! You did not scare us, but our losing you certainly did,' I told my disappointed brother."

It was a good thing that she had kept some candles, matches and torch-lights in the drawer beside her sewing machine. She found a torchlight and switched it on. It flickered and went out. The batteries were dead. She found two candles and lit them. Just then, she heard Bongsu crying in the bedroom.

National Service is a good way of training them to love their country and want to defend it in times of war.\n\nFrom what I observe of my cousin in Singapore, National Service training promotes discipline. Many of us have grown soft. Military training will instill discipline which is badly needed today.\n\nI also believe that military training helps in improving physical fitness. The exercises, walking, marching and drilling will raise our level of fitness.\n\nDuring National Service, trainees are also taught many living skills. I understand that trainees can choose a skill to specialize in such as mechanics, engineering, electronics, etc. Practical experience will help show us our talents.\n\nTherefore, I think that all of us should view National Service positively. I am looking forward to it. Although it may be physically tough, I think that I will have a good time."

So all should enjoy looking after it, and being responsible for it. I do not agree at all with the speaker who proposed that the woman's place is in the home. She can be at home and outside the home too. The idea of separate 'places' for men and women is outdated, dear friends.\n\nSecondly, ladies and gentlemen, home economics is useful for everyone. We need to know the price of fish and what to do with it - how to clean, preserve and cook it! As providers, both men and women must know how their income can be wisely spent. Economics is a useful subject so we should all study it. The home is a basic unit in society, therefore, home economics is a part of our daily lives.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, many boys enjoy home making skills. They enjoy baking, cooking and sewing. We also cannot deny that some of the world's best clothes' designers, chefs and interior designers are men. Some of these talents can be cultivated from school.\n\nDear friends, I honestly think that many boys enjoy home economics activities but are too embarrassed to admit it. Not all boys enjoy kicking a ball around a field or hitting a shuttlecock. One only need to think of Chef Wan, Jamie Oliver and Anthony Bourdain. They are all men, and each one capable of cooking up a storm! Our Kuala Krai born Zang Toi is also an example of a world class clothes designer who is male.\n\nTo conclude, ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for us to open the doors to all areas to both sexes. Let us encourage more boys to take up home economics."

        "content": "You are taking part in an oratorical contest. Your topic is 'School uniforms are here to stay'. Write a speech defending the use of school uniforms.\n\n \nHonorable judges, ladies and gentlemen, my topic for today is 'School uniforms are here to stay'. In the next few minutes, I will explain why. Some people think uniforms are out-of-date, but I disagree with them. There is no reason why school uniforms cannot be designed to look modern. Just look at the attractive uniforms of students in private institutions.\nThe main reason for having uniforms is that it does not make a distinction between the rich and the poor. All students dress the same to school so no one can show off or make others feel inferior.\n\nHaving school uniforms would lighten the burden of parents with many children. They will not have to buy so many clothes. Uniforms can also be passed on to the younger siblings. Since the uniform is used throughout the country, manufacturers can produce the cloth in bulk, which makes it cheaper.\n\nAnother good argument for having school uniforms is that it is less distracting. Schools should not be a place for fashion parades. Time may also be wasted every morning in deciding what to wear.\n\nFinally, the school uniform encourages unity. It reminds us that we are members of the same body. It promotes loyalty."

I'm here today to talk about Kuala Harimau Zoo. My friends and I were very upset to hear that the zoo is going to close down. We wish to beg the authorities to reconsider this decision.\nI understand that there are many opposed to the idea of the zoo. Their main argument is that wild animals should not be kept in captivity. Their reasons are noble, but the animals in the zoo are well cared for.\n\nOur main argument for the zoo is that it gives us a chance to actually see wild animals. Don't deprive us of this opportunity.\n\nAnother important point is that giving us a chance to see the animals will increase our knowledge and appreciation of them.\n\nFinally, let us not forget that the zoo is a tourist attraction. Our zoo is small but it has a few rare animals like the Sumatran Rhino and the tiger. My classmates and I are starting a Save Our Zoo Fund. We have already collected 500 dollars from the staff and students. Please donate generously. Look for our boxes at public places.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "You are the School Counselor. Give a talk on the pros and cons of private tuition to a group of students.\n\n \nIt is now fashionable for many Malaysian students to go for private tuition. In fact, most students feel insecure if they do not have extra tuition after school. Isn't that correct?\nExtra tuition may be necessary for some of you. For example, some of you are weak in Mathematics. Without help, you may be left behind. Many of you are in classes which are large. Your teachers cannot give special attention to weak students. But your private tutors can.\n\nSome teachers may seem unapproachable. Timid students feel afraid to ask questions. They don't want to look stupid. In a small tuition group, such students may feel more confident. Tutors can also afford to be more patient and allow students to take their time. They do not have to worry about completing the syllabus.\n\nNot all teachers are experts at their subjects. Unfortunately, you cannot choose your teachers. On the other hand, you can shop around for good tutors recommended by friends. You can also change tutors whom you find unsatisfactory. Nowadays, new graduates join tuition centers while waiting for other jobs. They are not trained teachers. They leave when they find something better to do. They are not bothered about completing the syllabus before they resign, so be careful.\n\nIn addition, tuition centers exist to make profits. Classes are often large-there may be as many as twenty to a class. This means you pay for individual attention but do not get it. There have also been cases of tuition centers closing after having collected fees in advance.\n\nFinally, extra tuition takes up too much of a student's time. A lot of time is wasted on traveling to and from the tuition centre. Some of you treat tuition classes as social gatherings. You can actually use your time more profitably on hobbies or personal revision. After attending tuition classes, you may be too tired to do your homework or your schoolwork.\n\nI personally feel that if you pay attention in class and do your revision regularly, there is no need for extra tuition. The money you would save could be used to buy revision books or put aside for furthering your education in the future."

        "content": "You have been invited to give a talk supporting co-education\n\n \nLadies and gentlemen, good morning to all of you. To begin with, I wish to say how surprised I am that so many people feel that co-education is not healthy. I strongly disagree. There are many successful co-ed schools in the country today, especially in the rural areas. I support co-education. Let me tell you why.\nIn the first place, it is a good idea to have co-ed schools for economic reasons. In some areas, the school population is too small to justify having separate schools for boys and girls. Instead of two small schools, it is better to have a bigger one with more facilities. That is how co-ed schools started in the first place.\n\nSecondly, there are good social reasons for co-education. At an early age and in a neutral environment, both sexes get to learn to understand and to get along with each other. They learn the best and worst about each other at a time when they are innocent.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, a co-educational school offers a wider variety of learning activities for both sexes. For example, in Living Skills, the boys can learn cooking and sewing and the girls can learn Industrial Arts. Many teachers also prefer a co-ed school because they find the teaching of mixed groups less boring.\n\nNext, I think that a co-educational environment also promotes a healthy sense of competition amongst the students due to the natural rivalry between the sexes. The boys would not want to look stupid in front of the girls, especially in the higher forms, and would work harder. The girls would also want to show the boys that they are not less intelligent and work hard to prove it.\n\nFinally, I have heard teachers say that discipline is generally better in co-ed schools. The boys don't like to be scolded in front of girls so they behave better, while the girls tend to be less petty with the boys around.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm sure you agree with me that there are advantages in co-education. From the economic, social and academic viewpoints, it is better. In fact, it might not be a bad idea for all schools to be co-educational in the future. Thank you for your support."

First of all, I wish to thank Mr Goh for allowing me to address the Assembly this morning. On behalf of the Green Club of the school I'm here to appeal for volunteers for the tree-planting campaign at Bukit Jambul. I'm sure all of you have seen the news on television and read the newspaper report about the recent forest fire that destroyed half the hill.\nYou may wonder why you should bother. I can give you plenty of good reasons. To start with, Bukit Jambul must be preserved as our remaining green lung. Its trees help keep our air clean-absorbing carbon dioxide and giving out oxygen. It is also a rain catchment area.\n\nDear friends, Bukit Jambul is a popular recreation spot for the people of our town. Let us repair the damaged hill so that all of us can once again visit this hill and be close to nature.\n\nMoreover, look around you. Our township has grown uglier over the years. What is the one pretty spot for miles around? It is Bukit Jambul with its wide variety of trees and wild flowers. We need to preserve this beautiful spot.\n\nFurthermore, ladies and gentlemen, we want to make our country beautiful for the Commonwealth Games. One of the venues for the Games overlooks Bukit Jambul. We can't have our international visitors looking at the bald hill, can we? Malaysia is noted for its greenery. Let's not disappoint our visitors.\n\nFinally, let me appeal to your sense of volunteerism. As a community we should work together for the benefit of all. Don't wait for others to come forward. People say volunteerism is dead. I hope the students and staff of this school will prove that opinion wrong.\n\nThe Malaysian Nature Society plans to replant the trees during weekends, starting next month. Everyone is welcome. So bring your parents, relatives and friends. Tree saplings and planting equipment will be provided. Transport will also be provided from the school to the hill. The Green Club members will be going from class to class today to take down the names of volunteers. Don't let us and Bukit Jambul down. Don't forget you are not doing this for me or the Club but for yourself and future generations.\n\nThank you for listening patiently."

        "content": "You represent a group of parents who are very unhappy about compulsory school sports. You have been chosen to be their spokesman at a Parent-Teacher Association meeting. Write your speech which should be at least 350 words.\n\n \nGood evening, the Principal, Mr Wong, Chairman of the PTA, Encik Lokman, teachers and parents. I wish to thank the Principal for giving me permission to address the meeting today. I represent a large group of parents who are unhappy with the policy of compulsory school sports. We hope that our protest will be recorded and forwarded to the proper authorities. The points I raise tonight are those brought up at our meeting last night.\nFirst of all, we think that school sports take up too much time. The annual school sports is in June but trials, practices and heats start from as early as February. Our children have to be in school at least twice a week from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. If they are selected, they have daily practices until Sports Day. By the time they come home, they are too tired to revise their lessons. We feel that their studies should come first.\n\nSecondly, we find that sports practices interfere with other activities we have planned for our children. We have difficulty fitting music, computer and tuition lessons around the sports calendar. In our opinion, these activities are just as important as sports. Some of us, in fact, have arranged private lessons for tennis, squash and golf but our children can't attend them because they have no time.\n\nNext, we wonder if the school authorities realize that sports activities cost extra money. Our children can't come home for lunch so they have to be given extra money for food and drinks. They miss the school bus so we have to pay extra money for bus fares. The teachers also demand that children buy special sports outfits and equipment such as track suits, tennis rackets, football boots, spiked shoes, etc.\n\nAnother factor that causes great unhappiness is the unsympathetic attitude of the teachers. Some of our children have medical reasons for being exempted from sports. I am referring to children suffering from asthma, bronchitis and weak hearts. But the teachers demand a medical certificate every time they are absent. Isn't this ridiculous? These children are also mocked by their friends.\n\nFinally, I wish to point out to teachers that we parents also want to spend time with our children. By the time our children get home after sports, they are too tired to even talk to us. We are not against sports but we think school sports should not be compulsory. We all have different skills and abilities. Not all of us enjoy sports. Allow our children to choose other ways to exercise if they want or need to. Thank you."

        "content": "Some apartment blocks are going to be built on a hillside near your housing area. As President of the Residents' Association, you have been asked to oppose this development project. Prepare a speech you will deliver at your next meeting.\n\n \nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your presence here which I take as a sign of your support in our campaign to oppose the development of the Bukit Saga hillside.\nMany of us were shocked to learn of the planned development of several high-rise apartment blocks on the Bukit Saga hillside. Firstly, the steep incline of the hillside makes it unsuitable for this sort of development. It is obvious that the developers have learnt nothing from the Highland Towers tragedy in Kuala Lumpur a few years ago. In that incident, an entire block of apartments, which was built on a hillside, collapsed, causing many deaths.\n\nThe developers want to take advantage of the spectacular view from the hillside to make some spectacular profits. But have they counted the cost-the damage that this will cause to the environment? The forest on the development site will have to be cleared. Some rare trees and plants which Bukit Saga is known for will be destroyed. Other consequences would be soil erosion, landslides and floods.\n\nThe people living on the foothills, such as the residents of our housing estate, would be living in constant fear. What would happen if the stability of the hillside is jeopardized as a result of the project. I shudder to think of it.\n\nThe developers have given their assurance that a proper drainage system will be built and measures will be taken to prevent soil erosion. They say that they will do everything to ensure the safety of the apartment buildings and the surroundings. However, their assurance is not a guarantee against any catastrophe from happening.\n\nThe last point I wish to bring up is what would happen if the apartment blocks were completed and occupied. Our town thus far has been a peaceful and quiet place. I foresee that this will change once the apartments are occupied. The population density will increase.\n\nI believe you are now truly convinced that we must oppose this development project. I hope that you will all give me your full support when we ask the authorities to stop the developers."

I'm very well here. I hope Grandma has recovered from her cough.\n\nMy big news for this month is that the History Society is organizing a trip to Thailand from2 0 to 27 December. The whole group will travel by train from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. In Bangkok, we will stay in a hostel. The members of the Bangkok History Society will show us around. Among the places we intend to visit will be the old city of Ayuthia, the ruins of Sukhotai and ancient palaces and temples.\n\nI'm now very unashamedly begging both of you to let me go. I can think of many reasons why I want to go on the trip. To begin with, all my good friends are going. The tour is very educational. Our History teacher has planned it specially for those of us who are interested in South-East Asian history. We will have excellent guides. Another very good point is that the tour is very reasonably priced. We only have to pay 400 dollars and this includes our fares, accommodation and most of our meals. I'd spend as much just going to Penang. The reason the tour is so cheap is because we are partly sponsored by our PIBG.\n\nI've never been abroad before -- not even to Singapore. This is the opportunity I've been longing for. You'll be happy to know that three teachers will be our chaperones. They will travel with us on the train and they will stay in the same hostel. I'll be very safe. I've been working very hard this term. in fact, I got Grade 1 in my trial exam with five distinctions. It will be a good break for me after the SPM exam.\n\nRight now, I'm busy with our annual exhibition. I'm in charge of collecting old photographs of the school and placing them in an album. Don't worry, I'm working hard.\n\nPlease give my regards to Amy and Farid. I hope they're both well. Say hello to Grandpa and Grandma and tell them I think of them all the time. Please write to me soon. I hope you will allow me to go on the trip My teachers need to know my decision by the end of this month."

Don't forget that in addition to a full-time teaching job, Mother still has to do housework! Furthermore, she does most of the cooking and the shopping. She has to do a lot of ironing too. It's just unfortunate that we lost our part-time help the same time I moved to college.\n\nAs for the cats, may I remind you that they were your idea. Just because I took over feeding them doesn't mean they are my cats. You'll feel a lot better if you have a more positive attitude. I think Mother really needs your help. Try to organize your time better. Are you still talking on the phone for houses ? just joking. talk to Mother and ask if John can help to  do the washing up on certain days.\n\nI'm going to write to Mother to urge her to find part-time help.

I'm very well but busy as usual.\n\nWell, Malini, you asked me my opinion about studying abroad. There are actually many Malaysian students here. Malaysians outnumber all the other foreign students on my campus, so I feel quite at home. Obviously, many people think a foreign degree is a good thing.\n\nThe most obvious advantage of being abroad to me is it helps to broaden one's outlook. You must admit our parents are rather conservative and we both have led rather sheltered lives. I enjoy the independence and the experience of living on my own.\n\nAnother good reason for Malaysians to go abroad is to keep us in touch with foreign ideas. People think differently about a lot of things here -- politics, leisure, careers and academic matters. I like the attitude of my lecturers about learning in general. They encourage me to think for myself.\n\nWhat is also important is that there is a wider variety of courses and a wider choice of combinations. You know I'm doing an Arts course with Philosophy, Mathematics, Economics and Art Education!\n\nThe first drawback about studying overseas is finance. It is very expensive. It has become worse with inflation in Malaysia and the weak currency. I have to be careful with my allowance. It is so much cheaper to study in a local university. Please think about this. Can your parents afford to pay for you now and your brother, too?\n\nAnother disadvantage is the loneliness. I miss home a lot, especially during festive holidays like Deepavali.\n\nLastly, your parents might fear cultural pollution. You can be corrupted by strange ideas. You have to be strong not to be influenced by classmates who smoke, drink alcohol and even take drugs. It is easy to be influenced when you're far away from home.\n\nWell, I hope I've given you enough to think about. My personal opinion is that studying abroad is a great idea if one can afford it.

I called my mother yesterday and she told me you looked really thin when she last saw you.\n\nRenita, I hope you are not doing something foolish like going on a crash diet. it is a good idea to lose some weight but it is dangerous to lose too much weight too rapidly. Rapid changes in weight are generally due to loss of fluid. Make sure that the diet you follow is sound. you have to lose weight slowly. You must be patient. half a kilo in a week is a reasonable goal.\n\nWhen you lose too much weight, you lose muscle. That is very dangerous. You can have severe health problems including low blood pressure and irregular heart beat.\n\nPlease try to exercise regularly. Exercise is an important key to weight control. I am worried about you because I remember how you used to hate doing exercise.\n\nFinally, I hope you are eating enough complex carbohydrates. When I wanted to lose weight, I cut down on my sugar intake, ate more fruit and vegetables and only ate wholemeal bread. I ate plenty of pasta, too. I also drank about eight glasses of water a day.\n\nI am coming home for Christmas. Please come and see me. I hope you won't avoid me because you don't want to be lectured by me.

        "content": "Write a formal letter to a local newspaper outlining your complaints about a tuition center.\n\n \nDear Sir,\nUnscrupulous Tuition Centre\nMy intention in writing this letter is to share a bad experience I and other students had with a private tuition center.\n\n1 I read about this tuition centre in a newspaper. It was located on the first floor of a shophouse. The person in charge told us that they were about to move into bigger and better premises. I was told to pay in advance for all three subjects, for a course of thirty weeks - this entitled me to a 20 per cent discount.\n\n2 On the first day, I had to wait more than half an hour for my tutor to appear. When he did, he took another half an hour to collect fees and to register us. The `lesson' was over. I was 20 dollars poorer and had not learnt anything. This sad state of affairs continued. My tutors were never punctual. They were often ill-prepared for the lessons. In three months, I had three Physics teachers. Our 'tutors' were not trained teachers but graduates who decided to do some part-time teaching.\n\n3 In the fourth month, we were told that the Additional Maths class would be cancelled unless we campaigned for more students! There were already ten of us and the advertisement had claimed that there would not be more than ten students in a class.\n\n4 Last month, the Principal told us that the centre would be closed for two weeks for renovation. When I went back after two weeks, I was shocked to discover that the tuition centre had, in fact, closed down. A few of us have made police reports. The police officer told us that there had been several similar cases recently.\n\n5 My advice to students is to be more careful when choosing a tuition centre. Shop around first. It is better to pay more and rely on an established centre. Do not agree to pay fees in advance. Complain to your parents if you are not satisfied with the services given. Be more curious about the tutors and the Principal of the centre. I did not even know the full name of the Principal of my centre.\n\n6 Finally, I hope the Ministry of Education will make a list of recommended private tuition centers available to all schools. This will prevent more of us becoming victims.\n\nI hope other students in a similar situation will report to the Ministry of Education.\n\nYours faithfully,"

I enjoy holding positions where I can serve others. I was a class monitor in Forms I, II and III. In Form IV, I was elected as a School Prefect. I think I am reliable and responsible in carrying out my duties. For the last four years I have won merit certificates awarded by form teachers.\n\nI have always been active in co-curricular activities. I am the captain of the school hockey team as well as a school athlete. Last year I represented the school in high jump and long jump. I am President of the Interact Club. I am also a keen Scout and a Troop Leader.\n\nIf elected, I intend to work hard to improve the canteen. I know many students are unhappy with the existing facilities. I also intend to co-operate with the teachers to improve discipline in the school. I have some ideas on preventing vandalism.\n\nWhy should I be elected ? I hope my past record will speak for itself. I know this will be a busy year for me. My time management is excellent. The proof ? My studies have not been affected so far in spite of my activities.

It seems as if everything was better then. But was it really? I don't think so.\n\nWhen my grandfather was a youth, university education was only for a privileged few. However, today everyone has the opportunity to further his education. My grandfather himself had to walk ten kilometers to go to the nearest school. Today there are schools in every residential area. Even though my grandmother was very intelligent, she was not allowed to go to university. Women were also not encouraged to pursue certain areas of education such as engineering and medicine.\n\nFurthermore, I am thankful for the medical advances of today. In the past, people died from diseases like typhoid and tuberculosis. Today, all these diseases can be treated.\n\nIn addition, life today is more comfortable with modern conveniences such as mobile telephones, the commuter train and photocopying machines. How boring the `good old days' must have been without computers and color television!\n\nTo conclude, I admit that life was much more relaxed in my grandfather's time. There was less pollution and life was more peaceful. However, I still prefer the life today because of all the benefits I have mentioned."

One only has to look at the newspaper to see this. Loitering, hangouts, ecstasy pills... what next? It looks as if they have too much free time. In our younger days, we had to help our parents after school so we had little time to waste.\nI am absolutely shocked to read about young people using violence against their teachers and parents. Whatever happened to respect for the elders?\n\nI am also dismayed to learn that volunteerism is dead in schools nowadays. It is getting very difficult to get students to help with cleaning the toilets and sweeping the classrooms.\n\nYoung people are becoming rather lazy nowadays. Are we raising a generation of couch potatoes? Where are all the young boys these days? The playing fields are empty. Oh, I forget. They're probably loitering in the shopping malls....\n\nOldster\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n \n\nI was shocked by Oldster's attack on young people in last month's issue of Teen World. I feel strongly that Oldster would not have written that article if he (she) had met and actually talked to young people like me.\n\nFirst, I must say that Oldster is guilty of making generalizations. Not all teenagers are totally out of control. I, for one, would like to think that I am very much in control of myself. The friends that I have are just as reliable, responsible and sensible as I am. We do not attend parties and stay out late at night. None of us smoke. We think that loitering in the shopping mall is a waste of time. We would much rather go swimming or look for some good books to borrow at the public library. We have never tried ecstasy pills but we know they are dangerous drugs, and have no desire to know what they look like.\n\nIt is true that we do not need to help our parents after school. But this does not mean we have too much time on our hands. Life for young people these days can be stressful and hectic. Our days are filled with extra-curricular activities, sports practices, music lessons, tuition, homework and revision. We work hard to get good grades and make our parents proud of us.\n\nAs for young people using violence against their elders, I believe Oldster is referring to an isolated case. All my friends and I are respectful to our parents and teachers. It would go against what we have been taught to be otherwise. It is just that the ones who are bad are the ones who get the publicity.\n\nIs volunteerism in schools really dead as Oldster claims? On the contrary, it is very much alive. The most popular clubs in my school are the community-oriented clubs, such as the Interact and Leo Clubs. As far as I know, we are never short of volunteers when it comes to helping the needy or doing something for our school.\n\nI hope that Oldster has a more accurate picture of young people now and will regard us more kindly. Don't condemn all of us because of a few rotten apples."

        "content": "You are concerned about the negative influence of television on young people. Write an article for a youth magazine arguing for some form of censorship.\n\n \nWatching television is one of the most popular pastimes in the world. The average Malaysian teenager spends about twenty hours a week watching television. Its power to influence young minds cannot be doubted. This is why I think that television programs should be censored.\nOne strong reason for supporting censorship of television programs is that many of the programs show too much violence. Research has proved that watching too much television violence has caused young people to accept violent behavior as normal. This can lead to an increase in aggressive behavior. Violent scenes should, therefore, be censored, and shows with too many violent scenes should not be aired.\n\nAnother important point is that foreign programs feature Western values, which are often at odds with Asian values. For example, Western culture is tolerant of issues such as pre-marital sex, homosexuality and lack of respect for authority. Do we want our youth to be brainwashed into adopting such values? Certainly not! Therefore censorship of foreign programs is essential to prevent this.\n\nI would like to conclude by saying that television can influence viewers both positively and negatively. Censorship plays an important role in lessening its negative influence and preserving positive Asian values."

        "content": "You read a letter in a newspaper remarking on the sharp increase in private schools. You are a parent with a child in a government school Write an article to be published in the same newspaper. State your views on the subject.\n\n \nPrivate Schools Gaining in Popularity\nChinese must be getting richer. More and more parents are sending their children to private schools. By all accounts these schools are not cheap. I only pay special fees once a year for my son, but his cousin who goes to a private school has to pay several thousand dollars a term! Uniforms have to be different as well. The fancy polo shirts, long trousers, track shoes, T-shirts and even blazers can end up costing a bomb. Furthermore, these schools are often located outside the city area. So, one would have to add in the cost of traveling on air-conditioned buses.\n\nWe ask ourselves why are parents doing this? Surely not all parents have money to throw down the drain? What is going on in our public schools that parents see the need to look elsewhere for their children's education?\n\nTo start with, many parents complain that in public schools, classes are overcrowded. To have at least 41 students in a class is normal. Parents therefore fear that their children are not getting enough attention. Private schools, on the other hand, guarantee smaller classes. The average size of a class is about 30 for the upper secondary. There is even a school which boasts of only 12 students in a Pure Science class. This is the equivalent of providing your child with a private tutor.\n\nAnother common complaint is that our schools do not have well-equipped laboratories. Many teachers do not even conduct experiments -- they have neither the equipment nor the expertise.\n\nThis is why, some parents think that private sector schools have more qualified teachers. This is not a surprise. Private school students pay more so perhaps they get better teachers. Public schools have to accept all those 'sent' to them. Principals from private schools can choose from a range of applicants who apply for the teaching jobs.\n\nPrivate schools can also afford better facilities. Most of them have air-conditioned classrooms, well stocked libraries and clean toilets. Sports facilities and equipment are also better. Most of the private schools have gymnasiums, proper basketball courts, badminton courts and playing fields with well cut grass. Of course, we understand that all these come with a price but then again many middle-class Chinese can afford to pay.\n\nFinally, private schools dare to do something that public schools dare not -- they guarantee good results. They help parents push their children by making them do homework during school time and providing regular feedback in the form of monthly report cards. The schools also provide parents with telephone numbers of their teachers so parents can check on their children's educational progress.\n\nFor all these reasons, it is not difficult to see why private schools are mushrooming in many towns in the country."

        "content": "You are a parent who is concerned about the amount of homework given to your child by school teachers. Write an article for the PTA newsletter, questioning the wisdom of excessive homework.\n\n \nIs Excessive Homework Really Necessary ?\nLet me begin by thanking the editor of SPOST for giving me the opportunity to write this article. After listening to my comments about the excessive amount of homework given to the children of this school, Mr. David was convinced that I should voice them in the PTA newsletter.\n\nTwo of my children are studying in this school-one in Year 2 and the other in Year 4. On the average, my children take at least two and a half hours to finish their homework. They normally begin right after lunch at 2 p.m. and are only able to finish at 4.30 p.m. Some days it takes them even longer. On one occasion when I took them swimming in the afternoon, my older son was only able to finish his homework at 9 p.m.\n\nI think that this is too much. With such a heavy load of homework daily, how much time would our children have left for other activities? I would like my children to have some hobbies like gardening, reading, or stamp collecting. But they say they have no time for these activities. I would like them to go for religious classes. But again, they have no time.\n\nIn my opinion, play is just as important, for a young child, as work. The exercise that children get out of outdoor activities is essential to their health. Sad to say, however, the children seldom have enough time to play outdoors because a good part of their day is taken up by homework. Some parents have told me that they even have to resort to hiring private tutors to help their children to complete their homework. This is getting out of hand, don't you agree?\n\nThe main purpose of homework is revision and consolidation. I suspect that some teachers think they have to load their pupils with homework so as to prove that they are doing a good job. This is unnecessary. Revision can be done in class. One period a day can be allocated for revision and consolidation work. Teachers must also co-operate to ensure that the total amount of homework given to the pupils each day is not excessive."

        "content": "Write an article entitled 'What I think about discipline in my school' for the annual school magazine.\n\n \nWhat I Think about Discipline in My School\n\nThere are different views about the state of discipline in schools nowadays. From articles in the newspapers, it seems that many adults think discipline in schools is generally poor and deteriorating. This article represents my opinions on the discipline in my school.\nI moved from a boisterous co-educational school to an all-girls' school in January this year. I must admit that the difference in the atmosphere was quite shocking to me. In my first week, I thought my new school was very boring and that most of the teachers and students took themselves too seriously. I missed the happy-go-lucky atmosphere of my old school. But now that I have been in this school for ten months, I have grown to appreciate it.\n\nLet me state all the things I like about the school first. There are many rules to maintain orderliness in the school. For instance, students have to walk in twos when they move from one room to another. They have to stand in line outside their classes in the morning and after recess. They also queue up at the canteen and in the library. The prefects are very strict about how bicycles and motor cycles are parked. Students get demerit points for any disorderly conduct.\n\nAnother thing I admire is the quiet atmosphere in the school. The students observe a respectful silence during school assembly. We are also not allowed to talk when moving from one part of the building to the other. The classroom areas are out of bounds during recess.\n\nNext, I like rules that promote love for the school. There are very strict rules against vandalizing school property. Every class is responsible for cleaning its own toilet. Classes are also placed on a duty roster to take care of the school garden and the common rest areas. This is the cleanest school I have been to.\n\nI now wish to describe what I dislike about the discipline in the school. I find the rules concerning the dress code too petty. For instance, why should there be a rule against girls cutting their hair too short? Why do skirt lengths have to be so specific? Isn't it expensive to change uniforms half-way through the year, just because the skirts are a little shorter than the specified length? Furthermore, why can't backpacks be fanciful? I feel that many of these rules take away the joy of being young. It is almost as if the authorities want us to look drab and ugly.\n\nGenerally, I think that the discipline in my school is very good. Although there are a few rules which spoil our fun, I would not want it any other way."

        "content": "\"Tourism is a mixed blessing.\" Do you agree ?\n\n \nMany people are unable to agree on whether tourism is good or bad for a country. That is why tourism is called a mixed blessing. I think that the industry has both advantages and disadvantages.\nWe cannot deny that tourism brings in a lot of foreign revenue. Even a budget tourist spends at least fifty dollars a day.\n\nMany people benefit from the tourist trade-tour agencies, transport companies and the hospitality sector. Jobs in the tourist industry pay well. Many tourists tip generously.\n\nTourism helps give a country publicity. This is good for trade.\n\nHowever, tourism has many disadvantages as well. Tourism disrupts traditional lifestyles. Bali is a good example. Places are developed to make them more modern and pleasing to the foreigners.\n\nFurthermore, tourists bring in foreign values and ways which our young people may try to imitate. At one time, a lot of young people in Penang were influenced by the hippies who visited the island.\n\nTourism can also affect the environment. Some tourist areas have become over-developed, like Redang Island.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the saying that tourism is a mixed blessing. It creates a lot of problems but it also has many benefits."

        "content": "Money is the root of all evil'. Do you agree ?\n\n \nMoney seems to be the driving force in many people's lives. However, I do not agree that money is the root of all evil. Money in itself is harmless. It is but a medium of exchange in trade. it is the  love of money that can lead to evil.\nMoney becomes a person's master if that person values material possessions above everything else. Many people do not realize that they are enslaved by money. However, you know they are when making money is the top priority in their lives. They work long hours every day and have no time for their families or friends. This often leads to marital problems, broken homes, neglected children, loneliness and much misery.\n\nThere are people who love money more than they value life -- whether it is another's or their own. Such people are ruthless, reckless and dangerous. As long as they can have monetary gain, they would not hesitate to rob, to destroy and to kill. These people are capable of all kinds of evil.\n\nDestruction of the environment is another example of evil caused by greed. Toxic waste is being dumped indiscriminately because it costs money to dispose of the waste properly. Fishermen who want a bigger haul to earn more money resort to using fishing methods which destroy marine life such as dragnet fishing and the use of dynamite. Vast amounts of forests have been cut down to make timber merchants rich and property developers wealthy.\n\nMoney or rather, the love of money, is the root of all evil in the world today. But I do not think it is responsible for all evil. In fact, money can be used for good too. Money, if channeled to finance important research work, will help to find solutions to some of the problems we face today such as incurable diseases. Money can be used to help those who cannot help themselves by providing special care for people with mental or physical disabilities, for instance, or helping to feed victims of famines, floods and war.\n\nTo conclude, I would say that money is a good servant but a bad master. It can be used for good but if one is controlled by it, then only evil will result."

        "content": "Spare the rod and spoil the child.' Discuss this in relation to corporal punishment in schools.\n\n \nThe old proverb 'Spare the rod and spoil the child' suggests that if children are not caned, they will become spoilt. In the old days, it was common for parents and teachers to use the cane as a form of punishment for the slightest act of disobedience.\nMany people still think that the cane should be used more often. They blame the lack of discipline in schools to the decline in the use of corporal punishment. Most people agree that caning should be enforced, at least for some offences. Examples of these are serious vandalism, repeated truancy and causing bodily harm to other students and teachers.\n\nTheir argument is that caning will act as a deterrent. The pain will prevent the offenders from repeating their wrongdoing. Caning will also show them that their offences are serious. Public caning is carried out to deter other students from committing offences and, to a certain extent, to shame the offenders.\n\nIn my opinion, caning should be done only in extreme cases and when there is no other choice. I think that certain conditions should be met. For instance, only a few people, such as the Principal and the Discipline Teacher, should be authorized to carry out this form of punishment. There must be witnesses and no more than three strokes should be allowed. The reason for the caning must be carefully and clearly explained to the offender and those witnessing it.\n\nIn my opinion, other forms of punishment are preferable to caning. Children should feel completely secure in school. Capital punishment has not stopped serious crimes, so why would caning be effective as a deterrent? Most problem children come from violent homes so caning would be nothing new to them.\n\nTo summarize, I disagree that caning is a deterrent against bad behavior. I think that we can spare the rod and not spoil the child. It is better to counsel the offender and gently steer him away from wrongdoing. Another way is to reward good behavior and thereby reinforce the desire to behave well in a child."

My parents keep reminding me that this is the best time of my life. They urge me to enjoy what they describe as my 'carefree' days. I can think of several reasons why people think this is the best time of our lives.\nTo start with, we have a lot of friends in school. It is hard to be lonely when we are surrounded by so many people. There is always someone to do things with, such as playing games, going to the cinema, etc. I suppose this situation of having company all the time will not happen again when we leave school.\n\nSchoolchildren also have few real responsibilities. All our needs are taken care of by our parents. There is food on the table, daily pocket money and even some luxuries like CDs. Our teachers spoil us with notes and we do not even have to think very hard as they are so anxious to help us pass our examinations.\n\nIn spite of all this, I am not sure my schooldays are the best days of my life. I am not that happy and I can think of several reasons for my unhappiness.\n\nFirstly, I hate the stress of examinations. There are too many of them in the our education system. I have already been through two major examinations and will sit for another one this year. In between, I have monthly tests, trials and music examinations.\n\nNext, I find school life too restrictive. I think there are too many rules to follow. I am not an obedient person and I get into trouble often. I have a problem with punctuality. I also find some of my teachers too authoritative. They are worse than my parents.\n\nI hope the best time of my life is yet to come. I think the best time will be when I am through with all examinations. I like to work and be financially independent. I want to look after myself. Only then will I have the best days of my life."

It is difficult to argue against this. It seems unreasonable not to allow parents to at least voice their preferences. Whether or not the children agree with them is another matter.\n\nGenerally, all parents feel they have the experience and would be in a better position to give advice on job opportunities and career prospects. Sometimes, however, young people do not base their choices on facts but on feelings.\n\nMany parents also feel that they know their children better than the children know themselves. Children can be impulsive and may make wrong decisions. There are also some parents who want to control their children's lives. They feel they must have a say in every decision their children make.

However, parents do not have the right to force their children to do what they do not want to do. Many parents, for example, want their children to be doctors or engineers just to impress their friends and relatives. They forget that young people are capable of making wise decisions too.\n\nIn my opinion, young people should seek the advice of their parents and teachers when choosing their careers. Some careers may appear glamorous, for example, singing or modeling, but the prospects may not be good. However, I feel, in most cases, a person has to make up his own mind after talking to a number of people, including his parents. It is wrong to totally disregard the opinions of our parents. On the other hand, it is wrong to choose a career just to please them. Parents should not try to live their lives through their children."

I am in Form Four while my elder brother is doing his Upper Six.\n\nMy problem is that my parents don't seem to acknowledge me. It is my brother who always gets their attention. He is the smart alec in the family. He obtained 8 As in his SPM exam. I am just average in my studies.\n\nHe is also a smooth talker. My parents always look up to him.\n\nHe gets whatever he asks for but my parents always turn a deaf ear to my requests. I feel so left out. Nowadays, I don't talk very much to anybody at home. I always remain in my room.\n\nWhat should I do? Please offer me some advice.\n\nOvershadowed\n\nWrite a reply to the letter above. You should\n\n\n• offer your advice related to the problem raised by the writer\n\n• tell her how she can overcome the problem\n\nDear Overshadowed,\n\n\nDon't wallow in self-pity. You feel left out because you are always on your own. You have retreated into your shell by remaining in your room most of the time. Perhaps that is the reason why your parents leave you alone. They probably think that you prefer to be left alone.\n\n\nYour elder brother grabs all the limelight because of his outgoing nature. Moreover, he is the eldest and it is just a matter of time before he leaves home to further his studies. Perhaps that is the reason why your parents indulge him.\n\n\nYou say you feel left out. You come across as a really sensitive person with a desperate need for attention. Your choice of the pseudonym further reiterates the fact. You are probably suffering from an overdose of growing up blues. All you need to do is shake yourself out of this frame of mind. Talk to your parents. Tell them how you feel. Communicating with others is the first step you should take so as not to feel left out. Keeping your feelings bottled up inside you can be emotionally draining. It helps to talk to your close friends and have a supportive family but the change must come from within you.\n\n\nHave a positive outlook. Be cheerful. Join in their conversations. Learn to crack jokes. It's never too late to mend."

In your letter you should\n• ask him not to worry as there is still time for him to prepare\n\n• advice him on how to prepare for the coming exam\n\n• assure him that he can be successful\n\nDear Charlie,\n\nI received your letter a week ago. I can understand your anxiety and apprehension as the Mid-term exam approaches. Don't worry unnecessarily. You still have slightly over two months to prepare. However don't wait until the last minute. Studying at the eleventh hour is definitely insufficient.\n\nFor success in your studies, you must put in enough effort. You must use your time properly. You have to set aside enough time to study everyday. To be able to do this, you have to plan your studies and your time as the saying goes, 'If you fail to plan, then you plan to fail'. Pay attention to all your subjects. Don't just study the subjects you like and neglect the subjects you don't like.\n\nThe third important precept to bear in mind is to set your goals and targets. Only then will you work towards achieving your goals and targets. Don't allow interruptions. Keep your mind focused on your studies and your examination. Forget television and the radio. Avoid telephone calls. Tell yourself that you will have time to enjoy once the exams are over.\n\nAt the same time, don't neglect your health. Have nutritious and well-balanced meals. Keep your mind free from worries and anxieties.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the key for success in your studies. Effort, time management, self-discipline and setting goals are the guiding principles for every student who is preparing for his exams. If you keep these golden rules in mind, then passing your exams will be a breeze."

How are your preparations for the final year examinations? As for me, I am still burning the midnight oil.\n\nI am sure you are waiting in eager anticipation for the school holidays, which are just around the corner. And that is the reason why I am writing this letter to you. I would like to invite you to Kuala Lumpur. In your last letter you mentioned that your family was choosing a suitable destination to spend the holidays.\n\nKuala Lumpur, as you already know, is the capital city of Malaysia. It is a cosmopolitan city with a multiracial mix of Malays, Chinese and Indians forming the bulk of the city's population. There is also a sprinkling of other races including Europeans, Thais, etc. A metropolis of mammoth sky scrapers and busy highways, Kuala Lumpur is a constant throb of color and activity. For the avid shopper, Kuala Lumpur is a paradise. The competitive currency exchanges and the string of shopping venues have earned Malaysia the title of a bargain hunter's paradise. You can also pick up good bargains at night markets with its potpourri of sights and sounds.\n\nThe many restaurants and food outlets offer a wide range of western and local cuisine. Sample the delicious Malay, Chinese, Indian and Nyonya cuisine.\n\nThere are many interesting landmarks that will definitely enthral the visitor. The Petronas Twin Towers, with an imposing 88 storeys, is reputedly the world's highest building and the KL Tower provides a superb bird's eye view of the city. At night, the city aptly dubbed the 'City of Lights' appears like a carpet strewn with dazzling jewels. The Mines Resort is one of the newer tourist attractions that has captured the hearts of thousands of tourists. Here, you can see fountains dancing to the beat of music and miniature creations of the Great Wall of China or The Eiffel Tower.\n\nI am sure you must be convinced by now that Kuala Lumpur is the traveler's choice destination. So what are you waiting for? Get on the phone and make the flight reservations right now.\n\nSend my regards to everyone at home.\n\nYour cousin,"

        "content": "Your health-conscious friend has written a letter asking your advice on how to stay slim and trim. Reply to her with your advice\n\nDear Jenny,\nI laughed until my sides ached after reading your letter. I can imagine your horror when you stepped onto the scales and discovered that you had put on two kilograms. I can just hear you screaming and squealing.\n\nTwo kilograms is not a big deal. However, if you feel that certain parts of your anatomy are getting a little too heavy, then you'd better do something about that.\n\nStaying trim and slim is not as easy as one thinks. It requires discipline and self-control. There are some important pointers to bear in mind. In the first place, avoid sweet food. Don't encourage a sweet tooth. If you can't stop nibbling, go for carrots, cucumbers or apples instead of cakes, biscuits, sweets and chocolates.\n\nPrepare and cook only the amount of food you will eat for a single meal. In this way, you will not be tempted to finish all the leftovers. Use a smaller-sized plate. A smaller plate means a smaller serving.\n\nExercise regularly. Alternatively, you can do some household chores such as mopping, washing and gardening. Exercise burns off those extra calories and can help you to maintain a slim waistline. Cutting down on red meat and eating food rich in fiber are wise moves. Avoid oily food; which is why it is advisable to grill, bake, boil, poach or steam food instead of frying. Food high in oil content not only makes you put on weight, it can also cause heart attacks.\n\nOne last word of advice. Always drink a glass of water before a meal as it will make you feel full and cause you to consume less food. Remember! eat only from hunger, never from habit. Look at food as a source of energy, not as an antidote to boredom.\n\nAn effective weight control program requires discipline, exercise and a diet low in sugar and fat content but rich in proteins, vitamins and fiber."

To tell you the truth, we are all busy with the last minute preparations for Dad's and Mum's silver wedding anniversary. What a pity you will not be here for the celebrations. Are you sure you will not be able to take a few days off and come down?\n\nSince the anniversary celebrations are on the first week of May, we do not have much time left. We are planning to celebrate the event at the Excellency Hotel. Initially, Mum wanted it to be a family affair and insisted that we have the celebrations at home to cut costs. Dad and Ivan agreed but not Lowrie and I. We were up in arms against the proposal and I am sure you know why. To get the house all spruced up for the celebration is one thing. The whole house would be at sixes and sevens after the event and imagine cleaning up the house after that. Ivan will not even lift a finger to help. After much coaxing from Dad, Mum finally agreed. Lowrie and I are keeping our fingers crossed that she will not change her mind at the eleventh hour.\n\nIvan is in charge of sending out the invitations. About 150 guests have been invited. They include all our paternal and maternal uncles and aunts and all our other relatives and close friends. Uncle Jason has volunteered to be the Master of Ceremonies.\n\nWe are having a buffet dinner. A three-tier cake has been ordered, Don't worry. Ivan has already bought two rolls of film. We will send you some photographs of the celebration as soon as they are ready.\n\nI know you will say that the whole thing is going to cost a fortune but Uncle Jason is footing the bill. Do you think that Mum being so prudent will allow such an extravaganza? You can bet she would not. She would have insisted that the money be used to finance your education. As you suggested, I bought a beautiful brooch for Mum and a wallet for Dad. I hope everything goes on smoothly without a hitch.\n\nWhen you write next, do give your suggestions. O.K. I will have to end my letter here. Take care."

Your request for the descriptions of the various tourist attractions in my state had me wondering. Are you, by any chance, planning a visit to Malaysia?\n\nMy state, Perak Darul Ridzuan, has just about everything to cater to the tastebuds of everyone. Flanked by Thailand and Kedah in the North, Kelantan and Pahang to its east and Selangor in the south; Perak has a rich blend of culture, history and legends.\n\nIpoh, the state capital, is renowned for its cave temples which are nestled in huge limestone caves and which make ideal backdrops for photographs. Ipoh also has its share of majestic architectural splendours. The Ipoh Railway Station with its Moorish architecture is affectionately called the 'Taj Mahal' of Ipoh among the locals.\n\nPangkor Island, accessible by ferry from Lumut, offers a refreshing change from the hustle of city life. Jungle trekking, scuba-driving, wind surfing, and snorkeling are some of the activities that await the sun and sea lovers.\n\nBukit Larut with its cool atmosphere and pristine forest is a paradise for nature lovers. It gives panoramic views of the town of Taiping. Taiping also boasts of Lake Gardens, which is one of the most beautiful parks in the country. Taiping Zoo, with its large collection of birds, monkeys, snakes and other animals is another attraction.\n\nIf you wish to know about Malaysia's colonial past, especially about the British rule in Malaya, then you should not miss Pasir Salak. At Pasir Salak, you can get a taste of the Malay village life. Apart from this, you can also get an insight into the rich Malay traditional culture of Perak.\n\nSo, as you can see, Perak has many tourist attractions. Whether you seek a respite from the hustle and bustle of the city or whether you seek the sun or some fun, Perak Darul Ridzuan has it all.\n\nThat is all for my letter this time. Give my regards to everyone at home. Do keep in touch.\n\nBye."

Jimmy had promised to teach me the art of fishing.\nIt was a fine day and there were already many people around the pool. Jimmy pointed out a secluded spot under some trees, away from the crowd. It was a perfect spot, where I, as a beginner could cast my line without entangling it with those of the others.\n\nI stared, horrified, as Jimmy threaded the worm through the hook to serve as a bait. He held it towards his back and swung it to the front. Then he reeled the line and instructed me to repeat what he had just done. My heart was thudding with excitement as I gave the rod a full swing to the back, pausing momentarily. Then I swung the rod towards the front with all my might. There was a loud splash and I found myself in the pool, still clutching to the rod.\n\nThe water-level came up to my neck. I reached out my hands for help. Jimmy had a stunned look -- his mouth gaping with disbelief. The other people at the pool gazed at me in amazement. One old man who happened to pass by and who had not witnessed the incident even shook his head and said, \"It is dangerous to swim in this pool. Didn't you read the sign over there ?\"\n\nOnly when two men came to my aid, did the old man guess what had happened. It was too embarrassed and flustered even to say 'thank you' to them for hauling me out. I was uncomfortably aware that I was soaked in muddy water and that a ring of laughter had arisen from around the pool. Jimmy suggested that we went home at once. But, I insisted that we stayed a while longer as a show of bravado to prove that ducking in public will not deter me from fishing.\n\nI was not easy because other people who arrived at the pool later stared curiously at my wet clothes. Only after I had caught my first fish, did I agree to go home.\n\nMy hair and clothes were still wet when we got on the bus, heading for home. Jimmy refused to sit with me. I noticed the curious looks and people whispering. I managed to keep my eyes straight ahead, but this did not prevent my cheeks from burning red with embarrassment.\n\n\"Never,\" I vowed secretly, \"would I ever get myself into such an embarrassing situation again.\""

Wong was not an ideal person to have for a roommate and Karen was complaining about her to Chan.\n\n\"Who's that over there?\" Karen said in a low voice. \"Where?\" Chan asked. Before Karen could reply, the figures emerged from the dark shadows and were striding towards them. Both were wearing T-shirts and tattered jeans. Something gleamed in the dark. Cold gripped Karen's heart. It was too late to run now.\n\n\"Show me your hands,\" one of them demanded, pointing the gleaming knife at Karen. Meekly, Karen stretched out her fingers. Her palms were sweating.\n\n\"Give me the rings,\" the youth said. \"Hurry up.\" Both Karen and Chan fumbled with their jewelry. Karen had trouble tugging her two rings out of her middle finger. They were stuck fast. One came loose, and with a swift movement, Karen flung it across the basketball court. The youth standing near her scrambled after it.\n\n\"Come back, you fool!\" shouted his partner. \"Take the other ring. I'll take care of this necklace.\" He grasped Chan's gold necklace and it snapped loose. A dog began barking frantically a hundred meters away, and the porch lights were switched on.\n\n\"Let's go!\" the youth with the knife shouted. They sprang across the basketball court to their motorcycle. The engine roared to life and they were off in several seconds. Karen and Chan stared at the vanishing tail lights. They were still numb from the shock.\n\n\"Let's go quickly, Karen. They may come back for the ring,\" Chan said. Karen looked at her fingers. The ring was still there. \"Not that, I mean the one in the basketball court.\" With great difficulty, Karen got up. She was still weak at the knees.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I brought you out here to discuss my problem. Now you've lost your necklace,\" Karen said.\n\n\"It's all right.

I was born on the first day of Chinese New Year and at that time children born on that day were considered to be unlucky. Sure enough ill luck struck when I was just three days old - my mother died. My father remarried a year after that.\nWhen I was four years old, I had to have my haircut like a boy and put on a male attire. My father and stepmother had no sons and they believed that if a daughter was dressed as a boy, a son would soon be born into the family. I was chosen for this role though I could not understand why at that time.\n\nMy father and stepmother began to treat me like a boy and soon I believed that I was one. I ran faster than any boy. I even fought with the boys in my neighborhood. In a way, I enjoyed my new role because I was allowed certain privileges that my sisters were forbidden. I could go out at any time and play any type of game I wished. I led an active life climbing trees, playing marbles, fishing in the river near my house and flying kites.\n\nOne day when I was ten years old, I was called into my stepmother's room. It was a rare event and it filled me with apprehension. When I entered, I saw her carrying a baby. She was smiling and talking to it fondly. When she saw me, her face became stern. She said, \"This is your baby brother. You don't have to put on the ridiculous clothes now. Go and change into one of your sisters' dresses.\"\n\nI looked at her as if she had gone mad and said, \"Why should I wear a girl's dress? I am not a girl.\"\n\nShe turned away abruptly and said, \"GO!\" in a voice that sounded final. I stormed into the kitchen and ran into the arms of Ah Suan, our servant. She was the only adult in the house I could talk to. I wept and told her what had happened. She patted me and explained everything to me. She told me that I had become a boy for a short while for my brother's sake. She explained it so well that I felt that I was a heroine. However, the thought of becoming a girl all over again filled me with fear that life will never be the same again."

All my hopes of taking a long walk on the beach and maybe reading a book under a shady tree were dashed.\n\nIt looked as though the whole population had descended on this two-kilometer strip of sandy land bordered by the deep-blue shimmering sea. Each person seemed to have started out with the same idea in mind: to take advantage of the public holiday and the light, sunny day for a wonderful outing with friends or family.\n\nThe horde of people set up sunshades and picked out picnic spots wherever there was space. They laid out mats as if to demarcate their territory. Soon, the whole beach was taken up. Everyone had to tread cautiously to avoid stepping on or knocking into others.\n\nA big orange and white sunshade in the center of the beach caught my eye. On a deckchair under it lounged a woman wearing a dark blue swimsuit. A pair of sunglasses dangled from her fingers as she watched her husband being buried up to his neck in the sand by their six-year-old son. Another son and a daughter were busy building a sandcastle nearby. Some small talk was exchanged and chuckles and laughter followed. What a picture of sentiment!\n\nIn the sea, a black mass could be seen bobbing up and down. It was clearly impossible to distinguish one person from another. Swimming was done with difficulty and one could hardly get any satisfaction and enjoyment out of it. What the people received were bumps and kicks: there were plenty of collisions! I noticed a man trying to coax a little boy to take dip in the water. The boy was practically screaming his head off with fright.\n\nThe overall scene could be likened to a football match where throngs of spectators filled the stadium to its full capacity and more were still trying to get in. They had to put up with the discomfort of being crammed together.\n\nIt was certainly a mistake coming to the beach. I vowed never to set foot on one again on a public holiday."

I fumbled with my study lamp and the dark terror of the unknown subsided. My scream died away as suddenly as it had come.\n\nA huge old monkey stared at me from the corner. Then it started shrieking, and dashing all over the room. I felt giddy just following its movement. Then it dashed between my legs. I started screaming again and made for the door. I dashed into the living room and headed for the stairs. The monkey following suit.\n\nThen the unexpected happened. I tripped over the monkey. Both of us rolled down the stairs together. Everything happened so fast that I couldn't see the house going topsy-turvy until I reached the landing. When I came to my senses, the monkey was still at my side.\n\nIt was clutching my pyjamas. \"What is happening ?\" I stilled myself, not daring to move lest that it should scratch me. \"What should it do next ?\" I couldn't scream for help as there was no one in the jungle. I came to study the social behavior of monkeys in their natural habitat.\n\nMy eyes widened as a thought crossed my mind. Perhaps the monkey was thinking of dragging me back to its habitat to study my behavior ! I was lost in my thoughts when I realized that he monkey was tugging my pyjamas. It seemed to be beckoning me to follow it. It didn't look that fierce at all.\n\nI stood up and followed. I stopped at the front door and looked up at me. I opened the door. Out in the porch were about ten monkeys of all sizes. The little ones were shivering. The animal lover in me took charge."

The carvings are so delicate.\n\nAnn and I as well as our music students arrived here on the 17th, all eager to see the musical concerts. The weather is cold, but tolerable. (If one is clad in warm clothing, it is not a problem at all.) The first night, some of my students and I attended a concert at the Royal Festival hall. It was splendid.\n\nThe following day we went to the Palace Theatre to see \"Les Miserables \". A superb production! I cried and ... cried and at one point, felt quite shy. Then I discovered that many others were crying too! The acting was so real and moving.\n\nYesterday morning we went to \"Foyles\", a huge book store, to get some music books. I selected two books, went to the cashier, paid for them and absent-mindedly left my purse on the counter! Then I proceeded to the second floor to get two books for Aunt Miranda and when I went to pay for them, I discovered my purse was gone! I turned cold.\n\nJust then, Farah, one of my music students, came to see me and said that a lady was after me with news about my purse. I dashed up the stairs like a mad woman. Thank goodness I managed to retrieve my purse!\n\nWe then proceeded to \"Marks and Spencers\" to get some foodstuff for the girls in my group - sliced meat, bread, fruit, etc. (I'm in charge of three girls in our group.)\n\nWhen I had paid for the groceries I found all the girls missing! I had gone out through a different exit and couldn't see any of my group. I was lost! I went up to an English lady and asked her if she could help - she laughed and said she, too, was lost! Finally I asked two girls passing by where Russels Square was. They smiled and said they were going there too. I was safe.\n\nTo cut a long story short, I met the rest of the group at Russels Square, all safe and sound. I have been to several places - Westminster Abbey, Westminster Cathedral, the British Museum, Trafalgar Square and the National Art Gallery.\n\nIn the midst of all this, I miss home very much. I have phoned home twice. Both Luke and Aunt Miranda said that everything was all right. I thank God for giving me this opportunity to come here, and also for close friends like you for encouraging me to come. Tank you so much.\n\nTill I see you again, take care. May God bless you always.\n\nYours sincerely,"

        "content": "Explain Motive to Viewers\nI'm writing this letter to ask for an explanation from the Censorship Board with regards to the guidelines used for banning and censoring television programs. In my opinion, there does not seem to be any sat rules used for this purpose. Programs which are harmless like 'Melrose Place' have been banned without prior notice whereas programs like 'Stuntmasters' which definitely is much more harmful to the imagination of young viewers has been allowed on our screens. They have been reports of children imitating their famous cartoon heroes and end up hurting themselves or other people. I hate to imagine what would happen if more of such violent programs are shown.\n\n2. I want to know whether the Censorship Board regards Malaysians, especially teenagers, as mindless people who do not know the difference between right and wrong. What a person is, comes from within and is mostly influenced by his upbringing. If a child has been brought up well, no amount of external forces can influence the child. In fact, the responsibility of censoring. programs should lie in parents. Parents should than take the opportunity to provide further guidance. However, due to the rigidity of the local censors, many parents assume that the programs shown are suitable for children and hence do not have to check on their preferences. Ultimately, most Malaysian children watch whatever that suits their fancy.\n\n3. We even have programs which are not suitable for children like the 'Movie' slot which has its share of violence, being screened early but programs which have children in them, like the popular sitcom, 'Home Improvement' being screened late at night. I really fail to see the logic and rationale behind this. We also used to have sitcoms during the seven-thirty to eight slot. Now the slots seem to have been taken over by game shows. I know that there are many fans of game shows out there, but let's be fair. All of us faithfully renew our television license yearly. Don't you think all of us should be treated fairly?\n\n4. I hope that my letter will be published in your Teenage Rights column in the coming issue so that the other teenagers out there would get an explanation too.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours faithfully,"

        "content": "We usually budget and plan ahead when we want to buy some costly electrical devices like compact disc players, washing machines and personal computers. But seldom are we prepared for the increases in the electricity bill. Are there ways for us to enjoy the use of these electrical devices and yet keep the electricity bill low? Yes indeed, there are.\nOne way is by switching off the electrical devices if they are not being used. We often forget to do so. We switch on the kitchen light, take our drinks and leave it on. We switch on the fan and simply forget to switch it off later. All we need to do is to change our habits.\n\nWe should also try to do as many chores as possible during the daytime so that we do not have to switch on the light. Do not use electrical devices unnecessarily. It has become almost a habit for us to switch on the fan regardless of whether it is a cold day or a hot day. Switching on electrical devices have become a reflex action. To save electricity, we should ask ourselves, \"Do I need this?\" before we switch on any electrical devices.\n\nThere are also habits of using the electrical devices which need to be changed in order to save electricity. For example, we like to open the refrigerator door very often. Each time we do so, some cold air escapes and extra electricity is needed to bring down the temperature again . The same principle applies when we use the iron for short periods of time throughout the day. Electricity can be saved if we iron a whole stack of clothes at one go instead of ironing them piece by piece as and when we need to use them.\n\nNowadays, there are many energy saving electrical devices such as bulbs which consume less electricity. We should use them instead of having fanciful ones that often beautify our homes and increase the bill as well.\n\nMany of us go for holidays. To deter would-be-thieves, we often leave some lights on the whole day because there might not be anyone available to switch them on at night. In such instances, it would be a big saving if you fix a timer to the lights so that they come on at night only.\n\nSaving electricity is possible only if ever one involved is concerned about saving money. Only then would everyone co-operate to keep the electricity bill low."

        "content": "Tourism is an important source of income to Malaysia. It is a good money-spinner because Malaysia is blessed with beautiful scenery, historical spots, sandy beaches and its famous Malaysian hospitality. These assets have been fully-utilized by our government to promote tourism.\nThe Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Sports plays a major role in promoting Malaysia to tourists overseas. Malaysia used to be little known in many countries overseas but now with much advertising in the mass media, people have begun to consider Malaysia as the next destination for their vacation. The prominent nationwide effort at promoting Malaysia is in the form of \"Visit Malaysia Year\" which was organized in 1991, 1994 and will be held again in 1996. Cultural shows and oral fests are part of the program for the \"Visit Malaysia Year\". These events are crowd-pullers.\n\nOur country aims for a constant flow of tourists into the country, instead of spurts in numbers which coincide with events like the \"Visit Malaysia Year\". This is shown by efforts at developing certain locations as tourist destinations within the country. Examples are Pulau Langkawi, Pulau Pinang, Mount Kinabalu in Sabah and Mulu Caves in Sarawak. The organization of tour packages is largely responsible for attracting tourists. Without organized tours, tourists waste time arranging accommodation and transport. Travel agencies have caught the idea and have many tour packages for various tourist spots in the country.\n\nThe income generated by the tourism industry would not be great if tourists come just once. To ensure that tourists make Malaysia a regular destination for their yearly vacations, there have been efforts by all quarters concerned to improve the necessary facilities. The government has built roads and highways to save traveling time from one spot to another. Hotels and tourist resorts offer special room rates during holiday seasons. They also have food fests which feature favorite Malaysian food like satay and laksa. Handicraft shops are situated at convenient spots so that tourists can bring home with them mementos of their memorable visit to Malaysia.\n\nEven the Malaysian on the street is ever ready to give a friendly Malaysian smile which makes tourists feel at home. And which brings them back again and again."

She was happy that George was studying with Thomas instead of loitering and wasting time with his other friends. She had frequently advised Thomas to stay away from Scotty, Man and Derek. Maybe, he was going to be all right after all, she thought.\nWhat she did not know was that George had actually lied to her. Instead of going to the library, George went to the Sinaran Shopping Complex to meet Scotty, Man and Derek. They went for a movie and played some video games later. Scotty owned a car. His father was one of the richest businessmen in town.\n\nAfter loitering for three hours at the shopping complex, they drove around town disturbing people and throwing candy wrappers at unsuspecting pedestrians.\n\nIt was about eleven at night when they left the city lights behind. Scotty continued to drive recklessly. Many a time he overtook at sharp bends. Twice they missed oncoming cars by mere inches. After all these near misses, they would laugh loudly. They thought it was fun.\n\nThen, suddenly a lorry pulled out from the side of the road. Scotty who was going very fast stepped on the brakes. All of them screamed as the car screeched and crashed right into the lorry. The last thing George could remember was hearing voices which seemed strange and faraway.\n\nMeanwhile, his parents were getting worried. George's mother telephoned Thomas's place and was shocked to hear that Thomas had not even seen George at the library. George's mother decided to call the police. Half an hour later, they informed her about the accident. George's parents rushed to the hospital where the doctors informed them that apart from a fractured leg, George was all right. However, they were not sure whether he would be able to walk normally again.\n\nIt took George three months and a series of operations to recover but he now walked with a permanent limp. George regretted his action but had to go on living despite a handicap. He lost his friend, Derek in the accident. Scotty was still in coma and Man still has nightmares of the accident.\n\nGeorge regrets not listening to his mother. However, he knows that it is no use crying over spilt milk. It would be better to make the best of the situation instead."

She was very dissatisfied with her two-week holiday in Malaysia. According to Ms Kingsley, she chose Kesuma's holiday package over the others because it promised a quiet holiday amidst a picturesque scenery.

However, when she arrived, she discovered that the claims in the brochures were false.\n\nAn interview between the management of Kesuma and Ms Kingsley was granted to get the company's side of the story. This was attended by reporters from all the local newspapers. Ms Kingsley claimed that Kesuma was overcrowded with tourists and the beach was littered with rubbish of all kinds. In addition, no Malaysian cuisine was served. Only western food was on the menu. The brochures boast of frequent ferry services to a small island a few kilometres away. However, on arrival at Pulau Selimut, Ms Kingsley discovered that the ferry service was provided only three times a week.\n\nAt an interview, the general manager and public relations manager of Kesuma Beach Resort defended their claims. They emphasised that their resort was picturesque and the beach was cleared of rubbish regularly. They suggested that Ms Kingsley could have gone to the beach just before cleaning was done. In response to Ms Kingsley's complaint that the beach was crowded, the management of Kesuma explained that it was the school holidays and there was unexpectedly more tourists and locals than usual.\n\nWhen queried by reporters regarding the unreliable ferry service to Pulau Kecil, the general manager of Kesuma explained that the service was provided by another company. \"We'll definitely look into this matter. If need be, we'll call for a new tender for the ferry service,\" Mr Jayakaran said.\n\nWhen Ms Kingsley brought up the matter on food, Puan Yasmin, the public relations manager of Kesuma, explained that the resort offered excellent Malaysian food of all kinds, but during the period of Ms Kingsley's stay, they were promoting western food."

        "content": "The pasture on the other side of the fence is always greener. When one is a student, one cannot wait to start working. However, when a person has been in the working world for some time, he longs to return to his student days.\nAs students, we do not need to worry about earning money unless the financial resources of our parents is really limited. Parents take it upon themselves to be responsible for what we need during our schooldays. There is no doubt that we have to budget our pocket money. When we are working, we have more money to spend but along with the extra spending power, comes commitment. Working adults, need to service car loans, house loans, pay insurance premium, not to mention contribute towards the household expenses. The best thing about being a student is that one receives money whereas when one is working, one is expected to give money.\n\nLife is certainly less complicated as a student. Students spend their time studying for good results. This is pressurizing for some students who wish to be free from all these. But can we escape from pressure ? In the working life, the pressure to perform well is even greater. The yearly bonus, increment and promotion depend on performance. There are more deadlines to meet and goods or rather results to deliver. There is little room for mistakes. if one fails to deliver the results especially on a major project, One may not get a second chance. However, as a student if one fails a test or an exam one can work hard to improve one's results. If students think that they are bogged down with homework and projects, then paperwork and projects in working life is endless. At least students can be consoled by the fact that it is for their own good. Working adults thrive for the good of the company.\n\nIn school, everyone strives hard to achieve academic excellence. There can only be one top student. Competition and rivalry among classmates is inevitable. if we think this i bad, we would be shocked when we step into the working world. The competition is worse especially when one's career is on the line. People will go to any length and do anything to achieve what they set out to do. There is much back-stabbing among colleagues. Genuine friendships seldom develop among colleagues whereas schools are where lasting friendships are made and maintained for life.\n\nThe best part of all is the holidays. A working adult has about fourteen days of leave a year. This excludes Sundays and other public holidays. This may vary depending on the number of years one has worked with an organization. A student has about twelve weeks of holiday excluding weekends and public holidays. A working adult can only dream of such holidays.\n\nWe cannot be students forever. We would spend many more years working. It makes sense to appreciate the relatively carefree life we enjoy as students and draw lessons for our working life later."

        "content": "Should euthanasia or mercy killing be allowed or outlawed ? Write a letter to a local newspaper expressing your views.\n \nIn view of the avalanche of letters in the `Letters to the Editor' column over the past week, I wish to join the debate on whether euthanasia or mercy killing should be allowed or outlawed.\nWhat is euthanasia? Euthanasia is a term which describes terminally ill patients who are allowed to die after a doctor, who is a specialist in the illness, confirms the diagnosis and prognosis. Hence, euthanasia actually means terminating the life of a human being. I think it is a despicable act that undermines the basic right of the individual-the right to live. At a time when a terminally ill patient requires greater care and love, he is considered a burden and is deemed fit to be got rid of.\n\nEuthanasia is now carried out in several countries especially in the west. In these countries, the criteria for lawful euthanasia are that the patient must be experiencing intolerable pain with no prospect of improvement or cure and it has to be a last resort when all other avenues of alleviating the person's condition have been tried and found wanting. Moreover, the request for euthanasia must come from the patient himself. While such a practice may be well-received by some western countries, it has no place in our society where children are still bound by filial duty to look after their parents in their twilight years, and in certain segments of our society, where the concept of the extended family is still practiced. In such a scenario, euthanasia, like abortion, is considered a sacrilege. All the major religions of the world denounce mercy killing. Life is God's gift to mankind and to take away that life shows defiance.\n\nIt is the duty of a physician to use his expertise to treat the patient who has been entrusted to his care. Thus, he has to carry out his duties with dedication and professionalism. A doctor is bound by a code of ethics to give the best possible medical attention and to prolong the life of a patient. Likewise it is the duty of the patient's next-of-kin to provide physical and emotional comfort to the patient and prepare him to meet his end with dignity.\n\nThus, euthanasia should not be allowed, with or without the consent of the patient. A physician who assists in mercy killing is guilty of committing a criminal offence which should be punishable."

Nowadays however, with jobs that require people to stay away from home for the greater part of the day, eating out has not only become a necessity, it is indispensable. The number of eateries that have sprung up all over town is indeed alarming.\nWhile eating out is still a no-no to some people especially fitness buffs and people who are health conscious, many people now opt to eat out for sheer convenience. It is especially so in the case of working people and those who are still single. In the first place, there is no need to get all worked up about going to the market. There is no necessity to waste all those precious moments deciding on the menu for the next day. On the other hand, eating out can be a pleasure minus the fussy preparations and the need to clean up the mess after cooking. All this can be left to the stall operators who actually offer their services with a smile.\n\nAnother reason why people prefer to eat out is the wide variety of choices available. One has only to go to a fast food restaurant to see the great variety of mouth watering dishes on display. Besides being able to choose the types of dishes that cater to an individual's tastebuds, there is also a wide choice of eateries. Most people frequent restaurants, hotels and fast food outlets. There are also people who prefer to eat out at hawker stalls, food courts or gluttons' corners. While the cleanliness of these premises leave a lot to be desired, people do not seem to mind since the food is delicious and cheap.\n\nPersonally, I do not fancy the idea of eating in public. I prefer to have my meal in peace and quiet. Being quite a fastidious person, I am especially concerned about the cleanliness and quality of the ingredients used and the freshness of the food that is served. It is a well-known fact that hawkers and chefs use flavor enhancers and additives that can wreck havoc on one's health."

Since moving into our new home in the countryside, my brother, Jim and I used to often sneak out to the pond where we would meet another friend. Dad had warned us not to venture anywhere near the pond area especially after a friend had made it known to him that an alligator had been spotted there. We took no heed of his advice though. This was our favorite hideout and we were certainly not going to give it up.\nOn this particular afternoon, the three of us had just finished swimming. Jim and Syed were reluctantly making their way towards the spot where they had left their clothes. I stayed back and was bathing in the waist-deep water when I suddenly became aware of ripples forming in the surface of the water. I cocked my head and looked in the direction. My eyes caught a motion in the water. A log, I thought. Then I saw it-its snout and its two reptilian eyes. `Jim...' I screamed with all my might.\n\nJim turned his head in my direction and immediately recognized the danger. 'Get out of the water Jeff. Hurry. It's just behind you.'\n\nI waded clumsily in the water. After a few stumbles and fumbles, I reached the edge of the pond. I looked over my shoulder. Moving swiftly towards me was an enormous alligator. I froze. Then, suddenly I felt a searing pain in my leg. Meanwhile, Jim and Syed screamed and started throwing stones at the alligator and managed to distract it. The alligator went for them now. As it opened its jaws, I could see its jagged teeth. I tried to move but a stabbing pain shot though me. I slumped onto the ground, sprawled in a pool of blood.\n\nMeanwhile our screams were heard by two hunters who were in the vicinity. On seeing the alligator, one of them fired a shot in the air. It had the desired effect. The alligator stopped in his tracks, retreated a few steps and slithered hurriedly into the water. Then, I passed out.\n\nWhen I regained consciousness, I found myself in a totally unfamiliar environment. The smell of antiseptics told me that I was in hospital. I later learnt from my mother that I was rushed to the casualty ward where I was treated for puncture wounds on my right ankle and a long gash which required fifty-six stitches. Mum reminded me how fortunate I was to have escaped from the jaws of the alligator. It was a narrow escape."

Since it is not a self-contained area, I used to go to the supermarket every Saturday to get all my provisions for a week. As my Sedan was just slightly over two months old, I would wait until late in the evening when the rush hour traffic would dwindle. Then, driving along the roads and highways would actually be a pleasure.\nIt was on one of these Saturday evenings while I was cruising along the Federal Highway, that I found my car suddenly veering to the left. I pulled over by the side of the road to inspect my vehicle. I discovered that I had a flat tyre. I did not have the slightest idea of how to change a punctured tyre. Gosh, I am stranded, I thought. I felt vulnerable and terribly alone. I had been fed with all kinds of facts and fiction about what an unsafe place the city was, with all sorts of shady characters waiting to prey and pounce on isolated targets especially ladies.\n\nA number of vehicles whizzed past me, nobody stopped to find out if I needed any help. Night was creeping in. All of a sudden, a grey jalopy pulled over just behind my car. A heavyset man in overalls alighted from the car. I took in his shabby appearance-stained overalls, unkempt hair and his stubble of grey and white.\n\n'What's wrong?' he asked.\n\n'A flat tyre,' was the only retort I could manage. He asked me to step aside, while he went about remedying matters. I was terrified and I did not dare to take my eyes off from what he was doing. Was he going to rob me of my cash and jewelry or was he going to drive off in my brand new car? I occasionally stole surreptitious glances at what he was doing. With deft movements, he changed the punctured tyre.\n\n'O.K. Madam, here's your car. Have a nice journey,' he said with a big grin. He fished out a handkerchief from his pocket and started to wipe out the grime and dirt from his hands. I thanked him profusely. He just nodded and sauntered past me. As I turned the key in the ignition, I saw him looking furtively over his shoulder to make sure that everything was alright. As I made my way to my destination. I told myself that I will never again judge a book by its cover."

Then, in the dark, he made out a dilapidated wooden shack. Ben kept his gaze fixed on the house. This had once been his home. How long had it been? He could hardly believe that ten years had passed since he left this abode. How could he forget the hardship, the struggle, the sorrow and the poverty?\nBen was the eldest child in a family of six. Life had not been so difficult when his father, the sole breadwinner of the family, had been around. By a cruel twist of fate, his father had passed away in a road accident. Ben's heart still misses a beat whenever he remembers the tragedy. It had been the most devastating period of his life. There were four other mouths to feed. He was the eldest and the others depended on him. At a time when most other people would have resigned themselves to being helpless victims of fate. Ben had the fighting spirit. He resolved to go on in spite of all the odds being against him.\n\nA typical day for Ben began at dawn. After gulping down his breakfast, he would take the refreshments his mother had made and deliver them to the cake seller at the market. He also supplemented their income by helping Roger at the food stall, washing the plates and glasses. With the meager income both mother and son earned, combined with their skilled husbandry, they had been able to make ends meet.\n\nIt was hard to keep a grip on himself and not lose hope but he endured it for the sake of his family, whom he loved. His mother had been the driving force that kept him going during difficult times but it was his determination to rise above their hand-to-mouth existence which made him excel in his studies.\n\nHe had passed every examination with flying colors. Determination and perseverance enabled him to obtain a Grade One in his high school final test and straight As in his pre-University examination. After securing a scholarship, he went on to university, graduating four years later with an honors degree in Accountancy. That was the reward for all his efforts.\n\nNow, working as an accountant, he finally had the means to look after his aging mother and educate his younger brothers and sisters. His recipe for success was working hard until one's ambitions were achieved."

Although their income was small, his parents were happy and did everything to please him. As a spoilt teenager, Danny did whatever he wished. He started making friends with shady characters and became interested only in having a good time, freely spending his parents' hard-earned money. So, he dropped out of school. Believing that he could do better than his parents who worked hard yet earned little, he dreamt of getting rich without sweat and toil.\nSoon, he was on the wrong side of the law. He became a con man but after a while, people were no longer fooled. Desperate, Danny became a pick-pocket and, later, turned to extortion. Once, Danny's mother had advised him to turn over a new leaf. However, he was still convinced that he could make a fortune without hard work. Danny thought his chance had finally come when his friend told him of a scheme that would make them rich till the end of their lives.\n\nIt had all seemed well-planned when the mastermind explained it to Danny. They would rob a bank and escape in a stolen lorry, abandon it outside town and continue their journey in a stolen car, which they would get rid of in a disused mining pool before crossing the border. Then they would live as rich men.\n\nIt was not meant to be. Before they could grab enough money, one of the bank tellers had managed to push a hidden alarm button. As police came screeching around the corner, Danny and his friends barely managed to flee in the lorry, but not before a security guard ripped off Danny's mask in a tussle. Danny had quickly turned his face away. Unfortunately, he had turned it into full focus of the security camera. The getaway driver, in panic, had made a left turn instead of a right and had taken an unfamiliar road. They had reached a tunnel for which the lorry was too high and had no choice but to jump off and try to escape on foot.\n\nIn his bare and gloomy jail cell, Danny finally admitted to himself that 'crime does not pay'."

Continue the story.\n \nI had just switched off the light when suddenly there was a knock on the door. 'Who is it?' I asked before unlatching the door.\n'Mrs Lim,' a woman whispered in hushed tones. Mrs Lim was one of my neighbors who lived down the street with her old invalid husband. I proceeded to open the door. In my hurry, I fumbled with the door knob. I glanced at the wall clock. It was almost 1 a.m. My instincts told me that something was wrong and that Mrs Lim needed help.\n\n'What's wrong?' I asked.\n\n'It's my husband. I think he's having a heart attack. Can you help me?' she blurted out, in between sobs. With lightning speed, I put on a new change of clothes. Then, I followed Mrs Lim to her house. The whole house was a little musty. As this was my first visit to the Lims' residence, I had a quick glance around the living room. There were wall panels covered with water-color landscapes, engravings and cross-stitch pieces. Then, along the corridor leading to the kitchen was Mr Lim, slumped in an armchair. He appeared to be gasping for breath. With Mrs Lim's help, I managed to carry him to the porch where their car was parked. When we finally managed to get him inside the car, I drove to the hospital.\n\nWe rushed him to the emergency and casualty ward. The doctor on duty informed us that Mr Lim had suffered a mild stroke. Mr Lim was admitted to the intensive care unit where Mrs Lim and I kept an all night vigil.\n\nMore than a month has passed since the incident. Mr Lim was discharged after a week. He made speedy recovery. Apart from his slurred speech, he appeared hale and hearty. As news about Mr Lim's affliction spread, the Lims received a steady stream of visitors who also rendered whatever assistance the old couple needed.\n\nPersonally, I was glad that I could be of help. It made me realize that when we give a helping hand to those who need our assistance, the world would be a better place to live in."

Which is your favorite building, and why ?\n \nWhile on a sight-seeing trip to India with my family last year, I had the rare opportunity to visit one of the most beautiful buildings in the world -- the Taj Mahal.\nBuilt by the Mogul emperor Shah Jahan, it is situated at Agra in northern India. Standing on a large terrace overlooking the banks of the Jamuna river, it is the pride of India, and even after more than three centuries its beauty remains unequalled.\n\nEqually intriguing is the story behind it. The Taj Mahal was built for the emperor's favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who is said to have been one of the most beautiful and intelligent women in the Mogul court. She was known to be kind and generous, and was the emperor's political advisor and confidant. Her dying wish was that the emperor build a monument for her as a symbol of their love. The distraught emperor then built the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum out of love for his wife.\n\nThe Taj Mahal is one of the wonders of the world. It took 22 years and 20,000 men to build this monument. The building measures 130 feet across and is 200 feet tall and at each one of its corners, there is a minaret. Surrounded by serene pools of water, it is a perfectly symmetrical building which never throws a shadow from any angle. The splendor of the Taj Mahal amazes the many people who visit it every year.\n\nThe Taj Mahal is also a reminder of the extravagant lifestyle of the kings and emperors of India's bygone era. The whole monument is made of white marble and inlaid with semi-precious stones. Intricate floral designs made of precious stones adorn the walls of the building. The lavish decorations make it a fitting memorial for an empress.\n\nIf given a chance to see the Taj Mahal again, I would definitely not pass up the opportunity. This building is not only my favorite because it is magnificently built, but also because it is a combination of beauty and a very touching, romantic story."

Her father was a physics teacher and this explains her enduring obsession with scientific research. Even as a child, Marie used to watch her father at the laboratory and she became determined to follow her father's footsteps. Her scientific zeal would later earn her a name so revered she would never have thought it possible.\nIn an age and place where a career in science was considered unsuitable for a woman, Marie was left with no choice but to leave for Paris to fulfil her ambition. There she met Pierre Curie, a professor of science, whom she married in 1895. This paved the way for one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time.\n\nIt did not take Pierre long to realize that Marie was truly a genius and he was happy to support her in her work. The pair discovered radium, a radioactive element of a mineral called pitchblende, in 1890. Working in a small wooden shed devoid of facilities, this fragile woman possessed a determination unmatched by most other women of her time. It took her four years of hard work to obtain a minute amount of radium from several tons of pitchblende.\n\nTheir work earned the Curies great praise but they remained unaffected. Both of them could have grown rich if they had attempted to patent the discovery of radium but money and public acclaim were the last things on their minds. In 1903, they shared the Nobel Prize for their work on radioactivity with another scientist. Meanwhile, Pierre succumbed to injuries he sustained in an accident. From then on, Marie worked wholeheartedly on her own and in 1911 was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry.\n\nThe Curies' love and commitment to the field of scientific research led them to a discovery of colossal value. Radium has helped to alleviate the pain and suffering of millions of cancer patients throughout the world. Marie Curie jeopardized her own health for the sake of her work but she overcame all odds in her scientific career. She died in 1934, at the age of 66."

Mrs Lai, our class teacher, considers our class the most notorious she has ever come across in her 22 years of teaching. She considers my class an albatross around her neck.\nMy class got its reputation because of two hyperactive, mischievous students. Most teachers come to our class braced for trouble from the infamous two and no lesson goes on without interruptions from these two pranksters.\n\nTopping the list is Dinesh who is an incorrigible chatterbox. A boy too small for his age, Dinesh has broken almost every rule in school. Despite repeated warnings and threats of suspension and expulsion from school, Dinesh has yet to change over a new leaf. He is always in the habit of throwing live cockroaches and spiders at girls who would then scream in terror. The other mischievous brat is Jerry whose favorite pastime is mimicking teachers. When it comes to playing tricks, both of them are hand in glove with each other. Whenever they get together, we know they are up to some mischief.\n\nHowever my class is not without distinction. Susan scored straight As in both her preliminary and final examinations. A petite girl wearing thick glasses and having a thick fringe, she is nicknamed 'Miss Einstein' and 'Walking Encyclopedia' as she has all the answers and facts at her finger tips. She is a real bookworm and is the pet of most teachers. The pranks of Dinesh and Jerry always incurs her wrath. She is always at her wit's end trying to instil some discipline in them.\n\nThese are some of the interesting characters in my class. Without them, my class just would not be the same. I am glad I am in this class. Although we are an incorrigible lot and can be quite exasperating at times, we have lots of fun. Just as the saying goes, 'it takes all sorts to make a world', our class would not be half as lively and enjoyable if not for these interesting characters. Since this is our last year of school, I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity of making each of their acquaintance."

Let us do our bit for the environment this week by changing our attitudes and actions. Instead of littering, let us view waste from a different perspective. By recycling waste, we can not only prevent our towns from being turned into dumping grounds, we can also ensure a systematic utilization of our natural resources.\n\nLet me start by giving you the aims of 'Recycling Week'. By having this project, we hope that students will develop an awareness of the importance of conserving and protecting our environment and our natural resources. 'Recycling Week' is also aimed at educating students on the methods they can use to reduce waste.\n\nIt is our responsibility to take care of the environment. Let us not discard this responsibility due to ignorance and indifference. Our teachers have planned many interesting and useful activities. First of all, you are asked to collect used magazines, aluminium cans and bottles. The class which contributes the most materials will win a unique trophy which is made entirely out of recycled materials. At the end of the week, all the materials collected will be sorted out and sent to cash-a-can centers or recycling plants.\n\nOfficers from the Consumer's Association have agreed to give a talk entitled 'Safeguarding the Environment'. The highlight of the week is a visit to a paper-recycling plant. If you need more information, you can obtain it from the notice on the school's bulletin board. Those interested in the trip should give their names to their class teachers.\n\nI hope that 'Recycling Week' will enlighten you on the importance and benefits of recycling waste. I would like to end by urging everyone to support 'Recycling Week' with your active participation."

Today, I am going to talk to you all about 'How to be a Smart Consumer'.\nFor most of us, the past year or two have not exactly been good times. They have been trying times. The attack on the currency has resulted in the country facing dire economic problems. If consumers play a concerted role and practice prudence and caution and stop being wasteful, then we can help to uplift the weakening dollar.\n\nIn the first place, we should have a budget. There has been a general increase in the price of many essential items. As the price of the daily food basket has gone up, we have to plan our purchases and buy only what is necessary. If you have a penchant for luxury goods, then perhaps, it is time you change. We must learn to live within our means. Having a shopping list and sticking to it is commendable. A shopping list saves time as you don't have to keep running back to the store for forgotten items. Buy what is listed and then make a quick exit for the longer you linger at the store, the more tempted you would be to buy something you do not really need.\n\nBe thrifty and do not spend unnecessarily. Paying more for the same basket of goods calls for thrift and restraint. We should look out for bargains as we would then be paying less for a product which would, at other times, be more expensive. At the same time, we should not throw caution to the wind and go on shopping sprees where we are lured to be lavish in our spending habits.\n\nConsumers have a vital role to play in overcoming the country's economic problems. Only when consumers wake up to that role, can the nation pull out of its current economic turmoil.\n\nThank you."

You have been asked to give a talk entitled \"The Consumer and His Rights' to a group of students.\n \nGood morning boys and girls,\nI am glad to be able to give you this talk on 'The Consumer and His Rights' today. Before I begin my talk, I would like to make you all aware that we are all consumers.\n\nA consumer is anyone who pays for a product or service. As consumers, we must all be aware of our rights.\n\nConsumers today are faced with many problems such as unsafe and unreliable products, unreasonable price increases, misleading and inaccurate advertisements and other deceptive practices. By being aware of his rights, a consumer can rest assured that he will not only get quality products and services but also that he will not be victimized by traders.\n\nA consumer's first right is the right of choice. The consumer should have the right to decide which product or service is best for him. The consumer also reserves the right to return or reject a product if it is not to his satisfaction or is not what he wanted.\n\nThe second is the right to be informed. Producers should be responsible enough to provide accurate information about the product or service. Consumers should have easy access to prices, expiry dates, especially for perishable goods, and also information about the ingredients used. Only then can the consumer make accurate and intelligent choices and not be beguiled by profit-minded producers.\n\nAs consumers, we should also have the right to voice our views if we are not satisfied with a product or service. Should a product be contaminated or substandard, the consumer should be in a position to voice his grouses and be ensured he will get a full refund or compensation for it.\n\nThe consumer also has the right to purchase products that are safe and reliable. The testing of products and the determining of their safety standards, such as is already being done by the quality control association, is one way of granting consumers their rights. Consumers should not be forced to make do with products that may be dangerous.\n\nLastly, consumers should have access to consumer education. Consumer education is important in order to create a consumer-conscious society. Consumers should be taught their rights and responsibilities.\nSo, boys and girls, now you are aware of your rights as consumers. Only when we assert our rights as consumers can we expect quality goods and services.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "You are an officer working with the Department of Environment. you have been asked to give a talk at a school on \"Our Role in Safeguarding the Environment\".\n \nA very good afternoon to the Principal, teachers and students. I am sure you are all aware that today is World Environment Day, so I will speak about the role that we can play in safeguarding the environment.\nHumans, in their overzealous attempts to develop the world around them, have set in motion the process of its deterioration. Today, we hear of environmental problems such as pollution, acid rain, ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect. Though we cannot undo the damage that we have already done, we can prevent it from becoming worse. It is our duty to protect and preserve the environment, and thus, Earth.\n\nOf course, the first place to start is at home. As the world's population grows, so does the amount of household waste. Many things that we throw away-old newspapers, glass bottles, plastic and metal containers-are not waste, and can be recycled. We should therefore, separate our rubbish and make sure that we dispose off only those materials which really cannot be reused or recycled. This way, we will not only reduce the amount of waste material that has to be destroyed, we will help reduce the consumption of raw materials needed in industries manufacturing paper, glass, plastic or metal items.\n\nAs consumers, we should make an effort to buy only environment-friendly goods. We should avoid products that are disposable and those that contain elements which may harm the environment. Instead, we should buy only those that can be reused or recycled and are biodegradable.\n\nIn the future, experts predict, the world may suffer a shortage of clean water. Therefore, we need to reduce the consumption of water because waste-water treatment is expensive, and untreated waste-water may become a source of pollution. Industries use a lot of clean water for cooling their machines, and often pollute rivers and seas with untreated wastewater. Much clean water is wasted when we leave the tap on while we brush our teeth or take time off to lather on shampoo and clean water becomes waste-water when we flush our toilets. Some cities have already begun recycling waste-water. We should install water-saving flush systems in our homes and use water wisely. Perhaps recycled water can be used in toilets or in industries. We should demand that all industries treat their waste-water to curb pollution.\n\nThe same goes for electricity. Conventional generators contribute to pollution and hydroelectric dams are a danger to the ecosystem in rivers. Turning off fans and lights when we do not need them is a good habit. Another is to replace all bulbs with energy-saving bulbs or fluorescent lights. We should also play our part in encouraging the use of alternative ways of generating electricity, such as solar energy, as this is an environment-friendly method that can also help save us money.\n\nMotor vehicles are a major cause of environmental pollution. Leaving the engine running while we dash into the store to pick up one or two items, or while we lock the gates to our homes, are all bad habits that contribute to air pollution. We should also reduce the number of motor vehicles on the road by car-pooling or using public transport. As responsible consumers, we should put pressure on car manufacturers to produce more environment-friendly cars. All these efforts can help reduce pollution by motor vehicles.\n\nEvery little action on our part can go a long way to protect the environment. Whatever we do serves as an example for others. If we all get together and make an effort to save the environment, we can make a big difference.\n\nThank you."

The topic of the debate is 'Canning Should Be Reintroduced in Schools'.\n \nGood morning, Mr Chairman, honorable judges, my worthy opponents, ladies and gentlemen.\nThe motion for today's debate is `Caning Should be Reintroduced in Schools'. Ladies and gentlemen, before putting forward my arguments, and before my opponents voice their opinions, I would like to draw your attention to our daily newspapers and news bulletins which are flooded with stories about the unruly behavior of our students. Whether we dare admit it or not, drug addiction, loafing and assault are rampant. Schools are no longer safe and conducive places for those students wishing to excel in their studies. Without discipline, effective learning and teaching cannot take place.\n\nWhat remedial action can we take? Ladies and gentlemen, I am certain that you will agree with me that one sure way of checking this decline in discipline is to reintroduce the cane in schools. I am confident that caning will be able to instil discipline in unruly students. Caning will act as a deterrent against gross acts of indiscipline. It should be viewed as a form of punishment which seeks to reform wrongdoers. Letting them go unpunished would seem as if we are condoning these blatant acts.\n\nMy worthy opponents will be quick to point out that violence breeds violence and that if a student is caned, he will, in turn, resort to violence. My worthy opponents, we are not saying that corporal punishment is the only method for reforming a student. Neither do we advocate the cane for every single misdemeanor. What we are saying is that the cane should be resorted to when all other attempts to discipline the student have failed.\n\nWe are also not in favor of caning a student in public. Caning should be carried out in the privacy of the discipline teacher's room or in the principal's office and with the consent of the school's discipline board. This will make the student think about his offence rather than make him rebellious and vengeful.\n\nOf course, there have been isolated cases in the past when the indiscriminate use of the cane by a handful of teachers has resulted in physical injury. However, in the hands of a competent teacher, the cane is an effective tool for instilling discipline and respect in a student, bringing about more good than harm. The rash actions of one or two teachers should not be used as a yardstick to measure the effectiveness and suitability of the cane as a disciplinary aid.\n\nWith that, I leave it to my two friends to further enlighten you on the topic. Thank you."

On the one hand, we are all happy that our form teacher, Mr Eddy, will be going on a promotion as the Senior Assistant to St Peter High School. On the other hand, we feel sad because today we will be saying farewell to one of our most dedicated teachers.\n\nLet me now brief you all about Mr Eddy's contributions to our school. He was posted to this school in 1994. It was his second posting. Prior to this he taught in a rural school in Kansas. Mr Eddy is an excellent Physics teacher. There is a general consensus among his students, both past and present, that Mr Eddy is the best Physics teacher we have had in recent years. Many of us considered Physics as a boring and difficult subject. However, Mr Eddy has helped to change our mindset. He has also helped to increase the percentage of passes for the subject in the Toefl exam over the years.\n\nMr Eddy has also left his mark in other areas. As the teacher adviser of the Science Society, he has helped the society to win top prizes for science projects both at district and state levels.\n\nAs our form teacher, Mr Eddy has been a father figure to all of us. He always listens patiently to our problems and offers the best advice. He is not just another teacher. He was a friend when we were in need, an educationist who saw to our needs in our studies and a firm disciplinarian when we were wrong. Anyone who has problems will find it very therapeutic just listening to him talk.\n\nDear Mr Eddy, we appreciate all that you have done for us. We congratulate you on your well-deserved promotion but your going away will be a great loss to this school. We wish you all the best in your new appointment.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "Write a speech entitled 'Responsibility of a Caring Society towards the Elderly'.\n \nGood morning ladies and gentlemen. In conjunction with Senior Citizens Day, I would like to give a speech entitled 'Responsibility of a Caring Society Towards the Elderly.'\nBetter living standards and health facilities together with sound development planning has resulted in longer lifespan. Recent population census indicate that the average life expectancy of the average Malaysian is 75 years for women and 73 for men. Although this is an achievement of sorts, we should join forces and not shirk in our responsibilities to the elderly. How can we care for an ageing population? Caring for the elderly is the responsibility of the individual, society and the government. In Malaysia, the retirement age is 55, an age where most people are still active and can contribute to nation building. Perhaps the government should consider increasing the retirement age so that senior citizens can continue to lead productive lives.\n\nSetting up community centers to care for the elderly in familiar surroundings should be considered. Community centers will provide the elderly with interesting activities to occupy their time instead of being cooped up at home to pass their time in idle pursuits. Besides providing the opportunity for them to interact with one another, activities can be organized so that they remain fit. It can also teach them to be independent.\n\nAdult daycare centers where the frail elderly can be cared for a few hours a day or overnight is another good move. This will not only provide temporary relief to the family which takes care of the aged parents but it will also delay institutionalization.\n\nA good geriatric service will help to lighten the burden of looking after the elderly especially the sick and the infirm. At present, the absence of geriatric services makes it difficult to provide home care for the elderly.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that society as a whole should take on the responsibility of caring for the elderly. We should realize the contributions made by them. With everyone playing their respective roles, Vision 2020, aimed at cultivating a caring society, can become a reality."

More than 300 paper rolls, three machines, office equipment and other paper products worth US$ 5 million were destroyed in the fire.\n\nFactory supervisor Warren Scott, discovered the fire at the storage section of the factory. He quickly ordered the workers to leave the factory. He then rushed to a nearby fire station. He said that there were only 15 workers in the factory at the time of the fire.\n\nThirty-two firemen in three fire engines arrived within ten minutes after receiving the alert call at 3: 20 am. Strong winds caused the flames to rise to more than 25 meters. Reinforcements had to be called in from nearby districts. State Fire Services Department operations offer, Michael, said the fire was brought under control after 30 minutes, but the factory had been completely destroyed.\n\nThick smoke billowing from the burning factory was visible over a radius of five kilometers. The distraught owner, Benson, told reporters that the cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained."

It is reputed to be his best and also the most popular of all his works. This autobiographical novel reflects much of Dickens's own life and experiences as a boy and young man. Much of the story is set in 19th century London and its vicinity. It was first published in 1850.\nThe novel has two parts. The first part deals with the unhappy childhood of David Copperfield, the protagonist, who was orphaned at an early age and suffered under a cruel stepfather. The second part of the novel contains details about David deciding on a career and finally establishing himself as an author.\n\nThe story exemplifies the silliness of immature love when he marries his child-like wife, Dora. Their domestic affairs are always in a muddle. When Dora dies, David finds true happiness when he marries the mature and understanding Agnes.\n\nThe characters of the novel are vividly portrayed. The variety of characters -- the optimistic Mr Micawber, the loyal nurse Peggotty, the kind and gentle Agnes and the sly Uriah Heep -- all appear like characters in real life.\n\nThe story is narrated in a simple, straightforward manner. The style is simple and the language easy to comprehend.\n\nIn this novel, Dickens portrays the social conditions prevalent during his lifetime. The reader gets a glimpse of the customs and manners of 19th century English society."

Write an article about this environmental problem.\n \nThe deteriorating state of our environment has always been a cause for concern not only among the authorities and environmentalists but also the Singaporean public. The haze which hit Singapore and other Asean countries in 2011 and the following years exposed the magnitude of the pollution level of the region.\nWhat is the haze and what causes it? Haze is actually brought about by the suspension of very fine particles in the air. The haze was caused by open air burning of rubbish and waste materials, factory and vehicular emissions and forest fires that occurred in a neighboring country.\n\nThe haze threatened the environment and the health of millions of people in the affected areas. It saw the air quality index of many areas reaching hazardous levels. It affected visibility levels causing collisions both in the air and sea. There were days when the visibility dipped to less than 500m making it ever difficult for search and rescue operations. The haze was also responsible for other disastrous effects, not to mention the irreparable damage to health.\n\nHowever disastrous the consequences of the haze were, it had one positive outcome. It provided a strong impetus for the authorities to tackle the problem and seek a quick remedy. It prompted the Singapore government and the governments for other Asean countries to collectively address the problem. Realizing the urgency in undertaking effective and immediate measures in tackling the problem, the authorities came out with a number of strategies. There was an immediate ban on open burning. Vigilance was increased to bring the culprits of open burning to justice. Singapore joined other countries in providing a fire fighting team to combat the forest fires. Doctors, chemical and meteorological experts, both local and foreign, joined in to combat the effects of the haze.\n\nOn the local front the authorities took full control of the situation. Schools in areas which recorded hazardous air quality indexes were closed indefinitely. Extra-curricular activities were put on halt. Flights were either rescheduled or cancelled. There was extensive media coverage of the situation and there was a public education campaign on the precautions that ought to be taken. A state of emergency was declared in several areas when the situation got out of hand.\n\nThe authorities acted with a sense of urgency in addressing the problem of the haze. The effective implementation of measures by the authorities averted a major environmental disaster."

It was the top foreign exchange earner, raking in billions of Thai baht. However, the haze and the economic downturn in the mid-nineties caused the industry to become sluggish. Nevertheless, the tourism market has yet to be fully tapped. Thailand has everything under the sun that appeals to tourists -- beautiful beaches, island resorts, cultural festivals and others. With proper strategies tourism can become a major money spinner for the nation.\nIn the first place, viable tourists venues have to be identified and tourism projects have to be implemented after careful and deliberate planning. Projects that are carried out on an ad hoc basis are not only impractical but large sums of money would have to be forked out.\n\nTravel agents must be creative and come up with new and interesting packages for tourists. Adopting the same old marketing strategies as in the past will be a forlorn attempt. Advertising by word of mouth or through brochures is simply not enough. Focus has to be shifted. The resounding success of the nation in hosting the Asian Games is proof enough that sports can be an important vehicle in promoting tourism. Realizing this the Government has designated 1999 and 2000 as the Sports and Recreation Years.\n\nTourism promotion missions to foreign countries will help to woo foreigners to visit Thailand. Such missions will enable tour and travel agents to sell their tour packages besides providing updates of the latest development in the tourism industry. Travel agents should also study the tastes and preferences of the international clientele and adapt their packages and programs to cater for them.\n\nThe Thai public should play its part in keeping the country clean while portraying a good image to tourists. The media should also play its part and come up with programs and articles to place Thailand on the world tourist map. With everyone working hand in hand, it will not be impossible for Thailand to once again emerge as the number one tourist destination in the Asia-Pacific region."

        "content": "Tropical rain forests are slowly disappearing from the earth. What is the importance of preserving the rain forests of the world ?\n \nTropical rain forests have some of the most exciting and diverse ecosystems in the world and are home to more than half of all plant, insect and animal species, many of which cannot be found elsewhere. However, many people do not realize the importance of rain forests to the earth. In the name of development, rain forests are slowly vanishing from the face of the earth.\nThe pristine rain forests play a central role in maintaining the water cycle and in controlling the climate. Almost half of the rain that falls in the rain forest is absorbed by trees through their roots and leaves and later released into the atmosphere during transpiration. If there are no trees, more surface water will find its way to the rivers and increase the chances of flooding. The clearing of forests will also lower the content of moisture in the atmosphere. There will be fewer clouds and less rainfall, which will, in turn, result in a longer dry season and a hotter climate. Rain forests are thus important to prevent climatic changes.\n\nRain forests help to maintain the oxygen level of the atmosphere and act like air filters. Trees take in carbon dioxide and release vital oxygen during photosynthesis. Polluted air is filtered when it passes through a rain forest as dust and other particles are retained by the leaves and branches. So, rain forests help provide fresh and clean air.\n\nTropical rain forests, with their diversity in flora, are also assets to humankind in other, unexpected ways. An estimated 10,500 species of plants are found here, and new species are still being discovered. Many of these plants have medicinal uses and tropical rain forests may hold the remedies for diseases previously thought incurable. The full potential of rain forests as suppliers of medicinal cures has not yet been exploited.\n\nOnce rain forests are cleared, it takes many years for them to regrow. For our sake as well as that of future generations, it is imperative that we preserve tropical rain forests as they regulate the world's water level and temperature, check the effects of air pollution and may even be important in the field of pharmacy."

        "content": "In your opinion, what are the threats facing wildlife today ?\n \nThe forests of the world, especially the rain forests, support a diverse population of wildlife -- both flora and fauna. They are nature's treasure house, teeming with different species of insects, birds, animals, a colorful array of wild flowers and lush, green plants. Today, many of these are in danger of dying out because of the actions of humans.\nIt is now estimated that more than 50 per cent of the world's rain forests have been cleared due to the population explosion, to keep up with the demand for houses. As more and more forests are earmarked for development, many species of wildlife are deprived of their natural habitat. When forests make way for concrete jungles, animals living there are forced to go to other areas where they are considered intruders and have to fight for territorial rights. When food is scarce, only the fittest survive. Removal of vegetation means that much of the jungle is lost forever. Many weaker species of animals will lose out.\n\nMany species of animals are now threatened with extinction because of hunting. Some are hunted for sport, some for food and others for parts which can be sold for high prices. Among the endangered animals are the elephant, which is hunted for its ivory tusks, and the rhinoceros, which is hunted for its horn. Crocodile and alligator skins are used to make expensive shoes and handbags. Seals and minks and wild members of the cat family are hunted for their beautiful coats. Humans have also encroached into the nesting grounds of turtles for their eggs, which are then sold. Hunting these animals or stealing their eggs reduces their number and sooner or later they will become extinct.\n\nPollution of the air and water also affects wildlife. When acid rain, caused by air pollution, falls over a forest, the forest dies. Acid rain and pesticides or oil slicks can cause serious damage to life in rivers, lakes and seas.\n\nHumans have conquered the world because of their supreme intelligence. They have cleared forests and jungles and poisoned water and air. Humans have upset the ecosystem and made sure that nature will never be quite the same again. The era in which man had to kill in order to survive is a bygone era. Now man has to learn to share the environment with other species on a more equitable basis."

Some may be subjected to unpleasant hints concerning their physique while others may have to bear the trauma of being compared unfavorably to their more talented siblings. Even as a child, I had to bear the brunt of insensitive remarks regarding my talents or rather the lack of them.\nThe problem is that I was born into a talented family. Dad can swing and sway to the rhythm or beat of any kind of music. His light feet and nimble movements can easily put young aspiring dancers to shame. He can waltz gracefully or do the tango and cha-cha with amazing agility. Mama is the one with the golden voice in the family. Even as she speaks, her words melt into music. It is not surprising, then, that such a talented couple be blessed with equally talented offspring, with me as the only exception. My sister, Sharon, is taking ballet lessons at an established ballet school and it is only a matter of time before she matures into a prima ballerina. Little Joey is currently taking up piano lessons and I am sure that he, too, will make the grade. Yes, if I could be granted a single wish, it would be none other than the wish to be recognized for the one talent I have and not to have to compete with my family when it comes to showmanship qualities.\n\nMy efforts at learning ballet or playing the piano came to nought. I remember the few ballet lessons I attended. It was real torture doing ridiculous contortions, and when others were prancing around daintily, I was like a clumsy elephant thumping up and down without grace. Of course, my attempts drew gales of laughter from the rest and I swore to stay away before I made myself look even sillier. My piano lessons came to an abrupt halt when I tried to live up to my motto that practice makes perfect. I sprained the index finger of my right hand and had to miss my entire mid-year exams.\n\nI had developed some kind of phobia. I simply detest going for receptions and gatherings for fear of being compared with the more talented members of my family. Exactly what went wrong, I do not know. Being the eldest and always excelling in my studies, I should be the role model to my two siblings. I admit to being a bookworm and the only thing I am good at is mugging. I had straight As for my O level examination and may be able to achieve the same feat in my A level examination. And yet, I feel that it is unfair that my achievements somehow are not recognized by my family or family friends who say it is a pity that I am not musically inclined.\n\nBeing labeled 'brainy' or 'studious' has made others happy. Why not me? Until I share the limelight with my siblings, until I stand on that pedestal alongside the rest of my family, I shall not rest. I will pursue the only thing I am good at and, hopefully make myself and my family proud of me."

Write about your feelings on this subject\n \nThe loafing syndrome has sparked off much debate and controversy among people from all walks of life lately. Many programs and suggestions have been made to combat the situation. However, loafing may not necessarily be a waste of time. It all depends on the way we look at it.\nLoafing should not be viewed negatively. Rather, it should be viewed as a desire to be with one's peers. Teenagers who loaf may appear to do nothing of importance but this is not true. Teenagers tend to become closer to their friends than their parents and siblings. When teenagers hang out with their friends, they are actually interacting with their peers. In short, they are just being normal teenagers.\n\nNo one can go through life working all the time. There are times when we must relax our bodies and minds. Teenagers do this by going out of the house and meeting with friends. Everyone loafs -- the difference is only in the venue. Teenagers may only be able to loaf at fast-food outlets and shopping malls; adults do it in exclusive clubs. Adults should not be hypocrites. They should own up that loafing is an activity that has been around since time immemorial.\n\nLoafing could also be an indicator that parents are unaware of the needs and pressures that teenagers have nowadays. Society is changing so rapidly that teenagers are faced with many new things non-existent in their parents' time. Simply brushing aside the onslaught of foreign cultural influences that teenagers of the 90s face with the words 'Its not part of our culture' is not enough. Parents need to understand their teenagers and keep up with the changing trends that affect their children. The problem might be solved if both parties stop blaming each other and instead work to bridge that gap.\n\nAs long as teenagers do not get involved in negative activities, loafing is a way of relaxation and a means of escape from the pressures of school work. Loafing need not be a vice or a sheer waste of time; it can be a recreational activity. Parents and teenagers need to work hand in hand so that loafing will not be a negative activity and instead be seen for what it is: an escape from the rat race."

Even the heavy fines and penalties aimed at hitting offenders hard do not seem to have had the desired effects.\nThe main cause of accidents is usually the drivers. Statistics substantiate this fact, with an estimated 90 per cent of road accidents caused by the inconsiderate attitude of drivers. Drunk driving, indiscriminate overtaking, not giving the appropriate signals, speeding and failure to adhere to the traffic rules are all manifestations of the inconsiderate attitude of drivers.\n\nIt is alarming to note that our roads and highways are constantly being turned into race tracks where drivers display their daredevil stunts. Whatever reasons drivers may have for speeding, it is unethical and shows selfishness, irresponsibility and arrogance. These drivers have no consideration for other road users or for traffic regulations. Statistics show that the highest number of accidents occurs during festive seasons, such as during the Hari Raya Puasa or Chinese New Year holidays, when there is an exodus of people from big cities like Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru to return to their hometowns. The mad rush to get home leads to a loss of precious lives. Accidents may also be caused by bad road conditions and other obstacles. Many of our roads are still single-lane roads which are badly lit at night.\n\nMalfunctioning traffic lights, road repairs, lack of warning notices at landslides, potholes and winding roads may also lead to traffic congestion and accidents. Roads which are not in good condition or without ample notices of road works or danger spots can thus also bring about accidents.\n\nAccusations and criticism have been hurled at Malaysian road users for various misdemeanors on the road. It is now up to the drivers themselves to discard their tarnished image and assume a new image as responsible, patient and considerate road users."

Inflation also occurs when there is too much money in circulation and the consumer's purchasing power increases. Only when demand and supply are balanced will there be no inflation. The task of reducing inflation lies not only with the government but is the responsibility of traders and consumers as well.\nThe government has taken some measures to curb inflation. Firstly, the setting up of huge cash and carry outlets has been encouraged. These outlets offer reasonably priced goods but do not allow customers to buy on credit, meaning that consumers can spend only money that they really have. In this way, consumers get their money's worth and do not overspend. One other measure taken by the government to control inflation is the introduction of the Zero Inflation Day sales. This campaign is commendable as consumers can buy at lower prices. More such steps should be introduced by the government to check inflation.\n\nTraders should heed the government's call to reduce prices. When prices are low, consumers will continue to frequent an outlet and the trader can make profits through an increased number of shoppers as word spreads. High prices cause demands for higher wages, and higher wages will, in turn, result in even higher prices. As such, the inflation rate will continue to rise. Traders can profit from fair pricing as it will earn them customer loyalty, attract more customers and help put an end to the inflationary spiral.\n\nConsumers should save their money and, when necessary, spend wisely. Commercial banks and licensed finance companies should provide attractive interest rates that will encourage more people to save. Consumers themselves should work out personal budgets and make an effort to cut down on unnecessary expenses. Lower savings by consumers also contribute to rising inflation and a change in spending habits by consumers can play a vital role in curbing inflation.\n\nThe struggle to lower the rate of inflation concerns all of us. Only when all the parties concerned-the government, traders and consumers-join forces, can inflation be reduced."

They are biodegradable, that is, they undergo decomposition and can be incorporated back into the environment.\n\nInorganic waste consists of discarded things made of plastic, glass, metal and other non-biodegradable material. These things are not environment-friendly and thus are not incorporated back into the environment. In fact they can pollute and harm the environment.\n\nThe basic thing about waste management is to separate the organic and inorganic waste and only allow only the organic parts to be put back into the environment. For example, some domestic organic waste like discarded vegetables and fruits can be converted into compost. The compost can be used as a fertilizer for growing plants.\n\nIn organic waste, being non-biodegradable, should not be dumped into the environment. Plastic, glass, metal and other man-made substances are preferable recycle and reused. Toxic waste has to be processed and rendered harmless. If this is not possible, then it has to be stored.\n\nIndiscriminate waste disposal can harm the environment. As the environment is the only one we have, harming the environment means harming ourselves. Let us keep it clean so that we do not live in filth. Let us live in harmony with our environment."

        "content": "Today the main source from which we derive energy is fossil oil. This is a non-renewable source and it will run out in the near future. We need to find alternative energy sources to power our world, and we have to begin now and not wait for the inevitable to happen.\nSome possible alternative sources of are : solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy, tidal energy, hydroelectric power, biofuels and nuclear energy.\n\nSolar energy is energy harnessed from the sun. Today it is commonly used for heating. It is also converted into electrical energy that is used for electrical devices. Wind power uses wind to drive generators for producing electricity. Geothermal energy is derived from heat produced by volcanic activity. This is usually used for heating and generation of electricity. Tidal power is also used for the generation of electricity.\n\nHydroelectric power plants are commonly used in may countries to generate electricity. This requires the building of large dams that can have a high impact on the eco-system.\n\nBiofuels include biodiesel made from vegetable oils. This is a cleaner alternative and there is a lot of increase in its use.\n\nNuclear power is used for the generation of electricity but its use is on a downward trend because of its potentially harmful nuclear waste and by-products.\n\nIn order to preserve our environment, clean renewable energy sources are preferred. Some of the alternative energy sources mentioned do fulfill this requirement. However more research and development are needed in order to make them viable energy sources for our future needs."

This condition has afflicted our country on many occasions and the effect has been most unpleasant and potentially dangerous.\n\nThe causes of the haze have been attributed mainly to forest fires and open burning in a neighboring country. The situation is further worsened by local open burning and vehicular emissions.\n\nSmoke particles and other pollutants in the air present several dangers to us. The first is the threat to our health, for example, an increased incidence of respiratory illnesses when the air-pollutant index (API) reaches dangerous levels. Persons with asthma and other breathing problems in particular have increased health risks. For the ordinary person, the smell of acrid smoke is most depressing. Secondly, visibility is reduced, sometimes to less than one kilometer. This increases the danger of traveling on the roads and also of airplanes taking off and landing.\n\nAll means must be employed to prevent any recurrence of haze in our country. Open burning must be stopped completely. Offenders should be punished with stiff fines and possibly a long prison term. For the people in the neighboring country, all help should be given to them to find alternative forms of occupation so that they desist from open burning. As it is now, many of them rely on the traditional slash-and-burn method of farming that contributes to the occurrence of haze. There is a need to reeducate them so that they stop all actions that hurt the environment."

For families involved in accidents, the festive season can turn out to be a tragedy instead of a joy.\n\nThe causes of accidents are many, but mainly they are due to human error. Recklessness, negligence, excessive speeding, poor driving skills, breaking of traffic rules and overloading contribute to the occurrence of accidents. Go to any housing estates and one can see underage children speeding around on motorcycles. They do not wear safety helmets and sometimes there are three or four of them on a motorcycle built for two. The law is blatantly ignored and the adults are to blame for allowing these young children to risks their lives. The behavior of adults is no better. Grown up but reckless road-users are aplenty on our roads. Road courtesy is almost non-existent.\n\nMechanical problems and road conditions can also cause accidents, for example, brake failure, tyre blowout, bad weather, potholes and traffic congestion.\n\nThe prevention of road accidents depends largely on the attitude of road users. They must respect the traffic laws such as keeping within speed limit, using safety helmets and belts and keeping their vehicles in roadworthy condition. They must also acquire and practice safe driving skills. In short, a change of attitude for the better is required of road users. As long as they persist with their present bad road habits, the incidence of road accidents can only worsen."

        "content": "Good morning ladies and gentlemen and students. I am here to present a talk on \"The hazards of smoking and some possible solutions\".\nRecent studies have shown the increasing health risk that smoking poses, not just to those who smoke but also to those around them. Smokers, as well as passive smokers, run a higher risk of contracting lung cancer and other diseases of the respiratory tract.\n\nBesides being a health hazard, it is an annoyance. The smoke of cigarettes causes eye irritation and cigarette ash may blow into your food at a restaurant. This is rather unpalatable !\n\nCigarette smoke pollutes the environment, contributing to photo-chemical smog. Also, the carbon dioxide content of the smoke increases temperatures, causing discomfort, especially in enclosed places.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, smoking is a fire hazard, especially in offices where there are a lot of books, papers, documents and other flammable material s well as in factories which manufacture or use highly-flammable products like petroleum paint. On a smaller scale, it is a nuisance when a cigarette butt accidentally burns a hole in your clothes.\n\nSmokers, either through ignorance or lack of consideration, often disregard the rights of non-smokers, blowing smoke in heir faces and littering the place with cigarette butts and ash.\n\nSmoking is now prohibited in public places, public transport and cinemas. However, in hospitals and government departments where smoking has been banned, some still smoke, showing a blatant disregard for rules and a lack of consideration for others.\n\nWith the ban on smoking, enforcement officers will now make their rounds and impose stiff fines on those caught breaking the law. Smoke detectors could be placed in public places where smoking is prohibited. The embarrassment of having triggered off the annoying 'Beep .. beep ..' sound of the detectors and the stares would be enough to deter any a potential smoker. Cigarette advertisements should be banned because they glamorize smoking and present a misleading image of all smokers as being young, healthy and higher-class, which is not always the case. It is also important to educate the public on the hazards of smoking and passive-smoking.\n\nNow that you have listened to the dangers of smoking to your health. ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will heed my call to \"STOP SMOKING\"."

Two words that have repeatedly appeared in the newspaper and mentioned over the news ever since the tragic death of toddler Bala Sundram -- an innocent victim of this beastly act.\n\nThis form of inexcusable violence does not occur among the poor and uneducated families only but also in families that have so-called high status in society. But more often than not, families that are socio-economically poor are the main abusers in this country.\n\nAlthough the main reason for this is lack of education, the pressures of city life also contributes to the rise in child abuse cases. Lack of education leads them to think that abuse is the only way to instill discipline in a child. Though this is very wrong, often, these abusers believe what they are doing is just. Sometimes, when parents have bitter disagreements, their anger is often projected towards the children.\n\nAmong the educated batch on the other hand, emotional abuse cases are more common. Here, the child is abused verbally with hurting remarks. The child might not have the physical scars as proof, but these internal scars remain for a lifetime.\n\nProblems in the family or among married couple cause a great deal of suffering to the adults and the children as well. Usually, disappointments in the lives of the adults cause extensive depression and anger. These people usually vent out their anger on their children who may not be really aware of what is going on.\n\nThe government is doing all that it can to curb child abuse and to create awareness among the educated and the uneducated alike. This public awareness is very important in the sense that it can let people know of their rights and what action to take in case they witness a child being abused. It also encourages people to report these incidents so that the abusers can be charged in the court of law.\n\nPunishment for abusers should serve as a stern warning and reminder not to repeat the offence. Within the period of punishment, therapy should be given to the abusers, for they too, need help. Apart from that, in-depth research should be conducted by doctors and psychologists to find ways to deal with this problem more effectively.\n\nWe must not let violence and cruelty become a way of life in our society. We have to stand up for our rights and for those who cannot do it for themselves."

There is war and conflict among nations. Industrialization and automation is gradually destroying man's ability to achieve happiness through appreciation of nature, art and literature. The younger generation are encouraged to study science and technology. I think our forefathers were more fortunate in their days.\n\nThe speaker for the opposition mentioned that our forefathers lived restricted lives. In the days' of our forefathers, traditions and customs helped to discipline and safeguard the morals of the young so that they would grow up as matured and responsible citizens. They had deep respect for their parents and elders and would not do anything that would reflect badly on their family. These days however, there is a decline in moral standards. What is the actual cause of this decline ? It is in my opinion that it is due to too much freedom. One good example is the \"Gay marriage\" problem.\n\nModern man lives a healthier life ? How can it be when the air we breathe is polluted and the food we eat is sprayed with insecticide ? Are these the signs of healthier times ?\n\nMy most honorable opponents may stress that great advances have been made in the field of medicine. Cures have been found for numerous diseases that were once deadly such as malaria. Yet, they forget that more and more strange, serious and fatal diseases are cropping up. Disease such as AIDS or the Ebola outbreak in Congo were unheard of in the days of our forefathers. Incurable diseases such as cancer and leukemia have claimed more lives recently than in the days of old.\n\nHow can we claim that life is more secure today when nations are fighting with one another ? How can life be happy when there are world powers testing nuclear weapons and there is constant fear of a nuclear war ?\n\nThe high rate of violence and crime today does not help to make life secure. Armed robbery, murder, kidnapping and other crimes go on every day of our lives. Child abuse which is often attributed to the pressures and stress-filled lives of people is on the rise. Success is measured by how big your pay packet is, what car you drive, how many houses you have, so on and so forth. Life is a big mad rush to achieve success, materialism and status, but at what price ? HAPPINESS.\n\nThe invention of sophisticated machines that are supposed to lighten our burden and save time and labor only results in unemployment and leaves us with more time to be bored and discontented with ourselves.\n\nLife today is more troubled and complicated that in our forefather's time. Therefore, it is certainly not happier but something worse."

The teacher will give some problems related to the topic to be done as practice at home. This supplements material that has been learned in school. Therefore, homework improves our understanding of schoolwork.\n\nHomework can also help us develop good habits and attitudes. It can teach us to work independently, manage time and meet deadlines. Homework can also foster positive character traits such as responsibility and independence. When we complete and hand in our homework, we get a sense of achievement.\n\nWhen we copy homework from our friends, we are actually cheating ourselves. Students who do their homework generally perform better academically than those who do not.\n\nIn addition, there are other benefits of homework. Students who conscientiously do their homework ultimately realize that learning can take place anywhere and is not confined to the four walls of a classroom. Besides, homework allows students to learn to use resources such as libraries, the Internet and other resources.\n\nFriends, if you just take the time to think about the many benefits of homework, you will definitely do your homework and reap its many benefits."

Almost all of us are farmers or fishermen who have been born and bred here. Most of us will probably remain here for the rest of our lives.\n\nDuring the past year, our patience has been tried to the limits. This is because of the existence of a new factory, recycling used rubber products, which was built not even one kilometer from our village. Since the factory began operating in January last year, the toxic fumes it emits have adversely affected the health of many villagers. Cases of asthma have increased dramatically, and many of us suffer from headaches, dizziness and nausea. We also have to bear with the unpleasant smell coming from the factory. To make matters worse, the factory has been dumping toxic waste into a nearby river. As a result, the river, which was at one time teeming with fish, is now a dead river. This has affected the fishermen's livelihood. we also fear that poisons may have seeped into the ground and are polluting our drinking water.\n\nIf this factory is allowed to pollute its surroundings unchecked, the whole area will be unfit for cultivation and we would have to move away, losing the land that has been in our families for generations and perhaps having to find some other kind of work.\n\nWe have repeatedly voiced our concerns to the authorities but our appeals have only been me with empty promises.

        "content": "Should people sell their organs or donate them ? Why ?\n \nThe centerpiece of the argument for those who advocate organ donation is that it is for a noble and worthy cause. Hence, monetary gains do not merit consideration. The second group insists that it is more important that critically-ill patients be relieved of their suffering and given a new lease of life, regardless of whether organs are donated or sold.\nPersonally, I am of the opinion that the sale of organs should be prohibited by law. Commercialization of organs would lead to abuse. If allowed, it will result in the poorer members of our society giving up their organs for more lucrative monetary returns. The dangers of such transactions are many. The donor may experience health complications. Besides, there are moral and ethical implications. It means the preservation of the rich patient's life at the expense of the poor man's life.\n\nWhile I am all for organ donation, I am of the opinion that organ donation should only be carried out with the prior approval of the donor and with the permission of his next-of-kin. Organ donation can give the seriously ill better chances of survival and should be encouraged. For example, patients who suffer from end-stage kidney failure may not be able to afford treatment such as renal dialysis. So the only practical solution here is to sanction an organ transplant, which will not only ease the suffering of the patient, but will also be cost-effective in the long run.\n\nOrgan donation helps to foster human virtues and moral values. Only a caring human being who has strong moral values such as selflessness can care enough for another person. They would be ideal to participate in organ donation programs. Organ donation is the ultimate and most sacred gift that a human being can bestow on his fellow man.\n\nOrgan donation should be advocated for the many benefits it brings. At the same time, the sale of organs should be banned for moral, ethical and religious reasons."

Our country was, in fact, a fine example to the world on how racial and religious tolerance should be. However, of late, there have been some disturbing developments that threaten our unity in diversity. The time has come to find ways and means to strengthen relations between the various races and prepare ourselves to face the multiple challenges as our nations progresses.\nRacial unity should begin at home. Since parents are closest to their children, they should be at the forefront and sow the seeds of racial and religious tolerance among children. Parents should encourage their children to mix freely with their peers of other races and religions. This will allow children to understand the different traditions and cultures and be tolerant of those from other faiths and beliefs. Once parents are able to instill values of racial and religious tolerance among their children, it will take off naturally.\n\nSchools are the best places for students of different races to mingle freely without prejudice and suspicion. Students should learn about the different festivals their friends celebrate, their rites and rituals and their places of worship. It is only when they understand how others live will they also know how to treat them with respect and understanding. There are numerous activities in schools that provide opportunities for children to integrate such as sports and competitions.\n\nThe various festivals celebrated by the different races are excellent opportunities to sow the seeds of unity. The concept of open houses is a unique feature that augments unity. The intermingling of the various races will contribute towards enhancing national unity.\n\nDespite more than 7 decades of independence, the country is still grappling with issues concerning race relationships. we must remember that these decades of nation-building can be erased if we allow racial tensions to build.

He is a well rounded student who can balance his study time with other social activities.\n\nA good student is self-motivated. He always stays focused in his studies. A good student always sets goals, and the goals he sets must be realistic. Once goals are set, the student must work towards achieving these goals. Pay attention once you are in class. One way of doing this is to sit in front of the class. Sitting in front of the class will help to reduce distractions and help you to focus on the lesson. Ask questions and take an active part in the lesson. Becoming involved in the lesson will not only enable you to understand the lesson better, it will also prevent you from getting distracted.\n\nBeing organized enables a student to execute his work in a systematic manner. it will also enable him to have better time management. A student who is organized manages to get things done on time. Homework is given for a purpose. Homework reinforces what has been taught in class. Therefore, student should complete homework on time. Do not procrastinate. Procrastination is the thief of time. Constant study and revision will enable you to be well-prepared for exams. Then, scoring in examinations will be a breeze. Take part in co-curricular activities and always obey school rules. Time management is important . If you do not plan and manage your time well, you will be wasting precious time without realizing it. Do not skip classes. If you have to do some other duties, then wait until the lesson is over. Alternatively, you can attend to these duties after school hours.\n\nOnly students who are disciplined, diligent and persevering can be successful.

In fact, for many of us, cleaning seems like a mammoth task that is both time-consuming and tiring. However, if it is done on a regular basis, then it will not be overwhelming. it will also reduce the all-day marathon cleaning sessions.\n\nThere are a number of things you can do to keep your class and surroundings clean. Have a schedule for all cleaning activities. Assign duties for everyone in the class. Go the extra mile to keep your school clean. Pick up rubbish lying on the ground whether you are on the field, eating at the cafeteria or climbing up the stairs. If everyone does this on a regular basis, then the whole school will always be litter-free. Clear rubbish bins when they are full. Do not wait until there are telltale signs like overflowing bins and a stale odor. Moreover, wipe window panes, fans and other areas where dust can accumulate.\n\nAt the same time, use the rubbish bins that are provided and do not litter. Besides that, do not vandalize walls and school property. Most importantly, have a positive attitude and do not be lazy.\n\nYour school can be a sanctuary or a place of stress depending on how you clean and maintain it. If you keep doing these things on a regular basis, they will eventually become second nature to you.\n\nWith that I have come to the end f my speech.\n\nThank you"

        "content": "You have been asked to give a speech on study techniques.\n \nGood morning friends,\nI thank the school for giving me the opportunity to give a speech regarding study techniques.\n\nFriends, with exams around the corner, we find that we just have too much to study and there is not enough time. Do not worry. You are not alone. The best thing to do is to use correct study methods.\n\nStudying for exams entails memorizing large amounts of factual information. Unfortunately, much of the information that we study is presented as words on pages. Often, most students choose study methods such as making short notes to remember key information, repeating or verbalizing the information studied and using memory tools to help retain the information.\n\nMemorizing a vast amount of information can be overwhelming and that is why students should resort to memory tools such as \"mnemonics\" to encode difficult-to-remember information in a way that is much easier. Making notes is another memory tool. Memory tools not only help to reduce the time required to memorize facts, they also help students to retain the information for a longer time.\n\nStudy methods vary for each one of us. What works for a particular student may not work for another. However, there are some study methods that can work for most of us. It is up to each  one of us to determine for ourselves the study methods that work best for us.\n\nWith that I have come to the end of my speech.\n\nThank you for your kind attention."

He scored straight As in his O level and A level exams. It was at this time that his father became terminally ill. Being the eldest, he had to shoulder the responsibilities of looking after his mother and siblings. James took on  apart-time job as a cashier in a mini-market. He had to juggle his time between school, work and studies. Life was definitely not a bed of roses. However, he did not give up. Through his diligence, he was able to repeat his feat. He scored straight As in his ACC and emerged the best student in the school.\n\nJames has now been offered a federal scholarship to study medicine at a local university.

It has come to our knowledge that a large consortium intends to build a theme park on a piece of prime land in the vicinity of our housing estate. If the talk of the town is anything to go by, negotiations are well under way and it is only a matter of time before the authorities give the green light to build the theme park.\n\nOur area has been gazetted as a residential area and is therefore not a suitable place for the theme park. If allowed, it will spoil the unique beauty of the neighborhood. One may argue that the theme park will boost trade, create more jobs for the locals and lead to the value of our properties to appreciate. But look at the converse side of the coin. The constant movement of vehicles in and out of the housing estate will cause noise pollution and traffic congestion. When our roads become congested, it will no longer be safe for our children to play at roadsides. Moreover, it will encourage truancy and loafing among school going children.\n\nThe authorities should gallantly admit their shortcomings and shelve their plans without any further delay. If they do not, it will only sully their image and paint them as inept bureaucrats. At the same time, business organizations, in their pursuit towards making profits should not brush aside their responsibilities to society.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours sincerely,"

On behalf of the villagers, write a letter of complaint to the local press, urging the authorities to look into the matter and take appropriate action.\n \nThe Editor,\n\nToday News,\n\nMay 11, 2013\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPollution Caused by Factory\n\nI write on behalf of the residents of Moonway village.\n\nOur village has a population of about 1900 people. Almost all of us are farmers and fishermen who have been born and bred here. Most of us will probably remain here for the rest of our lives.\n\nWe have always been a patient lot but during the past year, out patience has been tried to the limits. This is because of the existence of a new factory recycling used rubber products which was built not even one kilometer from our village. Since the factory began operating in March last year, the toxic fumes it emits have adversely affected the health of many villagers. Cases of asthma have increased dramatically and many of us suffer from headaches, dizziness and nausea. We also have to bear with an unpleasant smell coming from the factory. To make maters worse, the factory has been dumping toxic waste into a nearby river. As a result, the river, which was, at one time, teeming with fish, is now a dead river, and this has affected those who used to make a living fishing in the river. We also fear that poisons may have seeped into the ground and are polluting our drinking water. Furthermore, we fear that if this factory is allowed to pollute its surroundings unchecked, the whole are will be unfit for cultivation and we would have to move away, losing the land that has been in our families for generations and perhaps having to find some other kind of work. This will be a disaster which we are trying to prevent form coming true.\n\nWe have, in the past, repeatedly voiced our concern to the authorities but our appeals have only been met with empty promises. We have had to put up with this for more than a year. Enough is enough. It is inhumane for anyone to expect us to sit and wait patiently while our health and livelihood are at stake. It is time the authorities stop being indifferent and live up to their 'clean, efficient and responsible' image. We hope that by highlighting the matter in the local press, the authorities will change their attitude and relocate the factory to a more suitable site.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours sincerely,"

Resident of about 300 houses in Silver Garden are upset over the frequent floods which have been occurring ever since we moved into the housing scheme more than four years ago.\n\nThe floods would occur each time there is a heavy downpour. Waters would then rise up to 0.8m high. When this happens, traffic jams and people being stranded would be the order of the day. Traffic would grind to a standstill. Each time the flood waters recede, residents are faced with the arduous task of cleaning their houses and compounds as they are covered with mud. The mud is washed down from construction sites of housing estates near by. The roads will be covered with mud which also blocks the drains.\n\nExtensive development in the surrounding areas of our housing estate is the main cause of flooding. The mud is washed down from nearby construction sites. The problem occurs because developers, in their greed to save coasts, did not build perimeter drains as required when they started earthworks. the flood problems are further aggravated because people are in the habit of throwing rubbish into drains.\n\nThe residents get worried whenever it rains. we have been caught off guard each time and many of us are not able to salvage our household items. How long do we have to put up with this ? We have lodged numerous complaints with the local authorities in the past. It is time the local authorities looked into the flood woes of the residents and take immediate remedial action. Authorities must ensure that developers comply with requirements such as building perimeter drains to divert water. The authorities should also deepen the nearby monsoon drains to provide better drainage. We also want the authorities to urge developers of nearby development projects to take protective measures such as the installation of silt-traps to control surface run-offs.\n\nWe hope the authorities will take prompt action to alleviate the problems of residents.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours sincerely,"

We are going to have burgers !\" Three-year-old William turned to me and gave his trademark angelic smile. I looked down at the cherubic toddler and smiled, gazing at him fondly. My aunt had allowed me to take my cousin for lunch at the fast food restaurant near their house. Both of us were very excited about this mini 'excursion'.\nThe little boy skipped, hopped and sang along the way, being the active boy that he was. As we reached a slip road, William's excitement got the better of him when he saw the striped hump. The compulsion to hop on it overwhelmed his entire being. Unthinkingly, he gave a hard tug, freeing his hand from my grip. Then, he bolted towards the hump before I could react.\n\n\"Come back, William ! Be careful !\" I called out, at the same time, hastening to pull him to safety. My heart skipped a beat when my worst fear came true -- a mini school bus had appeared, turning out of the car park ! I froze for a moment before my eyes returned to my cousin who was still hopping over the hump delightedly. \"William !\" I screamed shrilly.\n\nI next heard the braking of wheels and the bus coming to a screeching halt. Then came a soft thump. My heart sank. The bus had knocked William down !\n\nI dashed towards William who had fallen from the impact. He looked at me in shock before bursting into tears from the trauma. The driver scrambled down from the bus immediately. All his young passengers gathered at the front of the bus, curiously peering from the windscreen.\n\n\"Is he alright ?\" the driver asked anxiously, his heart palpitating with fear. I was hugging William tightly and I almost did not hear him, being lost in my own sobs. My mind was a frenzied blur. My aunt had trusted me enough to allow me to take William out, yet this had to happen ! I felt myself surrounded by people who have been attracted by the commotion. Fortunately, some Samaritans stepped forward to help. Upon a closer examination, it turned out that William did not suffer visible injuries form the light impact as the bus had been traveling at a slow speed.\n\nI called my aunt and she rushed William to the hospital. After scans were done, it turned out that William was indeed well, saved for a few scratches and bruises. What a relief for my aunt and especially for me, to know that William had come away from this accident almost unscathed !"

We must get help,\" Ethan's frantic voice was choked with emotions. \"Rest here. Don't you go to sleep !\" he instructed before hobbling to the side of the road.\n\nMy gaze followed my brother's limping gait and I recalled what had happened. Both of us were on a self-drive holiday in Sweden, traveling along the snow-covered road when I caught sight of an antelope emerging from the side. I cried out to Ethan but it was apparently too late.\n\nEthan stepped on the brake immediately but the ground was too slippery. As the car skidded towards the creature, Ethan served the vehicle to avoid hitting it. While the antelope scampered to safety, the vehicle crashed into a looming fir tree that sent its canopy of snow crashing down upon the car roof ...\n\nI turned my attention back to my surroundings. I was covered with snow. The red bonnet was a twisted wreck. The whole scene was like a dream gone horribly wrong.\n\n\"Here ! Here !\" I heard Ethan's approaching voice. I turned my head slowly and saw my brother directing two burly men towards me.\n\n\"Hey, mister ! Hang on there ! Help is on the way,\" one of the men assured me while his partner hurried to my side of the door to open it.\n\nI smiled feebly at the kind Samaritans as I closed my eyes to rest from the ordeal.

Grandmother simply shot her a curt glance and shook her head in disapproval before taking my hand and leading me out of the flat.

We were so preoccupied with her grouses that we did not notice a man trailing us.\n\nAs soon as we had entered the lift, he bolted in when the door was about to close. Wasting no time, he whipped out a Swiss Army knife and brandished the razor-sharp tip threateningly close to our faces. \"hand over everything now !\" he growled.\n\nTerror-stricken, we were too stunned to scream or retaliate. With trembling fingers, Grandmother slipped the jewellery pieces off her wrists and fingers. \"The necklaces and earrings !\" he demanded with a snarl.

The news was accompanied by the fraudster's profile photograph. Our hearts sank the moment we saw the face.

Both Thomas and I simply smiled in acknowledgement. \"You are such loving children !\" he smiled and gave us a big bear hug that had us squealing in delight.\n\nSeeing how blissful our parents were with our act of love, Thomas and I realized that expressions of love towards people whom we cherish were not that difficult after all. In our hearts that day, we knew that we would endeavor to do something special for our parents every single year !"

With the pincers, we picked up the pretty pieces of fondant delicately and placed them on the tantalizing, golden-brown cupcakes.\n\nAbsorbed in the task at hand, a shrill cry of terror broke our momentum, \"Fire ! Fire ! The factory is on fire !\"\n\nThe sudden commotion caused us to stop whatever we were doing. Without saying a word, we made a grab for the keys and rushed towards the gate. Just then, a loud explosion reverberated in the near distance, startling everyone. I cupped my ears instinctively and shut my eyes, but the muffled screams and shouts remained clear.\n\nWe darted out to the corridor and looked out. Black clouds of smoke were billowing from the windows of the factory one street away. There were shattered fragments of glass from the broken windows and the white walls were charred by the blaze. Endless clouds of grey smog rose into the sky. Many people were milling around, overwhelmed by a mix of fear and curiosity.\n\nAs the distant wailings of the siren came nearer, there were hushed whispers and sighs of relief. The firefighters wasted no time as they sprang into prompt action, drawing out the long hoses and directing powerful jets of water at the flames.\n\nBy the time the fire was extinguished, all that remained of the factory were the remains of charred concrete. Fortunately, no lives were lost. We watched the news in the evening for a report on the fire. I was sure the rest of the residents did too. We simply had to know how the fire started, given that it had happened right before our eyes."

Acrid smoke hung heavily in the air as ashes swirled up each time the breeze blew. It was the first day of the annual Chinese Hungry Ghosts Festival.\n\nScattered groups of residents gathered at various spots and offered their sacrifices to the decreased in the form of food and burnt items. However, my family and I were turning in for the night instead. Just when we had drifted off to sleep, we were rudely awakened by a commotion. Intrigued and baffled, I dragged myself to the window and peered out.\n\nI was alarmed to see a fire in the car park ! I dashed out to the living room where my equally-aghast family was staring at the blaze. \"Fire ! Fire !\" The shouts roused those already asleep and light could be seen flicking on one by one from the otherwise pitch-dark apartments.\n\nA team of gallant residents had begun to do their part by splashing pail upon pail of water in a hopeful bid to quell the fire but the persistent fire blazed on. Just like the other residents, we could only watch in helpless despair, praying fervently for the swift arrival of the fire brigade. Soon, the shrill sirens of the fire engines filled the neighborhood and the firefighters sprang into action even before the vehicle came to a complete halt. We continued to watch in trepidation until the fire was completely put out.\n\nLater, we found out that the man who discovered the fire was a foreign worker. Through a translator, he shared that he was moonlighting as a car washer. He was on his nightly around of cleaning the cars of the residents when his attention was arrested by the trail of blaze along the road. He began to shout for help as he rushed over to the blaze. Instinctively, he poured his pail of soiled soap water on it. However, it was too little to be of any help. Panic-stricken, he shouted for help.\n\nA few days later, a notice was put up on the noticeboard where the residents were notified of the cause of the fire. The fire was caused by a trail of petrol from a car that had a leaking petrol tank ! It was highly probable that a stray piece of glowing joss paper had landed onto the trail of petrol. Since then, the enlightened residents needed no reminders from the Town Council to use the joss paper bins for their annual ritual !"

Shall we have a game of basketball later ?\" I squirmed and turned away as the odor of his breath reached me.\n\"Sure,\" I gave an awkward smile. \"You want a mint ?\" I offered as I fumbled for the breath freshener in my bag.\n\nRick was taken by surprise and there was a moment of stunned silence. \"Erm, thank you,\" he mumbled as I dropped one onto his outstretched palm.\n\nAs we headed towards the parade square, I could not contain the question in me any more. \"have you been smoking ?\" Rick did not reply me. Instead, his eyes were downcast as we continued our way. I persisted, \"I've noticed the whiff of cigarette stench for the past few weeks. You've picked up smoking ? From whom ?\"\n\nRick halted in his tracks and with a steady gaze, he looked at me solemnly. \"I've been having family problems and it is a challenge to cope with my studies at the same time. I confided in my elder cousin and he told me that smoking relieves stress. I tried and it works, so ...\"\n\nI recoiled at the absurdity of the advice given by his cousin. How could someone older be so foolish ? How could he introduce a vile habit to his young cousin ? Indignation surged in me and I retorted vehemently, \"What nonsense ! There are many healthy ways to relieve stress, and smoking is definitely not one of them !\"\n\nMy infuriated outburst shocked Rick, who stared at me in bewilderment. \"Why are you so upset ?\" he queried.\n\nSuppressing my vexation, I tried to answer as calmly as I could. However, I detected a tremor in my voice as I said, \"You are my good friend and I will help you in whatever way I can. I definitely do not agree with this ridiculous suggestion. Smoking will not help you solve your problems. Let's look for Mrs Yew after wards. I'm sure she can offer you wise counsel.\"\n\nRick pondered for a while, hesitant as he was uncertain of the consequences he would face when his smoking habit was revealed. i waited for his response with masked impatience. Taking a deep breath, he finally answered, \"Alright.\"\n\nI patted him on his shoulder and smiled reassuringly, \"Everything will turn out fine, because you've made the right decision.\"\n\nWith much relief, Mrs Yew, our sympathetic form teacher, understood Rick's predicament. she explained that the main concern was to give Rick the necessary support to cope with both his school work and family problems during this crisis. however, he must kick his smoking habit.

I would be taking the Mathematics test in the first period. As the cool breeze caressed my face gently, I stopped reciting for a while to enjoy the pleasant morning breeze. That was when I caught sight of my best friend, Thomas, casting furtive glances at the school from the main gate.\nI halted in my tracks and continued observing my friend. Hastily, my friend turned away from the school building and scurried towards the bridge. \"Thomas!\" I hollered. Startled, Thomas stopped in his tracks. I ran towards him. When he turned around and saw me, the look of apprehension on his face dissipated. \"Where are you going ?\" I queried.\n\n\"I ... I'm ... I'm not feeling ... erm ... well,\" Thomas blushed and looked away, avoiding any eye contact with me.\n\nHis evasive response aroused my suspicion and I continued to probe. \"You haven't answered my question, Thomas,\" I said with deliberate slowness.\n\n\"I ... erm ... I think I'm going home,\" came Thomas' half-hearted reply.\n\nUnconvinced, I urged, \"Come on, Thomas. Tell me the truth.\"\n\nThomas kept quiet for a moment before blurting out, \"I haven't studied for the test. I'm thinking of skipping school.\"\n\nI paused for a while, wondering what advice I should give him. Finally, I suggested, \"Let's look for Miss Lee. See if she is willing to postpone the test for you. Don't be a coward by running away.\" Without waiting for Thomas' reply, I put my arm around his shoulders and led him into the school.\n\nAs we approached Miss Lee at her desk in the staffroom, she greeted us with a friendly smile. Encouraged by her approachability, I nudged Thomas, who stepped forward with nervous reluctance and uncertainty.\n\nMuch to our relief, Miss Lee listened with patience and nodded her head in understanding. When Thomas stopped, Miss Lee spoke up, \"Thank you for being honest with me, Thomas. And I'm very glad that you've listened to Jonathan instead of playing truant. I will postpone the test for you. While your friends are doing the test, you will study the topic so that you can take the test after school. However, I'd like to have your word that this will be the first, and the last time.\"\n\nHeaving a big sigh of relief, Thomas answered with a resolute nod, \"Yes, Miss Lee ! Thank you, Miss Lee !\" Then he turned to me with a grateful smile and said, \"Thank you, Jonathan.\""

I was greeted by the sight of two aggressive youths confronting a foreign worker who was seated.\n\n\"What's your problem ?\" one of the youths demanded irritably.\n\n\"What did I do ?\" the foreign worker asked.\n\nAn evident hush had descended by then as everybody's eyes were fixated on the drama that was unfolding. \"Why did you knock into my girlfriend ?\" the youth demanded as he glowered at the clueless man. the man gave a blank stare as he could not comprehend the question with his limited command of the English language.\n\nOut of the blue came a shrill voice, \"Beat him up !\" It was then that I noticed a girl standing at the side. From their behavior and appearance, there was no doubt that the trio were troublemakers. Without warning, the two aggressors began to rain kicks and punches upon the hapless foreigner who was cowering in fear as he tried to protect himself from the relentless blows. The stunned crowd watched in silence as the injured man coughed out some blood.\n\nWhat was even more appalling was the apathy of most of the bystanders -- they were watching with great interest but none stood forward to help. In the meantime, the girl was egging the attackers on as she waved her umbrella, shrieking, \"Give it to him ! Give it to him !\"\n\nThere was no doubt that many feared being the next victim should they decide to intervene. Choosing to do the most sensible thing, I moved to a corner and called the police. It was then that two middle-aged men stepped in to try to stop the ruffians. The aggressive youths hit out at the men while the men tried to block the blows without hitting back. It seemed like the men wanted to avoid hurting the youths. I was with much relief that the police arrived soon after. While it was gallantry on the part of the two men, the indifference of the bystanders was disturbing and certainly an issue of societal concern."

Madeline and I were at the bus stop, discussing at length about the reviews of the movie that we were going to watch. At the sight of the bus in the distance, Madeline and I jumped up from our seats immediately. Our attention was also drawn to a foreign worker who was peddling rather laboriously on his rickety bicycle. \"He must be very tired,\" I thought to myself with a tinge of sympathy.\n\nThe foreign worker turned around and saw the oncoming bus. In a moment of poor judgement, he took an abrupt swerve nearer to the kerb. The front tyre hit the roadside and the poor man toppled onto the rough ground with a loud cry. Time seemed to stand still as everyone stared for a moment. It was the sight of him grimacing in pain as he clutched his elbow that woke us to our senses. Immediately, Madeline and I rushed over to him with a few other passers-by.\n\nIn the meantime, the composed bus driver navigated the big vehicle carefully away from the injured worker and made a stop at the bus stop. The driver hurried down to have a look at him too. In the midst of the commotion, I happened to look up to see many passengers peering from the bus.\n\nThe man's gaunt face was contorted in a tight grimace as he gripped his elbow tightly. We saw there was a rather deep cut in his elbow. Crimson blood kept oozing out, dripping onto the ground. The bloody sight prompted me to fumble for my tissue paper. I dabbed at his wound gently in a vain attempt to stem the blood flow. He squirmed at each touch. \"This can't go on,\" someone remarked, \"we need to get a doctor to attend to him. I'll send him to the nearby clinic.\"\n\nAll of us made way for the kind Samaritan who came forward to help the foreign worker to his car. Another middle-aged man lifted the bicycle and carried it to the boot of the car. Together with everybody else, Madeline and I simply stood there and watched as the car drove off.\n\nThough I felt sorry for this foreign worker, I was heartened to know that a solitary foreigner had experienced unconditional kindness in his moment of need in my homeland."

Write about the advantages of working from the home.\n\n \nWorking from the home has become a popular option for many people especially women. With the advance in computer technology, it is possible to do work at home and still keep in contact with the business world. Like everything else, there are advantages and disadvantages. I feel that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.\nOne of the obvious advantages is that one is released from the hassles of traveling to work. You do not have to struggle with traffic jams morning and evening going to and from work. You can clock in at 9.00 a.m. and clock out at 5.00 p.m. just like your ex-colleagues but within the comforts of home. Hand in hand with this you can sleep in a little longer and have a leisurely breakfast. What more can one ask for ?\n\nWhile working at home, we can take care of the family's needs. You are your own master and so you are allowed to plan a schedule with structured breaks. After you have finished a task, you will need to move around to get your blood pimping a little harder. Therefore, do the laundry or even water the plants. Get into a routine and you can give yourself a pat on the back for efficiency. Some mothers prefer to work from home because they can look after their children at the same time.\n\nWorking from home can be isolating and there is the danger of losing touch with friends. this may sound disadvantageous but with careful scheduling, you can still keep up with friends. Make lunch dates with them but accommodate their needs. With a laptop and a mobile phone, you can break the isolation by going to the park or a cafe to work.\n\nWhen you work at home there is the temptation of taking more breaks than you would in the office. the bedroom is just a staircase away and the TV is just a click away. the house looks slightly messy and you decide to do a bit of clearing up here and there. Soon, you have spent two hours doing housework rather than the work at hand. This is one disadvantage of working at home. Distraction can cost you some productivity.\n\nIf you set the proper boundaries, working at home is a breeze and you will wonder why you did not do it earlier. You have your work and friends and your hoe  is in your good hands."

We had to be there at five in the evening for some telematches and beach games before the barbecue. I had expected something more exciting. However, it would be great to see all the friends again.\n\nWhen I arrived I was glad to see all the friends gathered there. The barbecue pits were all prepared and the beach was decorated and the apparatus for the telematches and beach games were laid out. We had a drink and some sandwiches. Then, we had a match of beach volleyball. I lost the game and so decided to do some cave exploring with a friend, Frankie.\n\nThe cave was dark and gloomy and a small stream ran through it. The air was damp and musty. Our torches cast a strange light around. There were pillars and stalactites and stalagmites all over the caves. We looked carefully and saw a big empty space in the cave. Frankie shouted out to me and I called back to him. The echoes went back and forth. It was eerie but fun. We created shadow figures of people and animals with our hands.\n\nAll of a sudden, more and more shadows appeared -- some long and some short. Those were not our shadows ! We turned around and almost fainted with fright. The other boys had rushed into the cave when it started to rain. A few held torches in front o their faces and they looked ghostly. Someone built a fire and tow boys started strumming their guitars. The more energetic ones started a Red Indian dance.\n\nThen, it happened. A series of screeches started from somewhere further in the cave. The sound came nearer and nearer. As one, we turned and ran out as fast as we could. we stood and watched in awe as thousands of bats rushed out of the cave and flew away to the horizon. We sighed with relief that it was not something else. We finished the barbecue in a subdued manner and went home.\n\nIt was a strange party ! My wish for something more exciting fulfilled ?"

Use the notes given below to write your essay.\n\n \nReading makes it possible for one to speak intellectually or write well. One will be at a disadvantage anywhere he finds himself if eh has not read widely enough. Most school children read their textbooks only. Knowing there is a wealth of knowledge not found in textbooks alone, a few of the more diligent ones may read other books pertaining to the subjects they are studying.\nKnowledge is infinite and today, knowledge is increasing at such a rate that if we are ignorant of it now, we will be left behind. We will suffer from 'Future Shock' as suggested by Alvin Toffler. One of the best ways to acquire knowledge is through varied and wide reading whether it is from the Internet or print materials. What we gained from reading is an asset that cannot be taken away. One becomes richer in ways that cannot be explained.\n\nReading widely enhances our outlook on life. It gives us an insight into people's lives in other parts of our own country and foreign lands. Reading makes one capable of understanding the social, economic and political happenings in the world. When we read about the illiterate and starving people in many parts of the world, we learn to be content with what we have.\n\nBiographies of great men help us understand what they are made of. We learn about how they lived, how they dealt with situations within or beyond their control and their character in general. The contributions they have made to the world may inspire us to live our lives differently. we may even be able to draw parallels between their lives and ours and learn from their experiences.\n\nJust as we need a balanced diet, so also do we need a balanced reading habit. Concentrating on science fiction alone is like eating one type of food for every meal. This can cause malnutrition. That can be the trouble with our reading habit, if we have any. Read fiction and non-fiction on as many different subjects as possible to enhance our general knowledge and help develop our character and personality. We are able to converse interestingly with all sorts of people from all walks of life. We are able to move around with confidence as knowledge is power.\n\nReading chastens the mind. Reading offers infinite relaxation tot eh mind. Reading enhances the mind. We are what we read."

        "content": "The class has been asked to write on the effects of education on man. You feel that man's education has to a certain extent alienated him from his people.\n\n \nEducation is not merely the bookish education and the acquiring of diplomas and degrees. It is also the training of man's faculties to draw out the best from him and to make him a better person.\nEducation must result in an all-round personality which means physically, mentally, intellectually, morally and spiritually he is developed. By normal standards he is considered good, humble, ready to help and able to look after himself and  others. He makes good use of what he has learned to improve the world around him and beyond.\n\nBut, what is the scenario today ? The so-called educated man class has formed a class of their own and isolated themselves from the general public. They adopt a snobbish attitude and form exclusive clubs in which the ordinary man in the street has no place. They might even quote from the books to justify their actions.\n\nThe fruits of this education do not propagate more fruits because they are not filtered down to the lower level. Even within his family, the educated man shows snobbery. The college-educated son begins to look down on his parents and their way of life. He forgets that it is this way of life that helped finance his studies. He has adopted new ways from staying in a hostel and now cannot tolerate the conditions at home. These are considered common and low class unlike the conditions he had tasted in hostels. Thus he alienates himself in his own home and familiar surroundings.\n\nMan does not only become snobbish, he also becomes a walking zombie. He only sees and appreciates materialism and will use all sorts of tactics including breaking he law to get what he wants. What he wants is wealth, materialistic wealth not emotional wealth. He is immune to what others feel or say about him as he feels that as long as he has money, he is on top of the world.\n\nThe responsibility for such a development falls on the education system and the educated. Most of the time, the education system prepares a person for a job rather than for society. Society changes with time but the education system does not. The school environment is so examination-oriented and the students and educators alike are more concerned with the number of distinctions they should score rather than making them mature and adaptable to society.\n\nTo reverse the situation and make the educated man show and value his education, he should turn back to his family and relearn the value of family love and traditions. He can learn the value of humility and charity as there is a lot of give and take within a family. Reading literature through poetry, novels and drama will imbibe a person with humane qualities. He will learn to be more sociable and approachable.\n\nIf the educated man is not able to act as a man then he is lost to the world. It is possible for education to alienate man from his people."

In the midst of the chatter, Aaron's agitated voice rang out, \"Where is my game set ?\" His outburst caught the whole class by surprise and there was a complete silence. \"Where is my game set ?\" he repeated. His face was flushed and tiny drops of perspiration gathered at his forehead. He searched his bag again frantically.\n\"Have you searched your bag thoroughly ?\" I asked as I strode over to his table. A few of our classmates had gathered around him by then while the rest made a beeline for the canteen.\n\nWithout answering, Aaron heaved his bag from the floor and poured the entire contents onto the table. His files and books slid out from the main compartment. Unzipping the small pockets, he shook the bag frantically and items like keys and tissue paper dropped onto the floor. Dissatisfied, Aaron turned his bag inside out and he stared in dismay at the empty bag. \"I've lost my game set,\" he whimpered as the realization dawned upon him. Tears were brimming in his eyes and his lips quivered.\n\nWe stared at him awkwardly, at a loss for words of comfort. Finally, Rayne spoke up, \"Let's get Mr Ozil back.\" Everyone but Aaron nodded in agreement.\n\n\"But I'm not supposed to bring the game set to school to begin with,\" Aaron responded tearfully. \"Will he help me ?\"\n\n\"Well, we'll never know. You can't get your game set back if you don't have a teacher's help, right \" I answered as I turned to the door.\n\n\"Wait !Aaron, is this yours ?\" Edward rushed over with a black game set in his outstretched hand. \"It was on the floor.\" Then, with his eyes downcast, he added softly, \"I think you've dropped it this morning.\"\n\nThe sudden turn of events astonished us. While Aaron cried out his thanks gratefully, some of us, including I, simply kept quiet. I narrowed my eyes at Edward who was averting eye contact with everybody. At this point, Mr Ozil entered the classroom. Aaron froze upon seeing Mr Ozil, and Edward was noticeably unsettled.\n\nAfter we had recounted the whole incident, Mr Ozil told the rest of us to leave the classroom, except for Aaron and Edward. Mr Ozil must have known what Edward really did, because when lessons started after recess, Edward looked very down. when Mr Ozil deliberately delivered a lesson on honesty, our suspicions were confirmed. It was no wonder Edward was practically squirming in his seat throughout the lesson. That was certainly a lesson Edward would never forget and neither would we."

I'll leave them on your study table when I am done.\"\n\nI was overjoyed with gratitude. \"Thank you !\" I squealed. With the weight on my shoulder lifted, I drifted off to sleep once my head hit the pillow. Knowing that my brother would not fail me, I did not check through the work at all. When the teachers asked us to hand in our work the next day, I handed it in with smug confidence.\n\nHowever, just when the school day was about to end, I was summoned to the staffroom to see Mr Mackay, my form teacher. My heartbeat quickened. Mr Mackay was seated at his table with my assignment on it. My brother's small and neat handwriting was a stark contrast to my big and cursive scrawl.\n\n\"Is this your handwriting ?\" Mr Mackay asked in a quiet, even tone that intensified my nervousness.\n\nMy throat went dry. \"Well, I...\" Mr Mackay remained quiet. \"I..\" Taking a deep breath as I suppressed my tears, I confessed everything Much to my astonishment, Mr Mackay did not give me a tongue-lashing. Instead, he explained calmly, \"I understand your predicament. If you had told me the truth, I would have extended the deadline for you. I will not punish you this time, but I expect you to redo everything on your own. Understand ?\"\n\nOnly too relieved, I thanked Mr Mackay profusely and promised him that I would not commit such a folly again."

My curiosity was aroused, so I decided to take a closer look. I was greeted by the sight of two boys lying limply on the ground, I gasped in astonishment. As my gaze shifted to the tin and bag of yellow sticky substance, my eyes widened in shocking comprehension -- they were sniffing glue ! The smell was unbearably strong.\nI did not know if I could consider myself lucky that day -- the boys simply turned to look at me, then turned back to their vile act. They did not turn violent with verbal threats; neither did they try to harm me physically. The boys were too dazed to pay attention to me or the cockroaches and lizards around them.\n\nAs it was so dark, I could not make out their faces clearly. Courage got the better of me and I decided to go closer for a better look. An involuntary gasp escaped my mouth. They were my brother's classmates ! I had seen them before, working happily with my brother on school projects. Suddenly, I was overwhelmed by sadness, wondering what could have happened to cause these two promising boys to go down this route of destruction.\n\nShaking my head in disbelief, I hurried home and informed my parents and brother about the discovery. The police were called immediately.\n\nWhen the police arrived, the delirious boys were taken away. As we watched them leave, I was sure that I was not the only one hoping that they would realize the consequences of their actions soon and repent."

My heartbeat quickened as I reached the dreaded void deck. There, my tormentors would wait for me. My eyes darted around apprehensively. There was no one in sight. Just as I was about to heave a sigh of relief, the intimidating duo stepped out from behind a pillar.\n\nI swallowed hard and my lips quivered when the older boys strode purposefully towards me. \"Follow us !\" the bigger-sized boy commanded. The other one smirked as he pulled me by the my collar forcefully to a corner, and forced me against the wall. The leader stood before me and stretched out his arm towards the wall to block my way. He leant forward so close that I could feel the hot breath on my face. \"Where is the money ?\" the bully demanded.\n\n\"Here ... here,\" I stammered as I reached into my pocket to pull my wallet out.

As they entered, they were chatting animatedly. Much to my disappointment, those seated near the elderly ladies made no attempt to give their seats up. Some were listening to their music players while many others were fiddling with their mobile phones. Others simply stared ahead blankly while passengers on the 'priority seats' feigned ignorance of the need to give up their seats. I was indignant, \"How inconsiderate ! How selfish !\"\n\nSince these passengers chose to disregard the elderly ladies, I decided I would give my seat up, though I was quite a distance away.

Then, I weaved my way to the trio and invited one of them to sit down. The cheerful elderly lady smiled appreciatively and she offered the seat to the other two ladies.

You decide to write a composition for your school magazine about what is being done in your country to help the handicapped.\n \nA handicapped person is one who is physically or mentally disabled. In the past, the handicapped were considered as hindrances and an embarrassment. Therefore, more often than not, they were confined to the house. Nowadays, the handicapped face less prejudice as society becomes more accepting of them. This more positive perception has made them more independent and they are of greater service to society.\nIn the field of education, special schools are set up for the physically and intellectually disabled children. The schools are equipped with the required facilities and well-trained teachers. The curriculum is the same as the normal schools and the children learn to overcome their limitations in order to lead as normal a life as possible. These children are given specialized training, including computer technology, to prepare them for the working world.\n\nThe handicapped are encouraged to move around even in public transport. Buildings with ramps enable easier movement in wheelchairs. There are special parking lots and toilets allocated for the handicapped. To guide the visually-impaired along queues, rails are put up in some places. In the airports, travellators and electronically-operated doors help the disabled to move around more easily. Buses are now equipped with a special ramp for the wheelchair-bound. Taxi drivers are encouraged to help fold and store the wheelchairs in the boot. Traffic lights are fitted with beepers to aid the visually-impaired. All these have helped the handicapped to be more mobile.\n\nBesides thee facilities, the handicapped are encouraged to be independent. Companies are encouraged to employ the handicapped. A crippled person can work as a production operator or at toll booths. Some handicapped people work in fast food joints. The visually-impaired can work as masseurs.\n\nTo create public awareness, special games are prepared for the handicapped. These Paralympics provide opportunities for the handicapped to meet and exchange ideas. Those who excel at the national level are sent to take part in Paralympics at the international level.\n\nMuch has been done by the government to help the handicapped. They are now accepted as an important group of the country's workforce and they do contribute in their own way to the country's development."

        "content": "You watched a television program about animals and learned about animal extinction. Write a composition on the causes for increase in number of endangered animals.\n \nLoss of animals is an issue that concerns every country in the world. The presence of animals is part and parcel of our ecological system. However, over the past century, it has been discovered that more and more animals are on the endangered species list. Man has not and will not let up in the hunt of animals although governments have stepped up conservation efforts. The list of endangered species has increased mainly due to poaching and international illegal trade, habitat disturbance, fragmentation and destruction of lowland forests and diseases.\nPoaching and illegal trade in animals is due in part to the demand for animal parts. The rampant sale and demand for ivory especially in East Asia has affected the number of elephants. The Asian rhinos are hunted for their highly-prized horns. This has put the remaining rhinos worldwide at risk.\n\nLoss of habitat is another reason for the increase of endangered species. Forest conversion has resulted in a loss of habitat of tigers. In China, the re-opening of tiger farms could sound the death knell of this great beast. In Sabah, fragmentation of lowland forest has affected the habitat of elephants. These animals are forced to move nearer to human settlement in search of food. This leaves them open to destruction by man.\n\nA combination of factors of poaching for meat and loss of habitat has affected some animals. For example, these factors together with the illegal trade in live animals have resulted in populations of gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans declining at an alarming rate.\n\nMarine life is also endangered due to over harvesting and destruction by bottom trawlers and dredges and the building of marinas. Corals are in demand as they are used in the making of jewellery and decoration. Sharks are highly demanded for their meat and fins. Some fish parts, like the saw-like snout of the saw fish are sold as souvenirs and ceremonial weapons. Other body parts are sold as traditional medicines. The European eel is highly valued and sold live for rearing in aqua-culture.\n\nEfforts to conserve animals must be intensified by everyone, from the officialdom to the man in the street. Love nature, look after nature for their survival is our survival."

        "content": "The Consumer Society has launched Consumer Week for the school. Write a composition on how to be a smart and responsible shopper.\n \nShopping is one of the biggest indulgences in life for many people as it is often emotion-related. We shop for happy and festive occasions and we feel good. Some people go on a shopping spree when they received a windfall. Still, others shop when they feel depressed as shopping is considered therapeutic. Whatever the reason, we should shop smart, that is, find an alternative means to get what we want but in a much cheaper way without compromising too much on the quality.\nTo be a smart shopper, plan ahead for what you want to buy, when to buy and where to buy. Keep stock of what you have in order to identify the items that should go on your shopping list. a list helps to save time and backtracking as it reminds you of what you want to buy. Be cost conscious but keep to the quality you want. Certain quality goods might cost more but very often you get what you pay for. Avoid the pitfall of being penny wise pound foolish.\n\nAnother habit of a smart shopper which we should emulate is to avoid impulse buying. Impulsive buying or buying-on-the-spot decisions can be costly financially and emotionally. You might end up with items that could become white elephants. Seeing the item every day could be stressful. People who are in a hurry tend to be careless when they go shopping. If you have just received your salary, you should not go shopping as you might get carried away with the false sense of being rich.\n\nBesides being a smart shopper, be a considerate shopper, that is, be considerate to the environment. Plastic shopping bags add to the huge piles of rubbish at dumpsites. One way to be a smart and considerate shopper is to use products that come with less packaging. Buy refills, larger or economy-sized packets and choose longer life, energy efficient and rechargeable products. Reuse your shopping bags to avoid excessive use of plastic bags. Buy products that are made from recycled materials.\n\nThe advance in modern technology has brought us to -e-buying or buying on line. It is a convenient way of shopping. It saves time and the hassle of looking for a parking space in the hot sun. There is no crowd to contend with as one shops in the comfort of home with the help of the computer. In this case, one should and can be a smart shopper too. Observe the basic rules of planning ahead and avoiding impulse buying.\n\nShopping is an enjoyable activity. To avoid the pitfall of buying in haste and regretting at leisure, shop smart."

The officer-in-charge requests that you write a composition about pet animals\n \nKeeping animals, such as dogs and cats, is a lot of fun for adults and children. It is a good hobby to introduce to children. It helps to inculcate a strong sense of responsibility in children as they care for the animals. They learn to care for someone or something other than themselves. These animals will love without reservation and this is a lesson that is good for children to acquire. More importantly, these animals provide companionship for children and adults too. They are especially good for the handicapped, the old and the lonely.\nBefore adopting animals as pets, there are many issues to consider. The main issue is time. Having a pet is easy but does the family have time to care for the pet ? There are many responsibilities because i is like looking after a child. The pet has to be given baths, played with and trained. A dog, for example, has to be taken for walks.\n\nA pet animal's upkeep can be quite expensive. It includes food, medical treatment, playthings and a suitable home. They need a lot of love and attention. Pets that re bored will bite shoes, cushions or dig up the garden. They want attention and will not let up until you pick them up or talk to them.\n\nAnimals love to play as this is part of their growing up. Even adult animals need to play and this helps to strengthen the bond between owner and dog. Make this as part of the daily routine. Dogs and cats like to be ticked and stroked. Create games to play with them keeping in mind the safety aspects. A dog owner must take the dg for walks to spend its pent-up energy and basically to enjoy the scents, sights and sounds of the outside world. Exercise keeps the dog fit and healthy. A cat owner must let the cat out to sun itself and to stretch its limbs and body.\n\nTherefore, keeping pet animals is fun but it involves responsibilities and work. every member in the family must be willing to accept the animal as part of the family. Having a pet animal livens up the house."

        "content": "On International Deaf Day, the special education class held a special celebration. The doctor who attended the celebration commented that many youths nowadays are losing their hearing. You decide to do some research on the topic and write a composition for the school magazine.\n \nThe sense of hearing is very important to all of us. We can hear the beautiful voices of our parents, siblings, sounds of nature and the world around us. Some children are born hearing-impaired while others lose their hearing through congenital rubella or German measles. However, this faculty can be lost through carelessness or lack of health care.\nMost old people lose their hearing when they are in their sixties. Young people, however, may lose theirs in their thirties or forties. One reason for this situation is due to their hearing of loud music over a prolonged period and at a loud level. Walk down any road and without fail you will see a few young people suing hands-free phones, iPODS and MP3. This may make them look cool but they are gradually losing their hearing without realizing it. The scenario becomes worse when they are plugged in for hours.\n\nMost young people like to listen to music played at a high level. They do this because they want to experience the excitement or what they call 'kick'. Advances in technology have made it possible for good quality music to be played at high volume. the iPOD and MP3 allow greater storage capacity and provide continuous supply of music. At the same time, the use of earphones is unacceptable because it allows the loud music to go directly to the inner ear. Moreover, these earphones do not cover up the ear completely, so the volume has to be turned up to block out the surrounding sounds.\n\nLoss of hearing is gradual and there is no pain or visible damage. Symptoms of hearing damage vary according to the severity of the damage. One can be considered as having a hearing problem if one has difficulty keeping up with conversation in a group or following a conversation with background music. Other symptoms include always asking others to repeat themselves, complaining about clarity in one to one conversation and having difficulty following TV programs. some people hear ringing sound in the ears and this is a sign of hearing damage too.\n\nWhen there is permanent hearing loss, nothing can be done to reverse it. Hence, young people should be more careful about their hearing. Try not to use iPOD or MP3 so often and for a prolonged period. Listen to music the normal way and at a lower sound level. This is gentler and healthier on the ears."

He smiled broadly and said, \"Hello, little one !\" I was taken in at once by his pearly-white teeth and the twinkle in his eyes. Before I could say anything, he carried me up and gave me a bear-like hug.\nUncle Sam was the black sheep of the family and we have been forbidden to mention his name in Grandpa's presence. Grandpa was sure to lose his temper as he had never been able to forgive Uncle Sam for what he did twenty years ago. He had refused to further his studies. Instead, he had packed up and went on what he called, 'travel to the four corners of the world and seek meaning in life.' Grandpa had not mentioned his name since that fateful day.\n\nWhen Uncle Sam walked into the house, Grandpa said quietly, \"Get out of my sight.\" Grandma looked longingly at Uncle Sam and stretched out her hands to touch him. \"Woman, take me to my room,\" Grandpa bellowed. The air was so charged with suppressed anger, hidden joy and expectations. Uncle Sam walked out without a word and Father agreed that he would stay in our house for the time being.\n\nActually there was more to Uncle Sam than meets the eye. First of all, he had managed to travel tot he four corners of the world and had gathered immense knowledge about the world. He had acquired an island in the Pacific Ocean and plan to spend the rest of his life there like Somerset Maugham's Lotus Eater. He had the habit of stopping in the middle of his stories and take up the stance of meditation for five minutes.\n\nOne night, as I look out of the window, I saw Uncle Sam standing at the main gate. I was concerned as I know Uncle Sam had gone to bed earlier. i called Father and we went to check on him. He was fast asleep literally on his feet !

The quiet of the river and surroundings was broken by the swish-swashing of our paddles slicing through the water. we rounded a bend and were greeted by a disquieting roar in the distance.\n\nThe first stretch of the river flowed through durian orchards. The sharp, distinct fragrance of the ripe fruits permeated the air. At the numerous bends, the current picked up speed. We were swept towards the banks. Other dangers to dodge were overhanging branches, fallen trees and submerged logs. at calm stretches, we slowed to admire the serene scenery. at the same time we had to be alert as innocent-looking ripples could play us out. They sheltered hidden rocks that could rip our kayaks apart. My cousin and I struck a hidden rock and we had the dunking of our life.\n\nFrom the durian orchards we came to jungles. We could hear the soft roar of rapids ahead increasing to a crescendo as our kayaks were swept swiftly along. The first rapid along the river was only a small noisy rapid -- a lot of sound and fury that came to nothing ! We breezed through without any mishap. Then, we took a bumpy ride along a rough stretch. Heart pounding and feverishly rowing, we struggled to avoid the rocks.\n\nAt the next rapid the river divided into two streams. My cousin and I took the left stream while the others took the right. Both involved deft turns of the boat to negotiate short sharp passages between rocks. the last rapid was fast flowing but we went through with confidence.\n\nWith no more major obstacles to slow us down, we covered the remaining stretch happily."

Dong or thanksgiving Chinese style.\n \nChinese celebrate thanksgiving on 22ndDecember for the festival of Dong. It is a day of merriment, feasting and giving thanks. It is also a day for setting out hopes for the coming year and for ancestor worship.\nIn ancient times, according to tradition, the Emperor had to fast on the eve of Dong to prepare for the ceremonial rituals and ancestor worship which was carried out on the Altar of Heaven in Beijing. On the day itself, the Emperor would offer sacrifices at the Temple of Heaven. If the day was dry an clear, the coming year would be peaceful.\n\nDong is a family celebration with a family dinner for those who live nearby or are free to come. Prayers are offered at the family altar. The day is marked by the preparation of tong yuen, a dish of glutinous rice flour balls in syrup. The process involved the making of ground glutinous powder into dough. The, half the dough would be colored red and the rest left white. The roundness of the balls symbolizes family co-operation and union. Usually there would be twelve larger white balls symbolizing the number of month so the year. The rice balls would be boiled until they are cooked. everyone must eat at least one such ball to indicate that one is a year older.\n\nI can recall those early years when I helped to make the rice balls. It was a fun activity when we would compete to see who could roll the roundest and the most number of balls. Mother would be the judge and give a reward to the winner. When she had enough rice balls, we were allowed to shape the balance into any shape we like. they would also be boiled and we would et our own creations.\n\nNowadays, dong is not celebrated like it should be. The balls with fillings can be bought ready-made. People are too busy to observe traditions and customs. It is not a public holiday and many young people tend to forget that such a festival even exists. Moreover, no one wants to eat tong yuen as it is tasteless and not attractive at all.\n\nWe seem to have become too sophisticated to enjoy the simple pleasures of life as a family."

We heard it again after what seemed like hours -- in fact, it was a mere minute. The thunder went on and on, it clapped in merriment, it roared in fury. It was partnered by the zig-zagging lightning. we drew the curtains to hear and see the two \"friends' living it up.\n\nThe two forces of nature were now befriended by the wind. the wind started to dance with the dry brittle leaves on the parched ground and grass. They jumped up, hopped here and here. The green and the brown, the colored and the white now danced in dizzy delight, thrown up and tossed about in the air as they clamored to climb higher than one another.\n\nThe constant flashes of lightning allowed us glimpses of walking and swaying shadows of trees. We were enticed and gazed in awe as the elements gave in to the cosmic energies of the heavens. We laughed, happy that our days of 'suffering' from the relentless torture of the sun seemed about to end.\n\nThen it happened. the unexpected sound which we were waiting for in anticipation of the welcome drop tingled at our ears. It was a little drop, a tick, a plop ... It was a pit and a pat, a pitter and a patter, a splish and a splash, a few drops which increase, albeit slow at first, then fast, then slow and whoosh ! They came : the rains were here. they came, raining glittering tears of pearls dazzling our eyes and wondrously stretching far beyond the darkness into the wide unknown.\n\nThe rains continued to grow in its ferocity and continued unabated for an hour."

You decide to write on The newspaper and us.\n \n\"Where's my paper ? Every morning when we take our breakfast, inevitably someone, usually Father, will ask for the newspaper. He reads as he eats. We try to take a peek as he turns he pages. My brother will ask for the sports section while I will look for the entertainment section. Mum will take her time after we have left home to go through the papers at her leisure. Board a bus or a train and every other person is reading or holding the papers.\nThe newspaper is very much a part of every household. We feel a bit lost hen the newspaper is not available early in the morning. One will not be too far off the mark if one were to say that the press controls our days and our opinions too. The press has become a powerful influence in our lives.\n\nAs the mirror of the world -- the papers -- tell us about events in different arts of the world. Nowadays, with the world getting smaller due to the latest computer technology and means of transport, we cannot afford to be ignorant of what is happening in other parts of the world. One does not want to travel and land in a country where there is political unrest. Similarly, one makes arrangements for travels abroad to experience cultural events or sporting events. One does not want to leave one's country if there is potential danger of political upheaval. Such knowledge can only be obtained from the papers. The radio and television provides hourly news coverage but it cannot be as comprehensive and all covering as the newspaper.\n\nA good paper interprets, comments and criticizes many things that are happening within the country or abroad. For the layman, it is these views that are more important than the news. We rely on the papers to be educated on vital issues as they are written and presented in a nutshell. Readers can save time and yet be adequately informed.\n\nAs the paper is so powerful in its influence, the governments of the world would like to control their local dailies. They place certain limitations on the contents and opinions that can be printed or expressed by the press. The power of the press is feared by even the most powerful or the richest man in the country. Censorship is imposed to make sure what is detrimental to a country's security or the standing of the government of the day does not go into print.\n\nControl of the press by the government is desirable during emergencies but not during normal times. Too much control will stifle and kill the creativity of ideas and this can affect the mental and physical progress of a country. a free press will expose the bad influences within a country. It can get the opinions and support of the public and more importantly it is a symbol of democracy.\n\nAll said and done, the newspaper is a daily and constant source of information and education. Everyone should make the attempt to read and absorb whatever it prints."

        "content": "You are the president of the Board of Librarians. Write an article for your school magazine on how to choose a good book.\n \nReading maketh a man. We have been told that since the day we started reading. The wisdom of it is pounded into us by parents and teachers like as we progress from preschool to our teen years. So, like obedient boys and girls, we trot to the library and the bookshops with our parents. They pick out the books they think we should read.\nNowadays, we we browse through the book shelves, we see several interesting titles that might be worth a second look. We pick up one and hope that it's worth the time spent picking it up or the money spent on buying it. So, how do we know we have picked a good book for a good read ?\n\nOne way of making sure of a good read is to surf the web. Subscribe to publishers' newsletters or online book lists for the latest titles of books. Do a web search for sites where new or old book titles are posted or reviewed. Credentials of book reviewers might be provided and this will help you to decide the value of the books. Read the publishers' and writers' magazines for the latest titles. They provide reviews of books too. Such reviews might be biased but at least it will give you an idea of what the book is about.\n\nMost readers have their list of favorite writers. In this case, the best thing to do is to keep tabs on them. Magazines and websites often provide details of their upcoming book. Some give reasons for writing the book and how the characters are developed. This will give you an idea of what to expect and you can decide whether you want to read it or not.\n\nThe most obvious and easiest thing to do is to study a book's front and back covers. The front offers an attractive and irresistible graphic that symbolizes the message of the title. On the inside front cover, there is a blurb and comments by papers and book reviewers. One is prompted to start reading. On the back cover, one can find a summary of the story while the back page has the writer's information. This is the easiest way to choose a good book to read. Go further and look at the content page which gives chapter titles. this will definitely give you a better idea of the development of the story.\n\nThe best advice to take is this -- browse and pick, then skim through the contents. Do a random reading of one of the chapters, especially the middle of the story because this is usually where the conflict of the story is.\n\nI feel that every book or story has its own credits. So, even if you feel that the beginning of the story is not interesting, plough on if you can. You might be pleasantly surprised."

        "content": "After a class discussion about child abuse, the teacher wants the class to write an article on good parenting.\n \nParents and children have a special bond of love and affection. This bond can never be replaced by any other form of relationships, for as the saying goes, 'blood is thicker than water'. Parenthood like any other job requires dedication and sacrifice. So, what qualities should parents have that would provide good parenting ?\nParenthood is a natural consequence of marriage. Prospective parents should recognize their responsibilities and realize what parenthood involves. One of the essential qualities parents should have is the acceptance of the role of parenthood. The father may resent the child because it would be a rival for the attention of the mother and family, more so if the child is a baby boy. Mother, on the other hand, is put in a different class where her time is no longer her own. Household routine is changed as baby makes demand son her time. Both parents should be willing to make sacrifices, including their career and accept their responsibilities.\n\nParents love their children and this is a universal truth. But, love should in no way or at any time be considered as synonymous with pampering or spoiling the children. They should instill in the children qualities which will help them face life with a sense of integrity and strength of character. These can be cultivated if the parents teach them positively.\n\nParents should set good examples and provide the right atmosphere which is conducive to the growth of good character traits. A child learns good virtues and the influence of his parents counteract all other influences, good or bad as like father like son.\n\nIn general, good parenthood requires love and understanding. These two qualities can build a strong world of parent-child relationship. Love must be wholesome but not blind in that it does not ignore discipline and moral values. This love must provide security and confidence to the growing child to be a good thinking adult. Understanding means giving the child the opportunity to find out what he wants, the freedom to try new ideas and the support when the child meets with failure.\n\nParent should be themselves and allow the children to grow up to be themselves too. Give support and encouragement wherever necessary but temper this with love and understanding. Being a good parent is in itself a growing process. Learn to love but love wisely."

        "content": "You have been asked to write an article on wholesome healthy drinks for the school Health Club newsletter.\n \nWhat should one consider as wholesome healthy beverages ? Milk and fruit juices are good choices of wholesome healthy drinks.\nMilk is rich in several essential nutrients that will help the body's bones grow stronger and stay healthy. They include calcium, vitamin D and protein. Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth which is important in the growing child. It also slows down bone loss in later years which is imperative in maintaining continual good health in the elderly and infirmed. It is involved in nerve function, muscle contraction and blood clotting. vitamin D enables a child to absorb calcium. Protein helps build muscles, bones and other tissues. It serves as a back-up energy source if we do not get enough carbohydrate or fat. These nutrients complement one another.\n\nThere is a wide variety of fruit juices to choose from, from apple juice to orange juice, cranberry juice and pineapple juice. As the adage goes, an apple a day keeps the doctor away. Fruit juice offers many of the same nutrients as its fruit counterpart, with the exemption of fibre. It counts as a serving from the fruit group in the Food Guide Pyramid. The sugar content in fruit juices is natural sugar.\n\nSome of the key nutrients many fruit juices provide include carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals, and phyto-nutrients. Carbohydrates are our main energy source. Without them, we can become listless and inactive.\n\nVitamins and minerals are essential for growth and development of a variety of functions that the body performs every day. A growing child needs to grow in strength daily. If growth is inhibited, mental, physical and physiological problems may beset the child.\n\nPhyto-nutrients are food components that occur naturally in plant foods. They usually provide important health benefits similar to anti-oxidants. With global climatic and environmental changes and problems, these nutrients can help to stave off detrimental effects early.\n\nMilk and fruit juices have their own health benefits. If we combine them, we get a hearty healthy blended drink that is doubly enriched with essential nutrients like two for the price of one."

        "content": "You are a student counselor in a special education school. You are conducting a lesson on how to communicate with people with disabilities in the presence of your teacher counselor. Write out the talk you have prepared for your class.\n \nGood morning, my fellow students.\nThe process of communication between two people is very natural and we greet and exchange pleasantries without thinking twice. However, when it comes to people with disabilities, for instance, the speech-impaired, the sight-impaired or the hearing-impaired, we feel some awkwardness. Many people feel uncomfortable around people with disabilities.\n\nHere are a few suggestions on how to get around these discomforts.\n\nWhen talking to disabled people, bear in mind that they are normal human beings. Except for their disabilities, they are no different from you or me. They do not expect anything more than being treated with the same dignity, consideration, respect and rights as any other person.\n\nFor people with physical disabilities, for example, a person in a wheelchair, offer your assistance sincerely. If the offer is refused, do not insist. Do not attempt to push the wheelchair without asking for permission. A person's crutches, cane, walker or any mobility aid should not be moved without consent. If the person is accompanied by someone, talk to the disabled person rather than through the companion. When talking to the person in wheelchair, try to talk at eye level. This shows your sincerity and respect for the person concerned.\n\nWhen communicating with a visually-impaired person, first identify yourself to put the person at ease. Touch the person's arm slightly to indicate that you are talking to him or her. Talk facing the person and speak in a normal tone of voice. One need not shout or go too near the person. Maintain a comfortable distance. Let the person know if you are leaving as you do not want him or her to talk to himself or herself. Be specific when giving directions, for example, the table is at three o'clock.\n\nPeople who are hearing-impaired might have different ways of communicating. Use the medium of communication they are accustomed to. If you do not know sign language, make it clear. You can converse through an interpreter. But, look at and talk to the person rather than the interpreter. Catch the person's attention.\n\nThat's all for this lesson. Work hard and you will make good counselors. Thank you."

The president has invited  speaker to talk on the importance of keeping campsites clean.\n \nGood morning to the president, members of the Youth adventure Club.\nI am Elaine, a park ranger from Taman Negara. I feel honored to be invited to talk to you about the importance of keeping campsites clean.\n\nCamping  is a popular holiday activity among adults and school children. Most of us choose the forests, waterfalls and hills as campsites. This is a healthy way to spend the holidays. In fact, we encourage parents and schools to organize such activities and the trend is catching on.\n\nUnfortunately, an unhealthy consequence has developed from this healthy outdoor activity. Campers or litterbugs have turned such places into dumpsites. Besides this, trees have been cut to make firewood, vegetation cleared to make campsites and rare forest plants taken out.\n\nThis has resulted in many of the once beautiful forests, waterfalls and peaks becoming bare and ugly. Trekkers who hiked to and up some of these places a few years back found them to be pristine. It was like stepping into heaven with clean healthy fresh air and smells of nature. Now, they are shocked to find mountains of trash even on high peaks.\n\nSuch actions have consequences although the public does not realize it. The rubbish washed down by rainwater will flow into rivers and dams at the foot of hills. Once the river is polluted, it will affect the riverine inhabitants and people living nearby. Nature tourism ranks as an income earner in some of the states. Therefore, we need to protect our forests and mountains. A trekker who has almost busted his lungs to reach the peak will not appreciate the ugly sight of garbage. It takes the pleasure out of camping. Future generations may not have a chance of seeing rare, exotic and wild plants in their natural habitat.\n\nWho are the culprits and what can we do to change the mindset of the public ? Real trekkers are people who love trekking and nature. The culprits are the occasional trekkers from students to outdoor club members. Hence, the authorities have to enforce fines and strict guidelines at entry points to these places. Hikers and trekkers have to get a permit and register with the rangers before they enter the trail.\n\nI understand that your Adventure Club is planning a camping trip up Cameron Highlands. I hope you will remember what I have talked about this morning."

        "content": "You are the secretary of the 1Malaysia Club in your school. You have been asked to give a talk on the implementation of a national curfew for teenagers.\n \nGood morning, teachers and friends. First of all, thank you for being resent for this talk of mine. For this topic, national curfew for teenagers, I will touch on the reasons or needs for such a step.\nSome people are calling for the implementation of a national curfew for teenagers to curb juvenile crimes and to keep them safe. They are concerned about teenagers hanging out at \"mamak\" stalls and cyber cafes into the wee hours of the morning. A national curfew means that all teenagers must be home and not be outside the home by a certain time unless they are with their parents.\n\nTo a certain extent, there should be a curfew for teenagers. The implementation would not be smooth sailing because of the different personalities of teenagers. It would require determination and force.\n\nIn today's society, teenagers are always experimenting with new things and some of them are illegal. Many teenagers have confessed to the fact they have indulged in such illegal activities. Some teenagers are having too much fun and some parents cannot even be bothered or are too busy surviving the rat race or are truly unable to discipline or handle their wayward children. With the way society is spiraling out of control in matters of discipline, some parents need the legal assistance of the government to mind their children. This may result in the teenagers being detained and the parents being considered cruel and inhumane but the end justifies the means.\n\nA national curfew is a means to prevent juvenile crimes. In this case, such a law is a mere deterrent. It sometimes can not truly curb the growing problem of \"young people\" crimes and misbehaviors. Maybe, the curfew could be confined to those under 17 years old or those below 18 and those out without adult supervision. The cut-off point could be 12 midnight. It could be that those under 17 or under 18 could stay out beyond curfew hours provided they have elder siblings around. The question then arises as to how many younger siblings 'obey' their elder siblings.\n\nTeenagers need to realize their safety is a parental priority. After 12 midnight, parents are at home and children too should be at home, not gallivanting in the dark outdoors. There should be an understanding on the part of teenagers that their safety and well being are of prime importance to parents. It is better to be safe than sorry.\n\nThank you for your attention and I hope you will give this topic serious thought."

        "content": "You are a bank officer and have been asked to give a talk on the power of saving.\n \nGood morning, teachers and students. I'm Charlie Chee from Citibank and this morning I would like to talk about the power of saving.\nAs long as people could breathe and earn a living, people have realized the power of savings, especially for a rainy day. The ability to save is greater than the ability to earn. It is not how much you earn but how much you save that could make a mountain of a difference in difficult economic times or in your ripe old age. A high income earner who spends as much as he earns may -- at the end of the day -- be poorer than a meager income earner who saves at least half of his earnings.\n\nThe act of buying involves a financial plan. Buying anything, for example, a fast food meal requires us to do a quick mental calculation of how we are going to spend our money -- a promotional value meal will save us a few cents while a burger and a drink will cost slightly more. It all boils down to planning.\n\nThe first thing to start saving, is you should be aware of is your spending pattern. Not everyone adheres to the same spending pattern. Let us think \"small\" for beginners. Just think of ourselves as \"small-time spenders and savers'. How much do you need to spend in a day ? Are all the items you spend on necessary ? You need to be honest with yourself. Oftentimes, many people buy things they do not need just because it was a good buy or that it was going for a song. You just have to watch your purse strings !\n\nNext, put all your savings into a money bank. It does not need to be fanciful; it could be that cute little money box you received from your favorite aunt, or even a pretty little shoebox sealed with sticky tape. Then, fill your money bank constantly and faithfully from your pocket money or savings. Before long it will be fuller than you can imagine.\n\nWhen your \"makeshift\" money bank can \"eat\" no more, it is time to start a savings account. Scout around and look for a bank that offers the highest interest rate. The next step is to decide on how you would like to deposit in your account. Start with whatever you have; whether it is ten dollars or a thousand, it all helps.\n\nThis approach is a mere beginning -- we learn to crawl first before we can walk and run. Start small and grow into a giant !\n\nThank you for your attention and I hope to see many of you in my bank soon."

You realize its beauty when you leave home for studies overseas.\n \nWhen I was young, my family lived in a dilapidated house in Julu Village on the outskirts of Chebu town. It stood on wooden stilts and had a steeply sloping roof of corrugated sheets.\nWe seemed to live in perpetual darkness. Daylight from morning to evening was blocked out by the surrounding trees. I enjoyed listening to the sweet chirping of the birds. The night was a different kettle of fish. it was dark, foreboding and frightening with shadows that seem to lengthen and shrink with every gust of wind. Our imagination worked overtime as we crawled into bed and pulled the blankets over our heads. Our fears were compounded during 'Qing Ming' (Chinese All Souls' celebration) and the Hungry Ghost month.\n\nFrom the outside, the house looked dreary and creepy. Friends shied away and there were whispers that our house was haunted. I used to play in friends' houses but never invited them over out of a sense of shame. My parents used to encourage us to invite friends over. But, we, especially I, felt too ashamed to do so. Father pointed out the paintings and antiques treasures that they would appreciate. The compound was big enough for rounders, tic-tac-toe or hop-scotch. No, I kept telling myself -- my house was not worthy of my friends. It was rotten and ugly.\n\nLife was not so terrible al the time. My sibling sand I had good times playing hide-and-seek and climbing the horizontal plank walls. The paintings and antiques had many stories to tell.\n\nI left home to continue education in the States. I left with a happy heart, glad to be out of the rotten eyesore. But, within a month, I was so homesick for my rotten eyesore that I almost gave up my studies. Images of the houses came to mind. it was so picturesque with a character of its won. Father had extended the house until it was double its original size.\n\nHow could I look down on my house, no, my home ! I had been so busy downgrading it.

You feel that schools should not be totally blamed for the problem. Write a composition on the topic, 'Are schools to be blamed for the problem of delinquency among students ?'\n \nSchools are institutions of education in the academic and extra-curricular fields. The principal and teachers carry out their duties based on the curriculum set by the Ministry of Education. The daily, weekly, monthly and yearly routine operates with one objective in mind -- prepare the students for the public examinations. Make sure they score distinctions, if possible, in all the subjects. The principles in the education charter states clearly students should be achievers in all aspects. This is a tall order and the schools are doing their best in providing a good learning conducive environment. Yet, students still play truancy.\nAccording to students, they play truant because they are bored with their lessons. They want lessons to be made more interesting and challenging by the teachers so that they will not be tempted to play truant. Lessons become uninteresting because the teachers do not put in enough effort in the lessons. Teachers reply that their hands are tied by the need to finish the syllabus. The schools cannot afford to be too innovative with their lessons as time and results are of the essence.\n\nLet's look at the curriculum then. Some students say that schools are not challenging. Due to exposure to technological progress, students nowadays are good at handling electronic and computer equipment. Many are good in the arts and music, sports and games because they have been tutored in these since kindergarten. Thus, they find school boring and the curriculum mundane, not exciting or challenging. Their creativity is stumped and their potentials not tapped into.\n\nWhat then is the solution ? Some parents suggest that we should give students a wider choice of subjects in order to provide for their respective needs. There should be more specialized teaching, a broad-based curriculum and co-curriculum. Let the student choose what they are good in. Such provisions might curb their need to find excitement outside the school as their pent-up energy, potential and creativity will be well challenged within the school grounds.\n\nThe suggested solution is good if the school is actually responsible for truancy among students. Such a revamping requires co-operation of all concerned, especially the students, for it to be successful. I feel that schools should not be held totally responsible for the problem of student truancy."

        "content": "Your thirteen-year-old cousin is interested in social networking.\n \nSocial networking has invaded the realms of conventional socialising and merchandising. It is indeed a small world via the Internet.\nSocial networking has reached phenomenal heights since the launch of the Internet. As in every innovation, there are the pros and cons, and what it can do for you.\n\nThe first advantage is the low costs. It is cheaper to use online social networking for both personal and business reasons because most of it is usually free.\n\nThe second advantage is building credibility. You can gain the customers' confidence if you connect to them on both personal and professional levels. Potential employers use social networking to gain insight of future employees.\n\nThe third advantage is the connections you build up with family and friends, professional and business contacts. You are friend with people who have other friends, and the circle goes right around the world. Using a social networking site gets you people-connected to form a web of connections.\n\nThe boons entice you to start social networking. However, what about the disadvantage is the lack of anonymity. You are keying in personal (sometimes confidential) data. The advice is to be careful, but how careful is careful ? When people know you, some find ways to do you in.\n\nThe second disadvantage is the scams and harassment. There is a potential for failure of security in both personal and business context. Many sites apply certain measures to keep cases of harassment, cyberstalking, online scams, and identity theft to an absolute minimum. But you still may become a victim.\n\nThe third disadvantage is the time factor. If you are not into it, you regard surfing the net as a time consuming bane. The key to social networking is the fun element, whether clicking for socialising or business purposes.\n\nHow much you want to reveal about yourself on the Internet is finally up to you. It is advisable to check the security links of any website before divulging data.\n\nOnce you understand the pros and cons of social networking on websites: facebook, twitter, flickr, you feel safe to avail yourself of the network.\n\nTo sum up, take advantage of the online social networking but be careful using it. Be network smart !"

        "content": "You read an advertorial flyer advertising landed property in the hills. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hillside property development.\n \nThe landslide tragedy of the 2011 Hulu Langat reminded us of the landslides in the 2008 Bukit Antarabangsa and the 1993 Highland Towers which claimed lives and destroyed property.\n\nDespite such tragedies, why do people still buy property in the hills ?\n\nFirst, hillsides are excellent real estate. Owners have access to an unrestricted view while on flat land, houses are surrounded by identical brick blocks. Between a hillside and a waterfront property, hillsides score higher. The clear view of the surrounding terrain is touted as the prime factor.\n\nSecond, hillside property gives owners the feeling of exclusivity and remoteness. Hillside property is quite expensive and appeals to the affluent who wish for more privacy. Hillside residents are able to enjoy the suburban life by traveling mere minutes from the bustling city to their \"castles in the sky\".\n\nHowever, residents face a number of disadvantages.\n\nFirst, man-made accessibility can result in a steep driveway. Those physically unable to climb due to age, health and ability may find the many stairs and slopes difficult to navigate.\n\nSecond, the surrounding area has tall trees blocking the view. These trees should not be summarily cut down to allow for full unblocked view as these trees and their roots anchor soil to slopes. House owners have to maintain the drainage system on slopes and be prepared from any drainage problems.\n\nLandscaping and maintenance of the slope cover is an ongoing concern. Removing trees may destabilise the ground and make it susceptible to water erosion and mudslides. Besides that, the house foundations counteract with the years. Landslides may occur and wipe out the whole hillside.\n\nThe final factor to consider is the unpredictable natural disasters. The climate of the area with its heavy rains could mark catastrophes. Prior to developing property in the hills, the engineers, surveyors, architects, consultants plus a host of other interested parties have undertaken in depth studies to ensure safe living. However, the inclement climate can wreck havoc.\n\nWhat would you, a prospective buyer do ? It actually boils down to where you want to live."

As the Secretary o the Residents' Association, write a letter of appreciation and complaint.\n \nDear Sir,\nCondition of Dumpster Vehicles\n\nI am writing on behalf of the Residents Association of Moonlight Garden. We wish to bring to your attention several matters concerning the collection of rubbish in our housing estate.\n\nWe would like to state our appreciation at the regular collection of rubbish which occurs once every other day. We are pleased at the precise timing on the three days of the week. Rubbish bags are put out long before the arrival of the dumpster vehicles.\n\nBut we are aggrieved by the vehicles plying the rubbish route for they are guilty of leaving a trickling seepage trail of watery fluid stench on the roads. Long after the vehicles have departed to the dumpsite, the stench of the watermarks lingers in the air and continues to assail us for days. Furthermore the dirty smelly watermarks are etched on the paved roads. Even after a heavy downpour, the watermarks are still very visible and they still give off an unbearable foul odor.\n\nWe would like to suggest that the vehicles be fitted or installed with sophisticated fluid retainers or water chutes for fluid collection so that foul fluid from the rubbish does not seep from the vehicles and trickle onto the roads, leaving a watery trail and fluid remnants. In addition, the vehicles should be washed and sterilized periodically as we have seen it done in other cities.\n\nWe have advised the residents to use more durable rubbish bags or even to use double bags to prevent spillage. In fact, we have complied with this advice and have even purchased SW rubbish bags. However, a certain amount of spillage still occurs when the collectors carry out their work. We would like a greater level of co-operation. When the spillage is caused by your workers, they should clean up the rubbish trial on the roads.\n\nPlease look into these matters for it is most unhealthy to have rubbish vehicles that leave rubbish trails and fluids.\n\nThank you\n\nYours faithfully,"

        "content": "You have been chosen to give a speech to the students at the assembly on how to reduce wastage of paper in school during the \"Keep the School Clean Campaign Month.\"\n \nGood morning to the Principal, Teachers and friends.\nIt gives me great pleasure to talk to all of you today on how to reduce wastage of paper in the school. As all of you are fully aware, we are in the midst of \"Keep the School Clean Campaign.\" Needless to say, all of us are collectively responsible for keeping our school clean, it is not the duty of the school cleaners or the students on duty. I ask you, how can we reduce wastage of paper?\n\nThere are two schools of thought. One group would say, \"Why bother?\" whilst the other would be up in arms to do something concrete about maximizing paper use. I am of the opinion that the majority of us are in the second category for we realise that the tree population is fast being depleted and if we do nothing to reduce, recycle and reuse, we would one day not see a single real paper around!\n\nWhat can you and I do to resolve this issue of seeing valuable paper lying strewn on the floor, thrown into the dustbins and waste baskets or just abandoned in drawers, tables and chairs - just anywhere? I am sure most of you have lots of suggestions which may be similar to mine and maybe loads better than mine.\n\nLet me share some of these ideas.\n\nFirst, let us use both sides of a leaf. Oftentimes, we have seen papers thrown away where one side is still blank whilst the other is clearly used. Mind you, the other side is still usable and can be filled up.\n\nSecond, let us use all the cutouts and remnants of paper where parts of them have been usefully utilized to be made into little notes of reminders, short memos or for little jottings that are only useful at that point of time.\n\nThird, we have seen exercise books with many unused papers being discarded. These pages can be cut out neatly and bound according to one's inclinations and turned into little notelets to be wedged in back pockets or wallets. I have seen people scrambling for paper to write a telephone number or an address or even a reminder and not having any, would write on their palms. How gross!\n\nNext, for decorative purposes or designs for our art lessons or for own personal appreciation, we can cut out the lovely illustrations on colorful flyers, magazines or junk mail to add color to our otherwise dismal lives.\n\nThen, finally, of course, like it or not, we can collect all these used papers to be sold or sent to the recycling centers. We should not be throwing them away - in the lockers, desks, floor or around the bins. If you want to truly throw them, make sure that your flying missiles - oops, I mean the paper land in the bins proper. We should make it a habit to ensure that used paper falls into the bins and is entrenched\nthere and not sit like decorative graffiti around these receptacles of man's wastage.\n\nThese are just some of my ideas and I am very sure that each and every one of you would yield more ideas to reduce wastage and to create a more thrifty prudent school community.\n\nThank you."

        "title": "No more plastic",
        "content": "You are asked to give a speech against using too much plastic in our everyday life at a community club in your housing estate to a group of housewives.\n \nGood afternoon, Ladies. Thank you for your presence today and for sparing some time from your afternoon naps and your soap operas to be with me.\nToday, I am going to speak on the world of plastic and how we can reduce the usage of plastic in our daily life.\n\nUndeniably, plastic had invaded every fabric of our life that everywhere in almost all products, plastic is one of the main components. It seems as though we cannot live without plastic but we have to realise that most plastic is non-biodegradable. Then again, with advanced technology, plastic can be recycled but before that era comes, we have to be practical.\n\nI believe some of you, if not all of you, are already practising a lifestyle where plastic is used less and less. I hazard a guess that you feel a lot better that you are an environmental activist in your own practical way.\n\nMy first suggestion is to have a handy tiffin carrier where you can keep all the food you buy from the \"chap-fun\" store on the days when you wish to take a break from the kitchen. Buying food in Styrofoam containers means disposing of them after you have no use for them. In fact, they are not very durable and do not last long. A metal tiffin carrier does the trick just as efficiently and the tiffin carrier can be reused again and again. On top of that, the food remains fresher and hotter.\n\nMy second recommendation is to recycle all the plastic containers that you \"collect\" from fast-food outlets, food stalls, relatives and friends. Use them as much and as often as you can until they are either cracked or leaking or too worse for wear. Then only should they be discarded, not before when they can be reused.\n\nThe third option is to stack them up and keep them handy to use for throwing away liquid stale food or as receptacles for prawn shells, crab shells and even fish scales. In addition, the plastic containers would serve as rubbish bags and there is no need to use plastic bags which leak and leave trails of stench everywhere. You solve the problem of your bin smelling like a sack of rotten eggs, especially when the dustman does not come to empty the trash bins thrice weekly. It happens occasionally for the trashmen to take unofficial leave and forget about the overflowing garbage bins.\n\nNext on the list of suggestions is to stop buying plastic ware of any kind for the kitchen. The commercial world has found it easier and economical to bottle and contain almost anything and everything in plastic ware that comes in all sizes and shapes. So use them until they are useless. Besides there are other products that come in tins and glass bottles which can be put to use in various ways - we have to be innovative and invent new ways of putting them to work for us.\n\nFinally, there is nothing like using porcelain and glassware to serve and store edibles and eatables. So why use plastic when we can have other materials to grace our dining tables and our homes?\n\nI congratulate you, ladies, on your many innovative workable ways to reduce usage of plastic in the home to a minimum until one day you can say with pride that you have beaten the system. You have shared some of these ideas with us on the feedback forms - thank you.\n\nOn that note, I thank you once again, ladies for your attention and time."

At the right corner of the chart was written 'Done by: Connie Lim; Nuriada Senin; Kanesh Than; Roger Foo'. 'Ben Pang' was nowhere in sight!\n\n\"What do you mean by this?\" I cried out in dismay when I realized my name had been left out. \"Where's my name?\" I demanded loudly.\n\nConnie looked at me and answered coolly, \"We have decided not to include your name.\"\n\n\"Why? Am I not a part of the group?\" I asked, with desperation creeping into my voice.\nKanesh took a step nearer and explained patiently, \"You haven't done anything at all.\" The rest of the group members nodded their heads unanimously.\n\nI was taken aback by the forthright answer. I lost the courage to face my classmates suddenly and my eyes fell to the floor. I was filled with shame as I recalled how I really had not contributed to the projects. No one had confronted me thus far, so I thought my behavior was acceptable. Now that my classmates were bold enough to correct me, what should I do?\n\nThe four of them watched me purse my lips in my quiet contemplation. After exchanging glances with one another, Roger spoke up, \"Let us know your intention.\" With that, they went back to their seats.\n\nThe bell rang, indicating the start of the school day. However, my mind was somewhere else. The teachers' voices were a distant drone; the scenario of the incident kept recurring in my mind. I pondered over the options. Apologize and plead with them to include my name? That would be shameful and humiliating. Complete the project by myself? That would be daunting as it was to be handed up the next day. I sighed in helpless resignation.\n\nIt was only the flurry of activities around me that shook me out of my thoughts, reminding me that it was recess time.\n\n\"Wait!\" I hollered at my group members who were heading out of the classroom. That shout halted everyone in their steps and the entire class turned and stared at me in astonishment. I cringed and muttered sheepishly as I pointed at the four of them, \"I mean ... them.\"\n\nI walked up to the four, drew in a deep breath, mustered my courage and said, \"I am sorry.\" Before they could answer, I blurted, \"I volunteer to do the presentation tomorrow. I will prepare it today when I get home.\" Pausing for a moment, I asked meekly this time, \"So, am I in?\"\n\nMy group members offered no immediate reply. A slow smile spread over their faces. Roger was the first to speak. \"Kanesh, where's the marker ?\"\n\nThe four of them walked to where the chart was. My face lit up in delight to see them adding my name. The letters fitted in the space perfectly. It was as if my friends had left that space blank deliberately, knowing that I would repent."

        "content": "You are taking part in a debate. The topic of the debate is \"National service is for males only.\" Write a speech for the opposition where you disagree with the motion.\n \nGood morning, Madam Chairman, Honorable Judges, Members of the House and fellow members of the opposition.\nI do not agree with the motion that national service should be for males only. National Service is for all youths, be they males or females.\n\nFirstly, males and females are equally responsible for national security. The task of ensuring the nation's security should not be the sole responsibility of the males. In this age of equality where men and women are equal partners in nation-building, it is only fair that they too become equal \"guardians\" in safeguarding the sovereignty of the nation.\n\nSecondly, in addition, the advent of multitasking in all aspects of work has been simplified by sophisticated machines. Humans are aided by the numerous prototypes of gadgets. Needless to say, it is not brawn that is the sole requirement, defense too needs brains. Both men and women can put their expertise to real use.\n\nThirdly, one of the many objectives of the National Service program is to instill national unity. National integration cuts across race, culture, color, creed, religion, language and origins. National bonding is not meant for the male fraternity, it is also the right of the female to be wholly involved in fostering ties.\n\nNext, both boys and girls need discipline and what better way to instill the \"military\" discipline our youths need than via the national service. No, our youths are not indisciplined but a reminder and a dose of the \"no-nonsense\" military style is good for the heart and soul. Discipline is an ingredient that when applied justly and with the right blend of freedom is an antidote for the many ills of society. Of course, girls and boys need the discipline.\n\nFinally, national service addresses the many social problems of unhealthy youths. Youths, be they males or females need to be physically healthy and national service applies this maxim quite religiously. National service too addresses the problems of book knowledge to practical knowledge. Living skills are taught and trainees can specialize in a field of their choice. Our youths need to be exposed to\nsurvival skills and national service program fulfils this pressing need for our youths to be mature.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate that the national service is for all youths, not only for the males and not for females. National service is a program that fulfils the aspirations of the country to nurture youths of both sexes to contribute intelligently towards nation building and national integration. We cannot separate roles for the roles are complementary. Success can be attained with active participation by both sexes. National service is for both males and females.\n\nI rest my case. Thank you."

Just then, the doorbell sounded. \"Did Mummy forget her keys?\" I wondered aloud. \"Coming!\" I called out.\n\nWhen I opened the door, it was a courier who greeted me. That alone was puzzling enough. \"Good afternoon,\" he greeted me pleasantly with an earnest smile. \"I have a parcel for Miss Karen Lim.\"\n\nNow, that was really strange!

It was very light! Then, he left. Unable to contain my excitement any longer, I opened the parcel on the spot. It was a small soft toy that was rather adorable. Under it was a note.

All the niceties that I had planned to say flew out the window the moment nervousness took over.\n\nMarcus did not say anything. He gave me an incredulous look. I could feel another thirty pairs of eyes boring into my back. I knew that I was blushing as I felt very warm all of a sudden. \"This isn't from me!\" he blurted finally.

He sucked in his breath and staggered backwards from the shock. Everyone else froze as they gaped at the grisly sight. The culprits's earlier fearlessness was now replaced by cold fear. As Edwin collapsed onto the ground and soon lost consciousness, the gravity of his actions dawned upon the leader of the rival gang.\n\n\"Run! Run!\" someone shouted. Everybody took to their heels, scattering in all directions, except for the culprit and me. He fell to his knees, still staring at Edwin, his face as white as a sheet.

In no time, all involved in the brawl were rounded up. It was most fortunate that Edwin survived, but I broke off all ties with him after that."

We are pleased that you have decided to enrol as members of the club.\nI am sure many of you, if not all are computer-savvy and you know the basics of computer usage. At the same time I am sure most of you have a computer set at home with internet connection. For those who do not have a personal computer, we have five computers solely meant for members, especially for those without one, to acquaint themselves with the ins and outs of computer technology.\n\nIn addition, we have a club philosophy which is \"Share knowledge\". To this end, members who are better than the other members are encouraged to share their expertise with other members.\n\nToday, I would like to talk about rules for forwarding emails. We know there are rules. We know we need to follow certain procedures but sometimes, unfortunately, we forget and we thoughtlessly hit the \"send\" button.\n\nDaily, emails flow in and netizens are wary about asking relatives, friends, associates to stop forwarding attachments, chain emails, political commentary or jokes that are so prevalent offline.\n\nHere are five rules for forwarding emails that those who are truly thoughtful adhere to.\n\nFirst, do not forward anything without editing out all the forwarding, email addresses, headers and commentary from all the other forwarders. Please do not make your relatives and friends to have to look through all the gobbly-gook to see what it is that you thought was worth forwarding. If you want to forward, only forward the actual \"content\" of the email that you think is valuable.\n\nSecond, if you cannot take the time to write a personal comment at the top of your forwarded email to the person you are sending to, then you should not forward the mail.\n\nThird, think carefully about the value of what you are forwarding. Is it accurate information? Is it going to be appreciated, something that the recipient needs? Is it truly humorous, a sense of humour that the recipient shares with you? Is it worthy? Should you not be able to think of why the recipient would like to receive the email, do not forward it.\n\nFourth, reconsider forwarding chain mail. Forwarding chain mail, virus warnings or anything that says \"forward to everyone you know\" should not be forwarded because they are often commentaries that many would not appreciate. If you must forward emails of this type because you cannot help yourself, please do check @ Snopes.com to be sure that what you are forwarding is not a hoax.\n\nFifthly and finally, put your email address in the TO: field if you must forward to more than one person, and all the others you are sending to in the BCC field to protect their email address from being published to those they do not know. Take the time to type a nice little comment about why you are forwarding the email at the top of your forward.\n\nThe five rules above will help qualify if an email is worth forwarding and the right way to do so. Should you be asked to stop forwarding, do not get angry. The person at the other end has the right to make that request.\n\nTo sum it all up, at the end of the day, if you fear hurting or angering the persons' feelings by asking them to stop forwarding email, then just hit DELETE!"

        "content": "(Mode: Comparison & contrast )\n\nWhat do you think about film-makers adapting books into films ?\n \nThere is a growing trend for film scriptwriters to adapt multi-million bestsellers into multi-million box office hits. Writers have earned more millions from their books. Some writers just love the film versions, some are horrified at to how the films have turned out.\nSome writers have their royalties and subject matter protected both in the printed edition as well as in the film version. Nothing can be changed at all and if any alterations are made, they are deemed as absolutely necessary in the film production. The writer and the scriptwriters work hand in hand. Then in case of any dispute, there comes a compromise and film techniques dictate the final choice. Besides, every aspect of filming has to be taken into account for any scene to be pronounced suitable. Moreover, there have been writers who sit on the sets and are totally involved in the directing and producing of the film itself.\n\nThen some writers sell away all their rights to the books, allowing the producers, directors, scriptwriters and the film moghuls to do as they like with the text. They might use the theme, plot, setting and names of characters but there may be changes in the characters' personalities and roles. It is as though everything about the original has been totally erased. What remains is the title. The writer has no inkling at all of how the masterpiece has been mutilated and re-pieced to join the list of films that have grossed billions. The writer would only realise how little or how much has been \"added\" or \"deleted\" when he is invited to the premiere.\n\nFilm adaptations of books through the ages have been so prolific that it is impossible to list all. We know that besides novels, films have been based on religious and secular classics, plays, cartoon strips, one liners, people and even animals. On the reverse is that some films have become so famous that they have been remodeled as books. If children so loved the films then to help them to take to reading, write a book.\n\nThe one advantage I like about book films is that the book becomes alive for the reader. Then the characters are live personalities and in the flesh. The plot becomes clearer and the setting brings the world of the book right into the living room. Needless to say for literature buffs, the text comes alive and meaningful. Reading gets more exciting for seeing is believing and believing is remembering. JK Rowling's fans\nand Harry Potter's diehards will certainly vouch for the total immersion.\n\nAs long as there are budding writers and as long as there are gifted film-makers, there will never be a dearth of book films."

Participants have already agreed to carry out whatever is asked of them by the presenter. The acts would be in keeping with the theme of the show.\nReality shows have different objectives. Shows like \"American Idol, The Apprentice, Akademi Fantasia, Gang Starz, Kickstart, So You Can Dance, Please Give Me a job\" are talent shows. Participants are lined up to showcase their talents after some grooming and some acid comments by panels of judges. To add excitement to these talent shows, the audience and viewers play a crucial role : they cast their votes via their mobiles. Their votes are tabulated and the final result depends on the votes of the public.\n\nAnother objective is to give opportunities for the participants to channel their robust energies and their keen sense of adventure into controlled dare devil actions as in \"Fear Factor \"and \"Survivor\".\n\nAt the same time, there are shows which have no other objective except as pure fun entertainment where participants indulge in child-like games and sports.\n\nSome shows are just pure chance as in Deal or No Deal. You have the luck, you get the prize.\n\nNot all reality shows come with the dangling carrot of a prize money. Sometimes such shows are for research and developmental programs. There was one such reality show where 20th century English teenagers experienced 18th century English boarding life. They had no mobile phones, no ballpoints, no hot baths and no computers. It was an experience not to be missed and makes us appreciative of the\nmodern conveniences.\n\nAlmost all the reality shows come with a lucrative prize - a million dollar contract, prize money, goodies and fame. If you are declared the winner, you take home all the goodies. If you are not, you are still viewed by millions, you taste adulation and fame for a space in time. However, there have been instances where the winner is not that popular but the runners-up are. You never know the idiosyncrasies of viewers.\n\nSometimes, there are the minus points whereby presenters made the participants do all kinds of funny silly things. To be a participant, one has to learn to take losing with a smile and not begrudge the winner his win and fame.\n\nSponsors of reality shows have benefited greatly. Telcos have enriched their coffers with billions of votes via the mobiles. Co-sponsors have their products and services sourced by viewers. Presenters and franchise holders of these shows become household names. Ratings for television stations and cable TV soar.\n\nIt is hoped that the monetary gains by everyone involved would be channeled towards viewers because without these \"supporters\", the reality shows would not be in vogue."

        "title": "Bullying",
        "content": "(Mode: Forms, reasons & solutions )\n\nDescribe bullying in the school environment, its forms, reasons and solutions.\n \nBullying is a common occurrence in most schools. Bullying occurs when a group of students isolate one student and get on-lookers to support or remain neutral. Bullies taunt and tease before physically bullying the target. Bullying can happen to anyone, regardless of their status. Bullying occurs in any age group but is particularly prominent between the ages of 9 to 18. Bullying types cover the range of physical, emotional, verbal, cyber and sexual bullying.\nThere are several different types of bullies: confident, social, fully armored, hyperactive, bullied bully, a bunch or gang of bullies. Bullies come in all shapes and sizes. Girls and boys are both bullies. Girls are verbal social bullies: spreading rumors, breaking up friendships. Boys are more physical bullies: hitting, punching, and slapping. Bullies are typically overly concerned about their appearance and their popularity standings. They have an urge to dominate, or be in charge of others. Bullies are usually easily pressured by their peers and feel the need to impress them.\n\nStudents become bullies for many reasons. They want to impress their peers. They were once bullied themselves and now feel big in bullying others. Some even do it as retaliation for being punished in school.\n\nHow do we identify bullies? They are usually viewed as loud and assertive and may even be hostile in particular situations. Bullies are not usually the largest kids in a class, but may be part of the popular or cool kids group. The bullies that are part of a popular group may not come from intense disciplinary homes, rather they gain acceptance from the peer group by bullying a victim.\n\nThen how do we recognize the bullied? Victims of bullying are physically smaller, more sensitive, unhappy, cautious, anxious, quiet, and withdrawn. They are often described as submissive. With these qualities, they are vulnerable to being victimized.\n\nThere are short-term and long-term effects of bullying. The short-term effects include depression, suicide, anxiety, anger and poor school performance. The long-term effects result in feelings of insecurity, lack of trust, extreme insensitivity and a need for revenge.\n\nWhat can we do to reduce school bullying? It calls for a concerted effort, beginning right at the pinnacle (Ministry of Education) down to the staff base, students and parents. Everyone has a role to play because of the dynamics of the situation.\n\nHere are some strategies to help reduce bullying in schools. Adults need to know what is happening to their children. They should teach their children to defend themselves, verbally and physically. Affirm that bullying is never acceptable. Emphasize caring, respect and safety. Enforce consistent and immediate consequences for aggressive behaviors. Encourage positive peer relations. Improve communication among all stakeholders.\n\nStakeholders can formulate strategies to address the issue of bullying. However, for bullying to disappear from the school environment, two aspects need to happen. One is for the bullies to realize their behavior is unacceptable and they should be disciplined and counseled. The other is for the bullied to stand up for justice and fair play.\n\nIn the course of growing up from a child to an adolescent teenager to an adult, some forms of physical horse play and innocent emotional teasing are inevitable. The \"so-called bullies\" should know their limits when to stop \"fooling around\" and the \"so-called bullied\" should be less sensitive and accept such \"name-calling\" as \"part and parcel\" of growing up."

        "content": "(Mode: Definition & description )\n\nWhat happens when you are on school vacations ?\n \nWhat are school vacations ? School vacations come but four times a year with festival perks in between.\nMid-term breaks, half and end of year holiday stretches are supposed to be respites and freedom from school chores. Sometimes, they are but in most cases they are not, especially when you are in an examination year.\n\nMaybe with the suggested abolition of 2 public examinations in the pipeline, there may be a shift in the mindset of parents and educationists.\n\nThe present scenario is whenever vacations are around the corner, students see teachers churning out worksheets to be summarily distributed to them. We are told to complete them and hand them within the first week of our return to the hallowed halls of the school.\n\nJust picture the look of dismay on our faces. Add to this dismal feeling is one teacher's comment, \"I'm sorry. Just do them as soon as you can, today if you can and complete all before you go on that break. The sooner the better.\" She usually collects a stack of half completed exercises on our return. Then she spends the whole first week \"vomiting\" the responses. She does not say anything. She neither comments\non the unfinished work nor chides us on our attitude but not when it comes to her daily work, she gives no quarter. The only time we can afford to be lax is the holiday work. Maybe she understands that we want to let our hair down and totally immerse ourselves in our vacation.\n\nHowever not all educators react to our ineptitude with such understanding. Some are rather caustic and are the epitome of utter despair at our nonchalance.\n\nFurthermore, there are overzealous administrators who think nothing of having remedial plus reinforcement classes during holidays. Don't we have enough of these during semester time? Come on, give us a break! We need it from all the stress and boredom of studying!\n\nIn addition to the educators, we have our \"kiasu\" parents who jump on the bandwagon and enrol us for \"educational camps\". They are assured most suggestively by the course providers that we need that extra boost to stand head and shoulders above the ordinary student.\n\nShould we be \"victims \" of the tuition syndrome, classes continue ad infinitum. I know parents wish us to be young Einsteins or Bill Gates or Ibn Battuta or Tagore or Confucius, all younger modern versions of these successes. What is more important is we need to enjoy the days of our childhood and teen years before we are thrown to the adult wolves.\n\nMoreover, I have seen parents lugging school books to picnic grounds and holiday resorts where after all the \"holiday\" perks have been indulged in, the poor kids have to do some activity for the brain.\n\nNevertheless, there are some adults who really and truly take a break from work and pleasure. They realize the need for a total break, they do it for themselves and they allow their children to enjoy the luxury too. No handphones, no calls, no papers: a total no-man's atmosphere.\n\nI have a mixture of the two: some schoolwork, some classes and some kind of a vacation during the year. But at the end of the year, I put my foot down. I want my holiday and believe me, I do get that vacation. It is that time of the year when I look forward to the vacation of the year."

        "content": "You are explaining the advantages and disadvantages of some tuition to an audience of parents.\n \nIt is the trend these days for students, especially those in examination classes to attend tuition. Tuition classes are additional classes where students are offered revision, supplementary, additional, intensive, reinforcing or preparatory lessons. Where do they go for tuition? In private homes under private tutors or commercialized tuition centers under contract tutors.\nThe first advantage is home tutors usually specialize or have carved a name for themselves in particular subjects. Their knowledge is first-rate and they convey the right information to their charges. Their outlook is professional. On the other hand, beware, the disadvantage is there are some home tutors who are just interested in \"moonlighting\" for the additional income. They are not truly qualified to teach the subjects.\n\nThe second advantage is some are passionate about their \"trade\" and ensure quality teaching where students' skills are honed and sharpened. Then again, the second disadvantage is some are totally uncommitted and unprofessional and they compromise on the quality of teaching.\n\nThe third advantage is they try to keep the numbers small, depending on the space they have in their homes which they have converted into a classroom. Numbers usually do not go beyond a certain figure. The small number enables students to be given personal attention which is sorely lacking in schools where a class can be as big as 50. In addition, the tutor gets to know the students well and is hence able to guide his charges better.\n\nHowever, at times, the classes are overcrowded as there are too many students who have heard of the tutor who has produced straight A stars.\n\nUnfortunately, it has been rumored that some tutors are very selective as to whom they tutor. They do not accept everyone for reasons best know to them.\n\nThe final advantage is the homely home environment in spacious, well-lit, airy (or sometimes air-conditions) \"home\" classrooms which encourages spirited learning. The conducive environment ensures comfort and interest. However, the final disadvantage is some home tuition rooms are just too small and overcrowded and most uncomfortable.\n\nWhat is the parents' choice? Parents have to understand the concept of tuition: to help to improve or to ensure excellence. Parents have to understand the needs of the child. Based on the needs of the child, decide whether the child requires tuition. Fashion trends need not be followed blindly. Should a child genuinely feel he is able to cope handsomely without the paid aid of tuition, believe him. He knows best. On the other hand, if he requests for tuition and he genuinely attends the class, let him have the luxury of such instruction.\n\nA teen: an adolescent needs to be a child as well as a teenager: Childhood and adolescence come but once in a lifetime. Let there be a balance between study and play."

        "content": "Where would you go for medical treatment ? Discuss the pros and cons of seeking treatment at a government hospital.\n \nThe health industry in Malaysia is considered well developed in Asia. We have both government-run hospitals and health clinics as well as private clinics and specialist hospitals.\nFirstly, government hospitals are financed by the government and annual allocations run into billions of ringgit to upgrade services and facilities including expansion. Money is not the first concern, quality health\ncare is. Patients do pay a fee which is heavily subsidized by the government. Anyone seeking emergency treatment at any government hospital is treated first before the question of money or payment is brought up. One would be correct to say that the government hospital is the hospital for the poor or the needy.\n\nOn the other hand, non-governmental hospitals are run by individuals or a group or a consortium whose objective is to turn it into a money-churning enterprise. Rightly so, they have to get returns on their investments. Not everyone can afford to pay the charges levied. One could logically conclude that these non-governmental hospitals cater mainly for the rich.\n\nSecondly, government hospitals are staffed by trained professionals in every department. Administrators, specialists, doctors, nurses, technicians and the support staff are efficient and their work skills are constantly upgraded via courses and advanced training. Furthermore, because of the networking system, the medical staff are given opportunities to multitask. In addition, junior medical personnel have access to referral and consultation liaison with their seniors and specialists.\n\nHowever, these government-run agencies are marred by staff shortages and transfers. Then, because of the large numbers seeking treatment at government hospitals, medical personnel are overworked and inevitably, the service does slack and become lax. Patients who need to continue with follow-up sessions seldom, if ever, have consultation sessions with the same doctor. Such a scenario does not happen in a private setup.\n\nThirdly, government hospitals are found throughout the country and available to the public twenty-four hours of the day. The system allows patients to seek treatment where they are and not have to go a hundred kilometers away. Patients can be transferred from one hospital to the next or be referred to another hospital for further to treatment.\n\nOn the contrary, the private clinics are opened for a specified number of hours per day and are even closed on certain days. It cannot be denied that some clinics are 24-hour clinics and patients can avail themselves of such a service. Private practitioners do make house calls unlike government doctors.\n\nBased on the above reasons, one could say that government hospitals is the first choice of people in the country. The crowded polyclinics in the urban and suburban areas bear testimony to this fact."

        "content": "What is the role of community colleges in Malaysia ?\n \nFebruary 2007 saw the rebranding of the community college program by the Prime Minister.\nWhen the community college program was first mooted in 1999, it was meant as an answer to school leavers who could not get into university. It was a chance to acquire a skill or trade and to gain employment or even undertake self-employment. At that juncture, the community college was nothing but an alternative route for secondary school leavers. This was reinforced by the offer of only certificate-level courses or short non-credit courses, very much so like the industrial training institutes, Mara's youth training schemes or any other institution of further education but not pre-u college or university.\n\nIt is apparently clear that the rebranding of community colleges changes the above concept. The university entrants who are unsuccessful in securing places at public and private institutions of higher learning have a better route. It is not the straightforward academic track from secondary school to university. They have an alternative education track in their future career paths.\n\nFurthermore, the community college is not a dead-end path. to education and entry into the work force but a viable alternative possibility for the non-academically inclined person. He is given the opportunity to re-enter the academic path at a later opportune time when he is more prepared mentally.\n\nIn addition, the \"circularity\" nature of the community college path to higher education allows the knowledge-seeker to move in and out of ever available higher education as he climbs up his career path. Hence, age poses no restrictions to education and \"maturity\" is used as a legitimate entry qualification plus yardstick for higher education.\n\nWhat is even more relevant is that the community college assumes the role of the central institution for life-long learning in line with role of the Open University and Wawasan University.\n\nThe significance of community college becomes even more significant with the offer of diploma courses. Such a move presents the students with the opportunity to move into the realm of full-time tertiary education at public and private universities.\n\nThe annual 2007 Budget sees additional funding for community colleges and with the open door policy where these colleges cater for all, almost every one is eligible. The opening of branch campuses of more established community colleges will bring educational opportunities to far-flung and underserved parliamentary constituencies. Moreover the Ninth Malaysian Plan intends to construct community colleges in at least 200 constituencies.\n\nUltimately, the human capital development will be given its much needed thrust. The skill level of the Malaysian work force will be raised. Productivity will be enhanced. Employment growth and self employment will be maximized. Jobs will be created.\n\nGiven time and the right support, community colleges will take its appropriate place in the overall national education system. A community college is definitely not a second-chance institution; it will soon be the first choice."

Should we ignore the signs, then the wrath of nature knows no bounds.\nA United Nations report stated that the mid 2111 century would be the age of serious water shortage. The off hand remark from many Malaysians would be \"Oh, that won't be our problem. We have more than enough water. Why worry!\". But seriously, the day would come when the children of this century stand on the brink of retirement, they may not have the luxury of showering twice a day or washing cars twice a week. The billion-ringgit question is \"Do we care?\"\n\nWe should! Malaysians have become extravagant in the use of water and have forgotten the value attached to the use of water. According to the Federation of Malaysian Consumers Association, local water consumption is between 285 - 500 liters per day per person whilst the UN recommends water usage level at 160 liters per day per person. Obviously, we have exceeded the quantum, the quota just because we have excess water now. In addition, using treated water for non-essential purposes is sheer waste. What more is the increased water bill which in most households is quite, quite unnecessarily high.\n\nCollecting rainwater should be practiced among the people. They should be made aware of the depleting nature of natural water supply (rivers, lakes, underground water sources) for treated water. Using treated water for essential purposes efficiently is a long term government energy efficiency program.\n\nRainwater harvesting is the norm in the plantations on Carey Island. Residents collect rainwater and use it to water plants and wash cars. It is not a novelty. They have been doing it for the past twenty-five years.\n\nThe houses have been built with a gutter system that channels rainwater from the roof into large water tanks placed outside the houses. With pipes attached to the tanks, water flows out from taps, just like treated water.\n\nInitially the system was first built as treated pipe water was unavailable in these remote plantations. To cut cost of treating river water, the employer built the rainwater harvesting system for non-essential purposes.\n\nAccording to the Bandar Utama Group which runs the I Utama and Centrepoint Shopping malls, their rainwater harvesting system in the new wing saves them around 30% a year in their water bills. Two million gallons of rainwater in storage tanks is used for flushing toilets, watering the landscape and pumping into the air cooling towers.\n\nGreen architecture is the buzzword in building concept. Rightly so. The Malaysian government is planning to introduce by-laws requiring certain buildings (bungalows, schools, building complexes and manufacturing plants are the targets) to be equipped with devices to collect, store and use rainwater.\n\nIf trees can do it and animals can do it, so humans can do it, too. In the face of a growing possibility that a future water shortage is imminent, it is only sensible, logical and self-preserving to make the most of rainwater. Why not try harvesting rain? Start out small with pails when it rains and when your budget allows it, install the gutters, piping and the water tanks.\n\nWhat have you got to lose? The answer is \"Nothing but with everything to gain..\" Try it!"

The word \"fair\" suggests a reasonable price though I fear the word `fair\" in this instance refers to a bazaar!\nA book fair is generally a great way to pick up a wide assortment of books at reasonable prices. To make the event more interesting there would be autograph signing sessions with both local and foreign writers as well as other related activities for children and teenagers.\n\nA book fair is generally held in a very large area to accommodate the stock of the various vendors and exhibitors, in this case, the printers and publishers. In the publishing industry, book fairs are held year round in varied locations usually in the cities, and they are often associated with trade shows or warehouse sales.\n\nMalaysia has also jumped on the bandwagon. We have had the KL Book Fair, the Malaysia International Book and Education Fair, \"Pesta Buku Antarabangsa\", Bookfest @ Malaysia, Book Fairs hosted by MPH, Times and Popular, the 2011 Malaysia International Book Fair which was touted as the third Mega Book Fair, and the Big Bad Wolf Book Fair showcasing 1.5 million books.\n\nThe largest floating Book Fair, Logos Hope harbored in Malaysian waters in Penang and Port Klang. Visitors were allowed to go on board to buy books as well as explore the ship. They exchanged information with the multi-national crew members.\n\nAre these Book Fairs worth visiting? There are a few features in their favor.\n\nAs prices have been slashed drastically, the books on sale are very reasonably priced. In fact, they are going for a song! A classic example was the book \"The Secret\" by Rhonda Bryce which was sold at RM14.00 (Hard cover edition) compared to the original price of RM78.90 at the Big Bad Wolf Book Fair 2011. The books were real cheap! The Big Bad Wolf Book Fair 2011 sold books at a 75 to\n95 % discount.\n\nThen at these fairs, there are books of different genres, from pre-school to children to teenager to adult titles. There is a variety of titles to pick from and you can be spoilt for choice. If you know what you want to buy, there would be no problem. In browsing through the books, you may end up picking books you may not actually want to buy but because of the attractive \"low\" price, you may be attempted to overspend.\n\nThen the organizers of the Big Bad Wolf Book Fair believed in an Aftermath Splash! in 2011. For five days after the Big Book Fair, all the scratched, damaged and left over books went off at RM5.00 and below. This was a fantastic offer which was irresistible!\n\nHowever, there are certain factors that are not so favorable.\n\nSometimes the books at these fairs are not up-to-date. Then they are mainly in English. There are more books for children than for adults.\n\nIn addition there would be an overabundance of books on one genre. A good example is Cookery books. There is also a common practice among booksellers: to wrap their books in see-through plastic. This prevents an interested buyer from browsing. The booksellers have their reasons but how is a prospective buyer to gauge the book without looking at the contents?\n\nThe Book Fairs are usually held in a huge area where the organizers can house all the vendors' publications. Organizers have to plan for security, easy access, parking facilities, shuttle services and comprehensive signs and directions. Should one of these features be missing, it can cause chaos and delays.\n\nBook fairs play an important role in promoting reading for knowledge and life-long re-education among Malaysians."

What are the contributory factors and what can be done to reduce road accidents ?\n \nStatistics compiled by the Royal Malaysian Police revealed that the highest rate of deaths and accidents are among those aged 16 and 25 followed closely by those between 26 and 35. Together, they made up for 58.5% of deaths on the roads. The statistics covered the period of three years from 2004 to 2006.\nThe majority of road accidents involved young adult motorcyclists. Motorcycles are considered to be the most dangerous form of transport. It is often described as an unprotected mode of transport. Young motorcyclists are therefore the most vulnerable on the roads.\n\nFurthermore, it is also regarded as a relatively quicker and cheaper way of getting around. It takes an average of 30 to 35 minutes to get from one point to another in the Klang Valley. In terms of cost, motorcyclists spend less than RM18.00 a week. Besides, there is no need to pay toll, an added bonus and savings.\n\nBesides the factor of the motorcycle itself, there is the young blood factor to be considered. They speed. They beat red lights. They overtake and perform indiscriminate lane change. They perform stunts on the roads. They get thrills from being macho and dare devils.\n\nIt is a common tendency for the young throughout the world to underestimate their road craft. They think their reflex actions are quicker and their driving skills are better than most.\n\nSome younger people think they are invincible. They think nothing will happen to them. It can happen to others but not to them. Compared to the older people, the young are reckless, impulsive, fearless and immature.\n\nAnother interesting aspect to note is that although there is a tendency for young road users between 16 to 35 to show high-risk behavior, they also make up a high number of road users. Naturally there is a higher representation of them in the overall statistics.\n\nAnother factor that is often ignored is the machine itself. The vehicles may not be road worthy, being poorly maintained or of inferior quality. A further consideration is road and weather conditions, quite beyond the control of mere mortals.\n\nThe introduction of a new driving curriculum by the Road Transport Department to include defensive driving skills may help reduce accidents and bring about a breed of mature young drivers by year end (2007).\n\nWikipedia defines defensive driving as a form of training for motor vehicle drivers that goes beyond the mastery of the rules of the road and the basic mechanics of driving. It aims to reduce the risk of accidents by anticipating dangerous situations despite adverse conditions or the mistakes of others. Learners learn a variety of general rules as well as the practice of specific driving techniques. Defensive driving skills are available for both motorists and motorcyclists. It is hoped that defensive driving courses can help wipe out the fallacy that you are king of the road, you rule the road once you are behind the wheel.\n\nOverall, Malaysian road users do lack basic road courtesy. Changing the attitude and the mindset may go a long way towards reducing fatal road accidents."

        "content": "Peace is a state of quiet and stability. If a country is at peace, there is order, harmony, and tolerance. Its people feel secure and live in relative prosperity. If there is peace in every country, there will be peace in the world. Sadly, world peace is but a dream.\nThroughout history, there have been wars; with the two world wars in the 20th century being the most well-remembered. No region in the world has been spared. The African continent has endured more than 20 civil wars since 2005. One of the more recent conflicts is the Syrian revolution which has caused the death of more than 70,000 people by early 2013. North Korea, China, Pakistan and Iran continue to arm themselves with nuclear weapons and there are fears of a third world war where these weapons will be unleashed. One thing is for sure, there are no fears of another war after that because the earth would be totally destroyed if there were a nuclear war.\n\nWhat causes these conflicts that destroy peace and lives? Peace is threatened by a combination of factors. The most common causes are greed for resources, thirst for power and disagreement in ideologies. Many conflicts are a result of one nation coveting another's resources which include land, water, and oil. Others are due to a leader's desire to extend his territory and power. Great historical conquerors such as Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan went to war with many countries for both reasons. In modem times, many conflicts have arisen due to different interests and ideologies. As long as these factors exist, peace can never be achieved. It is the nature of man, his greed, desire to rule over others and intolerance that has led to violence and destruction through the centuries.\n\nDoes this mean that there is no hope for a peaceful world? Perhaps not. There are groups of people across the globe that believe something can be done to work towards world peace. The first step is to start with ourselves. We must practise self-control and tolerance personally. We need to teach our children to shun violence, to accept differences and to turn the other cheek. When harmonious relationships become a way of life in a nation, there will be peace in that nation. And if every nation adopts a culture of peace and harmony, there is hope that the world will be at peace.\n\nThe key to world peace lies in your hand and mine. It begins with us. Embrace peace as a personal value, pass on the message to others, support peacekeeping efforts at every level and see things change. We have the power to make world peace a reality."

        "content": "Tomorrow. What crosses your mind when you think of tomorrow? Some people think of the future literally as the next day. To others, it means the unknown. To me, it signifies hope. Let me tell you a story.\nEvery day, on the way to and from school I pass by a children's hospital. One morning, as I was hurrying to school, I noticed a child staring out of a small window on the first floor. The next minute I tripped and sprawled on the ground. As I slowly pulled myself up and dusted myself off, I looked up again and saw the child laughing. In spite of my situation, I was pleased to have made someone laugh. I bowed as though I were a performer. The child clapped and waved at me. As I stepped closer, I saw that the girl's head was bald, a sign that she was a cancer patient. I quickly waved one last time to her before hobbling off towards the school.\n\nThe next morning and the next, I looked out for the little girl and waved to her, doing a little jig just to make her laugh. I thought about her and wondered what her life must be like. 'Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.' Those lines from a Shakespearean poem I had learnt in school came to my mind. Was that how the child lived from day to day?\n\nI felt the urge to visit the child. I went to the hospital and looked for the room facing the road. I found the little girl. She was thin and pale. When she saw me, her eyes widened with recognition and she welcomed me with a shy smile. I talked to her a bit and learnt her name, Suki. The nurse who saw me talking to her later told me that Suki was a leukemia patient. Her navy officer father was a widower and was on duty outside the country. The nurse encouraged me to visit Suki so that she would not be so lonesome. As I was leaving, Suki called to me, `Tomorrow?' I understood and said, 'Yes, tomorrow.'\n\nAfter that, I popped in to visit Suki after school every day. We played card games, Scrabble and read together. Even though, Suki was only ten, I found that I could get along with her very well. I was not visiting her out of pity. I really looked forward to her company. At the end of each visit, she always asked, `Tomorrow?' and my reply was always, 'Yes, tomorrow.'\n\nTwo months later, Suki told me the good news. She was well enough to be discharged from hospital. On the day that was scheduled for her father to take her home, I visited her one last time. She gave me an envelope and said that it contained her email address. I promised to write. After Suki left, I opened the envelope. It was a short letter. Suki thanked me and told me how my answer to her question 'Tomorrow?' had given her hope from day to day. She believed that she recovered because of this. At the end of the letter, she wrote `Tomorrow?' followed by her email address. I smiled and said to myself, 'Yes, Suki, tomorrow.'"

Everyone wants to be recognized for his or her talent or efforts, to win over others or overcome circumstances to attain this precious thing called success. Unfortunately, some may focus so much on success, that they do not care how they get it.\nTo me, success is not something I want so badly that I would want to achieve it by hook or by crook. Some people desire success so badly that they use questionable means to achieve it. If I were to do that, I would lose my integrity and self-respect in the end.\n\nIf success were to be my top priority in life, I might neglect other aspects of life that are important. Focusing too much on achieving success would make me overly competitive. I would become insensitive to others' feelings and not even regard people as people but only as a means to my reaching my goal. I will lose people's friendship and respect which would leave me lonely and unhappy.\n\nIf I allow success to be all-important to me, failure to achieve it will affect me deeply. It would not be easy to deal with disappointment and dejection. Since my days and hours are concentrated on achieving success in what I want, there would be a great sense of emptiness if I do not achieve it. This is another reason why it is unwise to be too preoccupied with success.\n\nI believe that success is not something we should think about too much. Rather, success is something that comes naturally when we do our best in whatever we do. If we do our best and fail, we still feel good\nabout ourselves. We then learn from our mistakes and try again. And that is how success will come to us. I doubt we can avoid it when we try our best and use our past experience to help us make better decisions.\n\nHence, my idea of success is that it should not be our main focus in life. We should not make it so important that we do not care how we achieve it. We should not focus on it so much that we forget other"

I am left with just my thoughts and memories.\nI remember when Father came home with a big box. Daniel and I were so excited as we watched him open the box. He took out colorful bits and pieces which he assembled into a ride-on car. Daniel and I fought to be first to try it out. Being the older and stronger one, I won. I sat down and pushed with my feet and the car rolled forward. I remember laughing with delight while Daniel wailed. Our father made sure Daniel had his turn. It was our favorite toy for two years and the cause of many quarrels too.\n\nDaniel. I wonder where he is, my brother who is just a year younger than I am. When we were in primary school, Father bought us bicycles. We learnt to ride the bicycles quickly. Daniel's sense of balance was not good so he fell off his bicycle twice as often as I did. I remember the day when we could go cycling in the park together. Daniel was steady enough but he did not like to go too fast as he could not stop properly. Sometimes I would race ahead and then double back to let him catch up. It was fun for both of us.\n\nOur old bicycles are still in our backyard. I have not used mine in the past two years. Not since I got my motorcycle. I remember the day I became the owner of this powerful machine. It was my seventeenth\nbirthday. Father took me to the motorcycle shop to pick the model I wanted. It was the most exciting day of my life. I became independent. I could go anywhere I wanted. Daniel was envious but did not fuss because I started ferrying him wherever he needed to go after I got my license.\n\nI remember when Daniel turned seventeen and became bolder. He wanted his own motorcycle but he had to prove to Father that he was not afraid to ride on his own first, so he practiced on my motorcycle. I watched him like a hawk, afraid that he would damage my precious possession or injure himself. I remember the day we rode to the park for him to practice. The ground was wet after a shower. I watched him from the pavement. I remember ... my phone ringing ...I was taking it out of my pocket ...I heard Daniel's voice screaming, 'I can't stop!'.. .I looked up ... and Daniel was heading straight at me on the motorcycle.\n\nI cannot hear anything now. No, wait, I think I can hear someone weeping. It sounds like Daniel or Father. I try to call out to him but my body will not respond. How long have I been here? A long time, it seems. There is nothing to do, but to sift through my memories again."

Ahmid expertly shaved some ice into a plastic bowl and poured syrup and coconut milk over it. He handed it to the customer with a cheerful smile and thanked him for the payment. After finishing the dessert, the man asked Ahmid, 'How's business?' Ahmid replied that business was slow because it was the rainy season. 'Then why are you so happy?' asked the man.\nWith a wide smile, Ahmid said, `I'm happy because I'm alive and well.'\n\n'But you might earn very little money today. How can you smile like that?'\n\nAhmid's smile widened, 'It's all right. When I think of my family waiting for me, I'm happy.'\n\nThe rich man replied sadly, 'I wish I could find happiness like you.' With a sigh, he got into his car and drove away.\n\nLike the rich man, everyone seems to be searching for happiness. They try to find it through their achievements, material possessions, friends and entertainment. Some look for it by taking drugs and getting involved in crime. But truly, the secret to happiness lies in the cendol seller's reply.\n\nIf you enjoy each moment and each day as it comes, you will be happy. Focus on the present. The past is over, so do not dwell on what might have been. Tomorrow is yet to be so there is no point worrying\nahead of time. You are alive. Be thankful and enjoy the day. Smile often.\n\nAhmid the cendol seller did not have much money but he was contented with what he had. If he compared himself to his customer who dressed so well and drove a luxury car, he would be unhappy. So another secret to happiness is not to make money your goal in life if you want happiness. Those who think that having more money will make them happy will find that money is never enough. They look at what they have and they desire more. They focus all their time and energy in gathering wealth and they never enjoy what they have. How can they be happy then?\n\nThe other secret to happiness Ahmid shared with his customer is to treasure relationships. Knowing that you are important to someone will make you feel happy. You should invest time to build and strengthen relationships with family members and close friends if you want happiness. If you neglect the people in your life, you will end up sad and lonely even if you were to become a great success.\n\nHappiness is not as difficult to find as some people think. All you need to do is to be thankful for and to enjoy the present, to avoid making money the top priority in life, and to treasure relationships."

Would it make you feel gloomy and that everything is ugly and uninteresting? I am quite certain you would say yes to all these questions. We humans love colors.\nWe love colors because colors make our world beautiful. All things on earth have their own colors and hues. Even things of the same type may have many shades and colors. Flowers, for example, come in many colors. Roses come in a variety of colors such as white, yellow, red, pink, orange and even blue. The sky changes in color depending on the time and the season. The contrast between the colors of things makes the world more visually interesting. Man learnt from nature, and so the things that man make come in a variety of colors too. For example, mobile phones today come with a selection of colored covers so that users can choose the color they like best. They can also change the color of the phone whenever they wish.\n\nColors can also convey meanings. Red is the color of blood. So it traditionally signals danger. That is why danger signs are always red. However, red also represents energy and passion or love. Yellow is the color of sunshine so yellow signifies happiness. Green is the color of leaves and so it gives the impression of freshness, growth and safety. Blue is the color of the sky and the sea. Blue represents calmness, wisdom and truth. Besides these four primary colors, other colors and shades are also associated with specific meanings. Hence, colors are carefully chosen when dressing or when coloring a design in order to convey a non-verbal message.\n\nColors in fact have a strong effect on us. They can make us feel positive or negative. They can affect our mood. They can change our feelings towards an object or place. Restaurants use bright colors like red, yellow and orange to garnish their dishes because these colors increase the appetite. Each of us may find that we like certain colors more than others from young because the colors that attract us make us feel good. Once we recognize the colors that have a positive effect on us, we should surround ourselves with those colors.\n\nTo end, we should be thankful that our world is so colorful. The variety of colors makes our world beautiful. The different colors are associated with certain meanings and can convey an unspoken message. Colors do have the power to influence our emotions so it is essential to recognize which colors affect us positively."

Having a goal gives us a purpose and focus in life. To set that goal, I asked myself what I want to do for myself, my family, and my country. Finally, I have arrived at the answer. I want to make the world a better place by giving off my time, my talent and my wealth.\n\nThere are many things in the world that need fixing. There are people dying of hunger. There are people without homes. Our rivers are being poisoned. Global warming has made world climates go haywire. Some countries are on the brink of war. This is only the beginning of the list. Is there anything an ordinary person like me can do? Yes. I can contribute my time by joining organizations that champion worthy causes. Whatever I become in the future, I will make sure I spend a portion of my time to volunteer for a cause.\n\nTo make the world a better place does not mean I have to be a king or a president. I can still achieve my goal by using my talent to highlight things that need changing. I have a flair for photography. I will use my skill to capture pictures that will send a powerful message to the world to do something, to help, to change, or to correct. A picture paints a thousand words. My photographs will promote awareness of issues and problems that need people's attention. By creating this awareness, some of the problems may be solved.\n\nI will work hard to gain wealth but not for wealth's sake. I am confident that I will do well because of my determination and perseverance. The reality is that funding is important in any effort to solve the problems facing the world. Not only will I work at raising funds for worthy causes but I will contribute a portion of my wealth to support efforts to make life better for others less fortunate than I.\n\nHaving this goal in life makes one thing clear to me. I will not live not only for myself but for others. I must do my best in everything I do from now on starting with my studies. If I am going to make the world\na better place, I have to work hard. I am a ship with a rudder and hard work is going to get me to my destination."

        "content": "Everybody wants be loved. Every child, woman and man longs for love. Knowing that someone in the world loves you gives meaning to life, gives you strength to face troubles, warms your heart and makes you feel you can achieve anything. Being loved is important. Equally important is knowing what it means to love.\nIf you love someone, you would be willing to make sacrifices for that person. You would always put that person first. Take for example a parent's love for a child. A loving mother would make certain that the child is given the best even if it means that she has to sacrifice her own needs and wishes. A child would be willing to sacrifice a job with good prospects in order to stay near his parents and take care of them in their old age. Willingness to sacrifice time, money, effort and personal dreams is an indication of true love.\n\nIf you love someone, you would believe in him or her. Even if everyone else doubts your loved one, you would still have confidence in your beloved. For instance, the world may look down on a child who has learning difficulties but his parents would continue to believe that he will improve. They would encourage their child and help him to achieve his full potential. One good example of such a case is the mother of Albert Einstein. Albert's schoolteacher said he would never succeed in life because he is a slow learner. But Albert's mother did not stop believing in her son. She took him out of school and taught him at home. Can you imagine what would have happened if Albert's mother had listened to people and stopped believing in her son?\n\nIf you love someone, you would be loyal to that person. You would not speak badly of your beloved. You would not turn against him or her just because he or she made a mistake or hurt you. In fact, you would defend and protect your beloved. You would not allow your loved one to be hurt by others' words and criticism. You would stick by your loved one even if the whole world were to abandon him or her.\n\nLove is a funny thing. It is wonderful to be loved and it is even more wonderful to love someone. If you have not truly loved someone before, your life would be incomplete. Love's reward is happiness."

        "content": "`Beauty is only skin deep' it is said. This means that a person's appearance is not as important as his character. Yet it is strange why people and especially women are willing to spend a fortune on making themselves more attractive physically. The cosmetics and skincare industry is a multi-billion dollar business. This is true across the world. The reason can only be one, and it is that beauty has its advantages.\nAttractive people are more popular generally. Beauty draws a positive response from the beholder. This is obvious with children. For example, based on observation, there is a tendency for adults to treat good-looking children better. This favorable treatment continues into adulthood, as attractive people are more likely to be chosen for leadership positions and given more opportunities. Being well-treated gives attractive people more confidence and they perform better. It is found that tall, slim and handsome or beautiful people get promoted more easily and get better paid too.\n\nAnother important benefit that good-looking people enjoy is that they find a husband or wife more easily. It is a fact that people are first attracted to outward appearance. This initial attraction may then develop into romantic feelings and a serious relationship if the couple find that they are compatible with each other. Beauty, then, attracts more suitors, leading to more choices for a life partner.\n\nOn the other hand, beauty has a number of disadvantages as well. Firstly, a good-looking person tends to attract unwanted attention from all kinds of people. The admirer may have bad intentions and cause problems for the target. There is also unwanted attention in the form of jealous peers. Another problem faced by good-looking people is that they may not be taken seriously. It is thought that beauty and brains do not go together. Hence, attractive people may not command respect even when they deserve it because of this prejudice against them. Besides, good-looking people may rely too much on outward beauty and neglect character building. Life for them has always been easy, so they may not learn to be independent and strong.\n\nWhile every individual should take care of their outward appearance and look their best, they should not neglect their inner beauty or character. They should not place such importance on beauty that they become proud and arrogant, forgetting that physical beauty is indeed, only skin deep and will not last."

        "content": "I am only seventeen. I doubt I will need to think about marriage in the near future. However, that does not mean I have not thought about the person I would like to marry one day. The person whom I think is fit to be my life partner would have some very important qualities.\nFirstly, he would be faithful and loyal to me. A person who is faithful is trustworthy and dependable. He will not cheat on his loved ones. He will be protective, and he will not do anything that will make his partner feel insecure. This is very important in a relationship. A wife must be able to have full confidence in her husband or else she would become suspicious and jealous. A marriage cannot survive under such circumstances. Hence, faithfulness is an essential quality in a husband.\n\nAlmost as important as faithfulness is patience. My ideal husband would be very patient. He would not lose his temper if I kept him waiting for an hour. If I cannot keep up with him, he will slow down for my sake. If I were to lose my cool, he would remain calm. This is an important trait because I am an impatient person. If both of us were impatient types, we would end up quarrelling all the tune. An impatient man is rude and inconsiderate and I would not be able to respect him, much less be attracted to him.\n\nMy ideal husband would have a good sense of humor. People with a good sense of humor are fun to be around. They do not look at life so seriously nor do they get weighed down by troubles. Instead, they have a positive outlook on life. They are able to laugh at themselves and they are sporting. I love being with jovial people like that. So the man I would want to marry would be able to see the funny side of things. He would be able to comfort me when I am feeling down and make me laugh.\n\nIn a nutshell, the three qualities of faithfulness, patience and having a good sense of humor are essential for a relationship to last. Too often, young ladies are attracted to good looks and great wealth. Physical\nbeauty will not last and wealth can be lost. It is the three qualities described here that will help us weather the storms in life. I am not sure if my ideal man exists but I hope he is somewhere on this earth and that we will meet one day."

You have the luxury of lazing in bed a bit longer, and even snoozing\nfor another hour. Or you can jump out of bed and get started on a day of total freedom. Basically, it is a day where you get to choose what to do, unless you are one of those unfortunate souls whose weekends are packed from dawn to dusk with activities ranging from tuition to archery lessons. Fortunately, my parents are not fanatical about achievements so I get to spend the day as I wish. Most of the time, I would decide how to fill the hours only after I wake up. My decision is largely dependent on my mood. It is not all play though. I would spend a couple of hours on household chores to help my mother out. After that, I would just recline on the sofa and read, or lie on my bed and listen to music.\n\nI love Saturdays also because that is the day I get to meet up with my friends who are not from the same school. They would be my primary schoolmates and childhood friends. Usually, we would do some window shopping and then go to a mamak stall to have tea and chat. It is because we are able to meet on Saturdays that our friendship remains strong. Since we are all from different schools, it is fun to share about school life. This is something I look forward to every week.\n\nSaturdays are better than Sundays for me because it is also a family day for us. On Sundays, we have to visit our grandparents or visit relatives which can be a little boring for me. But Saturdays are reserved\nfor just my family. We go to the supermarket together to shop for groceries. Mother makes a point of cooking dinner for us on Saturdays because she gets home too late on weekdays to cook a full meal. Sitting together for a meal is a special time for us to catch up with one another. Besides, mother's cooking is far better than any restaurant food, and she goes out of her way to make us our favorite dishes. It is something that makes my Saturdays so much more special.\n\nThere is no doubt that my favorite day of the week is Saturday. It is a day that is free of stress and allows me to do anything I wish. It is a day for meeting up with friends and it is a day when my family gets to spend some precious time together."

He held out a wooden bowl and passers-by dropped in coins. Der Lun's mother put a small coin into the bowl as she passed him by. His eyes followed the mother and son as they set off for home. As Der Lun and his mother turned into the narrow path that led to their house, he suddenly realized that the beggar was following them. Der Lun told his mother about it. Alarmed, she quickened her steps and as soon as they got inside their house, she locked it. Der Lun peered out the window and saw the beggar sitting on the ground near the gate.

She gathered up her courage and went to ask the beggar to leave. But the beggar merely looked at her with a gentle smile. Worried that he would fall ill with no food and water, she sent Der Lun to give him a bowl of rice and vegetables and some tea. The beggar ate and drank. Then he lay down\nunder a tree to sleep. Der Lun's mother was at a loss as to what else to do. She was just a poor widow with a young son. Since the beggar refused to leave, she and Der Lun built a little shelter for him.

The men introduced themselves as lawyers representing a Mr Cheong. They explained that Mr Cheong wanted to repay Der Lun and his mother for taking care of him. Mr Cheong was a millionaire who had once been homeless. Now that he was rich, he liked to look for deserving people to help. He would disguise himself as a beggar and when he met someone who was kind to him, he would give that person a sum of money.\n\nThe sum of money Mr Cheong gave to Der Lun's mother was enough to make their life more comfortable and to give Der Lun a university education. Der Lun and his mother could not believe their good fortune. They treated the beggar well out of compassion. They never expected to be so richly rewarded."

They decided to boil the porridge first. They put some rice into a pot of water and left it to boil while they made the French toast. Jeff broke two eggs into a plate and added in some milk. Jenna found the bread and put two slices into the egg mixture. Next, Jeff turned on the second stove burner to heat up the frying pan.

Jenna threw the burnt piece into the sink and put in the other slice of bread. This time, she turned down the fire so it cooked nicely.\n\nThen Jeff noticed the pot cover starting to move. The next minute, the porridge boiled over and put out the fire. Jenna panicked. Thankfully, Jeff stayed calm and turned off the gas. But the stove was a mess now. Jenna told Jeff to wipe up the sticky stuff so they could continue to cook the rest of the porridge. But Jeff's hand touched the hot burner and he gave a yelp of pain. Jenna made him put his hand under the tap. Then she caught the smell of burning. Oh dear! The piece of bread in the pan had turned black as well.\n\nAs the twins looked around them in dismay, their father appeared in the doorway. One look and he knew what they were up to. Seeing their crestfallen faces, he told them to clean up the kitchen while he helped them make breakfast for Mother. The twins cheered up and did as told. Within an hour, the kitchen was cleaned, and Father had made some egg sandwiches and cooked some oat porridge. Then he sneaked back to bed. The twins prepared the breakfast tray, adding a card they had made, and then carried the tray upstairs to their parents' bedroom.\n\nThe twins woke their mother up by hugging her and yelling 'Happy Mother's Day, darling Mummy!' Mother hugged the twins. Her eyes widened at the sight of the breakfast tray. She shook Father who was pretending to snore. He feigned astonishment when he saw the breakfast. Mother bit into a sandwich and said it was the best she had ever tasted. Jeff immediately wanted to have a bite. Jenna caught her father's eye and they winked at each other secretly."

        "content": "I am really dumb. I have never thought that about myself, but after what I have just done, no other description fits. How could I have messed up my first day at the school, my first job, so completely ?\nJust half an hour ago, the sun was shining, the birds were singing. I stood by the side of the hall to help keep an eye on the Year One pupils. How can helping teachers to fetch and carry and keeping an eye on such cute seven-year-old children be difficult? I could see quivering lips and some tears rolling down fat cheeks. I would think the doting parents standing outside the hall, trying to control their feelings as their beloved children trotted into their classes, would be the real problem.\n\nThe morning passed swiftly. All I had to do was to bring the pupils to the toilet a couple of times. Then the bell rang for recess for the Year One pupils. A teacher and I led the little ones to the canteen. After every child had settled down to their meal, I moved to the back of the canteen. Suddenly, a half-eaten sandwich went hurtling across a table. It went smack on to a boy. Face red with anger, he hurled his bun across. It hit another boy. A war was declared. It was pandemonium.\n\nThe food went flying. The boys screamed. The parents shrieked. The teachers yelled. There was utter chaos. The principal came running. Mr. Tan ducked as a blob came in his direction. He slipped on the mess and knocked into the two cleaners who came running to the scene with their brooms, mops and pails. I could not control myself. I laughed and laughed. Even when Mr. Tan was sitting on the floor glaring at me, I laughed so hard that tears rolled down my cheeks.\n\nOf course, I was punished. I was told to clean up all the mess. First, I had to help disperse the children who were sniveling and bawling. After that, I had to clean up the canteen. The reason given was the two cleaners were injured in the fall. There was food splattered on the walls, the ceilings and the floor. I only finished scraping every bit of mess at 6.00 p.m. Finally, the principal was waiting for me. `I'm afraid you don't have to come back tomorrow. You did not supervise the children sufficiently, causing distress to all.' A letter of immediate dismissal was then given to me.\n\nMy back was aching. My hands were stiff with all the detergent I had to use. My head was spinning. I was traumatized by all the mess, some of which was still stuck to my hands and legs. My first day at the school was truly unforgettable."

Your aunt and uncle are feeling poorly. And your young cousins are critically ill. It's an epidemic that we are having.\n\n'The scorching heat is unbearable, warned Mother. 'Stay home. It's cooler. Obey!' frowned Mother as she glared at her youngest daughter.\n\n'Don't do this. Don't do that. Don't go there. Don't go out. I am suffocated in this dark damp corner. I can scream: And scream she did.\n\n'What's the row?' asked Hermit as he popped his head into the room.\n\n`I'm so bored.

All because of a little fever. I am suffocated by all the constraints and the dos and don'ts and ..:\n\n`Enough! Enough! Stop whining.'\n\n`I heard so much of the new development in the neighborhood - the gigantic new factory that has just been opened. Could you ..:\n\n`No. Sorry! I'm not going there. Anyway, your mum would kill me if I were to take you anywhere near there. Bye. Be good.'\n\nJeanie screamed until her voice came out in a croak. However, she was determined to have her way. She walked as fast as her short legs could carry her. Looking left and right, she trotted towards the direction of the spewing smoke.\n\nIt was sweltering. But her eyes glistened excitedly when she caught sight of the towering chimneys and then the factory itself. Jeanie went further down the road, keeping to the grass verge. She was determined to go and have a look at the factory as her family members had forbade her to do so. `This will show them not to treat me like an infant!' she thought to herself.\n\nBefore long she could feel herself getting dehydrated. Her skin seemed so hot, as though it was on fire. Jean started panting. Gasping for breath, Jeanie felt faint and lost consciousness.\n\nIt was evening when Jeanie was found. 'There are so few of us black-eyed litter frogs left. Another tragedy. We will be extinct soon, sighed Granddad wearily.\n\n'If only she had listened to me, sobbed Mother. 'I repeatedly warned her contaminants enter our body easily. The pesticides and pollution will kill us. Humans destroy us."

        "content": "My fists were clenched. Hurt and angry, I glared at my mother. She whispered softly, 'This is the best chance for an education, Dear. Behave yourself.' I did, not because of my mother or any need for studying or the threat that I might have to be fostered out like my two younger siblings. It was the promise of food in my stomach that stopped me from fleeing the House of Sunlight.\nMy father had died of a heart attack two years ago. The once comfortable life that we -- my two younger sisters and I -- had became a thing of the past. My mother barely made enough as a cleaner to pay the bills left behind by my father and to put food on the table. Then, her diabetes worsened and she had to go on dialysis.\n\nI was accepted into the welfare home. I hated it. It was a torture having to live with eight others in a dormitory. There was absolutely no privacy. My space was invaded by seven strangers who seemed oblivious that I needed to be alone. My mother's words 'Get an education and we will have a chance to be a family again. You are our only hope' kept me from shattering the early months.\n\nI detested the rigid and structured hours. We all had to be up by 5.00 am. Prayers, cleaning, washing. Off to school. Then back to the prison. Prayers, washing, preparation for school, exercise, cleaning the compound. Prayers, cleaning, more study time. It was a nightmare.\n\nOne day, feeling especially sorry for myself, I huddled in my corner and refused to help clean the compound. After a while, my dormitory mate, Leela, gave me a shove and arms akimbo, muttered, 'Stop wallowing in self-pity.'\n\nWhen I refused to answer her, she reminded me of all we have learnt at the House of Sunlight. Having to do things on our own has taught us to be independent. Why, we would survive anywhere. `Where else, Joey, could we get free tuition, free clothes, free accommodation, free lessons in life, free...'\n\n'Food, I smiled.\n\nLeela is right. The House of Sunlight has turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I have learnt the value of discipline and education. It is indeed a house of hope for me."

I looked at the swirling leaves on the roads and in the gutters and quickened my step home. Rain fell in big fat drops.\n\nWhen I ran into the house, the wind was rattling the window frames and battering the roof. As I hastened to close the windows, I shivered at the sound of the howling wind. Suddenly, there was a loud crash. I jumped with fright as the front windowpanes were shattered. Rain lashed in. I quickly pushed the furniture next to the window to the other corner of the room.\nAcross the street, I saw rain coming down like a great sheet and flinging itself upon the town. I stood dumbstruck and looked out at the street. Water was rising so fast and poured out of the drains into the street. Cars broke down and stalled, and, honking and hooting went on without stopping. A massive traffic jam would build up in just minutes.\n\nBefore I could close my ears to the ceaseless noise, there came a great din. The giant tembusu tree in front of my house had snapped. Another flash of lightning showed the angsana trees by the side of the street were uprooted. I was speechless with terror.\n\nI raced upstairs to my room. It was in the nick of time. Thunder roared and lightning flashed and there was an outage. 'Oh no!' I wailed as I huddled under the blanket in total darkness, trembling with fear and cold, and waited for my parents to get home. I always had a horror of storms and this one showed Nature's wrath.\n\nAs abruptly as it began, the freak storm ended. I crept out of bed and looked out of the window. The sight left me as shattered as the landscape. Branches and tree trunks were scattered to the left and right of the streets. There were giant craters where the trees were wrenched whole from the sidewalks.\n\nThe whole scene reminded me of one of those disaster movies. It would take all of us forever to clear the streets, the debris and the trees. It had been a most frightening experience."

I could not hear anything other than my heart thudding away. Was it my imagination?\nI was returning home after a late music lesson. My parents were attending a neighborhood watch meeting so I had to get home on my own. The distance from my music teacher's house to my home was just\n500 meters. The street was darker than I had expected but I was not very worried about the short walk home. I was busy thinking about my upcoming music exam when I became aware that I was being followed.\n\nI continued on my way, alert for any sound. There it was again, the sound of someone walking behind me. Fear gripped me and I hurried on. My house was just around the corner. I decided to run. To my horror, whoever was following me began to run too. I glanced behind me and saw a dark figure catching up with me. The next instant, I ran into a dustbin by the road and fell flat on my front. I felt a hand grip my arm and I screamed in panic. The hand released my arm and I pushed myself off the ground, getting ready to run again. I found myself looking at a startled young lady dressed in a dark tracksuit.\n\nNext moment, there was a rush of footsteps and someone calling my name. To my astonishment, my parents appeared together with a few people I recognized as our neighbors.\n\nThe young lady who looked anxious at first now seemed as relieved as me. We were all shepherded to our house which was just two doors away. As my mother put ointment on the bruises on my arms and legs, I was asked to explain why I ran away from Jagdeesh, the young lady. After listening to me, Jagdeesh laughed. She told us that she was new to the neighborhood. She had gone jogging that evening. On the way home, she was walking behind me when she heard footsteps followingher and she decided to run when she saw me run. It turned out that what she had heard was the neighborhood watch group patrolling the street. When I fell, she went to help me up, which unfortunately led to my screaming out in fear.\n\nThe night ended with us having supper together. Indeed, it was a strange introduction to the neighborhood for Jagdeesh. However, after that, we became firm friends."

Indra wondered how children could be so heartless as to abandon a parent like this.\nIndra recalled the day the old man was admitted to her ward. He was thin and frail. He could not produce his identity card but he could remember the number. The hospital tried to contact his family using the phone number he gave them but it was in vain. He was treated for a lung infection and was now recovering. Soon, it would be time for him to be discharged. Where would he go then? He did not look strong enough to fend for himself. Indra threw down the file she was holding as anger rose within her.\n\n`What's the matter?' asked Poh, Indra's colleague.\n\n`I'm just upset about old Mr Dev,' she replied. Poh nodded with understanding. She had been a nurse much longer than Indra. She had seen many cases of abandoned old people and she had learned to control her feelings.\n\n'Don't worry too much, the hospital will contact the welfare department. Mr Dev will be placed in an old folks' home,' Poh said, and patted Indra's arm comfortingly.\n\nIndra sighed. 'I know. It's just that the old chap really longs for his family to visit him. He cleans and tidies himself every morning and sits up to wait expectantly. You can see the eagerness in his eyes whenever the door opens. At the end of the day, he goes to sleep with tears in his eyes. It makes me cry inside.'\n\nPoh shook her head sadly. `He needs a miracle.'\n\nTwo days later, the doctor confirmed that Mr Dev was fit enough to be discharged. Indra was informed that the welfare officer would come to take Mr Dev to an old folks' home the next day. With a heavy heart, Indra helped Mr Dev to get ready. He was still a bit weak, so she put him in a wheelchair to take him down to the hospital lobby where the welfare officer was waiting. Her eyes were misty when she saw how sad the old man looked as they got into the lift. The lift doors opened at the ground level and she pushed the wheelchair out carefully. 'Appa!' a voice cried out. A middle-aged woman rushed forward and embraced the old man in the wheelchair. Both of them began to weep. India smiled through her tears. It was the miracle she had prayed for.\n\nIndra left the scene of the reunion and went to look for the welfare officer. She was eager to tell him the `bad' news that his trip to collect Mr Dev was a wasted one."

His brother Affin was still asleep.\nIt was Saturday and there was no school. Afiq's mother asked him to run some errands for her. On his way out, he glanced at his motorcycle which was parked at the side of the house. There was no hiding the broken front lamp and the dent and scratches on the side. Afiz squared his shoulders and went to complete his errands.\n\nIt was late morning before Afiq was free to carry out his plan. He marched down the road to Than Haji Osman's house. When he arrived and called out the customary greeting, Hajjah Aniya appeared at the\ndoorway and greeted him warmly. She invited him in and served him tea and some cakes. Afiq nervously asked to speak to Tuan Haji Osman. She told him that Tuan Haji was out but would be home very soon. Sure enough, the elderly man returned in ten minutes.\n\nAfiq cleared his throat a few times while his host waited patiently. Finally, he blurted out that he had come to own up. 'I'm so sorry. I was careless yesterday and knocked into your parked car in front of the post office,' Afiq said.\n\nTuan Haji Osman looked at the 17-year-old youth, surprised. 'So, you are saying that you are the culprit who dented my car and then ran away?'\n\nAfiq went red. He nodded. 'I'm sorry for not telling you earlier. I was too frightened.'\n\nThe elderly man smiled and said, 'But you're not too frightened to confess now?'\n\nAfiq said uncertainly, 'I could not sleep last night thinking about it. I knew I had to do the right thing.'\n\nTuan Haji Osman was silent for a minute before saying in a kind voice, `You think that it is the right thing to cover up for your brother?'\n\nAfiq went pale. `I ...I...you know the truth?' he stammered.\n\nTuan Haji Osman smiled, `Yes, Affin told me himself just half an hour ago.'\n\nThe elderly man explained that Affn had met him at the tea stall and told him everything, how he had ridden his elder brother's motorcycle without permission and lost control of it, resulting in the minor accident that dented Tuan Haji Osman's new car.\n\nAfiq now looked beseechingly at his host, `Will my brother be arrested?'\n\n'Ah, I see, you are trying to protect your brother. No, I will not be reporting the accident. It's just a small dent.' Seeing Afiq's relieved expression, he went on, `However, I hope that your brother will learn from this. As for you, remember that it is unwise to hide the truth.'\n\nAfiq thanked Tuan Haji Osman for his kindness and then set off home happily. He was glad the truth was known. His brother's courage in making a clean breast of everything made him happy and proud. He knew he could look forward to a good night's sleep."

My siblings and I were curious about who would be moving in.\nWe did not have long to wait. A week after the house was spruced up, a lorry arrived. We watched with interest as the movers carried the furniture into the house. The furniture looked expensive. Our new\nneighbours must be wealthy people. However, it never occurred to us four children that rich people may not be interested in befriending us. Our house badly needed a new coat of paint. We were clean and tidy - most of the time - but our clothes were clearly old and worn. Father drove an old car that we could hear coming down the road long before it was in sight. We were simple, ordinary people.\n\nWhen the new occupants arrived in a big and shiny car, we jostled one another to get a good look at them from our bedroom window. Mother had forbidden us from hanging around our gate. She said our\nnew neighbours needed privacy, whatever that was. A beautifully dressed lady got out of the car. To our delight, we saw a boy and a girl about our age following her into the house. They did not look excited to move into their new home though. That did not deter us from wanting to get to know them.\n\nThe next evening, we were playing hide-and-seek in the garden when we spotted the boy and the girl watching us. My siblings and I went to the fence that separated our gardens. My eldest brother Kian called to the pair. They looked at us unsmilingly. Their mother appeared next, took one look at us and shooed the two into the house. We were disappointed to have such snooty neighbours. We decided to leave them alone after that.\n\nIt was two weeks later that we heard screams coming from next door late one night. Father picked up a stick and ran over to the house. Man followed suit. They found the boy and the girl weeping beside their mother who was lying at the bottom of the staircase where she had fallen. She was unconscious. Father called for an ambulance which arrived within minutes and took the patient to the hospital. Father brought the children back to our house. Mother fed them some hot soup to calm their nerves. The children, whose names were Vin and Nora, told us that they had just returned from Indonesia. Their father was still there. Father helped them to contact their father who assured them he would catch a plane and join them as soon as possible.\n\nVin and Nora stayed the night with us. My sister and I had to give up our room to them but we did not mind. Before they went to bed, we shook hands and became friends."

The first lesson was in the science laboratory. Mr Kannan, our chemistry teacher, marched in and explained about the experiment we were to carry out. My partner Ru Em and I set to work. Halfway through, we noticed a couple of mosquitoes flying around us. This was the first time we noticed insects in the lab. One of the mosquitoes landed on my arm. Instinctively, Ru Em smacked my arm hard to kill it. It made me drop the bottle of ammonia I was holding. The bottle broke and the pungent smell of the ammonia spread all around us, making us choke. Everyone dashed out of the lab coughing and gagging. The lab assistant had to clean up the mess. Mr Kannan was quite angry at our carelessness. He gave the entire class demerit points. Ru Ern and I wished the ground would open up and swallow us. To make matters worse, we had to suffer the killer looks directed at us the rest of the day.\n\nBy recess, I was beginning to forget the unpleasant incident and was just enjoying my food. Then the boy next to me stumbled as he was getting up and spilled his bowl of leftover curry noodles all over me. I picked bits of noodles and beansprouts off my clothes while he apologized over and over. I went to the toilet and tried to wash the curry out of my clothes and my hair. The bright orange stain refused to come off my white shirt and the smell was still quite strong. The only consolation was that I could change into my sports clothes.\n\nWith the two disasters keeping me preoccupied, I almost forgot about the inter-house basketball semi-final in the afternoon. We played against Red House which was a strong opponent. We were neck and neck right till the final minute and then the golden opportunity to win was given to my team because of a foul. Everyone watched eagerly as I took the free throw. As the ball flew towards the hoop, I held my breath. The ball hit the metal ring and bounced away. Red house yelled with joy as my team groaned. It could not be happening, I thought. How could I have missed? But I did. My team members' disappointment was unbearable to me. That was the final straw.\n\nI slunk home as quickly as I could. I avoided my family members, got cleaned up and went straight to bed. I wished I had not got out of bed that morning."

The physics teacher's hand froze in the middle of writing a formula on the blackboard.\nMohi mumbled, Sorry, teacher,' and scuttled to his seat. Mr Tan glared at the rest of the students. The chuckles quickly subsided. Mohi's classmates always looked forward to Mondays. Nine times out of ten, they would be entertained by Mohi's late arrival and his odd appearance which usually included inappropriate clothing. That day, it was the pyjama top and the green sandals.\n\nMohi lived just a street away from the school. He walked to school daily. Students passing by in buses would yell his name in unison just to see him jump and stop in his tracks. When he spotted the merry bunch in the bus, he would wave good-naturedly. Although Mohi was likeable, he was too lost in his own thoughts to make friends. His classmates found him amusing but they ignored him most of the time. Only Hamed, who sat next to Mohi, tried to be his friend.\n\nThe following Monday, Mohi did not turn up at school. His classmates were a little disappointed but quickly forgot about him. After school, Hamed decided to walk over to Mohi's house to check on him. As he approached the gate, he could hear violin music. Mohi must be listening to music, he thought. The gate was not locked. Hamed let himself in. He called Mohi's name a few times but there was no response. The music played on. Hamed peered in through a window. His eyes widened in surprise. In the middle of the living room, Mohi was playing the violin. His eyes were closed in concentration as he drew the bow over the strings expertly. He played flawlessly, so much so that it sounded like a recording. Hamed left quietly.\n\nWhen Teacher's Day came around, Hamed had a plan. It was the tradition of the school to have a concert for the teachers. Every class had to contribute an item. Hamed convinced the class to let Mohi perform. Short of ideas, the class agreed. On the day of the concert, both the teachers and students were surprised to see the school's clumsiest student walking on stage with a violin. When he started to play, the audience fell silent. Jaws dropped. As the last note ended, there was a moment of silence. Then the audience erupted into thunderous applause. Mohi became a sensation and had many fans in his final year of school.\n\nToday, Mohi and Hamed are the best of friends. Mohi is on a scholarship pursuing music in Austria. Some days, he still arrives to class wearing an inside-out shirt or a pair of mismatched shoes."

        "content": "One topic that has always been controversial is whether television is good or bad for us. Many parents have condemned television as being nothing more than an `idiot box', while others have spoken much about the benefits of television. I believe that the truth lies somewhere in between. While watching television does have many benefits, it also has some drawbacks.\nThe main benefit of watching television is that it enables us to learn new things. Programs such as National Geographic supply us with a lot of information about nature, history, culture and science, while others, like CNN, provide us with news of what is happening around the world. Watching drama series is actually quite educational too as it shows us human behavior, the effects of common social problems such as family breakups, alcoholism and racial discrimination and how to deal with such issues. Besides educational value, television also provides us with entertainment right in our homes. It is a convenient and an inexpensive way to spend some of our leisure time.\n\nAlthough television can be beneficial, watching television also has its drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is that watching television makes us less healthy if we spend too many hours on it. While watching television, most people are sitting down or otherwise relaxing. Furthermore, people tend to snack when they watch television. The lack of exercise and additional calories from unhealthy snacks can lead to weight gain and even obesity.\n\nAnother problem with television is that not all the programs are good for the viewers and especially young viewers. Some of the modern shows portray negative values like selfishness, cruelty, vanity, jealousy, dishonesty and even vengefulness and hatred. Desperate Housewives and Mean Girls are two examples of such shows. These shows seem to say that gossiping, taking revenge and having extramarital affairs are normal and acceptable. They may influence young people who watch them to do the same. That is why parents and adults should ensure that children only watch programs with positive values.\n\nTo conclude, watching television does have both pros and cons. It is up to us to choose what we watch carefully and only watch in moderation, so that we may enjoy the benefits without risking the drawbacks."

        "content": "Most, if not all, people would love to have a large amount of money dropped into their laps. They say this because they feel that money can solve almost all their problems and worries. However, while it may be true that having money can take care of your basic needs like food and a place to stay, having too much money is bad for your body and your soul.\nFirstly, having too much money can lead to a deterioration of values. Becoming rich can make a person proud and arrogant. The rich can afford flashy cars, branded clothing, and jewellery. They always look well-groomed and so they become vain and proud. Putting too much value on material things makes a person shallow and uninteresting. They think highly of themselves and look down on others who struggle to make ends meet. In addition, the rich are used to solving their problems with money and they can no longer tell right from wrong. They begin to think that whatever they do is right. Hence, having too much money can change your personality, destroy your moral values and make you an unlikeable person.\n\nSecondly, being very wealthy can affect relationships. A wealthy man will attract insincere people who try to befriend them for personal gain. This leads to suspicion and mistrust of others which can affect relationships with family and friends. A rich man can end up being quite lonely as he does not know who his true friends are. Having too much money can destroy relationships and lead to loneliness. In other words, too much wealth may lead to unhappiness.\n\nBesides that, having too much money can lead to poor health and an early grave. We know that the wealthy can afford to eat good food regularly. There is nothing to stop someone who has the means from indulging in whatever he likes, be it exotic meats or expensive sweets. Unless he is disciplined and health-conscious, a rich man is likely to eat too much rich food which may harm his body. Coupled with lack of exercise due to his being driven everywhere and having everything done for him, he is likely to develop some critical illnesses such as heart problems and high blood pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, since having too much money has such serious negative effects, it is quite obvious that having too much money is a bad thing. Nevertheless, the same is true of having too little money, which is the reason why we should aim to simply have enough, and be thankful for what we have."

I was beginning to drift off to sleep when I saw the bus arriving. The sun was in my eyes and that was probably the reason why I got onto Bus 113.\nI was glad to get a seat. Within minutes, I was slumped against the window, fast asleep. When I opened my eyes, it was dark outside. I was the only passenger left on the bus. I could not recognize the part of\ntown we were passing through. I pressed the bell and the bus stopped. I planned to hop across the road and catch a bus going the opposite direction. However, I found myself on a quiet street with a row of shops that were all shuttered. I kicked myself for not asking the driver for directions.\n\nAs I was wondering what to do, a motorcycle came down the road. The rider looked at me as he passed and then stopped a short distance away. I went to him and asked him how to get back to Taman Klang Utama. He smiled and nodded. He patted the back seat and said that he would send me home. Without a second thought, I climbed up behind the rider. He turned the motorcycle around and headed in the direction I wanted. We travelled for about 15 minutes and the surroundings still looked unfamiliar to me. The rider made a few turns and I knew I was hopelessly lost. I asked him where we were going. He did not answer but increased his speed. Alarm bells started to ring in my head.\n\nI tapped the man on the shoulder and told him to stop. He leant forward and went at high speed now. Then he slowed down to turn into a dark and narrow road that led into an oil palm plantation. I had had enough. I jumped off the vehicle and fell onto the ground. The man turned around and rode towards me. I swung my school bag at him and he lost his balance and fell off his motorcycle. Without looking back, I just ran and ran. When I dared to stop, I found that I was on a properly tarred road. Cars were passing by. I was relieved to see a taxi and waved frantically, praying that it would stop. It did. I got in and gave the driver my house address. I was shaking uncontrollably.\n\nWhen my family learnt what had happened, they were horrified. My parents told me that I should have just looked for a public phone and called home when I was lost. I knew I had been foolish. It was a frightening experience which I hoped would never happen to me again. It's better to be safe than sorry!"

It came too fast and there I was, in the sterile waiting room of the dental clinic, miserable with butterflies in my stomach.\n\nMy parents told me to sit up, stop wringing my hands and to take deep breaths to keep calm. It worked. I was calm for maybe two seconds when I heard my name being called. I pretended to be deaf but my mother nudged me to get up. I forced myself to step forward and promptly stumbled over a toy left lying around by some kid. My clumsiness got me the attention of everyone in the room. Being scrutinized by that many pairs of eyes was too much and I scuttled towards the consultation room as fast as I could.\nI had refused my parents' offer to accompany me. I meant to show them that I was brave enough to face the ordeal on my own. I regretted it. Thankfully, I forgot my anxiety as I looked around the dentist's room. Tools of different sizes were arranged neatly in a tray on the tiny table which was connected to a chair with buttons and a light hanging right over it. I avoided looking at my dentist in the eye as I took my spot on the chair shakily. I almost jumped out of the seat when all of a sudden the chair moved and I was lying down facing the bright yellow light.\n\nThe dentist spoke in a soothing voice behind her mask. Everything was going smoothly and I was quite proud of myself. Then disaster struck. I was picking up the cup of water placed next to the chair for patients to rinse their mouths when I caught sight of the dental drill. Panic related to a bad childhood experience involving the drill kicked into me and on reflex, I spat out the rinsing water, right into the surprised dentist's face.\n\nI apologized profusely as I tried desperately to wipe away the water with a tissue, only to knock down the tray of instruments. The sharp instruments went flying and something that looked like it could have poked a hole in my eye flew past centimetres from my face. The dentist tried her best to disguise her annoyance with a very fake smile. I pulled off the tissue napkin around my neck and bent over to pick up an instrument. Somehow, my head bumped the overhead light in the process, sending it swinging directly at the dentist's head. It knocked her off her chair and she ended up half-conscious on the floor.\n\nAs the dentist's assistants went to her aid, I retreated from the room. My parents were standing near the door, alarmed by the commotion. Without a word, I dragged them to the exit. I knew they would find it hard to believe what just happened. It was the most embarrassing experience I ever had."

If it had not, I would have stayed in bed and the rest of the day would not have happened.\nI reached school at the usual time. The first lesson was in the science laboratory. Mr Kanan our chemistry teacher marched in and explained the experiment we were to carry out. My partner Ru Ern and I set to work. Halfway, we noticed a couple of mosquitoes flying around us. This was the first time we noticed insects in the lab. One of the mosquitoes landed on my arm. Instinctively, Ru Ern smacked my arm hard to kill it. It made me drop the bottle of ammonia I was holding. The bottle broke and the pungent smell of the ammonia spread all around us making us choke. Everyone dashed out of the lab coughing and gagging. The lab assistant had to clean up the mess. Mr Kanan was quite angry at our carelessness. He gave the entire class demerit points. Ru Ern and I wished the ground would open up and swallow us. But no, we had to suffer the killer looks directed at us the rest of the day.\n\nBy recess, I was beginning to forget the unpleasant incident and was just enjoying my food. Then the boy next to me stumbled as he was getting up and spilled his bowl of leftover curry noodles all over me. I picked bits of noodles and beansprouts off my clothes while he apologized over and over. I went to the toilet and tried to wash the curry out of my clothes and my hair. The bright orange stain refused to come off my white shirt and the smell was still quite strong. The only consolation was that I could change to my sports clothes.\n\nWith the two disasters keeping me preoccupied, I almost forgot about the inter-house basketball semi-final in the afternoon. We played against Red House which was a strong opponent. We were neck to neck right till the final minute and then the golden opportunity to win was given to my team because of a foul. Everyone watched eagerly as I took the free throw. As the ball flew towards the hoop, I held my breath. The ball hit the metal ring and bounced away. Red House yelled with joy as my team groaned. It could not be happening, I thought. How could I have missed? But I did. My team members' disappointment was unbearable to me. That was the final straw.\n\nI slunk home as quickly as I could. I avoided my family members, got cleaned up and went straight to bed. I wanted to forget that day. I wanted to go to sleep and wake up to a new day, hopefully a day when everything would go right."

In December every year, we would drive up to the island to spend three days visiting their favourite food haunts.\nThis year, we started our journey up north on a Friday morning. The drive up was punctuated by stops at Bidor town and Kampar so it took us six hours to reach our destination. We always stayed at one of the hotels in Batu Ferringhi. The beach is just a short walk from the hotel entrance and our rooms have a lovely view of the sea. We spent our first evening playing on the beach. After dinner, we returned to our rooms to play monopoly. My parents have a rule for our holidays which is that we were to spend time doing things together. There was to be no TV and no Internet.\n\nThe next morning, we went to Bukit Bendera and then spent the rest of the afternoon in town visiting our favourite hawker stalls. As we were having tea at a coffee shop, we overheard people talking about an earthquake near Sumatera, an island in Indonesia. We headed back to the hotel and then went to the beach. We took a walk along the beach, picking up seashells along the way. Suddenly, I noticed a strange thing. The sea seemed to be retreating from the shore. I called my father to look at the curious occurrence. My father took one look and went pale. We saw a grey line in the distance moving towards the shore. It seemed to grow taller by the second.\n\nMy father shouted at us to run back to the hotel. He grabbed my hand and pulled me with him. Other people on the beach also began to shout and run. As we reached the hotel lobby, we heard a roaring sound behind us. My father pushed us towards the stairs. We reached the first floor when we heard the roar of rushing water and glass breaking. I screamed when I saw water rising just below us. My father yelled at us to keep climbing. The water level rose so fast that it wet my feet as I ran the last few steps to the third floor. We stopped on the fourth floor and looked down at the swirling water below us. It had stopped rising. After some minutes, it began to drop.\n\nWe waited a long time before going downstairs. The hotel lobby was unrecognizable. There was dirt and broken furniture scattered everywhere. Some people who were caught in the tsunami were either unconscious or groaning with pain. I realized then what a narrow escape we had had."

It was to us the greatest event in the Beijing Olympics 2008 as we were all in the school swimming team, our forte - the butterfly stroke.\n\nHalf of us were for Cavic, the other half, Phelps. Me - my hero of course. One who is courageous, persistent, not one to cave in under pressure. Being tall and good-looking is a plus point of course.\n'Looks like Phleps will not be getting his seventh medal, I muttered to Dayang as I chomped on my popcorn. Phelps was the seventh slowest of eight swimmers.\n\n'I told you, Rajamoni continued happily, 'that man is not a machine. 50 meters mark. How can he...'\n\n'Be quiet. Look, he's picking up! He has another 50 meters more to go.\n\n'Come on Cavic; yelled June. `Come on man. You can do it.\n\n'Look at Phelps! Gosh, he's pushing himself so furiously!'\n\nWe started shouting to encourage our heroes. My admiration for Phelps grew. He had not given up. It was a race to the last. It was unbelievable. They were abreast. The crowd in the National Aquatic Centre started shouting 'Phelps! Phelps! Phelps!'\n\n'Phelps! Phelps!' I yelled. Cavic lunged for the wall underwater. Phelps swung his arms and seemed to be making a half stroke. 'Phelps touched first!' I shrieked excitedly.\n\nWe saw both swimmers spin around and stare at the video screen. There was a minute of palpable tension as the electronic numbers rolled. There was one second of absolute silence at the Centre and in the room. My heart was racing and thumping so hard. The results flashed across the screen.\n\nPhelps had won by 0.01 second at 50.58 seconds! He did the impossible! I danced round the room, pounded the table and jumped for joy. I screamed and screamed. What a feat! He had won by a hair's breadth. A fingertip.\n\nThat man is a machine. Look at the breadth of his chest and the length of his arms. The greatest of swimmers. The one without parallel. My hero."

Accommodation was free - we stayed in a relative's house - and we had the sun, the sand and the sea.\nTina's aunt's house was a stone's throw from the beach. The moment we reached the house, we flung our bags down and headed for the beach.\n\nIt was spectacular. The sea seemed luminous. It was so early in the morning that there was no one else there. The beach seemed to have been washed clean by the tide and no one had walked on it except the little crabs and the gulls.\n\nAfter the incessant noise of the city and the overnight trip on the train, the silence was utter bliss. Enjoying the warmth of the sun, both of us just sat on the sand and watched the waves roll gently on the shore. Far out on the distant horizon were some fishing boats. It really was the perfect start for the weekend. Tina waded into the shimmering blue and green sea, jumping to avoid the foam breaking on to the shore. I ran on the wet sand, enjoying the feel of it under my bare feet. 'Coee!' I answered the gulls and gave a cartwheel in sheer joy.\n\nAuntie Lis was waiting for us with freshly cooked nasi dagang. The aroma welcomed us as we stepped into the house. After the scrumptious brunch, Auntie Lis said it was time to paint the town red. The first stop was the Kuala Terengganu market. It was fun exploring floor after floor of local delicacies and crafts. There was keropok lekor that we sampled at the food court. We drooled over the hand-painted batik fabric and bought colorful batik pants and T-shirts. Of course Aunt Lis bought packets and packets of dried fish and keropok for us to bring home with. The wet market on the ground floor had an intriguing array of fruits and vegetables in all shapes and colors that we had never seen before. The best part was the duku langsat. There were mountains of them and I had never tasted such big succulent and sweet duku langsat before. Auntie Lis had to put a stop to our fruit tasting. `Enough! Your stomachs will burst soon. Keep some place for other local delicacies.\n\nOur next stop was Kak Yah's where we sat down for plates of their famous keropok and tea. It was wonderful. Auntie Lis had to drag us out of the shop to a batik factory. There we tried our hands at batik painting and created our own masterpieces. We also saw songket weaving and appreciated the fine craftsmanship.\n\nWe went home for dinner after that. Aunty Lis reminded us we would celebrate Earth Hour '09 by having a barbeque dinner under the stars. It was truly a memorable experience having dinner underneath thousands of stars, listening to the lapping of the waves and Uncle Shah's stories of old Terengganu.\n\nThe next morning we set off to the turtle hatchery near Kuantan. We were beside ourselves with excitement when we were allowed to release little turtle hatchlings into the sea. It was an incredible experience to watch the week-old hatchlings waddle into the sea. I held my breath when a huge wave swept the little ones into the sea and whispered a prayer for their safety.\n\nAll too soon it was time to take the train home. On the way home we talked and talked of our unforgettable weekend in Kuala Terengganu. We had left for Kuala Terengganu exhausted and burnt-out. Now, we left it refreshed and filled with a quiet joy."

        "content": "The world around us is in danger. The Earth faces problems of global warming and massive pollution. Our rainforests are disappearing. Animals in the rainforests are in danger of extinction. So are our natural resources. How can one person save the environment?\nThere are many things that we as individuals can do to stop the destruction of the environment. We should take green steps, that is, change our habits and lifestyles to stop polluting and harming the world around us. After some contemplation, I know what I can do to contribute towards saving our environment. I will practise the 3Rs - reduce, recycle and reuse - my dictum in life. I will not be part of the use-and-throw society.\n\nFirstly, I can reduce consumption of paper by using handkerchiefs. This will definitely save many trees. Every kilogram of paper I do not use can save 2.5 kg of greenhouse gases. I will also say 'No' to plastic bags. Plastic is not biodegradable. How many times have we read from the newspapers of fish being choked to death because of plastic bags? I will instead carry a cloth bag with me to carry all my shopping.\n\nAs a result, there will be less littering and pollution. Moreover, I will add to my 'No' list of disposables, especially Styrofoam and polystyrene containers. Again, I will go everywhere prepared. For my takeaways, I will bring my own tiffin carriers and containers.\n\nThis will definitely reduce the amount of rubbish I throw away. Of course, it can be quite inconvenient but 'little drops of water make the mighty ocean'.\n\nAnother example of what I can do is to reuse. I will use paper on both sides, reuse any paper and cards. I will creatively reuse wrapping paper, ribbons, birthday cards. Every ton of paper I reuse will save seventeen trees.\n\nI can also do a compost from my kitchen and garden. All the leftover food and garden trimmings can form mulch and enrich the soil. Old toothbrushes can be used for cleaning shoes and walls and a hundred other things. To do this alone is difficult, so I will get the help of my mother and the rest of the family.\n\nInstead of an individual effort, it becomes a family or class effort. It is more effective this way. For example, if I can convince my 'gang' to separate paper, plastic, glass and metals for recycling, it will really help to reduce the emission of methane. Still another example is computer recycling. As we change our computers and other related electronic products quite quickly, we should send them to recycling companies that specialize in such work. Just throwing them away will cause a major problem of disposal.\n\nThere seems a lot to be done. I will start today. I will get my family and my friends to participate in Earth Hour. One small step toward saving the environment."

        "content": "If you were to ask people what they needed to be happy, two of the most common answers would be health and wealth. Both are definitely necessary for happiness. However, if you could only have one, which is more important? It is my opinion, health wins hands down.\nFirstly, health is more important than wealth because if you are physically fit, you will have a sense of well-being. That means that you will feel happy. Wealth does not necessarily do the same. Many people mistakenly think that they would be happy if they had a million ringgit. They think that having more money will solve all their problems. On the contrary, it has been found that being wealthy can actually rob you of your peace of mind. Rich people suffer from more stress, anxiety, suspicion and unhappiness.\n\nBesides that, wealth is of no use without health. To understand this, we must look at why we gather wealth. The purpose of doing so is to be able to supply our daily needs and make ourselves happy by spending on luxuries. Without good health, no matter how much one spends on material things, that person will not be able to enjoy them to the fullest. For example, a person who is unwell would not be able to eat everything he wants to even though he could afford to buy the most expensive food. A person who is bedridden will not be able to enjoy vacations in exotic places even if he owned a private plane. Therefore, health is more important than wealth as wealth is useless without health.\n\nAnother point in favour of health is that if you were healthy, you would be able to gain wealth. The reverse is not possible. If a person is healthy, he would be able to find work or carry out investments that could eventually make him wealthy. However, for a person who is wealthy but ill, even the best medical care that money can buy may not guarantee the return of that person's health. This fact alone is sufficient to support the view that wealth is less important than health.\n\nIn a nutshell, health is indeed more important than wealth for the reasons explained above. Of course, the ideal situation would be to have both health and wealth. But if you had to choose, pick the one that gives you the greatest amount of happiness."

        "content": "One of the many complaints students in our country have about school is having to wear uniforms. Some parents share this view, and thus have campaigned for school uniforms to be banned. However, I disagree, as school uniforms serve many useful purposes that make them an important part of our education system.\nOne reason why school uniforms should not be banned is because they prevent discrimination and bullying based on economic status. Without uniforms, the rich would dress better than the poorer students\nmaking the difference in their economic status clear. This could lead to discrimination. It would encourage undesirable attitudes such as pride and arrogance, envy and jealousy, and also bullying. Uniforms help make all students appear equal.\n\nBesides this, school uniforms help schools avoid the problem of inappropriate dressing. Modern fashions include clothing that is revealing. Such clothing is unsuitable for a school environment. It would be difficult for the school authorities to enforce rules of dressing without school uniforms. Even in countries where dress codes are enforced in the place of school uniforms, such as the USA, teachers face many problems with students wearing inappropriate clothing to school. School uniforms are the best solution to this problem, and thus should not be banned.\n\nA section of people argue that school uniforms make the school boring due to lack of variety. However this is not a good argument. When there is too much variety, it can lead to distraction. Not only will students be spending too much time decking themselves out for school every day but they will also be distracted by what their friends wear. This will take their attention away from what is important, that is, their studies. Therefore, having school uniforms would be beneficial to students' performance in school, as it would enable them to better focus their attention on studying.\n\nTo conclude, school uniforms should not be banned as they serve a number of important functions in schools. However, given the fact that they are an additional cost to students' families, care should be taken\nthat the purchase and upkeep of uniforms is not an undue burden to less fortunate students."

        "content": "Going to the zoo is an all-time favorite activity for children and families. However, there are some who argue against keeping wild animals in zoos for a number of reasons. In order to make a decision, we must consider the arguments for and against keeping wild animals in zoos.\nOne benefit of zoos is that they are useful for educating people about animals. We can observe animals at close range and learn more about them than we can from books and the TV. It also provides an opportunity to promote the conservation of endangered species. In addition, zoos allow scientists to study animal behavior more easily. This helps them to come up with better ways of protecting animals from\nharm in their natural habitat. For example, a number of Chinese zoos have successfully carried out research on the breeding habits of the giant panda which has increased the survival rate of this species.\n\nOn the other hand, keeping animals in captivity is similar to a prison sentence. Many zoos do not have large enough enclosures to keep animals comfortable. The animals have limited freedom to move about.\nWe often see even the ferocious lions lying passively in their enclosures just waiting for their next meal to be served. They suffer from stress and boredom. This in turn causes animals to live shorter lives. For example, Asian elephants live an average of 19 years in zoos, but live about 42 years in the wild. This is a very big difference. We have also heard about animals being neglected and mistreated because their caregivers lack the skill and knowledge to care for them properly. This is cruel.\n\nAnother thing we need to take into consideration is the cost of maintaining a zoo. A lot of funds are needed to run a zoo. Money is needed to stock the zoo with all kinds of animals. Staff must be hired and trained to take care of each species animal. The animals need food and medical care. Special spaces need to be built to house each type of animal. More staff are needed to clean and maintain the zoo grounds. Even with all the money and effort spent to keep animals in a zoo, these animals are still not getting the best. The money and effort are better channeled to conservation programs.\n\nIn conclusion, while zoos do have some advantages in the areas of education and conservation, it is cruel and selfish to keep animals in an unnatural prison. If you want to see animals, I advise you to go on a safari. For conservation and research, set up sanctuaries like the Sepilok orangutan sanctuary in Sabah. It is kinder to leave the animals in their natural home - the wild."

        "content": "Electronic games include video games and computer games that are played on special devices like the well-known Playstation or a computer. Games like Angry Birds and highly detailed simulations such as Modern Warfare are very popular with youngsters. Some of these games are so entertaining that even adults play for hours on end. Hence, many people view electronic games negatively and claim that they are a waste of time. However, I think that electronic games are not a complete waste of time.\nFirstly, electronic games actually help develop some important skills from fine motor skills to critical thinking skills. Have you seen how good children are at manipulating the controls on their keyboards and game consoles? Research has shown that playing these games improves hand-eye coordination. On top of that, many of the electronic games are mentally challenging. They require quick thinking to resolve problems, and clever strategizing to win against other players or the computer itself. Playing these games therefore has intellectual benefits.\n\nSecondly, playing the right kind of computer and video games can be educational. It improves the players' skills and knowledge in various subjects. Playing a game that is based on historical events leads to the player learning dates and names without even realizing it. There are many simulation games involving role playing that allow the player to gain some valuable experience in handling real life and work situations. For example, there are games where the player runs a restaurant or a hospital. This sort of activity helps enrich knowledge and skills. Hence, playing electronic games is certainly not a waste of time.\n\nThirdly, everyone needs some form of entertainment for relaxation. Playing electronic games is just another form of recreation which helps the players relieve stress. It is similar to playing a board game or cooking. The time spent is rewarded with a sense of well-being. In fact, it is a cheap and convenient way to keep oneself entertained. Players can choose to play on their own or play with friends. They can play in their own homes so no extra cost for transportation or rental of space or equipment is necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, it cannot be denied that electronic games can be addictive leading to players spending too much time playing and neglecting their work, studies and relationships. Too much time spent on anything is not good. There are some games which teach negative values such as violence and dishonesty. Playing such games would be a waste of time. Players need to choose games that have educational value so that the time they spend on those games benefits them.\n\nIn conclusion, playing electronic games has many benefits and so, cannot be regarded as a waste of time. However, to benefit from playing such games, one must be disciplined and not spend too much time on this pastime as well as pick games that have educational value."

        "content": "Physical education and sports activities are part and parcel of the Malaysian school curriculum. However, sports is not compulsory for all students. Normally, only students who are exceptionally good in certain sports will receive training and participate in competitions. In my opinion, sports should be made compulsory in school because participation in sports activities has many benefits for students.\nThe first thing that comes to most people's minds when they hear the word 'sports' is exercise. Sports provides students with exercise that leads to good physical health. A recent news report said that obesity among Malaysians is on the rise. It is commonly known that the best way to avoid becoming obese is to exercise regularly. Nevertheless, there are some students who do not like exercising. For this group, making sports mandatory in schools would be an ideal way of making sure that they get the exercise needed to stay healthy.\n\nBesides improving physical health, participating in sports also teaches students important soft skills and values. Leadership skills, discipline and perseverance can all be learnt through sports. Teamwork is also a valuable thing to learn through sports. In team sports such as football, basketball or volleyball, players must learn to work together and cooperate with one another in order to succeed. These important\nlessons that can be learnt through sports lead to the well-rounded development of children and teenagers.\n\nOn the other hand, some people feel that making sports compulsory in school would lead to some negative consequences. Sports is mostly about competition. This might make youngsters focus too much on winning and become overly competitive. However, in my opinion, this provides a good opportunity for young people to be taught how to compete in a fair and honest manner. They should also be taught that it is not winning but trying one's best that matters. Experiencing healthy competition in school will help prepare young people for the working world which is a competitive place after all.\n\nIn conclusion, sports has many benefits for students. Taking part in sports promotes good health, develops soft skills encourages good values and prepares young people for the competitive environment they will face when they leave school. Hence, it only makes sense to make sports compulsory in school."

        "content": "I live in a kampung near Mersing on the east coast of Johor. There are some very beautiful beaches. The people in the kampung are very friendly and closely knit.\n\nI would like to tell you about our favorite pastime, kite flying. In fact, the whole community loves kite flying. My father used to take part in international kite flying contests. Kite flying is purely for fun nowadays.\nWe make everything from scratch. The whole family is involved and it is the work of the men in the family. Usually one of us together with our neighbors will get together to make the 'wau'. We first start with the frame. It is made of a special bamboo. After the bamboo is cut into lengths carefully, the strips are tied into position. My job is usually to help my brothers cut out and paste the paper. When we have pasted the third layer of paper, we will usually compare our kites with the others in the neighborhood. We love Pak Abu's decorations and ornaments of mythical birds.\n\nThen it is time to fly the kites. Everyone would gather along the beach or the football field in front of the community hall. During weekends and school holidays, we will fly our kites. It is exciting to see gigantic kites soaring in the sky.\n\nThese days, we watch a lot of television for relaxation. The womenfolk particularly enjoy soap operas. They love Korean drama serials the most. They will talk about the stories and characters whenever they meet. The grannies will warn the young girls about the danger of going to such dangerous places as pubs, quoting the serials they are presently watching. 'Don't be like...' is something we hear all the time. In fact, our dinners are timed in such a way that their view time is not interrupted and not a single part of any episode is missed.\n\nThe menfolk will not mumble too much for they have the football fever. The English Premier league, the FA Cup, the Champions league, just to mention a few. They will gather in a few houses to watch matches. They will cheer and shout encouragement and boo! The next few days they will discuss the performance of their favorite teams at mamak stalls.\n\nThe one time that the menfolk and womenfolk watched television together was the Beijing Olympics. Even until today, an unintentional mention of Usain Bolt will make most people including my mother beam and talk about the amazing athlete.\n\nA lot of people in our community also like to do gardening. In fact, Kampung Suria is famous for its herbs. Selasih, mint, kunyit, misai kuching - you name it, we have it. Early morning and evening you will see us in our little plots of land. We will be weeding, trimming, putting fertiliser, watering the herbs and vegetables that we grow for our own consumption. We are the organic pioneers. We even have a contest annually. It could be the biggest pumpkin or the most bountiful bitter gourd harvest. It is all in good fun.\n\nTimes had once been difficult for the residents of Kampung Suria. Learning from the past experience, being self-sufficient, taking delight in living a simple lifestyle and enjoying one's pastimes have long been most people's philosophy of life. This is why the senior citizens of Kampung Suria are always in good mood and health."

        "content": "The new year is celebrated throughout the world at different times according to the solar or lunar calendar. The Gregorian solar calendar celebrates the beginning of the new year on the first of January. For the Muslims, the new year, Awal Muharram, is based on the lunar year in the spring. Similarly, Chinese New Year is celebrated according to the lunar calendar. However, all the new years represent a fresh start.\nIn fact, for the Chinese, Chinese New Year is their most important festival.\n\nPreparation starts months ahead, usually with spring-cleaning. Many people give their houses a new coat of paint to spruce them up. Some people put up paper couplets with wise sayings on the front doors. In many households where Buddhism or Taoism is practised, home altars and statues are cleaned thoroughly too.\n\nA shopping spree also takes place at the same time. New clothes are bought for everyone. New year cookies like 'love letters', pineapple tarts and niangao are musts in every household. They all have auspicious significance indicating a prosperous year ahead. All varieties of delicacies are bought in preparation of the reunion dinner.\n\nThe dinner on the eve is a very special dinner as all members of the family come back for it. The married sons will bring their families with them. Usually a feast is laid out with fish and chicken and all kinds of treats for the family. Each family has its own countdown party with more food and drinks.\n\nOn the first day of the new year, in the traditional families, the children will offer tea to their parents. The parents will then give angpows, red packets with money, to their children. This is to wish them good luck and blessings for the new year. Another custom is to visit the oldest and most senior members of the extended family, usually their parents, grandparents or great-grandparents. No sweeping is allowed on the first day so brooms and dustpans are put away. This is to ensure that good luck is not swept away.\n\nChinese New Year is celebrated for fifteen days. The seventh day is another special day. It is traditionally known as 'renri', the common man's birthday, the day when everyone grows one year older. It is celebrated by eating a colorful raw fish salad, yusheng. As people toss the colorful salad, they make wishes for continued wealth, health and prosperity.\n\nThere are two other significant days. One is the ninth day or rather the midnight of the eighth day. It is an important day for the Hokkiens as they make thanksgiving offerings to the Jade Emperor of Heaven. The other is the fifteenth day. It is celebrated as Yuanxiao jie or Chap Gob Mei. Rice dumplings (tangyuan), sweet glutinous rice balls brewed in a soup, are eaten. This marks the end of the new year celebrations.\n\nIn conclusion, we can see that Chinese New Year is a time for all to get together and renew their family bonds. It is the promise of fresh beginnings and hopes of prosperity for the whole family."

        "content": "A healthy person is a wealthy person. Wealth is here measured in terms of the person's physical well-being so that he or she is able to go about and carry out day-to-day tasks easily. He or she will look good and feel good. To attain this, physical exercise is a must.\n\nFirstly, exercise ensures our good health. Modern-day chronic diseases like heart problems, diabetes and certain cancers are all caused by the lack of exercise. Conversely, any one having these ailments will recover better if they include exercise as part of their daily routine.\nAnother instance why we need to exercise is doctors link the lack of exercise to many people having one form or another of insomnia. Moreover, when we sleep better, we have better resistance, to infections. This has been proven by astronauts. During missions, their bodies physically deteriorate.\n\nTheir bones, internal organs, and cardiovascular system are all negatively affected. However, it has been found that exercise reduces the changes significantly.\n\nAnother example of how exercise helps us to feel better is it gets rid of obesity. It burns off the calories. In our push-button lifestyle, we have become quite sedentary. 'Why walk when we can take the car' seems to be the way of life for all of us. Nowadays, even shopping is done online. Moreover, we seem to be only exercising our fingers as we play computer games, surf the Net and press the control button\nto change the channel to our favorite television program. Add that to the Malaysian favorite pastime of eating, it is no wonder that our young have bellies and double chins.\n\nLastly, students should exercise at least three times a week for at least twenty minutes per session, as exercise is a good stress buster. Exercise stimulates different brain chemicals. One of those chemicals is endorphin which makes a person become less stressed and more cheerful. Students preparing for their examinations are therefore able to concentrate better. As a result, they will do better in their examinations.\n\nIn conclusion, regular exercise is an effective way by which we can not only feel younger, but look younger."

        "title": "Should every child learn music ?",
        "content": "There has been a lot of talk among parents and educators about the importance of giving children a balanced education. Opinions are divided, however, when it comes to music. There are those who say that learning music is a waste of time, and puts too much pressure on the child. However, I believe that the many benefits of learning music outweigh any negative aspects.\nAmong the benefits of learning music is that it develops self-discipline and the determination to work hard towards achieving something. It is common knowledge that to do well in music, one has to practice on a regular basis. Of course, this may put pressure on the child to be disciplined to practice every day and to put in effort to do well. But the pressure will lead to positive results. The child learns from an early age that success can only come through hard work and perseverance. This is a strong reason to support the view that children should learn music.\n\nBesides that, learning to play a musical instrument has also been linked to improved intelligence. Studies carried out by universities have shown that children who have learned music perform better on tests of\nmemory, mathematical skills and reading. An enlargement in the part of the brain responsible for hand and finger movement was also noted. The time spent on learning music is certainly not wasted. Since learning music improves general intelligence in this manner, it is only logical that children should learn music.\n\nAnother benefit music has is its potential to help children express their creativity. The school education system may not provide enough opportunities for the child to develop and display their creativity. Learning music will give children the chance to express themselves, and help them to learn the joy of creating. Creativity is essential in many aspects of life, especially in problem solving. Giving children the chance to create through music can help build their creativity. This is another good reason to let every child learn music.\n\nTo sum up, learning music will benefit children in the three ways stated above amongst others. I believe that these benefits cancel out any disadvantages of learning music such as having to make time for the lessons and the pressure of taking music tests. Hence, in my opinion, every child should indeed learn music."

        "content": "A common complaint among teenagers today is about having too little freedom. The usual response from their parents is that they had even less freedom when they were young. Unfortunately for the average teenager, their parents are usually right. Today's youths do have more freedom than before, especially in the three areas of knowledge, communication and money.\nToday's youths have more freedom to find and exchange information. The main reason for this is, of course, the invention of the Internet and other forms of information technology. Youths are free to obtain information from websites like Wikipedia and HowStuffWorks. They are also able to share information with one another easily through blogs and other wikis. This new information freedom was not available to most of the previous generation. Therefore, youths today definitely are freer to get and share information than before.\n\nBesides that, youths today have more social freedom than before. Social networks like Facebook, Whatsapp and Skype running over the Internet allow young people to make new friends and communicate with friends more easily than ever before. While the previous generation did have access to telephones, today's youths often own mobile phones, which gives them not only the ability to speak with friends wherever they are, but also share pictures, music and videos with them easily. This has enabled today's youths to have more freedom in their social life.\n\nFinally, youths today have more freedom with their money. In the olden days, children had to ask their parents for money whenever they needed to buy something. Modern parents are more likely to give their children a lump sum monthly for their pocket money. Parents today are more educated and believe in teaching their children how to manage money from a young age. Once they have decided on a reasonable amount of allowance for their child, they leave it to their child to decide on how to spend that money. Hence, modern parenting allows youths more say in managing their money.\n\nIn conclusion, youths today do have more freedom than before. This is clearly seen in their increased freedom to access information, along with more social and economic freedom. Indeed, youths have little to complain about if they compare the level of freedom they enjoy to the restricted lifestyle of their parents' teenage years."

        "content": "In almost every country, more and more people have migrated from the country to the cities. People seem to think that living in the city is better than living in the country. Given a choice, I would choose to live in the city too and I have strong reasons for this.\nOne advantage of living in the city is that life is more convenient. Getting around the city with public transportation is easy. Some complain about the traffic jams in the city but I think that a little delay is better than having to walk or cycle for long distances as people do in the country. Schools in the city are generally better equipped. The choices for furthering our studies after secondary school are aplenty with the large number of colleges in the city. Getting medical attention is easy as the big hospitals are located in the cities. In addition, getting provisions is convenient with shops at every corner where you can buy just about anything.\n\nLiving in the city is definitely more exciting than living in the country. Within the city, there are all sorts of places to visit, including shopping malls, theme parks, museums and cinemas. Although some of these may also be available in some parts of the countryside, it is commonly known that the best ones with the best facilities are located in the city. Those living in the city have easy access to and a wide variety of ways to entertain themselves.\n\nOne main reason why people leave the country to start a new life in the city is because it is easier to find jobs in the city. In the country, economic activity is limited to agriculture and cottage industries. In the city, there are opportunities to build a career in a wide range of fields such as the services industry, management, sales and marketing. Large international companies set up their offices in the cities, which provide city people with more employment opportunities. Earnings are also higher in the city and people can enjoy a better lifestyle.\n\nOf course, living in the city has its downside as well. People earn more here but they also have to spend more because everything from rental to food is more expensive in the city. The environment is noisier and more polluted than in the country. The crime rate is higher in the city. The busy lifestyle of city dwellers also leads to more stress. But then, living in the country has its share of problems too. In my opinion, the advantages of city living outweigh the disadvantages.\n\nIn summary, city life is more convenient and exciting than country life. Also, there are more career opportunities in the city. These advantages are sufficient to persuade me to spend the rest of my life in the city."

        "content": "We have often heard of the adage 'Spare the rod and spoil the child. 'Giving six of the best' has been accepted as a way of instilling discipline in schools. I do not agree.\n\nSome so-called experts claim corporal punishment is a good way to prevent students from breaking rules and committing offences, especially repeat offenders. Seeing their schoolmates getting the cane will deter others from smoking or any wrongdoing.\nHowever, how physically punishing a student can help correct undesirable behavior is beyond me. It will make problematic students become more aggressive and violent. It merely reinforces the notion that violence is the way to solve problems.\n\nA few educationalists say that corporal punishment in schools is a form of preparation for real life. Wrongdoing has to be punished. Students have to be taught to be responsible for their actions. In my opinion, caning would only affect the child's ego and self-confidence. Students who have problems learning will withdraw into their shells and lose whatever little self-confidence they have. They will live in an environment of fear. How often have we heard of children pretending to be sick to avoid school? The humiliation and shame of being caned, especially if in front of your friends will result in psychological scars. They will become more resentful and delinquent.\n\nA caning schedule is part of the school regulation - what warrants one stroke of the cane, what offence gets two and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no guarantee that caning can be imposed properly. It can be abused. There has been little research done on the effectiveness of corporal punishment in schools. A better alternative is counseling. Removal of privileges is another way. School authorities and teachers have to be firm with their dos and don'ts.\n\nIn conclusion, the American Academy of Paediatrics urges parents, educators, school administrators, school board members, legislators, and others to seek the legal prohibition of corporal punishment in schools and to encourage the use of alternative methods of managing student behavior. I agree."

        "content": "Have you ever felt stressed? Well, you are not alone, as every person in the world has to face stress at one time or another. Since stress is a part of life, it is essential to learn how to deal with it. Here are some strategies for dealing with stress and pressure.\nMost of the time, stress is a result of feeling overwhelmed. To get rid of this feeling, keep yourself organized. For example, you could keep a daily organizer and plan your activities. Get your priorities straight and focus on things that are really important. Do not get caught up in minor issues that only create additional work for you. Break tasks down into manageable bits and tackle them one by one or step by step. Proper planning also helps you avoid the stress of doing things at the eleventh hour.\n\nBesides that, taking time to relax can help you ease stress. Doing things that you like such as listening to music, taking a walk or reading a book can take your mind off things that bother you. Even doing nothing at all can be beneficial. After a short break, you will feel refreshed and more able to tackle a problem or a piece of work. Of course, make sure that taking a break is not an excuse for putting off your work. This would only cause you more stress when you have to rush to finish your work in the end.\n\nFinally, do not set such high standards for yourself and others that it leads to dissatisfaction and pressure. If you aim for perfection all the time, you will end up frustrated and stressed out. Learn to slow down, let go and look at the positive side of things. If you are too uptight about something, you will not be able to think clearly and make good decisions. In addition, you could hurt the people around you. Focus on what has already been done and what is good. Then, negative stressful feelings will disappear.\n\nIn conclusion, stress may be unavoidable but it need not make life miserable for you. There are many ways to reduce and deal with stress such as the three strategies shared here. Life gets better once stress is controlled."

        "content": "According to the World Health Organization, almost 6 percent of the world's population has abused drugs. Although this percentage seems small, it actually represents millions of people who have abused drugs. This statistic is very worrying because of the harmful effects of drug abuse. We need to find effective ways to fight this problem.\nDrugs like heroin and cocaine have destructive effects on a person's health. The drug user may face heart disease, liver and brain damage, and kidney failure. Drug users who share needles to inject themselves with drugs face a high risk of being infected with AIDS. Also, the brain damage caused by drugs is known to cause mental problems such as paranoia and hallucination. Furthermore, the negative health effects of drugs are not only limited to the drug user. If the drug addict is pregnant, there is a high chance that the unborn child will suffer mental and growth retardation.\n\nDrug also has an adverse effect on society. A drug addict will do anything to get more drugs. The addict often commits crimes to get enough money to sustain his habit. The money spent on drugs may then be channeled to crime syndicates, which could use the money to fund other illegal activities. Unfortunately, drug abuse creates a group of people who are unable to work or study, and thus unable to benefit society.\n\nClearly, solutions must be found to resolve the issue of drug abuse. Firstly, the young must be educated on the dangers of drug abuse to prevent them from experimenting with dangerous substances. Secondly, there needs to be more effective law enforcement to stop the distribution of drugs. Drug pushers must be caught and severely punished. In addition, drug addicts need to be given help to get rid of their addiction. Better ways need to be found to rehabilitate them so that they can keep away from drugs and become useful citizens again.\n\nTo conclude, it is a sad fact that drug abuse is a serious problem in many countries around the world. More efforts are needed to stamp out this problem. The individual, the public and the authorities must work hand in hand in order to rid society of the terrible effects of drug abuse."

The new challenges facing youths today are brought about by the changes in society and the modern lifestyle.\nA major problem youths face today is linked to today's competitive education system. From a young age, we have to spend hours of our day studying first at school, then at tuition classes leaving us little time to relax and play. The exam-oriented school environment gives us no space to pursue our interests. We are constantly reminded that we have to perform well in order to compete for a place in a good university. Trying to meet the expectations of teachers and parents causes us great stress.\n\nAnother serious problem facing young people today has to do with the electronic media. Firstly, there are plenty of addictive computer and digital games that vie for our attention. Many youths have given in to temptation and find that they are unable to stop playing late into the night. Similarly, youths get addicted to social networking on sites like Facebook and Twitter. The result is difficulty juggling their online social activity and other important tasks such as studying.\n\nThese modern times have also created major problems for youths in the area of moral values. Young people these days are confused about what is right and wrong. Our parents and teachers may teach us traditional values. But in reality, society's moral standards have dropped drastically. This is reflected in television reality shows that encourage selfishness and backstabbing. No one bats an eyelid nowadays at the increasing violence and loose morals shown in movies. People live together before marriage. Divorce and abortion is no longer frowned upon. Criminal actions are glamorized. It is no wonder that we are confused. Making decisions has become a big problem for us.\n\nAll in all, life for the youth of today is more challenging than before. Some of the main problems we face are the competitive education system, the allure of the electronic media and the confusing moral standards. When we make mistakes, parents and teachers have to guide us, not scold and punish us. Patience and understanding will ease our burden and encourage us to communicate more meaningfully with the adults who care about us."

        "content": "Large families were normal many years ago. It is no longer so. Today's families usually consist of only two or three children. There are many reasons why people have chosen to have less children and smaller families today. Small families definitely have several advantages over large families.\nFirstly, small families can have more comfortable lives. With fewer people living under one roof, there is more space for everyone. Children in large families often have to share rooms while those in small families can have their own rooms. There is also more peace and quiet in the home of a small family with less people competing over space, privacy and which TV channel to watch. Moreover, with less members in the family, less money is needed for basic necessities such as food and clothing. There is more money for better quality furniture, gadgets, bigger cars and holidays.\n\nA second reason why small families are better than large families is that the children will get more attention from their parents. This means that their emotional needs are more easily met. They feel loved and are happier and closer to their parents. Furthermore, parents with two children would have more time to guide and teach each child compared to parents with half a dozen kids. As a result, the children will be more mature and disciplined. Such children also do better in their studies.\n\nIn addition, the children in small families have equal opportunities compared to those in large families. Money and other resources are shared out among fewer children. Each of the children will probably have the chance to go to university. In large families, it is usually only the eldest or the smartest who will get such opportunities.\n\nTherefore, there is no doubt in my mind that small families are better than large families. I think small families enjoy a better quality of life. Not only that but each child will benefit from the loving guidance of the parents and have equal opportunities in life. That is why I personally prefer a small family."

They think that knowing their mother tongue and English Language is good enough. This is a pity because there are many benefits in learning a foreign language. I feel strongly that everyone should learn at least one other foreign language in their lifetime.\nThe most obvious benefit of knowing another language is that you can communicate more easily with people from different parts of the world. You will be able to learn more about another culture and form new friendships. Traveling to other countries would be easy. For example, if you know French, you will be able to communicate with people in most European countries, Canada, Africa and even Vietnam. In addition, you will be able to enjoy more variety in entertainment and reading material. Imagine being able to read and understand Japanese comics or to watch Korean drama without reading the subtitles.\n\nLearning a foreign language can also help you improve your studies. Students who learn an additional language besides English are known to do better in English and Mathematics. This is because the skills involved in learning a new language such as analytical skills are equally important in learning other things. As you learn a new language, you practise these skills and become even better. This will help you when you study school subjects. So, learning a new language for children could be as important as learning music or ballet.\n\nFinally, the ability to communicate in another language is valuable when you want to get a job. You will have the edge over those who know fewer languages because you will be able to deal with people from other parts of the world. Being multilingual does not only make it easier for you to find a job, but also makes you more valuable to your employer. This means that your salary and your job prospects will be better too.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many benefits that come from learning a foreign language. Hence, I strongly recommend that everyone learn an additional language. The benefits gained are worth the time and effort spent."

        "content": "I would agree that students should be encouraged to work part-time to a certain extent. Of course primary school pupils should not be allowed to work at all. As for secondary, and even tertiary students, working part-time should be allowed only during holidays. Working during weekends is not realistic as it would impact their studies.\nFirstly, times are bad. Working part-time during holidays would earn students some extra pocket money that will come in handy. Even if they use their pay to buy the latest model of a handphone or some branded shirts, they are at least not burdening their parents. This would definitely ease the financial stress at home. They would definitely learn how difficult it is to make money. As a result, they may appreciate their parents more. They may even be more careful with their money.\n\nSecondly, working part-time would give invaluable experience to students. Working at fast food outlets and as sales representatives or tutors would expose them to the real world. They would have to develop communicative skills and learn to deal with people. This is something money cannot buy. Working long hours for their pay may even make them value the importance of education, especially a higher education.\n\nCritics may argue that working part-time may result in the young mixing with unsavory company. On the other hand, we cannot be always protecting our young.\n\nFurthermore, many students have too much free time in their hands, especially during holidays. They just idle their time away. Moreover, students learn to cope with stress and pressure not just from demanding bosses and unfriendly colleagues, but also from their holiday assignments and projects. Students who work part-time will definitely learn a lot about time management and self-discipline.\n\nIn short, working part-time can be very fulfilling, but priorities must be clear. Students must be able to balance work and studies. The objective must still be studies first."

In fact, archaeologists have found remains of dogs that are 10,000 years old.\n\nFirstly, dogs are companions and friends to man. They are well known for their loyalty and unconditional love. Note what President Obama chose for his daughters. It was not an election promise that made him get a dog for his daughters. President Obama got them a Portuguese waterdog. This breed is well known for being loyal and protective.\nAnother instance of why dogs are man's best friend is dogs are invaluable to man in their work. Working dogs like the Siberian huskies and collies pull heavy loads across tracts of ice and snow. Sheep dogs such as border collies move sheep away from danger. Similarly, without the Anatolian shepherd, many sheep would be destroyed by wolves and feral domestic dogs. Herding dogs are used by stockmen in sheep and cattle farms around the world for mustering.\n\nFurthermore, police dogs, sometimes called K9 Units, are great assistants. They help track or immobilize possible criminals while officers arrest or investigate the scene of a crime. Some are even specially trained for anti-terrorist units, as in Austria.\n\nIn addition, some dogs help find lost people and animals. The St. Bernard is an example of a search dog. It was historically used in Europe in the case of avalanches and lost travelers. Search dogs are used in lost person searches each year and have helped save human lives.\n\nThirdly, dogs help the sick and disabled. These therapy dogs visit people in hospitals and nursing homes and provide cheer and entertainment. A wag and a lick on their hands brings a smile to the elderly in retirement facilities, the ill and injured in hospitals.\n\nAssistance or service dogs help people with various disabilities in everyday tasks. A newspaper columnist, Anthony Thanasayan, in his column 'Wheel Power' has been writing about how his friends have made significant changes in his life as a person born with a disability. His dogs help him to open and shut doors, push his wheelchair for him. Most importantly, they keep him from being depressed.\n\nIntelligent, loyal and loving, dogs really do live up to their reputation as man's best friend. Many of us would be lost without our faithful companions."

        "content": "In 2012, some people believed the world would end according to an ancient Mayan prediction. Thankfully, nothing happened. However, we must realize that the Earth is, in fact, in danger. This danger is not from asteroids or rogue planets, but from our actions and how they affect the environment. There are three main threats to Earth and they are global warming, loss of biodiversity, water and air pollution.\nGlobal warming is caused by the release of greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide into the air when coal and oil are burnt. These gases trap heat from the sun in the earth's atmosphere, causing temperatures to rise around the world and changing climate patterns. In recent years, global warming has worsened. Many parts of the world have experienced unusual and extreme weather resulting in drought, floods and dangerous hurricanes.\n\nAnother problem Earth faces is the extinction of plants and animals. In the past century, over 10,000 plant and animal species have died out, and about 25 percent of all remaining species is already in danger of disappearing. This can cause ecosystems to collapse. As part of the ecosystem, we humans would be severely affected as well. For example, the extinction of certain species of wild corn has created a loss of genetic diversity, making corn grown in farms especially vulnerable to diseases and pests, affecting our food supply. Because of this, it is important that we recognize the danger of the extinction of plants and animals.\n\nYet another danger that we face is pollution of air and water. Everyone knows the importance of having clean water to drink and clean air to breathe. However, many cities around the globe are facing problems with dirty air. For example, in Beijing, China, air pollution grew to such hazardous levels at one point that it was unsafe for people to go outdoors. As for water, many people assume that there is plenty of water around, more than enough to replace the polluted water. However, few realize that only 3 percent of the Earth's water is actually usable without extensive processing. Thus, any water pollution at all is dangerous, and can have a tremendously negative impact on our water supply.\n\nTo conclude, Earth is under serious threat from environmental damage. It is our responsibility to take action to protect the environment. Otherwise, the destruction of Earth is certain."

        "title": "Deforestation",
        "content": "It is reported that half the world's forests have already been destroyed. This widespread destruction is due to deforestation. Deforestation is the removal of a forest or group of trees where the land is later converted to a non-forest use. Cutting down trees is necessary for man's survival. However, deforestation has a number of adverse effects on the environment and needs to be controlled.\nThere are two main purposes for cutting down trees and one of them is to use the trees as resources. Essential items like paper, furniture and charcoal are all made from trees. Deforestation is also carried out to clear land for farming and to make room for roads and houses. As the population grows, more of the forest has to be cleared.\n\nAlthough deforestation is necessary up to a point, it has some negative effects on the environment. Firstly, cutting down forests destroys animal habitats, leaving them with no place to live. Deforestation also allows erosion to occur which leaves the land vulnerable to landslides and makes it difficult for plants to grow there. Finally, the removal of trees also worsens air pollution. Trees act as natural air filters that change carbon dioxide into oxygen. When they are removed, carbon dioxide can build up and pollute the atmosphere. Hence, it is obvious that deforestation harms the environment.\n\nDue to the harm deforestation causes, it is necessary to control it. There are a number of ways to do this. One of them is to make better use of farming land. This is so that we do not need as much land for farming, and hence do not need to cut down so many trees. There must also be laws to limit deforestation and these laws must be enforced strictly. On top of that, reforestation must be carried out systematically. This method involves planting new trees and plants in areas where deforestation has occurred to replace what was destroyed.\n\nTo sum up, although deforestation must be carried out, it can harm the environment and must be controlled. Beyond a certain point, this damage to the environment cannot be fixed. Hence, we should do our\nbest to make sure that the damage is never too great to fix."

        "content": "Recently, it was reported that Malaysia has the highest number of overweight people in Southeast Asia. This tells us that Malaysians have an unhealthy lifestyle. The Ministry of Health is trying to educate people about the importance of eating healthily and exercising regularly. A healthy lifestyle leads to good health. There are strong reasons why good health is important.\nFirstly, good health makes it possible for us to lead a normal life and to work, study and play freely. A healthy body is essential for the physical activity involved in working or playing with our friends. For example, to play football with your friends without easily getting tired, you need to be healthy. Also, scientists have found that healthy people concentrate better and remember things better. This means that we actually study and work better if we have good health.\n\nLeading a healthy lifestyle will also help us to live longer. An unhealthy lifestyle that involves eating too much or too little, having insufficient sleep, not exercising, smoking and drinking alcohol is a one-way ticket to ill health and life-threatening diseases such as cancer, diabetes, stroke and heart disease. These diseases are also known as lifestyle diseases because they are often the result of the unhealthy way we live. Needless to say, these diseases would send us to an early grave. Therefore, a healthy lifestyle is essential to a long life.\n\nIn addition, good health makes us feel good. Some may think that not being able to eat all the food we like or having to exercise is too troublesome, and will cause us to suffer. This is not true, as exercise and a healthy diet have both been shown to improve mood, and raise self-esteem. For example, in the case of exercise, your brain releases natural painkilling chemicals called endorphins during your workout which work to improve mood and relieve stress. Furthermore, being in good health helps us to feel happier about ourselves.\n\nIn conclusion, a healthy lifestyle is important as it helps us to lead full and normal lives, live longer and feel happier. Therefore, a healthy lifestyle is something that everyone should take care to practise."

        "content": "Life-changing experiences? After some hard consideration, three stand out. They have the most impact on me.\n\nThe happiest day of my life was my tenth birthday. All my friends had been up 'Top Buz: It was a ride I had begged, pleaded and cajoled my mum to let me go. Her reply was, 'You are too young to go alone. On my tenth birthday, my sister said she would accompany me. It was a great sacrifice on her part as Irin had a fear of heights. Looking down a three-storey building would make her retch. I was too giddy with happiness to realize what a great sacrifice my sister was making.\nI screamed and screamed with excitement as we were thrown up and down, left and right, round and round. It was utterly exhilarating. I did not notice that my sister was utterly quiet. When the ride stopped, I turned round to see my sister rigid with terror. That experience stood out in two ways. One, I loved the ride. It started my love affair with all rides. Two, I will not forget that my sister would (and still does) do everything for me.\n\nI was still as giddy when I was in the last year of primary school. I was impressed with a girl who claimed to be everything. I would hang at her very word and believe her utterly. One day Molly claimed that she just walked through the graveyard alone in the middle of the night. And that it was not the first time! Why, just recently she ... I was her slave.\n\nThe scales fell from my eyes when we were trapped in a lift. We both lived on the thirteenth floor. We were going home after tuition and I was listening to Molly, entranced, when the lift gave a sudden jerk. It creaked and plunged. Then all at once it stopped. The lights went off and we were in total darkness. Before I could utter a sound, I felt Molly clawing my arm. She was screaming hysterically. 'I can't breathe! There is no air! We are trapped!' Molly began to wail and howl.\n\nI was dumbstruck. Suddenly, the lights came on and the door opened. As I moved to the door, Molly pushed me away and dashed out of the lift. It was the most terrifying experience of my life. When the lift started falling, I could feel my hands going clammy and my heart hammering. I hate confined spaces. What was more frightening was Molly's behavior. I could forgive her panicking at being trapped in the lift and that the stories of her courage were mere stories. I cannot forget how she shoved me out of the way to get to the door, or, that she boasted to the world afterwards how cool and collected she was. I have since learnt to be more discerning and not to be so gullible.\n\nRecently I had a more traumatic experience that left me with nightmares. My cat was missing. I went round the apartment looking for Sheba. I could not find her. The whole family split up to go to look for her. She had been missing for three days.\n\nI was downstairs, heading to the rubbish collection area when I thought I heard a faint mewing sound. I hurried over. There was a huge carton. I peered into it and saw some movement. 'Sheba! You poor dear! Is it you?'\n\nThen I saw it. Lying partially covered by the papers was a newborn infant. There were ants crawling over it. I quickly called my parents. Its eyes were close. Was it dead?\n\nBy the time the police and the ambulance left, I was bawling. The baby had died. The poor baby. The poor mother! To have to abandon her child! Why? I kept asking the question.\n\nThese experiences have left an indelible mark on me. Life's lessons have taught me to value my family and to be responsible for my actions."

        "content": "Declared a city in 1994, Johor Bahru is a rapidly growing city. My wish list for Johor Bahru in ten years' time is simple - a city that is improved and developed based on the existing one. I think Johoreans do not need a 'megapolis' but changes that benefit the ordinary man and woman in the street.\n\nFirstly, priority must be given to better planned roads and drainage. Floods occur every time there is a heavy downpour. It has been flooding in Jalan Air Molek and Jalan Yahya Awal ever since I can remember. Recently housing estates like Taman Johor Jaya were also flooded. In fact, before the city grows more organically, there should be an improvement of the present infrastructure.\nSecondly, we need a garden city. We should 'green' the city. There are some parts of Johor Bahru that are lined with the trumpet flower trees. They are beautiful when the flowers bloom. This is a fine example that should be replicated elsewhere. Local species like the tembusu should be more widely planted. In fact many flowering plants thrive in our climate. An example is the bougainvillea. Otherwise we will really become an urban jungle - pavements and more pavements.\n\nThe present parks should also be improved upon. Set up public sports and fitness grounds and facilities for the young and elderly. Outdoor exercise equipment should be put up in all these parks for the senior citizens to exercise and enjoy the fresh air.\n\nIn addition, there should be better public transport. I think there are enough cars on the roads. In fact, cars should be banned from the city centre itself. Of course then, there should be more public buses that provide regular and efficient service. There should also be underground train services that link the people from one part of the city to the other. This will cut the massive traffic jams that plague Johor Bahru. Furthermore, there should be pedestrian walkways and bicycle lanes all over the city. This is one way to save the environment.\n\nTo ensure that Johor Bahru moves with the other major cities in Malaysia, we should build more facilities for the people. An example is libraries. The latest census figures indicate that Johor Bahru is fast becoming Malaysias second largest city, with a population of over one million. How many good libraries are there in Johor Bahru? There should be a library in every large residential area. Let the children, even the toddlers, make the library their second home. There is also urgent need to have public health centers. Public health care supported by state-of-the-art equipment should be one of the first priorities of the city. What is available now is too insufficient.\n\nLet's begin the work of 'remaking' Johor Bahru into a city where gracious living is a reality now."

        "title": "Eating out and eating at home",
        "content": "Malaysians are a fortunate lot when it comes to food. Food is readily available especially in towns and cities. There are hawker stalls along streets, restaurants, and food courts where a great variety of delicious food is sold. People have the choice of eating out or cooking their meals at home. Three factors that affect the choice of eating out and eating at home are cost, convenience and quality.\nIn terms of cost, eating out is usually more expensive than cooking at home. For example, buying the ingredients to cook a plate of fried noodles may cost less than half the price of a plate of fried noodles at a restaurant. Restaurants and food stalls need to make a profit. Therefore, they have to charge more than the actual cost of the food they serve.\n\nThe second factor that people consider when deciding to eat out or not is convenience. Having someone cook for you, serve you and clean up after you, definitely makes eating out more convenient than eating at home. This is one of the main reasons why people opt to eat out. It saves them the trouble of having to shop for the ingredients, doing the actual cooking, and washing up afterwards. Preparing a meal is also time consuming. So it is no wonder that busy people prefer to eat out most of the time.\n\nQuality is the third thing to consider when choosing between home-cooked food and outside food. Naturally, food prepared at home use better quality ingredients and is more hygienic generally. In contrast, food served at stalls and restaurants is often not prepared with such good quality ingredients as this would reduce their profit margins. Very often, flavour enhancers are also added to food along with too much oil and salt, which are not good for health.\n\nIn a nutshell, eating out is more convenient while eating at home is less costly and much healthier. Making the choice is really not that hard as it just depends on what is most important to you. If you dislike cooking, eating out is the solution. If you do not want to spend so much on food, then cooking your own meals is the better choice. Finally, if health is your most important concern, it would be better to eat at home."

        "content": "In recent times, reading as a hobby has taken a back seat to playing computer games and watching television. This is especially true for teenagers today. Most of them find reading books boring. In fact, young people should be encouraged to read more as reading has many benefits that other hobbies may not have.\nOne benefit of reading is that it improves our language. Books are a great way to learn new words and expand our vocabulary. When we read, we come across new words. The new words become familiar as we encounter them repeatedly in our reading. We learn how to use these words correctly and they become a part of our vocabulary. Having a good vocabulary enables us to express ourselves better both  in speaking and in writing.\n\nIn addition to language, reading also improves our general knowledge. Through reading, we can learn a lot about people, places and events among other things. A person who reads a lot may even know more about a country he has never set foot on compared to someone who has actually visited the place. A lot of information can be discovered in reading materials like newspapers, magazines, travel books, instructional manuals and story books. General knowledge is useful. It helps us to write and speak better. We become more knowledgeable and more interesting people.\n\nBesides improving our language and general knowledge, reading is also an entertaining pastime and helps reduce stress. Books are creative works. They can open up a new world to us. They stimulate our imagination and draw us into the world created by the book. Many readers find it hard to put down a book once they start reading. A well-written story is suspenseful and exciting. The reader can hardly wait to get to the ending. This form of entertainment is healthy and good for our minds.\n\nIn conclusion, reading is an entertaining hobby that holds many potential benefits for the reader. Reading is especially beneficial for students as it improves their language and general knowledge which will help them perform better in their examinations. Furthermore, reading helps lessen stress. These are sufficient reasons to take up reading as a hobby."

        "content": "Homework is a major part of every student's life. However, many dislike homework, as it keeps them from doing what they want at home. Often, students will make excuses to avoid doing any homework. However, homework actually plays a very important role in education for a number of reasons.\nFirstly, homework gives students practice in what they have learnt in class. Without this additional practice, students will usually forget what they have learnt. The extra work will also enable students to find out if they have understood what was taught during the lesson. When the teacher marks the homework, the teacher will also be able to check if a student needs help with a certain topic or concept. If a student has difficulty with a subject, it will be detected from his homework and the student can receive help before it is too late.\n\nAnother benefit of homework is that it keeps students occupied in a productive activity. Without homework, students will have a lot of time on their hands after school. They would most likely spend their time on things which they enjoy but are not beneficial, such as playing computer games and watching television. Homework ensures that students do some studying, which will help them do better in examinations. Otherwise, their time would be wasted on unproductive and even unhealthy pastimes.\n\nBesides, homework is important because it promotes self-discipline. Homework is usually done at home where there is no supervision by teachers. Unless students have strict parents who monitor what they do, it is up to the students to decide when to do the work or even whether to complete the task or not. With this, students would slowly become more used to the idea of doing independent work without someone breathing down their necks. This value will serve them well in the future, especially during work, where the ability to do independent work is a prized skill.\n\nTo conclude, homework plays a very important role in education, even though students like to complain about it. It provides students with valuable practice in what they have learnt, it provides students with a productive way to spend some of their time and it builds self-discipline. It is clear then that students should not be lazy and should do their homework diligently."

        "content": "It is a known fact that colors have an impact on our health. We use colors to describe our well-being. We could be 'in the pink of health'. However, we could be 'off color' or we may be 'feeling blue': Sometimes, you may catch us in 'a black mood'.\n\nResearch has found that colors can affect how we feel emotionally. If you go to a room that is painted just black, it can lead to depression. Experts have warned that we should avoid decorating any room entirely in black, however much teenagers want to, especially during the more troublesome years. A room that is painted totally white is also depressing as white is associated with sterile environments like hospitals and bathrooms. It can make the room feel a bit cold and clinical, and the mood of the person will be low.\nResearch into the physiological effects of color has shown our spirit is lifted by warm colors. Red, orange and yellow are the colors that energize and exude warmth. People just feel stimulated and better. Cool colors like blue and green are soothing and calming. Doctors often use these colors to relieve tension and stress. Blue, for instance, is associated with tranquil surroundings. Blue light is used for a calming effect in some mental hospitals. Other hospitals are now using soft green, blue, peach and sunny yellow on walls and even sheets and gowns. These colors seem to help patients to get well quicker.\n\nNutritionists and medical researchers have emphasized that we should imbibe `a rainbow of colors, that is to include all colors of fruits and vegetables in our diet to stay healthy. We should consume fruits and vegetables of five different colors in each meal. This is why we are encouraged to take green vegetables, tomatoes, pumpkins. The stronger the colors of the fruits or vegetables, the more power-packed they are with natural anti-cancer nutrients and phytochemicals. Phytochemicals occur as color pigments in fruits and vegetables. They contain antioxidants to help slow the aging process and reduce the risk of many diseases. So, take your strawberries and bananas. They are excellent for our health.\n\nSo, don't wait. Look at your room and the clothes you wear and the food you eat. Are they the right colors?"

We are fine here but I feel a little bit lonely. There is no younger sister for me to bully and to tell off about your untidy room or for taking my things. Father and mother send their love. They want you to be independent but at the same time they miss the little darling.\nI may sound a bit nagging here but I feel that I should give you some tips on how to keep safe and how to save your money. Though you are sharing a house with friends of the same age, they may be more safety conscious than you. Since this is the first time you are staying away from the family, maybe you need to know a few more safety tips, be it at home or outside.\n\nHere are some ways of keeping safe. Make it a habit to switch off the lights and fans when you go out of your room or when you leave the house. By doing this, you can save the electricity bill and thus save your money. More importantly, you can avoid any incidence of short circuit which can be very dangerous. Surely you are aware that short circuit is the main reason for most houses caught on fire, right?\n\nSo, do not forget. Always switch off electrical appliances and lights when you do not need them. Turn off the computer when not in use. By doing so, you can save the environment too because electrical appliances emits heat when they are on.\n\nHave some plants in the garden if you can. These plants can help to swallow up carbon dioxide and dust while cooling the area around them. With a cooler environment, there is less need for air-conditioning.\n\nUse public transportation whenever you can. Less driving means less fuel and more savings. Car pool helps you to save too because you share the traveling expenses. So you do not have to pay everything all by yourself. Make sure to send your car for regular servicing as this will keep your car more efficient so you do not need to consume much petrol.\n\nAnother way to save money is to plan before you shop. Make a list and check it twice to save money and minimize food waste. Buy only what you need and avoid buying that extra packet of snack or soft drink. Check the expiry date when buying packed or canned foods. The longer the expiry date, the better as this means the food is fresher. Food with earlier expiry date may be on offer but this may be a case of penny wise pound foolish as you might be forced to consume the food at a time when you do not need to. One may even overlook and end up throwing away the item.\n\nAnother tip which you, my younger sister needs is to keep healthy. I know you are lazy when it comes to exercising. But, you need to exercise to have a good health. Try jogging and swimming. As long as you do it regularly, you are on the road to good health. Eat well. Follow a healthy diet like what you eat at home, whole-wheat grains, fruits, vegetable and fish and you will stay healthy.\n\nThat is all for now. Do write to us when you have free time. Love from mum and dad."

This was an outing I will never forget.\nWe cycled to Bukit Nelayan. It was a long and winding stretch to the top. A tiring but exhilarating ride uphill and the view from the top was spectacular. We stopped to catch our breath and to enjoy the view. Then, we cycled downhill. The ride was easier as it was going downhill to Kampung Nelayan a few meters away from the foothill. The way down had a few sharp bends but it did not put us off. In fact,\nI got so excited that I challenged Hisham to a race. He protested and warned me about slowing down.\n\nI turned a deaf ear to his warning and filled with excitement, I zoomed down the hill and took the sharp bends like a pro. Trees and open spaces whisked past and I felt on top of the world without a care or thought for safety. Just as I turned a bend, a car appeared on the other side of the road. I was shocked to reality and gingerly applied the brakes to slow down. But, the brakes did not respond. I found myself spinning on and on down to the bottom of the hill. Now, in front of me were a huge tree and a clump of bushes. I had to avoid hitting the tree or I would end up with broken bones. I swerved and landed headlong into the bushes. Not exactly a soft landing but a safer one!\n\nHisham caught up with me and hauled me up from the bushes. On learning that I was none the worse from the fall, except shaken up, he gave me a hard glare and a good telling off. I looked at him sheepishly and we had a good laugh at my foolishness. Luckily the bicycle was not badly affected except for a bent fender. We cycled to Pak Man's house and this time at a leisurely pace.\n\nPak Man took us to the beach. We were helped into his boat and told to sit quietly and do as we were told. Pak Man said he did not want us to end up in the water. We were there to fish not to swim. I smiled awkwardly recalling the mishap at the hill. Soon, we were a distance away from the beach and the three men cast a net. They rowed the boat along dragging the net behind the boat. As usual, impatient to see the fruits of our labor, I stood up excitedly asking about the catch. Before I could get an answer, I found myself in the water. The boat had rocked and I fell into the sea.\n\nFortunately, I had a safety jacket on and it kept me afloat. Pak Man and his friends extended an oar and helped me back into the boat. Hisham did not say a word. He glared at me while Pak Man told me off about being impulsive and endangering my life. A few minutes later they pulled in the net and headed for the beach. They had a good catch. We had lunch at Pak Man's house and then left for home.\n\nHisham warned that he would not have any more outings with me until and unless I promise to behave."

        "content": "Pocket money is money that we have and that we can spend on what we like without having to account to someone. Usually, as far as children and teenagers are concerned, pocket money is given by their parents to help them pay for necessities. The amount of pocket money one requires depends on what one needs to pay for. It also depends on how much the parents can fork out. It may be given on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. Some parents attach conditions on what the money can be spent on.\nChildren can always ask their parents for money but there are limits. Parents will say that they have very few needs, other than food they have to buy in the school canteen. However, teenagers have more things to pay for like snacks, entertainment such as cinema tickets, DVD rentals, books and magazines when they go on an outing with friends. Other items they need to pay for may include mobile phones and phone credit, school supplies, public transport and other travel expenses, birthday and holiday presents and savings.\n\nSo, some teenagers may help their parents with household chores to supplement their pocket money. But, this is not advisable as it is wrong to attach a monetary value to tasks in the household. They may however be able to look for some ways to earn extra pocket money. It is more fun to earn your own money whatever the amount is. Parents should and can allow their children to earn pocket money.\n\nThere are several ways to supplement pocket money. Consider taking on a steady part-time job at a fast food outlet or a shop near your house. Helping your parents, neighbors or old people in the neighborhood with their work, such as typing or running errands like doing weekly shopping for them is another way of earning some pocket money. At, times, one can also do some mowing of the grass for the neighbor or looking after their home when they are away. These are good neighborly act and perfectly sensible ways of earning some extra money.\n\nTutoring other students is a good way of supplementing your pocket money. Doing this helps the students and in return you are indirectly doing revision. Babysitting for some neighbors is another activity that is both useful where earning pocket money is concerned and developing a sense of responsibility. In many countries teenagers earn quite a bit of money by offering to babysit on weekends or for a couple of hours in the afternoon.\n\nAsk your parents about joining a car boot sale, rummage sale or posting items on eBay or another online auction site is another good way to earn some extra money. While you are earning money, you are helping the family to clear the clutter in the house. Make sure whatever you take to the sale is really not wanted by family members or you might end up poorer and burn a hole in your pocket.\n\nAllowing the teenagers to earn pocket money benefits both parents and the teenagers. The latter learn to value money as they have to work hard to earn it. They learn to be independent and may appreciate their parents as the breadwinners. They also learn the importance of being responsible for their work, either at school or part-time work. The former or parents will realize that teenagers need their space to mature with confidence.\n\nWhether parents should allow teenagers to earn pocket money depends on the family circumstances. Pocket money can be the bane of any teenager's existence. No matter how much you get, it never seems enough. Of course this is the point of pocket money, to teach you to budget and save and become responsible for your purchases. Prove to your parents that you are equal to the task and you just might be pleasantly surprised by the results!"

        "content": "I stood there dumbfounded and stared at her with my mouth open and wondering if I had heard correctly everything that she had said just now. Then, I fell back against the basin and held my toothbrush tightly. What exactly happened just now? Did she really say all those things? I was trying to understand what had just transpired.\nPlop! Plop! The toothpaste dripped from my open mouth to my toes. That jolted me back to where I was and what just happened. I was brushing my teeth and thinking of the test I had to face in school when Rebecca barged into the bathroom. Without preamble, she looked at me with such a look that if looks could kill, I would have died then. \"Sister dearest, if you think you can get away with what you have done, think again. You've always been my idol, my know-all older sister. I've always looked up to you but now, you have dropped to zero. I will never look up to you again. You .. you ... \" She stormed out unable to finish her sentence.\n\nI quickly cleaned up and rushed out of the room. Mum was at the top of the staircase looking at Rebecca's retreating back. She turned and looked at me with question marks written all over her face. I shook my head and rushed down the stairs. Rebecca had disappeared by then. I would try and locate her in the school and talk to her. But, no. I couldn't because we might end up having a shouting match in school. As the bus drew near the school, I still could not make out the reason for Rebecca's behavior. I tried to recall but there was nothing in my actions in the past week that I could pin down.\n\nWhen I reached school, my good friend, Suzy was waiting for me. I told her what had happened this morning between Rebecca and me. She let out a loud laugh and chuckled non-stop until I told her to stop it. She put her hands on my shoulder and sat me down on the canteen bench.\n\n\"You really cannot remember what you did to her?\" Suzy asked shaking her head in disbelief. \"Either you have lost your memory or you are getting old!\" Her words calmed me and then it hit me. Rebecca was angry and she had the right to be. I had totally forgotten what I did five days ago. I had submitted Rebecca's name for the Spelling Bee Contest. She had been unwilling to do it when the contest forms were issued. I know that she was capable of doing well in the contest and I had tried to persuade her. But, she had stubbornly resisted. So, I had taken it on myself to submit her name and her name had been picked among all the entries to represent the school. No wonder she was so upset.\n\nI laughed heartily and did a little jig with Suzy. That settled, I went to look for Rebecca. She was talking and laughing outside her classroom. She did an about turn and was silent when she saw me coming. I went up to her. I apologized, congratulated and cajoled her until she smiled and laughed at her unreasonable behavior in the morning.\n\nShe hugged me and apologized and said, \"Thanks, sis, for having the confidence in me and submitting my name. Sorry for behaving so badly this morning.\" Things went back to normal between us."

        "content": "I glanced at the TV screen and saw a burning house. The crowd was shouting and pointing to the fire. I switched the channel and read a subtitle in Malay \"Tembak! Tembak!\" - the Malay word for \"Fire! Fire!\" Before I could say anything, the imp of my brother called out, \"Got you there! Shoot!\" Of course, \"fire\" could mean \"shoot\" in another context. Reading a dialogue in the papers, this sentence popped out, \"I will fire you if ....\" Fire in this case means to be sacked. The word fire has different meanings depending on the situation.\nThe history of fire will take us back to the days of the cavemen who lived in fear of wild animals or who ate raw meat or uncooked plants. Later, they used \"fire\" to survive the dangers of the wild and the cold. Heat from the sun was harnessed to make fire. From here, man progressed to man-made fires. These were made from natural materials like wax, kerosene and gas. With a mere flick of a switch we now get a lighted stove that burns from gas or electricity.\n\nFire has made life more comfortable as the fireplace keeps the bones and body warm in winter. Food can be cooked and need not be consumed raw. Strange that when man has discovered the power of fires to cook food, some people have decided to revert to eating \"raw\" food. The Japanese like to eat their seafood raw. We have the meat eaters who like their steak to be cooked \"rare\" or \"medium rare\" or \"well done\".\n\nThen there is the barbecue and satay or having food grilled on open charcoal fire. We can also have baked or roasted meat by cooking over fire. Have you ever been to a campfire? Boy Scouts, girl guides, cubs and rangers have wonderful memories of their camping days, sitting around and singing and cooking over a campfire. Watching the logs crackling and the flinders and ash flying into the air and the night filled with the happy chatter and laughter makes for memorable school times.\n\nThen what about the fires that are so huge that they destroy without mercy. A house on fire, a building on fire or even forest fires lick and eat up everything in its path. No fire victim could ever forget the uncontrollable fear of being caught in a fire and they will relive the nightmares of a fire over and over again. We can tame fire to serve our human needs but a fire that is allowed to blaze away, uncontrolled, heightened by the forces of nature like hurricanes, tornados and whirlwinds can destroy precious lives and property.\n\nYet, knowing the force of fires, man has been known to play with fire. The ordinary matchstick, the one touch lighter, the gas flame, the burning candle, the lighted cigarette when used wisely, is man's friend but abused or misused can become man's worst enemy."

        "content": "Good morning to Puan Hamidah, teacher-in-charge and friends. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk on road safety for cyclists and motorcyclists. As you know, I attended a talk of the topic last Friday at the Road Transport Department. So I hope I can pass on the message about road safety to all of you.\nCyclists and motorcyclists are the main victims in road accidents. You are more exposed to dangers than car drivers. So, it is important that you take precautions and observe road safety.\n\nLet's start with the cyclists. First, allow me to tell you what you should do before you go off on your bicycle. Wear crash helmets and knee pads to protect your head and your knees. Fasten them properly for if you don't they might come off and your head or knees will be exposed in case of an accident. Wear proper shoes instead of slippers as the latter can get entangled with the pedals and your feet may slip as you cycle along.\n\nThe same advice goes to motorcyclists. Your crash helmet is your first defence against head injuries. Make sure you buy the approved crash helmets. Unlike cyclists, motorcyclist are more likely to travel a longer distance and so face more potential dangers. Wear appropriate attire like gloves and proper shoes. When you place your feet on the ground to stop at a junction, compared to slippers, the shoes can give you better protection from the heat. If you are wearing a jacket, button up properly as you do not want your jacket to flap in the wind or be caught in any passing vehicle.\n\nBoth cyclist and motorcyclist should check their vehicles before leaving the house. Check the back light, tyres and brakes to make sure they are in good working condition. Motorcyclists should check their engines and fuel to make sure they have enough fuel for their journey. All motorcyclists should switch on their headlights the minute they start their journey.\n\nFinally, don't speed on the road. Speed kills. Don't overtake recklessly. Make sure the road is clear if you want to overtake. Cyclists should not cycle two or three abreast. This applies to motorcyclists too. Have both hands on the bicycle or motorcycle and don't use any handphone while on the road. Motorcyclists should use the motorcycle lanes along the major highways. Observe all traffic rules and regulations.\n\nI sincerely hope I have convinced you to be careful while cycling or motorcycling on the road. Your life and that of other road users are too valuable for you to be careless.\n\nThank you for your attention and if you have any questions, feel free to ask me."

        "content": "My grandma used to live in a small farm 20 kilometers from the town where we stay. Grandma planted vegetables and flowers for sale. In addition she had a small fish pond where she reared several species of fishes for her and the neighbors' consumption.\nGrandma left a mark on my life for what she was and what she did. You know you love and care for a person when you look at her and feel your heart brimming with a special kind of feeling. That is love and that is what I feel when I looked at Grandma. She was a superb grandmother. She was so adorable and every one of my friends loved her.\n\nShe would give us pocket money and fresh fruits whenever we visited her. Every holiday I went and stayed with Grandma. Sometimes a few friends came along. The minute I get to the farm, Grandma would make me forget all my worries and make sure I enjoy myself.\n\nI learned to appreciate nature up close as Grandma taught me to fix a fishing line to catch fish, identify bird calls and animal and insect sounds. She always said that there was no better place for her than nature in the raw. She would wade into the river and even caught fish with her bare hands. Then she would let it go. I discovered the intricacies and techniques of vegetable planting and floral cultivation. Grandma can even predict the weather just by smelling the air and looking at the clouds. The best times I have spent with Grandma were when we sat on the beach to observe the sunrise and sunset. The splendor of the sun made me realize how lucky I was to have such a lovely lady by my side.\n\nI always thought Grandma was the one and only and different from other grandmothers I had seen. For her age and generation, she understood all of her grandchildren and listened to us even when we grumbled about out parents. She was open-minded and I want to be like her when I grow old. She was very supportive of whatever we, her grandchildren wanted to do. She had even gone with us on some\nof our nature hikes and adventures to isolated places. She always encouraged us to believe in ourselves.\n\nI remember clearly the times when Grandma and I sat on the beach at midnight to wait for the turtles to come up and lay their eggs. We kept very quiet and as the turtles shed tears as they did their egg laying, Grandma shed silent tears too. She said that she felt sad when she thought of the fate of those young turtles after the eggs hatched. Most of them never made it to adulthood.\n\nThe next morning, as we were playing in the sea, something dark floated up to where I was. I screamed but Grandma silenced me and bent to scoop it up. It was a young turtle which must have got detached from its family. One of its legs had a small cut. Grandma took it home and looked after it. When the cut healed, I wanted to keep it as a pet but Grandma advised against it. It was better for the turtle to have a normal life in the sea. So we went to the beach and let it swim away. That day, I learned to appreciate the creatures of nature.\n\nThen, all of a sudden, Grandma's health deteriorated. It was heartbreaking to see her lying in the hospital bed. Two months down the road, she breathed her last with a smile on her face. My Grandma was definitely one of a kind and one I would change for all the money in the world."

        "title": "Parents and children should spend more time together. Discuss.",
        "content": "The family unit of parents and children is the most important aspect of our life. Some families are big with at least four children while others opt for smaller family units of one or two children. Nowadays, it is unusual for families to have more than three children especially urban families. Whatever the number, a common complaint nowadays is 'my parents have no time for me' or 'my children prefer to spend time with their friends'. This begs the question why or what is the reason for such complaints.\nA very basic rule of parenting is that parents should spend time with their children. This is the time when parents can show their love and care for their children, physically and emotionally. Similarly, the children can show that they appreciate their parents' love and this brings about a strong parent-child relationship. Both parties benefit.\n\nWork commitment is one reason why parents do not spend time with their children. They are the bread winners and always want their children to have the best. Often both parents work to support the family especially because of the high cost of living. Sometimes, mothers opt for a career outside the home as they find the role of a homemaker too restricting. This preoccupation with their careers means less time with their children. Consequently, the children turn to their friends who are there to offer a helping hand and a shoulder to cry on as and when it is necessary. They confide and open up to their friends more than their parents. Another substitute for their parents is the maid who is always there.\n\nWhen parents get home from the office and the children from school, it does not mean that they gravitate to each other with their problems. Most of the time, it is just a gruff, \"How was your day?\" and a mumbled answer. Then, they are on their own - mother prepares a meal, father and children either in front of the computer or their iPhones. They spend time together at a meal but each is more absorbed in his or her own thoughts rather than what the others are thinking about.\n\nThis scenario is inevitable and common and it is a disturbing aspect of our so-called progressive society. What can both parties do to correct the situation? Parents can reschedule their activities with the aim of spending more time with their children. Plan for holidays, real holidays together. Children can also do some rescheduling and spend less time with their friends. Have quality time together doing the same things. Have common interests like watching a game of football or badminton together. Ask about each other's day sincerely and listen to the replies attentively. This will help forge a close and healthy relationship and is a good and effective example of spending time together.\n\nSpending time together whether as parents and children or among friends take effort and time. Stay focused and you will reap the harvest of your efforts."

        "title": "We eat to live.",
        "content": "Food is any substance that we eat to provide nutritional support for our body. It usually consists of plant or animal origin, that contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. We take them as sources of energy, to stimulate growth, and maintain life.\nIt has been said that man does not die but that he kills himself by overeating. It is puzzling that food which sustains life can also kill life. What it means is that if we are given to overeating over a period of time, our arteries can be clogged up with fats and we can die of coronary diseases. What is true of the world is that some die of overeating while some others die of starvation.\n\nHistorically, people obtained food from hunting and gathering, farming, ranching, and fishing, known as agriculture. Today, most of the food energy consumed by the world population is supplied by the food industry operated by multinational corporations using intensive farming and industrial agriculture methods.\n\nFood sustains life. It is indispensable for life. If you go without food for a couple of days, you will be like an invalid, immobile and incapable of doing anything. Yet, there are people who go on hunger strike and risk death to plead a cause. Ladies who want to lose weight will cut down on their necessary food intake and suffer side effects. Some even have problems of malnutrition. Fasting or abstaining from food is practised for religious reasons.\n\nThe type of food that people take depends on the climatic conditions they live in and the type of soil in the country. People who live in the tropics and equatorial countries take rice as their staple while people in temperate countries take wheat and potatoes for carbohydrates and meat for protein. Meat gives them the protein to withstand the cold weather. Religion also determines the type of food people take. Muslims do not take pork while Hindus do not take beef. Some people follow a vegetarian diet due to their religion. Still others will eat anything and there are those who go to the extreme of eating what they call exotic meat, that is, the flesh of rare and wild animals.\n\nSome food has more nutritional value than others. While meat provides lots of protein, vegetables contain a lot of minerals and vitamins. It is always advisable to follow a balanced diet. Food can be cooked in a number of ways - fried, steamed, baked or grilled. The way food is prepared depends on one's taste and interest. While meat has to be cooked properly, vegetables can be eaten raw or cooked.\n\nFood serves two main purposes - it satisfies hunger and provides nutritional requirements for the body. It can provide pleasure and there are people who eat out of boredom. A normal healthy man will not reject food. The desire for food can be psychological and there are many among us who become frantic when food is not easily available. To them, eating has become a habit and they believe that without food at frequent intervals, they will lack energy and cannot carry on with their work.\n\nFood is indispensable to life. We eat to live not live to eat."

        "content": "Roland and I were participating in the Sabah Adventure Challenge, a 150 km race. This was the final leg of the challenge - hill trekking. The past two days had been hectic and physically challenging and we had covered mountain-biking, orienteering, paddling and tubing. We had come through the other activities in either the first place or second place. On this last leg we had to do jungle trekking, followed by hill trekking.\nThe race had attracted us the minute we saw the advertisement. It would be like going into the unknown where we would not know what lay ahead. We knew we would be challenged mentally and physically. After signing up, we launched into a training program to be well-prepared. Of course we hope to win. There was no let up in our training for the two months prior to the challenge. Every day we start our training with a hike up and down Gasing Hill, cycling in the park and swimming. We have even attempted paddling and tubing in Kota Tinggi river and waterfalls. We have a good relationship and understand each other well.\n\nOn the last day, we were going uphill and as we went higher we could hear the sounds of falling rocks and earth. We had outpaced the other pairs of competitors and were feeling a bit high. As we climbed higher, we saw a lone climber standing precariously on a ledge. We signaled to him to be careful as we feared for his safety. He waved back and continued on his climb. Roland muttered under his breath about some people not knowing their limit. I understood what he was trying to say as I had been foolhardy at times before this too.\n\nWe pushed on but I felt a bit uneasy about the lone climber. Then, we heard a rumble, a thundering cacophony of the sound of rocks, earth and trees. I looked back and the scene that greeted my eyes stopped me in my tracks. We were just a few meters from the peak and I did not want us to lose that advantage. Even if I was willing to stop, I had to think of Roland. We had to reach the end as a pair or we would be disqualified. As I hesitated, Roland urged me to move on. In that second, we heard a voice calling for help. Should we or shouldn't we? Roland also hesitated. I could see questions and doubts in his eyes. The picture of victory played in front of us. But, conscience overcame us and both of us, as one, turned back. We could not leave a fellow man knowing he was hurt and that we might be the only people who could help him.\n\nWhen we reached the spot, we saw the man was badly hurt. His ankle was turning blue-black and his hands were bleeding from a nasty gash. His forehead had a nasty cut and he was almost unconscious. Together Roland and I pulled him clear from the rock fall and as he could not walk on his own, Roland being the bigger of us two, said that he would carry the man. We made our way downhill slowly to the finishing point. The crowd cheered us as we touch the finishing line. We were still the first pair in, in spite of our delay! Roland and I exchanged grins and I told myself 'I'm glad we did not turn our back on a fellow man. One day he might do the same for us.'"

        "content": "Dishonesty is the act of deceit or fraud with the intention of cheating another person. This habit of dishonesty seems to be part and parcel of certain people. It is natural for us to expect blatant dishonesty in, for example, gamblers, illegal hawkers and unlicensed taxi drivers or even taxi drivers with licenses to be dishonest all for a few dollars. Expecting certain people to be dishonest is helpful in that we can avoid dealing with them. If we have to deal with them, we are more vigilant. One can never be too careful.\nRead your e-mail or the newspaper and inevitably there are reports of cases of dishonesty. These are not reports of the dishonesty of petty traders or hawkers. These are reports of dishonesty of professionals, people in positions where one expects them to be honest turn out to be dishonest. Throughout the history of man, we have read of cases of heads of governments, financial institutions, big conglomerates who have shown themselves to be dishonest. They misuse their positions of authority and the trust placed in them. So, dishonesty is present in all levels of society.\n\nWhat about the younger generation? They are not immune to acts of dishonesty in moments of desperation. The student who wants to excel and who is not prepared to work for it may be dishonest during examinations. A young man or woman may be dishonest to the other person in their relationship. Within a family, dishonesty can also take place. This is covered up with the excuse of 'I did not want to hurt you so I told a white lie'. The white lie is a camouflage for dishonesty.\n\nAnother type of dishonesty are the scams or con jobs that promise thousands of dollars and expensive gifts. Interested parties are invited to invest in these dubious schemes for lucrative returns. They naively believe they will end up millionaires or multi-millionaires. Sad to say, many have ended up hundreds of thousands of dollars poorer. Why do these people fall into the traps of such scams? The answer here is greed - pure and simple.\n\nSometimes, one can be cheated by dishonesty not through greed but carelessness, sheer laziness or the penny wise and pound foolish habit. Helen and I had a brush with blatant dishonesty when we were looking for a house to rent. Thinking that we should save on agents' fees, we put out an advertisement about looking for a house to rent. Within two days, a call came asking us to go to a certain address. The person claimed to be the owner of the house and was willing to rent it out to ladies only. Happily we agreed and went to the house. A lady in her mid-thirties greeted us and showed us round the house. She was pleasant and generous enough to let us have the house fully furnished. All we had to do was to come in with our suitcases. This suited us fine as we did not want to trouble ourselves with furniture hunting. The offer was a godsend or so we thought.\n\nIt did not occur to us to inquire about where she would be staying if we take over her house. The rent she quoted was reasonable and so we paid her three months' rental in advance and collected the keys immediately. Congratulating ourselves on our good fortune, we celebrated with a pricey dinner. Next morning, we shifted to our new place and settled in. Two days later, someone opened the front door with\na key and brought in some luggage. He demanded to know what we were doing there. Apparently, he was the owner and had not put up his house for rent. We had been cheated by this sweet pleasant lady! We lodged a police report and subsequently the lady was detained.\n\nDishonesty may be pervasive but fortunately as the saying goes, what goes around comes around and the majority of cases of dishonesty are always uncovered. You can hoodwink a few people but not the majority."

        "content": "What we define as beautiful depends on who sees it - the young or the old, through the Asian or Western eyes or the beauty gurus.\nLet me give an illustration. The Kayans are a tribe living near Thailand and Myanmar. The women wear brass neck rings. The longer the neck rings, the more beautiful they are regarded. On the other hand, the Asian world regards fair porcelain skin as the ultimate definition of beauty. We are also influenced by the Hollywood idea of beauty. Look at Angelina Jolie, Jessica Alba or Salma Hayek. All have fantastic skin, long silky hair and huge sparkling eyes. This can also be used to describe Aishwarya Rai, the reigning Bollywood queen. This glazed blue-green-eyed beauty was once a Miss World.\n\nAnother criterion is she must be slim. An example is Keira Knightley. This beauty has become very slim. The idea of a beautiful person as slim is especially so in the world of fashion. Many models are slim to the point of being skinny. However, they have eating disorders. As a result, some countries have tried to put a stop to this. In 2006, Spain was the first country to ban models below a certain weight from Madrid's Fashion Week. Italy has recently decided to keep models who are sickly thin off the catwalk.\n\nThis is done not just for the health of the models. Teenagers and young adults look to the models not just for fashion advice, but rather as the rules as to what fashion is. These young adults notice how all of the models are skinny and therefore try to follow them. They think that to be accepted and regarded as looking good, they too must be skinny. This may inadvertently cause health problems for young women and men around the world as they attempt to follow in the models' footsteps. This leads to poor diet, poor self-esteem and poor health.\n\nBeauty is also related to youth or looking young. This has given rise to aesthetic therapy. All kinds of beauty treatments and miracle creams are in the market. Recently New Yorkers looking for a quick beauty fix risk death from unlicenced practitioners offering oil injections.\n\nWe have forgotten what Confucius said 'Everything has its beauty, but not everyone sees it. A good example is the anecdote of clay balls. A man found many clay balls in a cave. He just threw them into the sea. Eventually, he found out that there was a precious stone inside the hardened clay ball, but had thrown away many. Inner beauty is something that we seem to forget - because we do not see it.\n\nThe recent singing sensation who was dismissed by the audience and the judges before she could open her mouth is one such case. Susan Boyle is frumpy-looking, has bushy eyebrows and frizzy hair. In short she is 'ugly' compared to the other young and beautiful participants. However, she has a beautiful and fabulous voice. When she sang, she was given a standing ovation by the audience and the judges.\n\nOf course, looks should have absolutely nothing to do with talent. But people's perception is such. We have placed so much importance on looks than character or qualities of compassion and kindness that are so important in our daily lives. One of the most beautiful persons in the world is Mother Teresa. She spent her life in the slums of India to take care of the sick and dying. There are many like her, going around helping the destitute and sick and needy their quiet little ways.\n\nIn short, we should open our eyes to the inner beauty of a person, and remember the story of the clay balls."

I was hooked.\n\nI was six years old when my father gave me my first stamp. Now I have three albums. Most of my stamps were given by my parents and relatives. I also exchanged some with my friends. I am especially proud of my album on Malaysian wildlife. I remember waiting eagerly for the postman to come, hoping to get a new stamp - one that was not in my collection.\n\nThe artwork had drawn me to collecting stamps when I was six years old. Then I started to look out for important personalities. I have stamps of our first prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, Queen Elizabeth, my favorite actors and actresses. I collect stamps from all around the world. Whenever an important event is going to take place, I will rush to buy the first day covers. My most prized possession is the stamp commemorating our country's independence. Stamp collecting is a wonderful hobby. I can learn about the history, socio-economics and important personalities of a country.\n\nI would not consider myself a philatelist; merely an avid collector of stamps. When I am feeling down, a quick flip through the pages of my album will cheer me up. The stamps have sparked my interest in my other hobby, postcard collecting. Many of my friends sent postcards to me. I found the postcards as fascinating as the stamps.\n\nMy first postcard was one of the funicular train in Penang Hill. My brother had gone on a school trip to Penang and had written home to tell us about his trip. From then on, I would coax or badger anyone who is traveling to get me a postcard.\n\nI have been lucky. Many of my cousins travel widely. I have postcards of the seven wonders of the world. They are now vintage postcards. Like the stamps, these postcards are windows to the past. I have a postcard of a rural scene of Malacca - a farmer and a bullock pulling a plough. Another is of a tin mine in Perak. They are all part of a vanishing landscape. Such postcards give an insight to what was life then. I once went to a postcard and stamp exhibition. There was a collection of postcards by German photographer A. Kaulfuss who was based in Penang in 1900. It was a time of horse-drawn carriages and bullock carts and ladies holding parasols. I would not have guessed it - if not for the postcards.\n\nWhat is required of a good collector is some creativity and an orderly system. My hobbies have definitely made me neat and systematic. I learnt the hard way as many of my stamps were torn because I was too impatient and careless.\n\nMy hobbies have given me much pleasure. Nowadays my family and friends do not ask me what I would like when they are traveling. They know the answer - 'Get me a postcard, please. And get it stamped, if you can."

        "content": "I was watching the crowd going 'Ho ho ha ha' in a laughter yoga activity rather sceptically. I was not in the mood to laugh, especially with a crowd of strangers. But soon I was joining them in doing the one-metre laughter and the lion laughter, and from mere grimacing, I was genuinely laughing. At the end of the 30-minute session, I was perspiring. Best of all I felt good.\n\nOne of the earliest proponents of therapeutic laughter is Dr. William Fry, a psychiatrist. One of his studies confirmed that 20 seconds of intense laughter, even if faked, can double the heart rate for three to five minutes. Dr. Fry proved that mirthful laughter provides good physical exercise and can reduce our chances of respiratory infections.\nIn addition, he showed that laughter causes our body to produce endorphins that are natural pain killers.\n\nMy favorite spokesperson for laughter as the best medicine is Dr. Hunter `Patch' Adams. I saw the film on 'Patch' acted by Robin Williams and became a fan of him. Do you know he goes around as a clown to hospitals to make patients laugh? He thinks that the role of a clown and a physician is the same. Patch believes that laughter is the best cure. In his opinion, every doctor should be a heart specialist - a merry heart, that is. 'Patch' has inspired millions of people by bringing fun and laughter into the hospital world. He has been a physician for nearly 30 years, but he has been a clown for almost 40.\n\nAnother doctor who strongly advocates laughter as a therapy is Dr. Madan Kataria. Together with his wife, he developed a range of laughter exercises that incorporate elements from yogic breathing. These deep breathing exercises increase oxygen to our cells. As a result, we flush stale air from our lungs. Dr. Kataria also discovered that we could start with fake laughter but genuine laughter soon follows. He calls this very unique exercise routine, Laughter Yoga.\n\nDr. Kataria includes childlike playfulness in his exercises. I could not believe my eyes when the 'Ah Sohs' and makciks and pakciks hopped like kangaroos and did the penguin walk. There are many clubs in different residential estates in Johor Bahru that start the morning with Ho Ho Ha Ha Ha! I am one such member of the Leisure Mall Laughter Club. It is fun and I feel energized.\n\nPsychologists and therapists are convinced of the healing power of laughter. To quote Mark Twain, 'He who laughs lasts.'"

        "content": "Mercy killing is an issue that touches on social, legal, religious and health matters. Mercy killing takes place when a person is terminally ill and has no chance of recovery. This patient's life is then terminated by a predetermined way where a doctor or relative or an authority gives medicines to end his life.\nReligion forbids the taking of another person's life. So does the law. Our conscience too will tell us not to kill another person but we must consider the circumstances in this matter. If a loved one is very ill and is suffering, this affects the whole family. It will be hard to see him in pain all the time. Furthermore, he may never recover from this illness. His illness will drain the family emotionally and financially. His life will be miserable and he may wish for death himself. So would mercy killing help to end his misery?\n\nVery old people who are in such painful situations may actually prefer death to a life that has taken away their dignity. They will know that there can be no recovery for them. What about severely disabled persons who suffer pain and loss of dignity on a daily basis? We do know of cases where these people have begged for death! It is sad to see the plight of these people and there can be very little done to make their lives better. Of course one must remember that there are many disabled people who can live a fairly decent life. One must not think that mercy killing is a necessary measure or an answer for all health problems.\n\nIn addition, research and medical progress will come to a standstill if mercy killing is carried out without much thought. Doctors and scientists must work to find cures and man's life must be thought of as sacred always. As long as there is life, there is hope and some people may actually benefit from a miraculous cure. A patient in pain cannot be put to sleep instantly or ultimately. That will defeat our purpose in life. Mercy killing can only be considered as a last resort for some patients under special circumstances.\n\nIrresponsible doctors and greedy relatives may start to cause the deaths of rich people on the basis that they are acting mercifully. That will be murder! So to say that we must have mercy killing on a general basis is very tricky indeed as there may be abuse of the system. There are many factors to be considered and weighed before decisions can be made.\n\nThere are countries which have legalised mercy killing but many countries are cautious as it may lead to abuse. This is an area of life which needs more thinking and rational decisions."

        "content": "I was born in 1964 to a lower middle class family on the island of Pangkor. My parents were fisher folk and we had a trawler that we used to eke out a living in the Straits of Malacca. I had four older siblings, all girls-my parents tried for children until they had a boy. I was to take over the family business when I came of age.\nMy life was no luxurious but adequate. I had a chance to go to school at the small Tamil school on the island. the island was predominantly Chinese, most of whom were well off. Days were spent either helping dad land his catch or indulging in idle play with my friends, exploring the island.\n\nFortunately for me, the Headmaster at the school, Encik Dollah, was a visionary. He worked tirelessly with the small group of dedicated teachers to inculcate the love for learning among the island children. There was a small library at the clan association on the island that supplemented my voracious appetite for reading. Meanwhile, my dad worked hard to put food on the table. When I went to secondary school I found that my love for Maths and Science paid off. I was the top student in the school and my sisters had also excelled in their studies.\n\nOne of my sisters had opted to become a teacher while two went on to study Maths at a local university. The youngest decided to get married to a local businessman and settle down. She ran her own successful hair salon after a stint in Lumut as an apprentice at a salon. I was the last to finish school and managed to score straight As in the SPM.\n\nI had to go to Ipoh to study for my A levels at a college. A kind aunt took me in. My dad was already struggling to meet his obligations to my sisters. I decided to work part-time to supplement my expenses and managed to get a place in the National University of Singapore to study marine engineering. Soon I found myself as a graduate looking for a job. I landed a prestigious position and am currently pursuing a Master's degree. Mum and dad lead a much more comfortable life and my sisters are all happily married. Thinking on my past, this made me realise how wonderful my life is."

I hoped they would have a great time.\nI was also happy for another reason. I was hoping to ask a couple of my friends to go for a holiday and it seemed an ideal time to do so. After all, my parents would not know about this at all. I planned with Razali and Shan about the many things we would do for those five days. We thought going to Port Dickson would be wonderful.\n\nThus, we planned for our holiday and roped in a couple more friends as well. Kim Seng and Jerry were more than happy to join us. I had just passed my driving test and was very keen to test my driving skills and of course show off to my friends in my father's new Volvo. Life was good.\n\nOn the day my parents left for China, my friends came over in the evening. We packed our stuff into the car and left for the beach hotel that we had booked. The drive down was pretty smooth and my friends were quite impressed by my driving. I kept to a good speed and tried to remember all the rules I had to follow on the road. We were at the hotel by late evening.\n\nWe had dinner and slept. The next day we went swimming and played games on the beach. We made friends with many other young people and had a great time. I had brought my father's credit card and used it to pay bills. My father's signature was easy to imitate and I didn't think my father would mind much.\n\nOn the day we left, the bill had accumulated and was huge. I was a little nervous but chose to ignore the feelings of guilt. We left Port Dickson after lunch and drove back late in the evening. The weather was\nstormy and as I took a corner, the car skidded and struck a tree. We were in total shock but no one was hurt. The car was wrecked.\n\nWe had to leave the car to be towed back and returned home feeling miserable. Imagine our shock when we reached home. The house had been broken into! Everything valuable had been taken. I sat down and cried. How will I explain everything to my dad?"

There were 30 of us from various faculties from the University. It was our first trip to Sabah, and for me, the first trip on an airplane.We were herded into a college mini bus and shown the attractions of Kota Kinabalu as soon as we arrived. We had a slow drive along undulating country roads as we headed for Ranau. Ranau was a picturesque mountainside town where people grew vegetables and fruit. At almost 5000 feet above sea level, the air was pleasantly cool.\n\nWe were assigned guides and had to dump our stuff at the park hostels before our climb. We were all excited and fearful of what lay ahead as many of us as fit as they would like to be. The next morning, we were awakened by our lecturers and sent off to a breakfast of eggs and instant noodles. By 6.30 a.m., we were on a trail that suddenly climbed vertically into the jungle. The going was slow as we clambered up the narrow steep paths into the slopes of Kinabalu.\n\nAlthough it was tough, it wasn't as bad as I had imagined. It felt very much like the trails running up Penang hill from Moon Gate. So I was in front of the group most of the way. There were many exotic plants that were in bloom and curious monkeys that made the trip exciting for some. Some were just too out of shape and exhausted to really enjoy the scenery.\n\nAs I climbed the steep terrain, I volunteered to help two girls who have obviously never heard of exercise. I helped the girls up the mountain. We had to take several breaks at regular intervals. Our guides were rather amused. Then finally we reached the hut at Panar Laban. The trees of the tropical forests were replaced by coniferous trees. It was cloud country at 11500 feet. The temperatures dropped to 10 degrees and there were waterfalls everywhere. So this is where rivers are born! The night we spent at the hut was miserable but memorable as the temperature dropped to minus 1. We tried to sleep as we had to continue the climb at 2.45 a.m. the next morning. We grabbed our torches and groped our way up rocks and crevasses in the dark, with only the reassuring voices of guides and the nylon ropes. All of us soldiered on. As the hours passed, we watched the night grow brighter and as we reached the summit, dawn broke over the horizon like a scene from a National Geographic Special. I was above the clouds at 13000 or more feet and my outdated camera froze due to the extreme cold so I had to rely on Rajesh, my enthusiastic friend, to take a snap of my frozen face. This is a day I will always remember, the day I conquered Kinabalu."

Is it fact, or just plain nostalgia tempered with a little amnesia ?\nIn those days, I had to go to a phone booth to make a call. It was cheap to make a local call and a little more expensive to make a long distance call. It\nwas inconvenient but saved us a ton of money as we didn't make many calls. With the advent of home telephones and mobile phones, it is so easy to make a call and we spend a lot of money every month for this 'necessity'.\n\nThe way we eat and treat food has also changed. Now, we can have meat whenever we want, however we want it, but back then meat was reserved for special occasions or for family gatherings. Nowadays, we have Japanese or Korean cuisine at expensive restaurants. We work longer and harder to earn that money to maintain our luxuries.\n\nWeddings are different too. There is the modern wedding where wedding planners take care of everything, and we curse the traffic and the traveling we have to endure to make it in time to the opulent dinner at some city hotel. Our clothes cost a bomb, and we buy expensive gifts. In the old days, weddings were a three day affair where all family members chipped in, had fun decorating and borrowed each other's clothes or even jewelry. Cousins played at the river banks and snapshots were full of spontaneity and real laughter. No one cared how much your gift cost, and arduous trips were made happier by legions of family members traveling together by train or bus.\n\nThen, there was the old ways in school - the teacher disciplined you and when you went home, the news would have reached your parents. Parents disciplined you as well for making trouble in school. Today, the teacher is disciplined by the overprotective parent and children call the teacher names to his or her face, threatening a lawsuit if the teacher so much as bares his or her teeth. Ten A's meant moral as well as spiritual superiority in the old days, not the reward of rich children with a bottomless tuition budget.\n\nThe old ways may seem outdated but it cannot be denied that the old ways are better in some ways."

It was called St Xavier's, after the saint.\nIt was an imposing school that had been reborn after the allied bombing of Penang during the Japanese occupation. My father had attended this school, and so I was proud to keep the tradition going. There was a huge hall with curtains that seemed to be a hundred feet high and there was a balcony within the hall-I was reminded of opera houses. There were dressing rooms behind the stage and trapdoors beneath it. Large, colored-pane doors opened up on either side giving the place a bright and sunny atmosphere during the day. The doors kept out the rain during the monsoon seasons. It was where I took my final exams. There was a chapel where Catholic children went to pray but I was never asked to convert or coerced into thinking that my faith was inferior to theirs.\n\nThere were five blocks of classrooms, three storeys high. The canteen was at the back next to a huge yard, where I played with my friends when I was younger. Ten years later, it was where my friends and I had serious discussions about physics and girls. The basketball courts were on the far right near the brothers' quarters. They were the white robed pillars of the school, fine examples of selfless men who were knowledgeable and exemplary. We never went anywhere near their quarters as it was forbidden.\n\nThen, there were the workshops hidden behind the canteen where we learnt the industrial arts as it was known at that time. The Science laboratories overlooked the yard just below the library where we spent thousands of hours reading tales of faraway cities and people, did our homework or tried to impress a sixth form girl-the only girls there were in the sixth form - as St Xavier's was a boys' school. The girls were usually transfer students from the Convent school across St Xavier's, since that school did not offer a sixth form.\n\nDue to the lack of space, the school field was across the road adjacent to the Convent. We enjoyed playing sports there or marching with the school band as we had an audience of girls in braids watching from the balconies of their school next door. There was very little interaction between sexes those days except for the odd debate or carnival. This made the boys do silly things in the field to catch the girls' attention - these made for excellent and entertaining stories for years to come.\n\nHowever, above all, the most important feature about my school was the culture imbued in us by the teachers, brothers and staff. We loved our school more than anything in the world. The traditions and the culture of hard work, honesty, humility and selflessness will live on in every boy (and girl) who passed through its hallowed halls."

After much persuasion, I gave in. There was a Will Smith movie on and I was a fan.\nSo we set off to the movies together, bought our tickets, popcorn and drinks and settled down comfortably. As we were early, the lights were still on. We watched people come in groups, families and there were couples too. Some of them looked like school students playing truant like us. As I turned around, I caught a glimpse of my uncle Andy and aunt Jane walking in. I sank into my seat quickly to avoid being spotted. I signaled to Raine that there was someone I didn't want to see and Raine being Raine made it more obvious by turning around and asking 'Who? And where?' loudly. It made me sit even lower in my seat.\n\nTo make things worse, they came and sat in the row behind us and were saying to each other how I would have loved to come to this movie as I adored Will Smith. They were even commenting about the students playing truant. Soon the movie began and I was glad when the lights were turned off but I didn't enjoy the movie at all for fear of being spotted. So, I sat there like an astronaut, peering over the front seat. Every now and then I would sneak a peek at my aunt and uncle. I was sure they were looking at me. Anyway, there was another hurdle. I had to leave the cinema without being spotted. So when the movie ended and the lights came on, I sat there waiting for everyone to leave but my uncle and aunt just sat there talking. Then, after a little while they got up and walked to the doors.\n\nAs soon as the coast was clear, I made a dash for the door and tried to make a quick exit via the stairs. To my horror, my uncle and aunt were standing there smiling. I tried to say something but all that came out were sounds that meant nothing. I stuttered and spluttered so much! My uncle merely said, 'I hope you have learnt your lesson. We saw you as soon as we came in and I am sure your father will be very disappointed in you. We hope you won't do it again.'\n\nAfter giving me a piece of their minds, they sent us to school. This was the most embarrassing moment in my life."

As we advance in technology, we also have new solutions to age-old problems such as pollution, transport, medicine and treatment, food production, war, poverty and energy production.\nThe first worry is pollution of land, sea and air. The future may seem bleak as the greed and ignorance of industrialists join forces with evil developers, heartless loggers and hungry farmers. Nevertheless, as we speak scientists and NGOs are battling the frontiers of science and technology pushing innovation for better manufacturing processes and enacting new laws along the way by appealing to the ambitions of a new generation of technocrats, who seem better educated and informed.\n\nHybrid electric, fuel cell and solar vehicles are leading the way in transport innovation and alternatives. Traffic congestion and accident rates are forcing governments to improve mass transit systems. Trains and sea taxis are even being introduced on islands as land grows scarce. Singapore is a fine example of things to come. They are a model of good governance and environmental practice trying to balance development with sustainable ecosystems. Advancements in science might even lead to reforestation happening faster than deforestation.\n\nThe diseases that plague the young and old alike might be reduced, if not eradicated, with new medical procedures like non-invasive surgery, new drugs and the infinite possibilities of cloning technology. Heart and organ transplants may be commonplace, making life so much better. Cancer and deadly pandemics might become a thing of the past as science explores the universe and beyond. We don't know what lies beyond our solar system and what sophisticated space travel would bring. The possibilities are mind-boggling.\n\nIn time, man will realise the need to unite and eradicate hunger, famine and unequal food distribution. Fabulous new technologies in food production are being discovered every day and more and more people are becoming aware of the need to prosper together. People will cross religious and racial barriers to find unifying ideas as is being done by the Pure Life Society in Jalan Klang Lama, Kuala Lumpur. Wars will soon be on poverty and illiteracy.\n\nAs mentioned by doomsday predictor Nostradamus, war will be averted and peace will reign if man redeems himself. There is hope yet in the good of mankind as we see more efforts towards nuclear disarmament, the green movement and proactive honest world leaders."

The train ride was slow and boring and I was glad to get off at the station.\n\nMy cousin, Ramesh, was there to pick me up in my uncle's Mazda. As we turned up the driveway, memories of childhood play and many weddings came rushing down memory lane. As we reached the porch, it was almost like those Tamil movies where the city slicker arrives to the doting eyes of the country relatives. Grandma was first in a long list of forehead kissers who gushed at my appearance. Lunch followed by an afternoon of gossip and catching up ran into tea and vadais and curry puffs (homemade of course). That evening was spent touring the small town and dinner was a lavish affair. Aunt Rani dished out the best crab curry in the world. We sat in the large verandah that night, with grandma tying my hair in braids playfully and listening to some old Tamil songs.\n\nWe slept late that night as secrets were shared and ghost stories told. As I drifted off to sleep later, my dreams were all about crab curries. The next morning, I decided to go for a jog before breakfast and left early without telling the sleeping brood. I worked up a sweat not realising that there was a motorcycle coming fast round the bend with no lights. The rider was off to the rubber plantations and didn't think of running into a city girl in tights and Linkin Park T-shirt. I went flying into the bushes as I heard a crack. I woke up in the hospital with a fractured leg and bruises. The doctor said that I would have to be transferred to Ipoh General Hospital as they didn't have the parts. Parts? It seems that I would need a metal plate and four screws. I spent the next two weeks trussed up in orthopaedics. The pain and the immobility made this the worst holiday ever."

There are a variety of fruits in many shapes and colors.\nThere are local fruits and imported ones. The imported variety are apples, oranges, pears and grapes. Some of these fruits have been cultivated locally but without much success. Only strawberries seem to have been commercially successful in the Cameron Highlands. Most of these fruits are imported from China, Australia, America and Europe. They are found in almost every supermarket and convenience store. They also come in various forms such as juices, preserves, jams and flavors for ice cream.\n\nLocal fruits are equally delicious and nutritious. The rambutan, durian, mangosteen, banana, papaya and mango are just as popular. The only difference is that some of them are seasonal. However, this has been solved by our neighbor, Thailand. They have managed to genetically engineer strains of durian and now we are able to find the fruit in stores all year round.\n\nSome ingenious food technologist has even made a health supplement from mangosteen skin and another has made papaya soap. Avocado creams and coconut shampoos are quite common. So fruit not only has nutritional value, but it also has medicinal use.\n\nFruits also make excellent gifts. Many people send fruit baskets instead of flowers. Fruit farming has become a great career and a lucrative one too. Much of our fruit is exported overseas at lucrative prices. Fruit sellers are doing roaring business in urban areas. Desserts, biscuits and sweets in fruity flavors are big business. Yoghurts with added fruit are very popular.\n\nThus, fruits are not only a good source of nutrition, growing them can also make you rich. So we must encourage our local orchard industry and reduce our dependence on fruit imports by encouraging more young people to take up this form of agriculture as the market grows and demand remains strong. There is a lot of land lying idle that can be cultivated. Another advantage is our tropical weather and excellent research facilities backed by the government. So let's grow more fruit."

Our journey took us along the North-South Highway to Bukit Beruntung where we exited the toll booth and headed past Serendah till we arrived at Kuala Kubu for breakfast. It was a quaint little town that had many colonial buildings and an undulating landscape.\n\nFurther along the way, we passed a huge dam and stopped at the lakeside to take pictures. Along its banks were orang asli villages that dotted the hillsides. The journey up the hills was scenic and lush with tropical rainforest.\n\nFinally, we reached the Gap where we were allowed to go up to Fraser's according to an hourly timetable. Odd and even hours were designated for ascent and descent as the final few kilometers of road were too narrow for two-way traffic. When we reached the town centre, a quaint clock tower, rustic police station and cute golf course greeted us. We stopped for lunch at a stall serving Chinese food. Then, we got directions to the government bungalow from the locals. It was a 15-minute ride to the clean spacious bungalow that was equipped with kitchen facilities, dining hall and TV The carpets and the lounge set were spanking new. The garden had a playground and barbeque area.\n\nIt was eating, sleeping, playing cards or Monopoly all day 'as it was raining. The mist enveloped the bungalow giving it a foreign atmosphere. We looked cool in our jackets as we walked along the road for dinner at some stalls near the mosque in town that night. It was a spooky half-hour back and we were excited using our powerful torches. The next day was spent at the waterfalls 15 kilometers away and jungle trekking near the town. We had lunch at a Hainanese restaurant before checking out at 1 p.m. The staff was very courteous and friendly.\n\nWe bid them and the cool natural surroundings goodbye as we made our way back to the polluted city."

I feel neither is better as each has its advantages and disadvantages.\nThe cooler climates of the northern and southern hemispheres have their appeal in that they make picturesque postcard material. There is the snow and the winter landscapes that gives the white Christmassy feel to the environment that many would say is ethereal.\n\nThen, there are the golden hues of the forests and the falling leaves of autumn that give the feeling of beauty and awe. Summer is always the time to head to the beach and spring heralds the blooming flowers and planting of crops, a renewal of sorts. In short, the crux is variety. It gives different plants and animals to show off their plumage and man to show off various fashion trends.\n\nThe tropics is one long summer with wet rains intermittently. There is one fashion statement-light, comfortable and colorful. There is little room for heavier clothing unless it's a hill station or in the deserts where the temperature falls tremendously at night. Raincoats and umbrellas are essential in the tropics more than trench coats and sweaters. You have the freedom of going out and staying out for as long as you like.\n\nYou can go to the beach any time of the year or just take in a movie without changing your tyres or clothes. A fan or an air conditioner is enough to survive the heat.\n\nHowever, if you talk to a Londoner or a Russian living in the cold climates of the north they might lament on the high cost of winter heating, clothing and the troublesome fitting of snow tyres. The rich will jet off to a warmer climate but the poor suffer from the problems of sludge, mud and snow-ins. Going out is a struggle as the roads are slippery and the winds icy. You need special shoes and heavy bulky clothing. The consolation is skating and snowboarding but if the weather gets below minus, even those activities are impossible.\n\nThe conclusion is both have its advantages and disadvantages but it's the individual that decides which is better. The cold is not for everyone and I personally don't like the heat but the cost and the considerations of adapting to an environment help the decision-making process."

        "content": "Cars, houses, a college education, holidays and medical bills all have something in common. They cost money. As time goes on, we need lots of it as inflation and greed have forced the prices of services and goods upwards.\nIt is not enough to have money, it is also important to save some of it. There are always unexpected expenses like wedding gifts, funerals and birthdays. Even if we give a token, we need to save in order to pay for gifts or donations.\n\nThe next most important reason we need to save is for medical expenses. This is sometimes covered by medical cards and employers but we always need some spare cash for the things they don't cover or to pay the premiums. Savings also help pay for the quality of the medical services we need.\n\nThere are also other benefits of savings which are pleasurable. We could save to make the trip of a lifetime to a place we want to visit. Savings could help realise the world tour we dreamed of as a kid. Saving money enables us to make timely investments when the opportunity knocks. We will not be able to grab that condo, share issue or car on offer if we do not have spare cash.\n\nSaving money helps us pay for our dream home without paying too much interest to the bank. We could save from a young age and be surprised to see how much we have at the end. We need to save to be able to afford a college education for ourselves and our future generations. It helps us to get a better job.\n\nFinally, the habit of saving creates a sense of emotional and mental security that is essential in today's world. We need that assurance that we are safe financially to enable us to lead a normal life. Many people today suffer from tremendous stress if they have financial insecurity. It is one of the causes of marital problems and can cause a rift between siblings and extended family when you are unable to meet your financial obligations.\n\nThus, the habit of saving money is essential to live a happy life."

        "content": "Life in Malaysia is so good that the ancients called it Suvarnabhumi literally meaning Land of Gold. This is my story in this blessed land.\nMy name is Lim Boon Hwa and I am a billionaire. My parents came on a boat from China sometime in the early 1900's when there was a tin boom in Perak, a state in Malaya (the old name for modern Malaysia). They came to a strange tropical paradise run by the colonial British from India. They wanted the lucrative spice trade that all Europeans craved and fought for. My father was a farmer and he knew nothing about trade. My mother was an illustrious woman who was quick to take in orders as a seamstress and hawker. She made the most delicious dumplings on earth. With her small enterprise, she managed to supplement the earnings from my dad's little farm in the sleepy seaside hollow of Tanjung Tokong on the island of Penang.\n\nSoon, the farm and business grew and so did our family. There were three of us, all boys. I was the eldest. Although we lived simply, our parents made sure we were well fed and educated. We invited relatives from the motherland to work for us in the new land that father and mother had bought in Balik Pulau and Air Itam. We had ventured into fruit orchards as well. The durians, mangosteens and the blessed nutmeg allowed us to attend the best schools. We even had a car and a house close to Chusan Hotel. It was soon to become 'Millionaires' Row'.\n\nI had attended the Malayan University in Singapore and my brothers too had become accountants. Soon, we returned to Penang and expanded the family fortunes by trading in all and sundry. Our parents found us dutiful wives who in turn bore us beautiful children. We all lived in a beautiful bungalow with three storeys and a sprawling compound that had all the trappings of an English manor. Our aged parents spent their time with the grandchildren while tending to their beloved orchards in Balik Pulau. Penang had since become one of the busiest ports in the world.\n\nOur company had grown into a conglomerate that dealt with not only fresh fruit, vegetables and spices but shipping, cars, property and hotels. As we remain united and humble in our lives we can't help but sigh'...Aaah! What a nice life it has been.'"

        "content": "Happiness is the most sought-after emotion. It is the reason for the existence of all beings. Happiness is not confined to the human world alone. Animals and even plants seem to display happiness.\nA young child is happy when it is well fed and becomes sad when it is hungry. Even adults succumb to the pleasures of food and associate this with happiness. A bar of chocolate, an ice cream treat or a sumptuous spread at a buffet all bring happiness.\n\nPeople are happiest when they are having a meal and some drink. Plants that are watered and are given enough nutrients will grow happily.\n\nClothing and accessories too bring happiness. Toys and gadgets, presents and red packets bring untoward joy. Even a pet cat or dog will show its happiness at being given a toy or plaything. A ball of wool or a plastic bone is all it takes.\n\nThen, there is the house and the car, holidays abroad, a simple picnic or even a movie that evokes happiness. Happiness is found in obtaining material things or indulging in recreational activities. However, many are still not happy with all these trappings of luxury. Why? Well, it all boils down to the individual. Money can buy happiness to a certain extent but when all is achieved, obtained and bought, there comes a time for the true sense of happiness.\n\nMany have sought it in ashrams and from wise men, but all it takes is an act of kindness and sharing. True happiness is eventually not in the receiving, possessing and getting but in the giving. Giving time, things, labour to those around us, loved ones or strangers is the true happiness that lives on in our lives. Making others happy is the core of being happy. It doesn't have to be grand or expensive but has to be sincere and thoughtful. As Mark Twain once said, 'The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer somebody else up'. So, go out there and cheer someone up!"

You mentioned that you were nervous about speaking in public. Tell me about it -- I was so nervous the first time when I had to speak in public that I froze! I couldn't speak! Now I am more confident and I think you will do even better than me.\n\nOnce you overcome your fears, you will realize that public speaking allows you to have a chance to share your ideas with others. You may have great ideas but you will need to share them with others. So learning how to speak in public is a great help. Remember, one day you may have to speak up in the office, in a society meeting or in community gatherings. So it is a great help to be able to speak confidently. In fact, it will help you to network better in life.\n\nPeople will see your abilities and trust you to do your duties efficiently if they hear you speak well. If you fumble and stammer through every time, Tanya, they may wonder a little about your abilities. Public speaking will give you confidence and thus I think you should master this skill and use it to your advantage.\n\nGet over your nervousness by preparing thoroughly. Look at the topic of discussion and gather as much information as possible. Talk to people and do research on the Internet. All this will help you to understand the topic well. Be well informed about the topic. Then, draft your speech.\n\nOnce the draft has been completed, practice reading out your speech. Ask your friends to listen to what you are saying and get their feedback. Make changes if necessary. Practice in front of the mirror if that will help. Look at your posture and the way you hold yourself. The more you practice, the more confident you will be.\n\nRemember, other speakers have also been afraid. Many well-known speakers have said they felt extreme fear but have overcome it by practicing thoroughly beforehand. It is normal to be nervous. So tell yourself that you will get over it, and you will.\n\nMaking mistakes is all right. If you do make some mistakes while on stage, do not panic. If possible, use some humor to get by. People will understand and therefore laugh it off.\n\nHave faith and confidence in yourself. Remember you can do it if you are determined to do it. Dress appropriately. Make sure you have your notes in the right order. Put on a show of confidence and you will feel confident.\n\nTanya, you will make a good debater. Of that I am sure. Go ahead and give your best. You will find that you will actually enjoy that experience. Do tell me about it when it is over.\n\nLots of love,\n\nSania"

We need people around us. We need to remember to appreciate them and enjoy their presence in our lives.\nIt is very important that we always look for the good in people. There are some people who may come across as unreasonable, irrational, and self-centered. Forgive them if they are so. Forget their weaknesses. Be kind to them. Be their friends.\n\nThere are lots of unpleasant stories you will hear or read about. Choose to ignore them. Make sure you find the facts about the stories before you believe them. They may be stories spread by unkind people. Don't listen to everything you are told. Do not spread such stories yourself. It is unfair to people who cannot defend themselves.\n\nLook for occasions to help others as there are always people who need help. Be helpful to your own family first, and then be kind to your relatives and friends. Sometimes you may get the chance to help total strangers, please take it. Helping people means going out of your way, losing sleep or rest and sometimes even giving money. When the need arises, please help. We cannot be calculating our gains in this matter. Our duty must be to help others.\n\nBe always good and sincere in everything you do. You will build good relationships and enjoy the friendship of other good people too. Not everyone we meet will be good but that must not stop us from being good ourselves.\n\nLive a good life always. Have strong moral values and don't be tempted by more money or power. If you work hard honestly, you will be successful and do well in life. Enjoy the privileges that come with success. You deserve them. By setting high standards of good behavior you will be an example to others.\n\nDear friends, do your best always. If all of us try our best to be good human beings, remember the world will be a better place. Don't we want that?\n\nThank you, everyone."

        "content": "The skies were dark. Rain fell in big drops and thunder and lightning flashed across the skies. I shivered with cold and fear as I walked through the streams of muddy water. Some people were rushing by, completely soaked in the heavy rain.\nAlong the way, I saw some schoolchildren clutching their heavy schoolbags and rushing home. I also saw that some road repair work had been abandoned by workers. Obviously the workers had left in a hurry because of the storm. There were few signs and it was hard to see what was on the road. There were pieces of wood and slabs of metal and it looked like a hole had been dug and hastily covered with planks.\n\nI moved on but suddenly stopped as I heard some sounds. It sounded like children crying. I quickly turned back and went back to the place from where the sounds came. I was horrified! To my dismay, I found that two small children had fallen into the gaping hole on the road. The planks had moved away with the force of the rushing water. I could barely see the children as it was dark all around me. I told them that I was going to get help and ran.\n\nI was not sure of what to do or where to go but decided to go to the nearest house for help. I knew the man, Mr Lee, who lived there. I called Mr Lee and told him about the problem. He readily said that he will get a torch and some rope. He also called his good friend Encik Ahmad to come along with him. A few other neighbors also quickly joined the rescue party and together went to the road. They managed to get the children out of the watery hole safely. The children were very scared and they shivered with cold.\n\nThe parents of the children who had just arrived from work were totally shocked to hear of what had happened. They were very grateful to the neighbors who had helped to rescue the children and thanked them profusely. I was very happy that I had been part of this act of neighborliness. It was a wonderful moment, one I will never forget. The neighbors had been great. They had helped people in need without hesitation. I went home with a good feeling."

        "content": "The world has progressed greatly. With technology and industries advancing at such a quick pace, we find that there are many attractive things in the market today. Whether it is in the world of clothes, shoes or electronic gadgets, new things appear daily in the shops. People are taken up with them and want to possess them.\nPeople want to be seen with branded and expensive things as they feel that these things reflect power and wealth. A few people are brave enough to reject these trappings of wealth and still live a simple life of sober values. Most people want to show off their wealth and position. Thus, they are very materialistic.\n\nThese materialistic people must have the right house in the right area and they must be seen driving the prestigious cars. Very often they will live in the affluent areas called 'Millionaires' Road'! They also wish to belong to expensive clubs which will reflect their financial status. Other middle class people will try their best to make more money to join this class of the rich and famous!\n\nPeople are so materialistic that they sometimes reject their poorer friends or poorer members of their own families. It is sad to see old parents rejected by their upcoming children who wish to own second homes and cars and will, therefore, not spare money for the old folks at home. They forget their filial duties in their greed for power and wealth. Have we not heard of children who have quietly rejected their aging parents so that they can pursue their career advancement to obtain more money and power?\n\nIt is only a small group that rejects this materialism and goes for better values. This group lives a low profile life and will lead a simple lifestyle. They will not rush to buy the latest or newest things and live a life without pomp and show. They strongly believe that they must live simply and help others. They strongly believe that less is more. Their happiness is derived from their strong sense of human values and not things.\n\nI personally find that many people are very materialistic today. People must reject this need to show off their material goods. Buying things with money they do not have to impress people whom they do not like is unnecessary. They must be more sincere and have a balanced view of life. They must realize that people really do not need many things to be happy."

I just wanted to idle and relax as much as possible before the next term started.\nThe day started quietly enough. We got up as usual and went about our chores. Just as I finished sweeping the porch, I heard a car draw up to our gate. It was Uncle Suhaimi and his family from Kluang. I was surprised to see them as we did not have any calls earlier to inform us of their visit. My parents were very happy to see them and offered them drinks and some cookies. Mum went to the kitchen to prepare more food while dad quickly went to the sundry shops nearby to get some drinks and fruits.\n\nIt looked like it was going to be a day for relatives to visit us as Aunty Kamsiah and her family came by just before lunch. They had come to attend the graduation of their daughter and decided to drop in to see us. The graduation ceremony was just over and they were going to look for a place for lunch. My mother, of course, insisted that they stay for lunch and not go anywhere else! That was the typical hospitality my parents extended to others.\n\nI was a little taken aback by the sudden influx of visitors but amazed at my parents' warmth and kind hospitality in reaching out to others. The house was noisy with the chatter and laughter of people and there was a general good feeling. I did wonder who were going to stay overnight and if I was going to lose my bed to our visitors.\n\nI thought having so many relatives in one day was enough when my father's two friends from Kota Bharu came by! There was a kind of astonishment on my parents' faces but being the sporting people they were, everyone was made to feel welcome. Amazingly they had brought ketupat, rendang and other Kelantan delicacies knowing that father loved them! There was so much of food and everyone enjoyed eating all the various items. I made a glutton of myself!\n\nSome of the visitors stayed the night and it looked like a slumber party for me as mum brought out some mats and many of us slept on the floor! Everyone left the next day. It had been an amazing day for me with loads of delicious food, good comradeship, love and laughter. I knew nothing would take away that warm memory of good interaction I had seen and enjoyed. I had no idea that the day would end like this!"

My mother will make some simple cookies and hot coffee. My elder brother would make paper boats which we launched into the drains and watched them float a while before they sank. The sound of rain brings back those memories which I cherish dearly.\nWe could hear the sound of insects and frogs. Then, the rain would stop and one could smell the freshness of the air. Rain is good for the plants which look green and luscious in the morning. The flowers will look fresh and beautiful. The soil will be soft and farmers would turn it over to ensure its fertility. New plants will sprout and there is a promise of a good harvest.\n\nRain, unfortunately, does not only come in pleasant forms. Excess rain brings many problems. Thunder and lightning can cause danger and death. Fishermen out at sea are at risk when storms occur. Schoolchildren and working people encounter many problems on the roads. There will be traffic jams and flash floods in the towns and cities which will delay people from reaching home. More accidents are likely to occur. In addition, continuous rain would lead to villages being flooded and people being evacuated to safe shelters. Life will come to a standstill until the rains subside.\n\nIf there is no rain at all, as in some countries which experience hot weather for several weeks and sometimes months, the people face much suffering. Plants and animals die. People also suffer from the ill effects as rivers and water sources dry up. Droughts will lead to food and water shortage. Slow death will prevail unless outside help is rendered.\n\nLife is indeed tough with excess rain or with insufficient rain. The problems that people would go through are numerous. Rain is a blessing when it arrives in moderate doses and a catastrophe when it comes as a typhoon. Modernisation and the products of technology have brought some good to the people but the effects of the forces of nature cannot be dealt with easily. Sudden climatic changes have made life more unpredictable today."

I carried my aunt's basket as we walked into the busy market. It was busy, even though it was so early. I heard some sweet chirping in between the chatter of people buying and bargaining.

The hawkers were friendly and enquired about me. My aunt proudly spoke to them about me. I had to nudge her and tell her that there really was no need to tell so much, but I am afraid that my protests didn't stop my aunt at all.\n\nThere were a lot of interesting vegetables in the market which I was not able to identify. There were even some fruits that I could not recognise. The vendors were very willing to let me taste some of the unfamiliar fruits. I had so much to learn!\n\nThere were stalls selling sarongs and scarves. All the items looked colourful and inviting. I bought a sarong for my father and a scarf for my mother. I was sure that they would like these gifts.\n\nIn the meantime, my aunt had bought chicken, fish and vegetables. I helped her choose the fruits. Near the fruit stalls were several stalls selling delicious cooked food. My aunt and I had pancakes with peanut butter spread. I also bought some prawn fritters to eat at home.\n\nI carried the heavy basket as we walked back to the house. Walking in the open air amidst the friendly atmosphere in the village gave me a sense of peace and belonging. I had actually enjoyed the visit to the village market."

        "content": "The Internet is the 20 century's most incredible invention. There is greater access to information and knowledge, all for free and from the comfort of home. However, with the Internet's great advantages comes the potential for abuse as well.\nChildren are exposed to many good and bad websites. The danger is always there that children may surf websites that deal with pornography or illegal activities such as piracy and hacking. Many children may not be monitored by their parents at all. In fact, parents might not be aware that their children are surfing such websites.\n\nThere have been stories about children being kidnapped for ransom or sale. There have been also numerous stories about children being sexually abused or exploited through people met via chat websites. Naive children are easily misled into harmful situations.\n\nThe question then arises as to when children should be allowed to use the Internet. When are they mature enough to read or watch the various streams of information that come through the Internet? Should they have parental supervision?\n\nI strongly believe that parents must be fully aware of what is going on in the lives of their children. They need guidance and advice. Parents cannot give up their role because they claim to be too busy or tired. They must take the time and trouble to be there for their children.\n\nChildren mature at different ages. Only parents can know when their children are ready to deal with the various elements of the Internet. If they can advise the children and guide them through the early years, the children will be better prepared to make their own decisions as they grow older. Children need supervision and guidance through childhood and adolescence, especially in the modern world.\n\nChildren may resent parents' control strongly if parents interfere a lot when they are older. It is true that parents have to let go more of their control as the children grow older and hopefully wiser. It is unhealthy to keep them under their wings all the time. That will not work at all. However, during their growing years, it is good for parents to have a say in their children's activities."

If parents understand their role from the very beginning, they can play a major role in molding their children in the right manner to a large extent.\nIt has been said that the values and ideas we want to teach the children should be done in the early years. If this teaching-learning period is handled responsibly by parents and guardians, a lot can be achieved. Good habits can be imparted in the early years. Simple courtesies should be taught right from the beginning. Parents must talk politely to their children and expect the same from them. All rude responses must be firmly rejected.\n\nChildren must be taught to be part of the family by giving them simple duties as early as possible. Duties can be as simple as putting toys away when the children are done playing with them. They can be taught to put away their clothes or shoes in the respective places on a daily basis. Children are quick to learn, and good habits formed during this time will stay for a lifetime.\n\nNowadays, affluent families hire maids and children are not expected to do things for themselves in some homes. This can be detrimental if children are allowed to be rude to maids. They may also think that they need not do anything as the maids are there to see to their every whim and fancy. Parents should think carefully and make sure that they are doing the right thing towards nurturing good values in their children. It will be too bad if the parents find that the children have become spoilt and irresponsible just because the parents have failed to teach them the right values.\n\nChildren should be taught to sit down and play quietly or read a book if they can. In creating this habit, parents play a vital role as they too have to sit down and occupy themselves. In this fast world, everyone expects to be entertained. They want things to be exciting and fast moving. If parents themselves do not read or spend time quietly, it is hard to expect the children to do so.\n\nOf course, we must also realise that some children will be different. They will not always follow what parents instruct them to do. They will want to test the limits set and want to be individualistic. Parents may have to allow some leeway so that creativity and inventiveness can be nurtured. While some amount of discipline is good, it must not be allowed to destroy their imaginative nature.\n\nChildren can be taught responsibility by parents from young. It is not an easy task but it can be done."

I came back to myself when a voice said, 'Aren't you planning to get up for today?' A hand reached out and pulled me up. I got up shakily and looked up to see this handsome man in front of me. Oh, my goodness, did I have to fall flat in front of him?\n\nThe handsome young man said that he was Victor and he offered to get me a drink as I still looked rather shaken.

The idea of spending more time on the same topic didn't appeal to me. Furthermore, my friends said that a new tutor was coming in, a man who was known to be very strict and fussy. Who needed a fussy tutor?\n\nI made it on time for my accounts class and sat down in the back row. I usually preferred to sit at the back of classes as I didn't want the teachers to be calling on me to answer questions. Teachers should ask the students who knew the answers and not plague students who didn't!\n\nWhen the tutor entered the class, I had the shock of my life! It was the handsome stranger from two days ago. I was quite stunned. I managed to sit through the class and could not wait to get away. I think my face was red from sheer embarrassment.\n\nThe next day, I encountered the tutor right at the entrance of the class. He teasingly asked me if I was going to fall at his feet again! I told him, 'Not likely!' and went to my usual place in class. The good part of this relationship is that I really paid attention in class and I ended up doing very well in accounts. I actually got a distinction for the subject. Victor and I have become good friends and I am glad that my little misstep has brought me a good friend."

Ever since films began to change with sound, color and technology, we have moved into a fantastic, amazing field of make-believe.\nThe first films didn't have sound and therefore had no speech. Even then the silent films provided much entertainment and delight to the audience. However, with the advent of technology, there has been fantastic progress in the film world. The special effects and the possibilities that have opened up have created a world of fantasy. Whether it is about the distant past or the almost-impossible inventions of the future, the film world can deal with it. Many things that people can only dream about can be brought to life in films.\n\nFilms like Jurassic Park, Titanic or Avatar are examples of technological achievements. We saw amazing things and praise must be heaped on the technicians and engineers who made these films possible. No doubt the genius of the directors and producers must be appreciated for they saw the possibilities and made them real for the audience. The actors and actresses were amazing but we must really appreciate the technical expertise that actually worked it out on the screen for us.\n\nThe television has captured its own market of the film world for it has brought films into our houses. We have entertainment right in our own homes. In this tension-filled world, we need entertainment and relaxation. We need to forget our worries for a little while and get away from our troubles. The television with its films helps us to do just that.\n\nOf course many people will claim that films have many negative effects. There are films with too much violence and death and sex. They have an unhealthy influence on weak and vulnerable minds. They do not allow much thinking in their direct portrayal of action and more action. They are a waste of time and money.\n\nIt is up to the thinking audience to take the good and to ignore the bad. They must appreciate all the wonderful imaginative minds which create a world of fantasy and entertain us with its art, science and technology. It is like stepping into a world of magic and being swept away for a couple of hours. It is an escape that inspires our minds and teases our imagination."

        "content": "Plastic surgery began many years ago as the surgical repair of skin defects and deformities, the removal of skin tumours and surgical reconstruction. Also known as reconstructive surgery, it aims to fix certain areas of the body that have been altered due to trauma, growth, infection, burns, tumours or any other kind of involuntary cause.\n\nThose that seek this type of surgery usually do so in order to restore their body and face to the normal state. For them, they do it not as a purely cosmetic procedure. It is done to remove burnt parts, scars after accidents and birthmarks. This type of surgical procedure can also include broken limbs and skin grafting methods. Examples are reattachment of toes and fingers and the manipulation of knees, limbs and teeth.\nHowever, increasingly, this medical specialty includes other procedures such as fatty-tissue removal, wrinkle reduction and even the permanent application of make-up. The increasing popularity of plastic or cosmetic surgery is attributed to its immense benefits. One of these benefits is the emotional benefit. This is because people are finally able to feel comfortable with their body after the surgery. They find that they are more outgoing, personable and confident when they have a transformed and better look. This new look often causes a heightened sense of self-esteem that can last a lifetime.\n\nOther than emotional benefits, the physical result of plastic surgery produces a healthier look. This healthy look often extends to the person's entire lifestyle by bringing about a positive, healthy lifestyle. For example, for people who have liposuction, they can have slimmer and even healthier bodies. This certainly makes them fitter and therefore, gives them improved quality of life.\n\nWhile plastic surgery cannot prevent the natural aging process, it can diminish visible signs of aging to improve appearance and overall well-being. As we grow older, our body begins to degenerate slowly changing the way we look. We can now undo the damaged done to our aged appearance. This is possible with the help of cosmetic and plastic surgery. It comprises a number of surgical procedures performed on many parts of the body. The result of it changes one's physical appearance and makes it more pleasing. Plastic surgery can also correct or modify features, as well as to correct damage resulting from everyday living, especially exposure to the sun.\n\nPlastic surgery has come a long way in the last thirty years. Whatever the reason for opting for it, it is a valuable area of medicine that is doing great miracles."

        "content": "Between the 1980s and the 2000s, the mobile phone has gone from being an expensive item used by the business elite to a pervasive and personal communications tool for the general population. They even developed to specific styles of phone seen as a regular fashion symbol. Inevitably, a mobile phone culture evolved in which the phone becomes a key social tool.\n\nThrough the mobile phone, countless people keep in touch using SMS. This also creates a whole new culture of 'texting'. The commercial market in SMS is growing. Many phones even offer Instant Messenger services to increase the simplicity and ease of texting on phones. In most countries, mobile phones outnumber landline phones, with fixed landlines numbering 1.3 billion but mobile subscriptions 3.3 billion at the end of 2007.\n\nIn developed countries today, 50% of children own mobile phones. It is not uncommon for young adults to simply own a mobile phone instead of a landline for their residence.\nEven in some developing countries, where there is little existing fixed-line infrastructure, the mobile phone has become widespread. According to the World Factbook the United Kingdom now has more mobile phones than people.\n\nInvented in 1997, the camera mobile phone makes up 85% of the market. Mobile phones also have features beyond sending text messages and making voice calls. They now have a limitless range of features to make communication and transactions faster. Most cellular phones sold in the last three years have integrated cameras. The other more up-to-date models have high quality digital cameras. Many of the cameras are capable of taking both still and video images. Images can usually be sent to other mobile phones and embedded in messages.\n\nThe range of additional capabilities include e-mail, phone and address books, alarm clock, stopwatch, live video feed via Piconet. Mobile games such as role-playing games like Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy series can be played. they also do recording and playback of voices, music, images and pictures, include Internet browsing, music (MP3) playback, personal organisers, built-in cameras and camcorders, ringtones, games, radio, Push-to-Talk (PTT), Bluetooth connectivity, call registers, downloading video for later viewing and even serving as a wireless modem.\n\nHowever, there is a price to pay for this phone culture. Several studies have shown that motorists have a much higher risk of collisions and losing control of their vehicle while talking on the mobile phone and simultaneously driving. This occurs even when using the hands-free system. In fact, using a mobile phone while driving poses the same risk as someone operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. In some countries, laws are passed prohibiting the use of mobile phones while driving."

        "content": "Extinction of wildlife is the disappearance of wild animals brought about by natural or unnatural means. The rapid disappearance of wildlife species was ranked as one of the planet's gravest environmental worries, surpassing pollution and global warming.\n\nOver 34 000 plant species and 5200 animal species around the globe are threatened with extinction and many thousands more become extinct each year. The primary causes of species extinction or endangerment are habitat destruction, commercial exploitation such as plant collecting, hunting and trade in animal parts. Of these causes, direct habitat destruction threatens most species.\n\nMany types of human activity result in habitat destruction. As species evolve, they adapt to a specific habitat or environment that best meets their survival needs. Without this habitat, the species may not survive. Pollution, conversion of shrub lands to grazing lands, cutting and clearing of forests, urbanisation, road and dam construction have destroyed or seriously damaged available wildlife habitats.\n\nAgriculture is another leading cause, with about 45 percent of the total land area in many countries used for farming. Besides replacing natural habitat with fields and plantations for the cultivation of crops, agricultural activity also results in soil erosion, pollution from pesticides and fertilisers.\n\nAs for urban development, it has destroyed wild habitat areas as well. Like agricultural activities, urbanisation has led to the direct replacement of natural habitats. For instance, it causes the depletion of local resources such as water. Shortage of water is detrimental to the survival of many species. The cutting of forests for the clearance of land has destroyed many important habitats for numerous species.\n\nNumerous other forms of human activity result in habitat destruction and degradation. These are grazing by domestic livestock reared by humans, mining activities that degrade habitats through pollution and building of dams.\nEven human recreational activity, particularly the use of off road vehicles, results in the destruction of natural habitats.\n\nPollution is another important contributing cause of extinction. Water pollution and increased water temperatures have wiped out species of fish in many habitats. Oil spills contaminate the ocean floor for many years after the event. Acid rain, which is the toxic result of extreme air pollution, has been known to kill organisms in freshwater lakes and destroy large tracts of forested land.\n\nThe warming of the Earth can alter habitats drastically, with serious consequences for numerous species. It has caused expanses of evergreen forests located immediately south of the tundra to shrink. Another effect is the shifting of forests and grasslands towards more appropriate climate regimes. However, animal species cannot shift their ranges quickly enough, so they have no habitat to shift into.\n\nThe extinction of wildlife species is indeed a serious matter. Therefore, preventing it is of utmost importance."

All of us know that good health is paramount for it enables us to achieve what we set out to do.\nFollowing a healthy diet means eating right. To do so, you need to eat a lot more fruit and vegetables. Try to avoid cholesterol-rich foods such as meat. Take the time to prepare your meals properly and make sure you include plenty of vitamin-rich vegetables in every meal. Eat more grain, fruit and vegetable. Such food gives you carbohydrates for energy, plus vitamins, minerals as well as fibre. It also tastes good.\n\nLifestyle is another important contributing factor to living a healthy. If you do not have access to at least an hour of sunlight every day, you can count on having acne, oily skin and hair, poor complexion and depression. Work stress is definitely bad for health. So come up with a timetable for your daily schedule. It will not only make it easy for you to manage your time but also reduce pressure on you. It will certainly make you feel happier and better. If you are happy, you are healthier.\n\nMake sure you exercise regularly. Choose an exercise routine that you are comfortable with, be it an hour of aerobics or something meditative such as yoga. By working out on a regular basis, it helps to prevent the development of heart disease, obesity and other illnesses. This is by improving the ability of our body to pump blood, which will boost the amount of oxygen in our bloodstream, burn fat and eliminate all toxins from our body through sweat. As useful are mental exercises or meditation. They are effective in eliminating negative emotions and habits from our mind.\n\nOf course, it is necessary to observe cleanliness and hygiene. This means being clean on all levels: mentally, physically and spiritually. Wash your hands frequently to cut down on germs and reduce the transmission of illnesses like colds and flu. Clean and floss your teeth at least twice a day: keep them sparkling. Protect and look after your skin. Use sunscreen and moisturiser. Do not smoke for smoking affects your skin. Alcohol and caffeine should be an occasional treat, not a regular part of your lifestyle.\n\nMake healthy eating and physical activities fun and habitual. In doing so, you will grow stronger, play longer and look and feel better."

        "content": "To prevent accidents at home especially those to little children, it is extremely important to have a 'childsafe' home.\nHere are some handy tips to point you in the right direction. Children are inquisitive, so never leave a child alone to crawl, especially near stairs. It is always good to have a stair gate in place at the top and bottom of your stairs. Small children can easily fall as they learn to walk. The garden is another dangerous place. Therefore, never leave a child near an open pond or swimming pool.\n\nMost accidents involving children can be predicted and are therefore preventable. Vigilance is not a substitute for simple safety measures. One must admit that it is physically impossible to keep an eye on a child all the time. This is especially so when you are tired or preoccupied. Accidents are more likely to happen. If you are going through a stressful time, such as work pressure, chances are that you are less alert to possible hazards.\n\nEnforcing safety rules, such as not touching plug points or not playing with matches, are important from an early age but remember that these rules need to be repeated over and over again before the message sinks in. The most important step a parent should take is to make the home a safe place for little ones. So sharp objects such as knives and scissors should be kept out of reach of children. Similarly, medicine and poisonous substances should be kept under lock and key. Swallowing of objects that are brightly coloured and small like buttons and beads is a common home accident. Extra care on the part of adults with these things will and can prevent such accidents.\n\nScalding by hot water or oil is another preventable home accident. Observe a few basic precautions and such accidents will not take place. Handles of saucepans should be turned away from the edge of tables. Either an adult or a child might be careless enough to tip the pan over.\n\nMost cases of poisoning happen in the home and are usually the result of accidental ingestion of medication, paraffin and cleaning agents. Children, particularly those under four years, are especially at risk because they are curious creatures and explore the world by putting everything into their mouths. Therefore, do not be fooled into thinking that children would not ingest bad tasting substances.\n\nIn case of accidents, all homes should be equipped with a first-aid kit. Parents should teach children the basic of first-aid steps to take in case of emergencies. Accidents sometimes cannot be eliminated but first-aid would help ease the pain until proper medical care arrives.\n\nThese recommended ways can help to a large extent. They might not prevent altogether but they can ensure fewer accidents."

        "content": "To choose a dog or a cat as a pet, that is interesting. I remember this saying 'A dog is man's best friend'. That common saying may contain some truth, but to me, a cat is a better friend. I am one of those people who enjoy the companionship of cats.\nFirstly, cats are affectionate. I like my pets to be affectionate. They will snuggle up and want to be petted or scratched under the chin. If I have a pet cat, I cannot resist doing that. I just love a purring cat. I can think of nothing more interesting than playing with cats. They are generally quite playful. They love to chase balls and feathers or just about anything dangling from a string. They especially enjoy playing when their owners are participating in the game.\n\nContrary to what people think of cats as being impossible to train, cats can be trained. By using rewards and punishments, just like with a dog, a cat can be trained to do what we want it to do. It can be trained to avoid unwanted behaviour or perform tricks too. Cats can even be trained to fetch our newspaper, for instance.\n\nMoreover, cats are civilised members of the household. Unlike dogs, cats do not bark or make other loud noise. They generally lead a quiet existence. Cats also do not often mess up the place. Mother cats train their kittens to use the litter box and most cats will use it without fail from that time on.\n\nOne of the most attractive features of cats as housepets is that they are easy to care for. Cats do not have to be walked. They get plenty of exercise in the house as they play and they do their business in the litter box. Cleaning a litter box is a quick and painless procedure.\n\nAs cats take care of their own grooming by licking themselves especially after a meal, bathing a cat is almost never necessary. In fact, cats are more particular about personal cleanliness than people are. In this aspect, they differ from dogs. Dogs like to run around and mess themselves up with the garbage outside homes. For this reason, I find them dirty animals.\n\nAnother benefit of keeping cats is that they can be left home alone for a few hours without fear. Unlike some pets, most cats will not destroy the furnishings when left alone. They are content to go about their usual activities until their owners return.\n\nFinally, cats are low maintenance civilised companions. People who have small living quarters or less time for pet care should appreciate these characteristics of cats. Cats do have claws and owners must make provision for this. A tall scratching post in a favourite cat area of the house will often keep the cat content to leave the furniture alone.\n\nSo considering these benefits of keeping pet cats, I prefer to choose them as pets. I always tell my friends this: no pet dog for me."

        "content": "If having to make a choice between reading an e-book or a printed book, which would most people choose? Some would go for an e-book while some still prefer the hard printed book.\nElectronics publication, be it in the form of e-books or downloadable PDF documents, are part of our age of technology. Technology improvements coupled with rising costs of printing on paper plus lowered costs of electronic publishing have caused a great rise in the use of them.\n\nIt is undeniable they do have benefits. For one, changes to an electronic publication are relatively easy to make. They are quicker to obtain. If you want specific information and it is available in a book, you can purchase an e-book and download it immediately. Instead of waiting for a printed book to be delivered, you can assess this information now.\n\nE-books are more easily updated and upgraded. Information changes rapidly today.\n\nThe printed books on many subjects can become out dated very quickly. On the other hand, e-books can be easily and quickly kept up to date. You usually get far more than just the e-book. Most e-books are sold with bonuses and related information that usually do not come with the purchase of a printed book. Moreover, they take up less space. Instead of a bulky library, you can fit literally thousands of books on your computer. It also makes it easier to share this information with family and friends.\n\nPrinted reference books are already dying out. When was the last time anyone purchased a printed encyclopaedia set for use at home? A generation ago that was common as parents often purchased printed encyclopaedias and even bookshelves to hold them in order to provide the necessary tools for their children's studies.\n\nIt is a fact that reference books of all sorts are already being released in digital format today and are selling well, usually being viewed on Windows or Macintosh computers, often as web pages. As improved handheld readers become available, sales in electronic format will only increase.\n\nFor nearly twenty years, futurists have been predicting the imminent demise of printed books. The conventional wisdom has been that digital e-books were on the verge of replacing paper books. However, this has not been the case. A printed book has its advantages too. For one, it is a stand-alone object that can be carried and used alone. It needs no electric outlet, no batteries, nothing. On the other hand, e-books will always require some form of support that the printed book does not need.\n\nI believe that that online publishing has not taken off because people want real books. What is being published online more and more are pamphlets and things that really do not need to be in print. These are stuff that people throw away afterwards. More often, people do not want to read a book on the computer. What could be better than a paper book? It lasts a long time. These books are designed to last a long time without degrading.\n\nTo sum the pros and cons up, there is no denying that the printed book is still very much preferred over its digital cousins. Reading electronic publications is just not the same when it comes to books. People are still very interested in real books and not e-books on the computer."

        "content": "It is undeniable that games and sports are an important part of school life. In fact, some people feel that sports should be made a compulsory curriculum in schools. The role of schools is to produce young people who are academically good. I disagree with the view that students should not waste time on sports.\nFirstly, sports plays a more meaningful role in developing positive values in students. It builds up leadership skills in students who are active in games and sports. Every game requires a leader or captain. The leader or captain gets good training on leadership skill by leading the team. Playing games or sparts also requires teamwork, initiative and a sense of responsibility.\n\nMoreover, games and sports provide a healthy avenue for students to exercise and relax after a bout of studies. As they play, they get to release tension and stress. After a game or match, their minds are recharged and they go back to their books in a better frame of mind.\n\nStudents who are not so academically good might end up to be good in certain games. If that is the case, participation in sports in school can help them develop their interest and ability in sports. They may even develop a career in sports. This would be a good option to those students who cannot obtain degrees in academic courses.\n\nStudents who play sports quickly learn that sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. They learn to be a good sport in both situations. It also helps them learn to deal with disappointment and go on.\n\nStatistics show that kids who are active in sports while in high school are more likely to experience academic success and graduate from high school.\n\nThe best part of sports is that playing it is fun. It gives the child something to do and a group to belong to. Students have a group of friends that has the same goals and interests. Young people who play sports are more likely to have a positive body image and higher self-esteem. They are also less likely to take drugs or smoke because they realise the impact that these destructive activities can have on their performance.\n\nIn my view, schools should make sports an important activity in the school curriculum. By so doing, they are not neglecting their mission in producing young people who are academically good. Every school should encourage sports. Through participation in games and sports, schools teach students good traits and values. Of course, good values can also be instilled during class lessons. However, if these values can also be instilled through playing sports, then sports is definitely not a waste of time and energy."

For one, it is a good way for them to spend the three month break while waiting for their examination results.\nDuring the programme, the trainees learn a lot of things like national ideology and history. The objectives are to instil in them qualities like loyalty, tolerance of others and living in harmony in a multi-racial society. The trainees will come out of the three month's national service stronger and much more thoughtful.\n\nAt home, they tend to take their home comforts and family members for granted. During the training, they live in camps away from their family. While at the camps, they gain a lot in terms of becoming more independent and disciplined. These are good traits to acquire. And such traits will stay with the young people.\n\nOne cannot deny that national service is a great way for Malaysian youths to channel their energy, especially while waiting for their SPM results. After all, three months is not a long time compared to Singapore, whose government implements their national service for two years. Our government has worked hard to make national service a success. Moreover, it provides them with essential skills in life. Not only will they learn more about their own country, but it will also build their confidence, teach them to cooperate in a group and mix with people of other ethnic backgrounds.\n\nTo those school-leavers who seldom mix with other races, this is their chance to do so. They should take it as a challenge. After all, the whole idea of National Service is not so much to instil a sense of patriotism but more a sense of discipline, courtesy and civic consciousness, which is very lacking in a lot of young Malaysians.\n\nAs for the argument that school-leavers are going to college three months later, this is rather insignificant. Many school-leavers do not join a college straight away after leaving school. Moreover, the trainees learn a lot of skills and knowledge during the national service. It certainly is not a waste of time. In fact, it is a very good experience for school leavers before they proceed to colleges for a tertiary education.\n\nConsidering these benefits of compulsory national service, I am convinced that it should not be stopped. What should be done instead is to improve the period of training to include a more challenging curriculum which our youths really need."

Of course, this is only true if advertisers refrain from giving false information in their advertisements or including their advertising costs in the prices of their products.\nThrough advertisements, consumers can know about new products in the market. They can be household, food or even more expensive items like cars and houses. This gives consumers more choice. From a variety of brands, they choose the brand that suits them or the one that they like. If not for advertisements, they will not know about the different brands.\n\nMoreover, due to advertisements, competition exists when companies advertise. This is good for it maintains or even improves the quality of the products. If there is no competition, quality of the products may drop. Through advertisements, consumers also come to know about the offers, special discounts or free gifts given during sales. This is useful to consumers who can stretch their dollar especially considering today's rise in the costs of almost everything in the market.\n\nAdvertising does have a positive role to play in modern society, helping us choose between competing goods. Many advertisements are drawing our attention to products with new features, for example more powerful computers, telephones which are also cameras and music players, or food with added vitamins. Others try to compete on price, helping us seek out the cheapest or best value products. In most cases advertising does not just make us go shopping. Instead, it makes us plan to buy food, clothes, gifts and go for entertainment in a healthy way. What advertising does is to help us make better decisions about how to spend our money, by giving us more information about the choices available.\n\nOver the years, advertising has evolved into a major industry that goes beyond informing to persuading, influencing and in some cases even brainwashing. It has actually become a type of culture with ardent followers. One cannot walk down the street, ride on a bus, watch television or read your email without seeing advertisements.\n\nThe fact is that the presence of some unethical advertisers does not mean that the whole basket is bad.

If it does not work, I am responsible for that too, but then I can make changes and improve my idea without the need to play company politics with the sales department. Moreover, self-employment comes with financial advantages. I can have more influence and control over business expense deductions. My business expenses are actually deductible. I will have more flexibility in how much tax I pay and when to pay it.

        "content": "It is my desire to follow in the footsteps of my parents. Both of them are teachers. Like them, I want to be a teacher too. My best memories are of my mother teaching in my primary school.\nI was in Year Four then. My mother was my English teacher. That lesson, she went to the greatest lengths to make our lesson so captivating. We got to play, sing-a-long as she played on the piano and read stories. I believe it was then I wanted to be a teacher just like her. I would make my students laugh and sing, like she did.\n\nOne strong factor that made me decide on a teaching career is my realisation that often, children who do not receive enough attention are in the lower income families. These children often lack the drive to succeed. As their teacher, I want to be the one who can push them. By giving them the right guidance in class and outside, I can change their lives. I strive to give them a better future.\n\nEveryone must be given a chance to do well in life. As a teacher, I will help my students by teaching them compassion, motivation and real life skills. These last with them for a lifetime. In class, I would try my best to give each child the opportunity that is sometimes not offered at home.\n\nAs our country keeps pushing for more progress, it is becoming imperative that students are successful in education. Communication is the most important skill one can possess to be successful in education. As a teacher, I could be the one to ensure a better academic experience for language-disordered children.\n\nGenerally, I like the lifestyle that a teacher lives. As a teacher, I move around and mingle with children. I love to be around them and to be a part of their maturation. Children are so naive that it helps me to remember that life does not have to be completely serious. I cannot imagine another job that would keep me young at heart.\n\nMoreover, a career in teaching does not end one's education. A teacher is a professional learner and that too appeals to me. In the educational setting, the methods in which we as teachers perform our job are always changing. A teacher is never done with learning. He is always adapting his point of view and using his imagination constantly.\n\nTo me, choosing a career in teaching is the most important job one can hold. Teachers are the people who produce future doctors, lawyers, politicians and other various important people that make our society as powerful as it is today. Teachers may also be the only people that can help a distraught child and keep them from becoming our future criminals and abusers.\n\nNo matter the background of the child, his race, his gender, or his societal worth a teacher is able to give a child a chance at future success. That is a gift of a lifetime that no other career can provide. So to me, the best career for me is as a teacher."

        "content": "To prepare for an exam, you as a student have to start early. If you have been keeping up on a daily and weekly basis, you must be in good shape. It is easier when it comes to getting serious about preparing for an exam.\nAs to how to go about it, the first thing you need is a plan. Start with the day one week before the exam. That is the first day to start studying in earnest. Plan out how many hours you will spend each day studying until the exam. Make a schedule and stick to it. Be sure to leave time for group study or review sessions.\n\nThe second thing is to outline the material you need to study. This helps to develop a big picture overview of the material. Start with big topics and leave room for subtopics. Fill in the information as best as you can. Get another sheet of paper and start over if necessary. Once you see all the units of information in front of you, it will be easier to organise your studying.\n\nIt helps to break up the material into parts and cover a little each day. Only once you understand each one, should you move on to the next topic. Do this part alone in your quiet study place. If you need to, memorise the information as much as you can.\n\nLater, if you prefer, work with others, go to review sessions or see a tutor. At this point, it is important to make sure that everything is clearly understood. If this step is skipped, you are left with trying to memorise hundreds of useless factoids. It will never mean anything to you later. Having done that, it is time to put the information into your brain for retrieval. If you have been working all along, you will already remember, much of it. Make sure that nothing is left out.\n\nTo find out if you understand what you have been studying, try working with someone else who will ask you questions about the material. If you can answer and explain concepts without too much effort then you are prepared.. Usually by doing this it will expose areas that require more attention and study.\n\nIf you planned well and kept up with the work there should be little anxiety the night before an exam. If you started late or waited to get questions answered, then you will be busy the night before. This will add extra stress and you are likely to make stupid errors in the exam.\n\nOn the night before the exam, make sure you get eight hours of sleep. Though some believe pulling an all-nighter to cram information is a good idea, it really is not at all.\n\nOn the morning of the exam, wake up about thirty minutes earlier so that you can do a quick refresher of some of the main points from your exam review. These last thirty minutes keep the information fresh in your mind without wearing you out. Eat a full breakfast of healthy food. You need to be healthy and alert to do your exam well. Make sure you arrive early so that you are not rushing around right before the exam starts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you are better prepared for an exam. You will feel more confident and in control When you feel as such, you are more likely to do better in the exam."

        "content": "As social problems increase among Malaysian youths, youth crimes too have risen especially since the late 1990s. Sad to say, the youth crimes are becoming more violent and alarming. Young people are responsible for 40% of crimes committed today! Examples of such crimes are theft, burglary, robbery and fighting.\nYouth crimes are caused by various factors. They can be poor attainment at school, truancy and school exclusion, deprivation such as poor housing or homelessness and peer group pressure. Family factors include troubled home life, poor parental supervision, criminal parents or siblings, parental abuse or neglect and the quality of the parent-child relationship.\n\nParents usually do not accept that they are to be blamed when something goes wrong with their child. Instead, they are quick to blame the system and others when their child commits crimes. They refuse to accept that due to lack of parental attention, the teenagers turn to wrong company and get influenced to commit crimes. These youth criminals do this either to fit into the group or to listen to the group leader.\n\nTackling youth crimes is a priority for the government today. One move taken is to introduce major changes to the youth justice system, which together with preventive measures, are aimed to reduce offending by young people. The prevention efforts implemented are comprehensive in scope. They include activities such as substance abuse education and treatment, family counseling, youth mentoring, parenting education, educational support and youth sheltering. All these come under the delinquency prevention program. The aim of the program is preventing youth from becoming involved in criminal or other anti-social activities.\n\nIncreasingly, governments are recognizing the importance of allocating resources for the prevention of delinquency. As it is often difficult for states to provide the fiscal resources necessary for good prevention, organizations, communities andgovernments are working more in collaboration with each other to prevent juvenile delinquency.\n\nSchools play a big role in this. A school-based program has been initiated to provide support and advice to young people aimed at improving behavior and reducing truancy. When students show greater interest in their studies, they are less likely to be influenced by bad company. Some youth centers impose a requirement for parents to attend counseling and guidance sessions where they receive help in dealing with their children.\n\nYouth offending teams are an important part of our strategy to deal with youth crime. They include representatives from the police, social services, health, education and housing. Their job is to identify the needs of each young offender as well as their problems and then measuring the risk they pose to others. This enables them to identify suitable programs to address the needs of the young person so they can be rehabilitated."

        "content": "Leaders are needed to manage a country or any organisation. They are very important people. Under good leaders, the country will be stable and peaceful. In this way, it can prosper.\nThe same goes for organisations. They too need good leaders to lead them. They cannot grow or do well without good management or leaders. Schools too need leaders. They are the headmaster, class monitors, prefects and game captains. All of them have an important role to play to ensure the smooth running of the school. At home, parents are the leaders guiding the family.\n\nTo me, the most important trait of a leader is a strong sense of responsibility. A leader should take his work or position seriously and carry out his duties to the best of his ability. He should always think of what is best for his people, be it staff members, family or any group of people.\n\nA leader is also someone who helps others become more than they ever thought it was possible. Leadership is about unlocking potential, whether individual potential or that of a group, company or organisation. It is not about telling people what to do. Instead, it is inspiring them to see what they are capable of and then helping them get there.\n\nA very important quality of a leader is being sincere, honest and truthful. In dealing with those under him, he should at all times follow the principles of fairness and justice. Leaders in schools or communities should be honest with those under their charge. In this way, they can gain their people's respect and trust. If a leader does not have these traits, his people cannot rely on him.\n\nLeaders of a country should always put the interests of their people first. They have to be approachable, caring and concerned about the welfare of those under them. A good leader should be willing to listen to his people's problems or suggestions. This is then followed up by doing his best to solve these problems.\n\nUltimately, a leader is a friend to those under his guardianship. This is by being their mentor and guide. As one, he has to set good examples. That is why a good leader is likely to train good followers. The reverse is likely to happen under poor leaders. This testifies to the importance of good leadership.\n\nIn addition to being self-aware, an effective leader is not afraid to take on extra responsibilities and duties. Sometimes it requires putting the organisation or group first. To do this, there must be a strong sense of commitment.\n\nIt is not easy to be a good and true leader. Neither is it impossible. True and good leadership requires one to make sacrifices, including putting others before oneself. He is often the mentor who prompts others to be their best, someone who cares and listens, and is willing to always be there for them."

Located in the heart mainland of Southeast Asia and flanked by Vietnam in the east, Laos in the north, the Gulf of Thailand in south and Thailand in west, it conjures images of a glorious and mysterious past and rich in cultural heritages, particularly the world's renowned ancient temple city called Angkor Wat temple.\nIts magical image draws ever-increasingly tourists from all over the world. The perfection, balance and sculpture of the temple makes it an architectural masterpiece.\n\nAngkor Wat is actually a series of galleries, chambers and courtyards on different levels linked by steep stairways. One can just stand on its high terrace and picture its past grandeur, where ancient court life was rich and lustrous.\n\nAngkor, meaning 'capital' sprawls over 200 sq km and is studded with over fifty ancient ruins. In the olden days, it was the administrative centre of the Khmer empire, which existed in the fifteenth century, During that period, the kings built temples and monuments to honour their gods and ancestors.\n\nBesides Angkor Wat, there are larger temples. Most of them are surrounded by moats and have common features such as galleries, halls, terraces, bathing pools and enclosure walls. Carvings have been engraved on walls while statues of Hindu deities and of Buddha stand guard in halls and passageways. Reliefs, which are projections of sculptured forms, carved in stone, are among the Khmers' greatest artistic achievements.\n\nAnother place of tourist interest is Bayon which sits at the centre of a walled compound called Angkor Thom. Unlike Angkor Wat, which is classic and grand, the Bayon temple is wild and erratic. Its design is almost bizarre, with 54 towers, each topped with four gigantic faces bearing smiles. They are believed to be the faces of one of the kings of the Khmer empire.\n\nBesides temples, there are other attractions. One of them is the Bokor National Park, another one of the wave well-known tourist destinations in Cambodia. This national park is home to several endangered species of tiger and elephant. Its high altitude allows you to experience the awesome beauty of Vietnamese and Cambodian coastal line.\n\nIts Kompong Luong is also worth visiting and viewing. This floating village is popular for its picturesque setup. With its colourful shops, restaurants, vegetable shops, petrol stations all floating on the Great Lake, Kompong Luong is indeed a great experience in itself.\n\nCambodia is famed for its Khmer heritage, temples and culture. It is a indeed a strange mixture of old and new as well as of beauty and ruins everywhere."

        "content": "The Malaysian night market or pasar malam is based on a concept of open-air shopping where street vendors take over a designated street to set up stalls. The designated street is closed to traffic from the early evening to late at night, only to be transformed into a network of brightly-lit stalls.\nThe night market is the place where you can weave your way around the stalls, enjoy the smell of local foods and maybe pick up some trinkets. Many night markets are also famous for their imported fabrics, imitation leather goods and branded items.\n\nEach night market comprises a different combination of stalls, and new items are constantly being added on in line with current trends and market demand, so there is always something new and exciting to look forward to at each visit.\n\nThe night markets are typically from 5 p.m. till 10.30 p.m. You can get anything from might markets, be it groceries, clothing, good local food, hot snacks, accessories, bags, household items, fresh produce and even the latest fads.\n\nBy around 6 p.m., the market is in full swing as the first batches of people sweep in. For those who cook, there is stall upon stall selling fresh seafood, meat products and a limitless variety of vegetables. Dried and preserved items such as dried shrimp, mushrooms, salted eggs and century eggs are easily available here too.\n\nIt is no secret that all night bazaars share a common treasure - scrumptious street cuisine. It would be a sin to breeze through these places and not nibble on mouth-watering local dishes. Thirst-quenchers such as the ever-popular soy bean drink and sugarcane juice are a permanent feature here.\n\nNoisy jostling crowds are the hallmark of the night market. Therefore, it is not a place for the faint-hearted or the gentle. To many, they are fun and thrilling places to explore. You can even indulge in discoveries of the antique kind which can be found in some night markets.\n\nBargaining is a practice in this part of the world where you try to persuade the vendor to part with his ware at a price lower than the price he is offering to sell you. A good starting point would be to offer to pay 40-50% of the price quoted.\n\nSome places are 24-hour markets, which are livelier at night when traders set up numerous stalls selling unusual local food, exotic tropical fruits, cheap clothes, second-hand goods as well as fresh produce. The night market is truly an exciting experience and a feast for the eyes on a tropical night out. The atmosphere is almost festive. There is so much to see, buy and eat."

It was opened in November 1999.\nIt has about 430 shops on five and a half floors. It also has an 18 screen cinema. Then there is a state-of-the-art bowling centre, a One-Stop IT Centre, two mega food courts and also a mega bookstore called MPH.\n\nIt houses a 48300 square foot convention centre and it is situated adjacent to a 646 room business hotel named Cititel Midvalley and thirty units of exclusive eleven-storey signature offices. A second hotel, Boulevard, opened in mid 2005. It has 390 rooms. Megamall is a key part of Mid-Valley City, one of the country's largest urban development projects.\n\nOne of Malaysia's most popular tourist destinations, Megamall is one of the largest shopping complexes. It was awarded the Best Shopping Complex Award 2000 by Tourism Malaysia and Best Retail Development Award 2001 by FIABCI Malaysia. A visit to Malaysia would not be complete without visiting this mall. It is easily accessible as there are KTM Komuter trains, buses and taxis that ply this route regularly.\n\nThe Gardens, a new wing, was opened to the public on October 2007. After The Gardens completed in 2007, it is linked to Mid Valley Megamall through a bridge. Not many knows about the existence of this bridge, though, as it is hidden by Oasis, one of the main food courts in the Megamall, which probably contributes to the high contrast between crowds of the two shopping centres. As this mall is huge, it is always a good idea to take a look and study the directory of the various shops that are located in both the Megamall and the Gardens.\n\nWhether weekdays or weekends, this shopping complex will be full of people. The traffic around this area is always congested with both public and private transport. One can choose to travel by bus, taxi, LRT or car.\n\nThere are three of Malaysia's famous anchors: Metrojaya, Jusco and Carrefour in the building. Eateries are plenty here and most of them are located at the Lower Ground and First Floor. Fast food outlets such as Burger King, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, KFC, Sushi King, and Long John Silver's are all located at the LG level. A whole range of international cuisines featuring American, Chinese, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Thai and Vietnamese are all available here for one to savour.\n\nThe Mid Valley Megamall is a place Malaysia can boast of to people visiting it. It is on par with the shopping complexes found in most developed countries."

Sad to say, I never took his advice seriously.\nOne day, my father said he had finally decided to buy a new laptop I had been asking for. I was elated! He told me to withdraw the money I needed from an ATM machine. Then, I was to go to the shop and wait for him there.\n\nHe reminded me, \"Be careful. There are many robberies and crimes. Don't talk to any stranger outside the bank. Just use your ATM card and withdraw the money. Then walk away quickly.\"\n\nI laughed his words off and said, \"No, I won't, Dad.\" In my mind, I imagined a stranger attacking me. But me being strong, I pictured myself sweeping him down and sending him away with a few swift blows.\n\nAt three o'clock, I decided to go to the bank. Inside the ATM room, I looked all around me first. I had to make sure nobody was watching me press my pin numbers. Seeing it was safe, I pressed the six numbers. The sum of RM3000 came out of the machine. I took the money and tucked it safely inside my pouch.\n\nThen, I walked quickly out of the ATM machine room. Just outside of the room, I felt someone tapping my shoulder.\n\nIt was a man. I heard his voice.\n\nHe was asking me, \"Excuse me, did you drop this...?\"\n\nI turned around. A layer of thin smoke swirled before my face. I breathed in, not knowing what it was. I immediately felt dizzy and weak and could not think clearly any more.\n\nI only heard a soft voice saying, \"Follow me.\"\n\nSo I followed him. My mind did not seem to be mine any more. I walked behind the man. When I got into his car, I had a good look at his face. He was dark and had a scar on his cheek. After he had started his car engine, he pushed his face towards mine. I passed out.\n\nWhen I woke up, I saw I was lying on the ground in a dark alley. Where was this place? Slowly, I got up and felt my pouch. It was empty! All the money was gone! I phoned my father. He came to fetch me from the alley and immediately took me to the police station.\n\n'The policeman was very kind. He asked me gently, \"Can you recognise the man?\" I told him I saw the man's face clearly in the car. He had a long scar on the right side of his face.\n\nThe policeman told me, \"The stranger hypnotized you. So, you could not think clearly and followed what he said. There is a gang of people doing this.\"\n\nI learnt a painful lesson. From that day onwards, I was very careful. One day, I got a phone call from the police station.\n\nThe same policeman spoke to me. \"Dave, can you come to the police headquarters? We need you to identify the robber.\"\n\nThe next day, my father and I went to the police headquarters. Through the glass door, I saw him and recognised him at once. That was the same robber who had robbed me of my money. I nodded my head. Then, I walked out whistling happily. I had done my part to help the police."

This is us at our best adept at social interaction and making people feel at ease. Whether it is a party at our own house or one thrown by a friend or relative, we are always able to liven the atmosphere with our own particular brand of humor. Thus, it is not surprising that each sister has an active social life peopled by lots of friends.\n\nAnother instance of my family members at their best is during discussions of political or social situations or issues. Being interested in the affairs around us, both regionally as well as internationally, we are keen on active and informed discussions at home. Our discussions are usually sharp and rapid, a testimony to our debating skills developed while at school.\n\nBut the one thing that my sisters are poor at is the planning of logistics for family outings. My eldest sister tends to be the one trying her level best to figure out the necessary logistics for the outing. But this usually ends in terrible chaos as we would find ourselves without things that we need for a barbecue or picnic.

        "content": "Weng's Convenience Store was a well-known landmark feature of the Lumee estate. Started by old Mr Weng in the early 1970s, it had grown from a little corner shop selling necessities to today's mini-supermarket catering to the needs of the neighborhood that had grown up around it. Mr Heng still worked in the shop, although it was now more a matter of recreation for him than making a living. His sons were not interested in the business and Mr Weng ran it with the help of hired manpower.\nEach evening, he would sit outside the store and watch the little children playing at the playground he had built almost ten years ago. The children loved their Uncle Weng who laughed at their antics and often gave them sweets as well as hugs. The adults always felt safe letting their children play there while they went about their business. In fact, Mr Weng's store was like a huge childcare centre; children would be well taken care of as long as Mr Weng was around. He was indeed a well-loved institution in the area.\n\nBut things changed after Mr Weng suffered a stroke and became bedridden. His sons sold the land on which the store stood to a large corporation with plans to demolish the store and build two bungalows on it. It was a sad day for all in the neighborhood when the familiar sight of the store was gone. The residents were disheartened by the huge vacuum left in their lives by Mr Weng's absence.\n\nIt was no longer convenient to buy their groceries as the nearest store was now more than two kilometers away. The efficient manners of the staff at the other store contrasted sharply with the friendliness at Weng's Convenience Store. No longer did the residents linger for chats at the convenience store. Everything became business-like now: one simply purchased what one needed and left.\n\nThe residents in the new homes did not make things better. They were largely affluent professionals who had no time for friendly smiles and well-wishes. Gradually, the neighborhood felt like a strange place as people passed each other without a word or smile. Everyone was always in a hurry and avoided any form of contact with one another. The neighborhood became an unfriendly place.\n\nBut the greatest loss that was felt was Mr Weng's presence itself. No longer were children able to play at the playground that he had built for them. Even if the playground had not been demolished along with the store, everyone would have missed the comforting presence of Mr Weng on the bench every evening outside the store. The streets were now deserted, streets that in the past were filled with the laughing voices of children and friendly chatter of adults. No one could get used to the change and gradually, many moved away from the neighborhood to start a life elsewhere where there were no painful memories of a lost community."

        "content": "Beauty truly lies in the eye of the beholder. Many people cite famous models, picturesque tourist spots and exquisitely crafted items as their idea of beauty, but I prefer a more natural and understated definition.\nTo me, beautiful people are not those who are well endowed or glamorous. Rather, they are people with `beautiful' personalities. I know of a lady whom everyone considers beautiful not because she has delicate features, but because she is kind and caring from the heart. When one talks to her, one is never in doubt over her sincerity. Once, I was all torn up over a family problem and she was the first to come and offer aid, both emotional and material. She is always ready to give of herself to those around her, and that makes her one of the most beautiful people I have ever known.\n\nAnother person whom I find beautiful is my friend, Sally. She is not beautiful by conventional standards, but he has such a warm and bubbly nature that everyone around her is immediately attracted to. She has a wonderful and quirky sense of humor, which is really entertaining. Everyone enjoys her company and her ready peal of laughter is always heard. Few have seen her daunted by anything at all and in fact, her high-spirited greetings every morning are what we look forward to.\n\nPlaces that are beautiful to me are not those that are perfectly captured on postcards, but rather, those with a sense of serenity and charm. I enjoyed the countryside of Europe tremendously not because they are wonderful works of nature, but because they gave me a sense of tranquility that I do not find in Malaysia. Europe is so steeped in culture that even just walking along the cobblestone paths are enough to conjure images of a romantic world long past. Coupled with this old-world charm is the sense of history that one feels in the places visited. It provides an awesome experience that makes one want to go back again.\n\nIn all, beauty is a state of mind, for no one who is negative about experiences and life would find anything attractive. To use a line from the famous poet William Blake, beauty comes when you can \"see the world in a grain of sand\"."

As the primary `clients' of schools are the students, emphasis should be placed on their progress into productive people capable of being worthy citizens in the society.\nTo produce such people, it would be ideal if the school provides a conducive environment for learning. The surroundings should not be a busy thoroughfare, but rather, peaceful and green as these will relax the mind and encourage introspection. Also, the climate in school should be one that encourages learning. If park benches with tables are placed in cool shady spots and occupied by students who are quietly concentrating on their work or busy discussing their work, the school will become an inviting place to those who are reluctant to study.\n\nA school is as good as dead if it does not have dedicated teachers who put in effort in making learning an enjoyable yet thought-provoking experience. The ideal school has teachers who are thoughtful in planning how the lesson can achieve the aims outlined and unafraid of being different in their methodology. Lessons become more interesting as they stimulate creativity and independent thinking. Teachers are 'friends' to their students, that is, the students see them as approachable and deserving of respect. This also helps to bridge the gap between teachers and students, allowing the former to act as counselors whenever the need arises.\n\nThe curriculum taught in the ideal school would focus on the pupils' learning rather than the teachers' teaching. By this, I mean that effort would be made in ensuring that the curriculum provides challenges for the students and stimulates them to pursue the subjects with interest. This is in contrast to the current syllabus in school where the teachers merely lecture and cram information down the students' throat. Instead of giving the students the information, more would be done to allow exploratory learning, like work project and assessing the process by which they arrive at the conclusions rather than just grading the finished product.\n\nOpportunities would be given for individualized learning in the ideal school. This means that there are enough different co-curricular and extra-curricular activities in school to meet the different needs of the students. Instead of the teachers telling the students how to run the activities, students would be trusted to do the job. This will lead to testing out their organizational skills as well as problem-solving abilities. Even if an activity is not well received, the students will be able to learn from their mistakes and move on to greater awareness. This is important for the growth of the student as an individual as well as a team player.\n\nAn ideal school is one that allows the students to discover their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. It is one that makes learning enjoyable and interesting."

        "content": "I once took a bus journey from Kampung Pulai to Butterworth during my school holidays. I was on my way to meet my family who had already gone there ahead of me. Gathering in Butterworth during the December holidays was a yearly routine for my family, as my grandparents were originally natives of the island before moving to Perak in the early 1950s. This was the first time that I was traveling on my own and I was a little apprehensive.\nBut the different sceneries that I was treated to along the way silenced my fears. When we were driving through Kampung Pulai, I noted the modern and bustling city that it had become. The buildings were all beautiful and tall, with estate sporting a different identity. Then, the landscape changed as the bus drove along oil palm plantations. The air of serenity and the endless stretch of green were unbelievable. I usually traveled by air to Butterworth with my parents, and now knew what I had missed all this time. I was also treated to neatly planted rows of coconut trees swaying gracefully in the wind, as well as the heavy red fruit of the oil palms neatly seated along the road for collection by the lorries.\n\nThen the bus passed a stretch of sea as it went along the coast. The sight of the sun's rays bouncing on the waves to form a glittering bed of blue and green was absolutely beautiful. I was enjoying myself so much just watching the scenery that I did not realize that my stomach was protesting in hunger. The bus stopped at a little market square where hawkers had set up little stalls to sell their wares. I got down the bus and treated myself to a juicy Danny's burger, legendary for its scrumptious taste. Had my mother been with me, I would never have been allowed to buy it. So I enjoyed my freedom greatly.\n\nBy this time, I had made friends with two other boys who were traveling up to Butterworth for the holidays. We struck up a conversation and got along well once we realized that we had a lot in common. Together, we went round the square looking at the wares on sale and eating all the oily but tasty food that were cooked on the spot for us. We had a really interesting but unhealthy time!\n\nWhen the bus finally reached the depot where I was to take a ferry across to Butterworth, I had the pleasure of knowing that I had benefited greatly from the journey. I had made two new friends, while feasting both physically as well as visually. It was really an enjoyable trip!"

        "content": "Kenny Eating House is always crowded in the late afternoons right up to midnight. As you approach it, you will see many people standing around the tables that are already packed with hungry customers who are busily gulping down food. These people who are standing around will be on the alert for a table most likely to be vacated. Once there is even the slightest indication that the patrons are leaving their table, you will see a few people swooping down on it. The victor will stand at the table triumphantly waving his relatives or friends over, while the losers will curse foully under their breath.\nBut having found a place to sit is not the end of the wait. You next have to get the attention of the busy waiters rushing about to attend to the customers. You will usually hear the words `hot water' being shouted out as they pass, even if they are not holding any such thing! This is in fact their ingenious way of clearing the way. In between trying to catch the attention of the waiters and looking through the menu, you will hear customers grumbling about the slow service. But strangely, they fall silent suddenly whenever a waiter comes by.\n\nOnce the waiter comes to take your orders, he is brusque and impatient. It would do well for customers to plan their orders in advance instead of asking him too many questions. Sometimes, these waiters would just walk away from indecisive customers and the latter would have to work hard at getting some attention again. Usually, fast and furious orders are bandied around loudly, as the waiters shout the orders out to the cooks, even though the latter are located deep in the kitchen and out of sight. But such shouting certainly adds to the ambience of the place as a busy eating place!\n\nWhenever the crowd gets too thick, the waiters will resort to asking customers to share their tables with those standing so that the eating house will not become so congested that it is impassable to human traffic. When the tables are shared by two different groups of people, the cacophony becomes incredibly deafening. Amid the din of plates clanking and people talking loudly, you need to shout to be heard. This becomes terribly unpleasant as having dinner becomes an extremely chaotic and tense affair.\n\nOnly when the hands of the clock approaches midnight does the crowd begin to thin and the noise dies down. The flustered waiters can finally sit down for a chat or puff at their cigarettes. The activity at the eating place winds down, ready to recuperate before the next day of madness arrives."

        "content": "When the Experimental Theatre Company in Singapore held their highly anticipated performance of 'Medea' at the West Coast Park, it was an event that took Singapore by storm as it was a hitherto untried venue for a serious play. My friends and I were avid theatre goers and decided to attend it even though the ticket was rather costly.\nWe turned up for the event at about six in the evening and were shocked at the vast number of people who had already gathered. As it was to be a performance that capitalized on natural changing light, the evening was the best time to stage the play. We had to pick our way carefully through the crowd of people who had come fully armed with picnic mats, baskets of food and even binoculars. It was a crowd who had come prepared to enjoy themselves. Energised by such enthusiasm, we settled down quickly under a tree.\n\nThe opening of the play was spectacular. Using the colorful palette of the setting sun in the distance, the play opened with a dance sequence that was breathtaking. We were so engrossed in the dance that when the actors and actresses streamed in from around us, we were visibly stunned. Never before had we experienced actors and actresses moving around the audience instead of being on a clearly-defined stage. But it was a novel experience as the intensity of the drama was driven home for the audience.\n\nBut a hilarious interruption to the unfolding drama took place when an errant child tottered forward to one of the actresses and insisted on being carried. When the professional actress ignored the child, the latter started bawling loudly, earning some titters from the audience. When the child still refused to move away, one of the actors finally picked the child up and deposited him safely out of their way. It was really funny watching the actor trying to quell the petulant child.\n\nBut the play got back on track as we watched the tragedy of Medea powerfully enacted by an actress. Torches strategically placed now lighted the set and the entire spectacle of shadows and blazing light was stunning. Safe for the earlier interruption, the play progressed at a pace that was invigorating and yet heart-rending. We were enthralled by it.\n\nWhen the play finally ended, we all rose as one body to give it a standing ovation. The actors and actresses took their bows and the audience started to pack up. We were so exhilarated by the power of the play that we decided to go for supper to discuss it. It was certainly a wonderful experience."

        "content": "The mention of `household' gives me an impression of domesticity (to be tamed and trained to do housework). `Tasks' is a negative word to me - it spells unpleasant chores, in this case, those done in the house.\nBeing an only child and a boy to boot, Mum dotes on me. But Dad would have none of Mum spoiling me. He always asks Mum to delegate household chores to me, the more unpleasant the better, so that as he phrases it, \"I will respect those who work with their hands\". I have seen the truth of what he says, especially when I see the behaviour of some of my friends who behave like spoilt brats. They always leave dirty, unpleasant tasks to their mums or maids.\n\nHowever, even though I know it is my responsibility to help lighten Mum's duties in the household, I have certain preferences. For instance, I like to cook, vacuum and mop the floor. The tasks that I hate to do are sweeping, ironing or throwing the rubbish bag down the chute. I will give my reasons for my likes and dislikes.\n\nBy nature, I am a very clean and fastidious person. That is why I am very averse to have anything to do with dirt. Hence, when I sweep the floor, I tend to take ages to do it as I search for the miserable litter and dirt in every nook and cranny of my flat. My mum nags me on my slowness and that is why I also dislike doing this.\n\nTaking out the household rubbish and disposing of it is another task I heartily dislike. The sour smell of leftovers and swill revolts me and Dad always laughs when he sees me trying to get rid of it as fast as possible when I carry it to the common corridor outside to dispose of it down the chute!\n\nAnother task I always try to avoid doing is ironing. For the life of me, I can never get it right. By nature, I am rather impatient. Hence, I try to get the task over as quickly as possible. Being lazy at times, I do not put much effort in ironing out the creases. The end result is that the clothes are not always properly ironed, and Dad insists I have to iron them again. What a bother! I guess I do not have the aptitude to do this tedious chore.\n\nHowever, I like mechanical things and love to control machines. Hence, I am always the first one to start the washing machine and vacuum cleaner. I love the mechanical clanging and wringing of these things. When I move my vacuum cleaner across the floor, I pretend that I am a monster and the dust and dirt are ugly human beings being sucked up by me.\n\nThere is one task which I thoroughly like and that is cooking. Others may regard it as a chore. Mum is an average cook and Dad cannot cook for the life of him. But boy, can I cook! They say that self-praise is no praise at all, but it is true. I really can cook. Dad says so and Mum also grudgingly admits it.\n\nWhen I am given the task of preparing the weekend meal, I will spend the whole day thinking about it like what dishes to prepare, how to cook them and how to obtain the best and freshest ingredients. I really take pains to cook the dishes and the satisfied expressions of those who partake of my dishes is satisfaction enough.\n\nI shall end this essay now on my likes and dislikes of household tasks. I hope I have not prejudiced you against certain household tasks."

        "content": "November 3, 2013. The date ranked of primary importance to any Pahang football fan. This evening was to witness the final match between Pahang and Kelantan - the culmination of the Malaysia Cup Competition. It was to decide which team was supreme in football in Malaysia.\nThe match was to kick off at 7.30 p.m. Over 80,000 observers could view gay decorations of flags, banners bearing the names, bright colors and logos of the contesting teams decorating the Shah Alam Stadium. An air of anticipated excitement hung over the place. In fact, busloads of fervent supporters had been arriving at the stadium grounds throughout the early afternoon and before the kickoff.\n\nAt 7.25 p.m., the scene outside the stadium was a hive of activity and a mix of sounds and colours. The reverberating sounds of kompangs (Malay drums) could be heard as fans tried to boost the morale of the players and crowds.\n\nLong queues of impatient fans were waiting in line to be allowed into the stadium or to buy last minute tickets. Ticket touts moved around them quietly, offering tickets on the black market at marked up prices. A few fans, impatient at the long queues, were waiting to part with their money for the coveted tickets. Moreover, it had been a long, tiring wait in the hot weather outside and these were tickets for the covered stands. There might be a monsoon coming along as drops of rain had started to patter on the pavements outside the stadium.\n\nHawkers outside the stadium were doing a roaring trade. Brightly colored pinkish drinks clashed with the sound of sizzling Ramly hamburgers which were sold from pushcarts. There were even vendors selling brightly-colored balloons for the children. A stall somewhere proclaimed branded football jerseys at a discount but on closer inspection, would reveal them as fakes. Business was brisk as a 30,000 - crowd filled the stadium.\n\nMeanwhile, as the time approached 7.30 p.m., those outside who had not gained entrance to the stadium began to resign themselves to watching the game outside. The generous authorities had kindly provided a giant television screen outside. The crowd jostled patiently and good-naturedly for the best vantage points to view the match outside.\n\nGroups of boys were moving around, bearing rattan baskets containing pies and drinks and shouting out a continual refrain of \"Drinks, curry puffs, 50 cents, 1 dollar.\"\n\nAn observer would, if he had looked up, seen a giant helium balloon bobbing in the air outside the stadium. It bore the words of its sponsor, `Jusco Batteries.\"\n\nThe crowd itself was a motley group of people. There was a sprinkling of Chinese and Indian fans amid the mostly Malay fans. They were mostly youths, with some middle-aged men. Children and women comprised the least. One could spy some families having a picnic on the grounds outside. Most people were dressed casually, but others were decked in traditional wear.\n\nThere was suddenly a silence. The minister had just finished his speech. Then there was a tremendous roar inside the stadium. The match had begun ! The people outside the stadium joined in the welcome shouts as the long awaited finals started to unfold."

        "content": "Singapore, my neighboring country, may be small but it is a stable and prosperous multi-racial city state. Moreover, it has a reputation for non-corruption. Consequently, it attracts tourists and prospective residents. Being a small country, many Singapore residents like to travel abroad to escape from their fast-paced city life. Hence, for both foreigners and-locals alike, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) building is a place they will need to visit at least once.\nThe grey, multi-storeyed building stands adjacent to the Lavender MRT (mass rapid transit) station. From dawn to dusk, it receives a steady stream of visitors from the station or from the nearby bus stop. Most of them make a beeline for the building as the surrounding buildings are just a mix of drab warehouses and scattered residential buildings.\n\nThe building itself has several levels catering to the various needs of the visitors. Here, people come to apply, renew, extend or collect the passports and forms or passes relating to residence, immigration or citizenship.\n\nA visitor will usually head for the information counters first. There, his request will be assigned a queue number at a given counter. He will then head for the required storey and counter. Once there, the person will wait patiently or impatiently for the perpetually busy clerks to call out his number. Then he will produce his collection of forms, photographs and other documents so as to process that all important document which either allows him to visit the overseas country he is hankering for (for a local) or to stay in this country for a while longer (for a foreigner).\n\nThe Immigration Officers work behind closed doors in their office booths. Occasionally, he or she will come out to clarify something or hand over some papers to the clerks. When people are ushered into the offices, they are to be interviewed for the issue of the documents they are requesting for. The merits of their case will be considered according to rules and regulations and its progress according to due process for this is a country which prides itself on its 'clean' and efficient reputation.\n\nPeople of different races and cultures will be seen. People trickle in at early dawn, patiently waiting for the doors to open and to avoid the crush of public applicants who come later. The crowds swell to its maximum just before lunch time.\n\nAt this time, many people will head for the canteen on the ground floor. A casual observer will hear topics of conversation ranging from holidays abroad to problems of applying for citizenship. However, the main employment of the mouths here is to receive food for the hungry stomachs.\n\nBy 4 p.m., the crowds thin out. More people will be seen leaving rather than entering the building. The doors of the building will close promptly at 5 p.m.\n\nWhen dusk settles in and the evening shadows become longer, the place becomes silent and empty. The building and its staff will rest and recharge for the next day will be another busy day when the doors open again."

        "content": "SSM High is situated in the heart of Rockwell town. It is not one of the better known schools, having just a history of four years since its inception. I have been a student there ever since its founding and will have fond memories of it when I leave.\nThe midday break, or recess time, as it is popularly known in Malaysian schools, is indeed a welcome break indeed. Schooling in Malaysia starts at an early morning hour and sleepy-eyed students have a hurried breakfast or no breakfast at all before they go to school. Hence, the break is a time to fill up the students' hungry stomachs. There are healthy appetites, hunger pangs and thirsty throats at this time. Also, it is a welcome rest from the morning's academic load as most of the `heavy' study subjects like Mathematics, Science or History are conducted before the break.\n\nThere are two recess times. The first, at 10:10 am, is for the secondary one and two students. The second, twenty minutes later, is for the upper secondary students. At the welcome ringing of the bells signaling the first break, there is a purposeful march of many hurried footsteps zeroing in to the food haven represented by the canteen on the ground floor. Wearing white shirts and khaki pants for boys and pinafores for girls, the uniformed students will break the morning silence with their footsteps and their constant chatter which will reach its peak after their stomachs are filled.\n\nThere will be some students who will stay behind in class, being detained by last minute work or those who prefer to skip recess. The majority, however, will form themselves in front of the food stalls they fancy on that day.\n\nThe most popular stall in the past was Auntie Alifah's. Her mixed rice dishes included favorites like the French fries and golden brown chicken wings. However, French fries has been banned on the orders of the School Health Board due to high calories and chicken wings limited to being sold two days in a week. The food at Auntie Alifah's is tasty and the students with hearty appetites gorge themselves on white rice smothered with brown soy sauce or curry gravy.\n\nUncle Ali's orange 'Mee Siam' and yellow 'Mee Rebus' noodle dishes also see patient queues of eager students in front of it. Pupils who order piping hot noodle soup dishes from his stall can be seen taking care to avoid spilling any drop of soup.\n\nRecently, there have been more healthy dishes introduced in the canteen. Brightly-coloured orange slices and dried pineapple snacks are displayed by the vendors, while yoghurt-based ice cream replaced the dairy ones.\n\nThe drinks stall is another popular point. We used to order fizzy drinks. However, recently, we have been encouraged to partake of healthy drinks like barley or fruit juices which are now often seen besides the brown malt drinks on the tables.\n\nGroups of students usually congregate in their favorite places. The boys will usually occupy the back of the canteen while the girls will sit on the front benches. An observer would note that the students would sit with their friends or class. Malay pupils and Indian students talk animatedly, partaking of their favorite ethnic dishes. This is the only time an observer will hear chatter in Mandarin, Tamil or Malay. For the rest of the day, the pupils converse mostly in Malay or English, as encouraged by the school.\n\nThe canteen is the noisiest spot in school at this time. Giggles and shrieks are occasionally heard from some lower secondary girls, while loud shouts can be heard from some exuberant boys. This is the only time when loud noises are tolerated. The senario is slightly quieter when the seniors move in for their food.\n\nThere will be lower secondary boys who will have very hurried snacks and then head for the cooling areas in our school to play some games. Some students are seen with their Chinese chess sets or international chess sets under the cool shady spots with tables and benches, competing against each other during the limited time allocated. Avid supporters are seen behind both sides cheering for their friends for making a brilliant move.\n\nGroups of chattering pupils will be seen lining the corridors outside their classes. This is a time when appointments and plans will be made for the hours after school. The chatter may also involve the latest developments in school.\n\nEagle-eyed prefects sporting smart red ties and supervised by the teacher on duty will be hovering around, keeping a watch on students who do not return their utensils to their bins.\n\nWhen the bell sounds for the end of the break, the lower secondary students will return reluctantly to their classes while the seniors are already descending on the canteen. The scenes will then be repeated again.\n\nThese are the sights and sounds at the midday break in my school and I will carry fond memories of these when I leave school."

It is an average neighborhood school and the students are mainly from the surrounding residential area.\nOn the first day of school, there is inevitably a traffic jam before the school opens its session at 7.30 a.m. Parents drive their cars near the school's main and side gates to drop off their children or attempt to get into the adjoining car park. Taxis are also seen as the school is situated some kilometers from the main road.\n\nThe air is still fresh at this time and the cries of birds and the early rays of warm sunshine signal the start of the new day. The older teenage students of the Form Three and Four classes can be distinguished by their taller frames and the fact that the boys sport long sleeves while the younger ones are dressed in short sleeves. Uniforms are white and a red tie is spotted once in a while, worn by prefects on duty.\n\nThe elder boys and girls can also be distinguished by their familiarity with the school. They do not have an air of nervousness, which the Form One boys and girls have, being in an unfamiliar and new environment. The seniors, however, look relaxed, considering this is the start of a new year. The older girls huddle in groups around shady corridors, while the boys are seen around the car porch. The girls are making small talk, gathering news and feedback on what is the latest in school or keeping up to date with what their friends did in the holidays. The older boys would be more inclined to discuss current affairs or the latest fad among them. Quite a few boys are casting glances at the shiny new cars which belong to some teachers.\n\nConfidence is also seen in the behavior of the Form Two students. In fact, some of the boys can be seen playing on the field, while some of the girls can be spotted playing tag along the corridors.\n\nIt is easy to spot the newcomers in school. The Secondary One boys and girls are gathered together with some parents in the canteen. You can tell from the anxious and curious looks on their faces that they are unfamiliar with the school. Most of these students are also carrying heavy school bags as they are uncertain about what to bring.\n\nThe canteen itself is stirring to life. Food stallholders are busy preparing ingredients to cook the food for the students when they have their midday break. The teachers are all gathering in the staff room, busily assembling their lesson materials or catching up with colleagues about what they did in the holidays. The office is a hive of activity and some anxious parents are waiting there to discuss admission matters with the heads of department.\n\nAt 8.30 a.m., the school bell rings. Promptly, the older students fall into place in neat rows and lines on the school quadrangle. Teachers stand behind the students. The new students are escorted to the hall on the first floor by some teachers and prefects.\n\nAt this time on the quadrangle, the sun is beating down. The principal mounts the podium, greets the teachers and pupils and turns around to face the flag post. Then the National Anthem is played and the flag of Malaysia is raised. Everyone sings the familiar strains of the song which they know by heart. After this, the vice-principal makes the announcements and reminds students to exert discipline and obey school rules. The assembly is then dismissed and the students file quietly to their respective classes. This signals the beginning of a new school year for the school."

        "content": "I am a seventeen-year-old boy studying for my A Level Examination at the end of this year. What can I count as my achievements so far? I think that in the materialistic society that my peers and I live in, we tend to imbibe the values of a rat race. Being students, we aspire to get good grades in order to secure comfortable jobs. I find studying no problem and have consistently scored As in my subjects. There was a year in which I topped my cohort in the final examinations.\nAnother achievement and memory I fondly retain is how I managed to foster a better relationship between my Mum and Dad. Dad is a successful businessman, but he is seldom at home. Mum is a bored housewife who often nags him to allow her to go out to work. Their frequent bickering depressed me and one day I poured out my grievances to them. I managed to convince Dad that Mum would be better off with a part-time job. He agreed and since then, their relationship has been better.\n\nHowever, the one achievement I am proudest of is my successful work in the local old folks' home. From young, I had been brought up by my grandparents. When they passed away, I cried bitterly. Since then, I have developed a fondness for elderly people, understanding their weaknesses and appreciating their good points.\n\nI participated in my school's Community Service Club when it was first set up. Our members made numerous trips to the local old folks' home. Pretty soon my enthusiasm and hard work led me to being unanimously elected as Chairman of the club.\n\nUnlike many of my fellow students, I do not do community work to earn points. I really love the work and feel I am doing something worthwhile. Hence, while some of my peers have stopped visiting the old folks' home, I indefatigably spend many satisfying weekend afternoons there. Many of my fellow students are put off by the smell of the home. It is a fact that some old people are bedridden and some are not particular about their personal. There is also a shortage of nurses and caregivers. Also, some of my friends complain that many old folks are grumpy and suspicious.\n\nThis is where I can contribute. I chat with the old folks, help them with their daily tasks and listen to their problems. They like to tell me of their glorious old days and their suffering during the Japanese Occupation in Malaysia. Initially, my attempts at helping them were regarded with suspicion. I cannot blame them as many of them do not like to be viewed as abandoned old people whom chattering students visit once a year.\n\nHowever, my sincerity and keenness to help won them over. I did not mind cutting their fingernails or changing adult diapers. Now, many of my elderly friends regard me as a friend or foster son, and I call them 'uncles' or 'aunties'.\n\nMy club organised a successful Christmas party last year. The able-bodied old folks took part in the concert. Many of them told me they looked forward to another party next year.\n\nHence, looking back at my achievements, I am very proud of my community work at the old folks' home. In the future, I hope to study social work in the university and work as a social worker as I find great satisfaction in helping the less fortunate."

Remember me?\" I momentarily hesitated as I tried to recollect whether I had made the cardinal sin of forgetting my client's name. Then the words, \"school chum\" rang a bell! Of course! It was the 'old' Ah Wah from secondary school days.\n\nI answered warmly, \"You old rascal, how have you been?\"\n\nThe upshot of our conversation was that I agreed to a meeting with Ah Wah and two other classmates whom I had not seen since graduating from our secondary school.\n\nBefore the get-together, I thought about my friends fondly. Ah Wah, the handsome boy in our class, would still retain his looks. Had he married our pretty class monitress, with whom he had an on-off relationship? And how about Morgen, the clever one who constantly topped our class. Was he already a doctor as he aspired to be? As for Ahmad, would he still be the happy-go-lucky guy who was constantly playing pranks?\n\nAt 1:45 p.m. on a Saturday, I strolled into the Raffles restaurant of the Crystal Crown Hotel. I thought I would be late for the lunch scheduled at 1.30 p.m. Work problems had held me up. But I was wrong. The waiter ushered me to an empty table reserved for our reunion.\n\nMorgen was next to arrive. I had a shock when I saw him. The last I saw of him, he was a scrawny teenager. Now standing before me was a man with a muscular physique. His face had not changed much, however. I quickly established that he was indeed a medical doctor practicing at General Hospital. The shy Morgen I once knew was now married to a nurse with a son to boot!\n\nWhile we were thus animatedly discussing our past and comparing the changes that had taken place in our lives, Ah Wah and Ahmad arrived together. There was much slapping on the backs and then we proceeded to lunch. Ah Wah had not aged much. His dashing looks were still there. And guess what? He was working as a manager in Crystal Crown Hotel itself. That was why he arranged the lunch there. We found out that Ah Wah was still eligible as his relationship with Janet had not worked out. Ahmad was the one who experienced the most changes. He was quite plump now and had a prominent belly. However, our main concern was that he had suffered from cancer which was now in remission. Time and sad events had mellowed him. His business had failed. Ahmad told us that he was very keen on his faith, and his demeanor was serious and not like the joker we knew of in the past.\n\nIn the course of our lunch, my friends also noted the change in me. I was now more sociable and they were astonished that the shy teenager they once knew was now a confident man. I also told the two bachelors (Ahmad and Ah Wah) that I was in a serious relationship. It was time, I hinted, that they should settle down.\n\nIt was a very nice lunch. We enjoyed reminiscing about the good old school days. Morgen, however, had to leave at 3 p.m. for a medical meeting. Before we parted, we promised to make the get-together an annual one."

        "content": "My bosom friend and classmate, Emily, came from a large extended family. She was of Chinese and Malay blood. People of such heritage are described as \"Baba\" or \"Peranakan.\" Theirs was a loving family. There were two married sons and two unmarried daughters. The sons, together with their wives and children, lived in a huge bungalow with their parents. The house was always alive and full of laughter. The family was also very traditional and had great respect for their ancestors.\nThe parents were greatly revered by all the other members of the family. The children were obedient and filial and never argued with their parents. They were a close-knit family in which members of the family who helped each other in times of difficulty.\n\nHowever, the family was also very particular about certain practices and superstitious beliefs prevailed. No members of the family could give each other sharp instruments like needles, knives or scissors. They believed that this would cause quarrels between the giver and the receiver. The family also instructed that nobody was allowed to sweep the house after sunset because this would cause family warmth and love to be swept out of the home.\n\nOn the eve of Lunar New Year, the children were not permitted to sleep until they had ushered in the new year at the stroke of midnight for the deities bestowed most blessings on those they met first. On the day a son got married, he and his spouse were each made to sweep a large orange into the threshold of the house. The oranges signified gold and prosperity and sweeping them in portended sweeping good fortune into the home. If any member of the family were to fall ill, there was to be no mention of death or hospitals for fear that these would attract the devil to claim the soul of the sick person.\n\nOne day, my family was invited to their home for dinner. During the course of the dinner, one of the grandchildren unwittingly rested her left hand on her plate. Immediately, her grandmother upbraided her. She told the child that she would never find food on her plate if she did that because the devil would say that her plate was not for food but for her hand.\n\nI had never encountered such a superstitious family, but this family appeared to be amiably united by these superstitions, both good and bad."

The second room is used by my brother and his wife. That leaves Grandma and me and we use the living room to sleep in at night. The house is very crowded, hot and stuffy. It lacks privacy and there is no place to keep my personal belongings which are stacked on a shelf in a corner of the living room and hidden from sight by an old curtain.\nIn my dreams, I long for a larger house. It would be spacious enough with rooms for everyone - a bedroom for my parents, one for Grandma and my little sister to share, one for my brother and his wife if they are still living at home and of course a room for myself. There would be large airy curtained windows in all the rooms and these will have enough storage space for clothes and personal effects. My room would have a desk and chair to house my computer where I can work from and shelves for all my books, hi-fi system and a glass cabinet to display my memorabilia.\n\nThere will be a family room large enough for all of us to relax in. It will have comfortable velvet sofas and cushions and a large flat-screen television for our entertainment. I will make sure that there is adequate lighting to sit and read in comfort. My dream home would also have a living room where guests would be entertained in. It would also have a modest dining room where meals are served.\n\nThe rooms would have high ceilings so that air through the open windows circulates freely to keep the rooms cool. The house would be tastefully decorated with minimal but eclectic furniture, table decorations and wall mountings to give it a feel of openness and space. All the walls will be painted a light, bright neutral colour. The floors would be tiled with cream marble tiles in the living room and wood parquet flooring for the bedrooms. This would make cleaning and sweeping simple and easy. The kitchen would be practically fitted out to allow economy of movement when preparing or cooking a meal.\n\nThere will be adequate toilets and bathroom facilities for everyone and will be safe for my Grandma to manage independently. The floors will have a non-slip surface to prevent any accidents with grab rails fixed on the walls for use if needed.\n\nMy dream house would have either a small garden where we can sit out in the cool evenings under a shaded umbrella or tree and listen to the birds singing in the garden. Otherwise, I would like to have a balcony where I can enjoy the views across the skyline. I would spend evenings sitting in a swing chair and grow flowering and foliage plants in pots.\n\nThis would be the house that I would like to live in."

People have keen and discerning taste and appetite for good food and the popularity of a stall is spread by word of mouth. In my housing estate, one stall has received this status.\nRecently, the food centre was renovated and is now a bright and airy place with quite a large number of stalls. There is a good variety of food that caters to all palates such as Chinese noodles, chicken rice and duck rice, cakes and snacks and Indian food like 'roti canai', saffron rice with curry as well as Malay food such as 'nasi lemak' (coconut rice) and 'satay' (meat kebabs). There are also stalls selling hot and cold drinks, desserts and fruit juices. The food centre is very crowded especially in the mornings and during lunchtime and also at the weekends. Some people come to buy their breakfast, lunch or snacks to take into the offices, while others sit at the tables to eat.\n\nThis one particular stall selling snacks is very popular. It is owned by two women who do a roaring trade selling deep-fried local snacks. They are there very early in the morning kneading, rolling, cutting and deep frying the shaped dough sticks, spring rolls, battered yams, red bean cakes, tapioca, bananas and sweet potatoes. The fried dough stick is very light and moist and the batter in which the pieces of yams and potatoes are dipped in makes the cakes crispy and tasty. Two young assistants, a lad and a young girl, assist them to take orders, bag the food for their customers or serve those at tables. Queues of people wait eagerly to be served daily.\n\nA framed certificate at the front of the stall states that the stallholder was recently awarded a certificate of excellence for good food by a food critic. The stall always looks clean and hygienic. Random checks are made by inspectors from the Ministry of Health to monitor and ensure that hygiene standards are maintained.\n\nOne Saturday, Mother and I had our breakfast there. As it was a weekend, the stall was busy and there was a long queue formed when we arrived. It took the better part of an hour for our food to arrive at our table. We had ordered some fried red bean cakes and Mother had spring rolls served with chili sauce. The food arrived fresh and hot off the pan and was delicious. It cost us RM10 and was well worth the wait as we both enjoyed our breakfast.\n\nWhen we were finished and ready to leave, I noticed that the queue up to the stall was still just as long. I understood why it had received an accolade for food excellence.\n\nIt is an asset and convenience to have food centers easily accessible catering to everyone's dietary needs as we live such busy lives and may not always have time to cook our meals. I know that it helps my mother at times when she is busy or unwell and is unable to prepare a meal for us at home."

        "content": "There is an old saying that goes, \"Never judge a book by its cover\". It is a lesson that not many heed since we are all prone to passing judgment on others based on what we see. However, after I came to know of a certain security guard, I now whole-heartedly agree with those who say that a book's cover may not always reveal the book's worth. Sometimes, the truth is very far from what you might see with your eyes.\nThe security guard in question is an old man, around fifty years of age, who works for a factory down the street. From what I have seen, he appears to have a family of two children and a wife, and they visit him regularly, about three or four nights a week. Their attire is old and shabby, and their meals are always simple. He sleeps for a few hours in the afternoon and always leaves his workplace in the early hours of the day. I was told that he works elsewhere during the day, and comes back to his usual workplace for a short while after lunchtime.\n\nThere are places which distribute food to the poor on certain days of the week, and the security guard regularly has his lunches at these places whenever possible. He makes it a habit to bring home some of the food for his dinner. Other days, he can be seen cooking his meals after sunset by a small stove in a small area. An old and rusty bicycle serves as his primary mode of transport, and he can be seen riding it from shop to shop, selling bundles of newspaper for a few cents. At night, he has regular visitors - rough, loudmouthed friends who cause a rumpus, and stay with him until the small hours of the morning. At a glance, he seems like a poor, sad and pitiable man, doing his best to survive despite the odds. I thought so too at first until I found out more from my friend.\n\nIt turns out that this security guard is actually a money-lender, and a nasty one at that. He took the job of security guard at this place because many of his debtors work at the factory, and he finds it in his best interest to keep tabs on each of them personally. His debtors pay monthly instalments at the end of each month and this way, they have no chance of escaping, given his position as security guard. As a money-lender, he has adopted the tactics of a loan shark, charging very high interest rates to those who borrow money. The loud and rowdy friends that visit him at night are actually his assistants who go over to deliver updates as well as money. I was also told that the security guard has made many a house wife and children miserable through his horrible ways. Some have even been known to cry and plead on bended knees for more time to repay their debts.\n\nSince then, I have a very different impression of him as one who takes advantage of the misfortunes of others, acting very much like the vultures which feed on the carcasses of dead animals. My sad conclusion of such people is that they are completely despicable and are void of both conscience and morals, and only add to the woes of those already troubled."

        "content": "The usual comments that we hear of society today are tongue-lashings at its encouragement of the twin evils, selfishness and greed. All around us, we hear of the degeneration of society with children committing heinous crimes and families falling apart. But is this a fair judgment? After all, to say that there is nothing positive about people today seems rather extreme. I will attempt to show that although the assertion in the question has some validity, it cannot possibly be accepted as the whole picture.\nOne cannot deny that people today are less likely to want to reach out to others in amity and goodwill. Stories about how, for example, in Malaysia, urban dwellers are today more likely to shut their doors against their neighbors in times of trouble have long been in circulation. Many neighborhoods live in fear of covetous people and hence, prefer the measure of self-preservation over community help. Yet, this cannot be seen solely as selfishness, but rather, a desperate attempt to safeguard their lives against the increasingly violent society. In America, even a family fast food joint like McDonald's had become the scene for more than a few shootings by angry and warped civilians. Can you really blame these people for barricading themselves?\n\nEven in hallowed learning institutions like the universities, selfishness has played a major part in creating tension. A good example is the local university where recommended books for subjects have been known to have crucial pages torn out to prevent others from sharing the same knowledge. This sense of extreme selfishness can be pinned squarely on the `rat race', that is, the competition to get the best paper qualifications so as to get a better head start in their career. Due to the fact that there is no balance achieved through a focus on the effective inculcation of moral values and ethics, many graduates come into the working world with loads of practical money-making ideas but few scruples. Their concern is merely to make more and more money. This is the sad reality about many people today.\n\nBut one cannot deny that the world has also seen some examples of goodness in the recent years. When the plight of a foreign worker who had been dumped in a drain by his heartless employer and left to die was reported extensively in the Malaysian newspapers, many people came forward to offer comfort, encouragement and material gifts. Although he was consequently paralyzed, the Bangladeshi national never stopped highlighting his gratitude for the people's concern and willingness to help a stranger. Such acts of kindness have been beacons of hope in a rapidly callous world. There are acts of goodness still.\n\nThus, to say that people today are selfish and greedy is a sweeping statement that cannot be applied to everyone everywhere."

        "content": "The usual perception of a worker is that of a person who is harassed by the need to make a living. His motivation for work is more a matter of necessity than interest. This is further corroborated by the media displaying pictures of workers at the busy commercial hub of Kuala Lumpur, usually taciturn and in a hurry. However, this may not be the complete picture of a worker in Malaysia.\nIt is without doubt that everyone enjoys his or her leisure. After all, if you are constantly pressurised every day working at a stressful job from nine to five, leisure in the form of a relaxing dinner, a game of squash or tennis, or even a karaoke session can be truly welcoming. Leisure allows one to reduce the pressure experienced when one is inundated with deadlines and endless projects. Thus, unwinding after a hard day's work would definitely be appreciated and greatly enjoyed.\n\nFurthermore, leisure is always a social event, allowing friends and relatives alike to gather together for recreation. Such time spent not only allows you to keep in touch with the important people in your life, but it also reaffirms ties that are crucial to maintaining satisfying relationships. Self-esteem is then boosted when you feel the warmth and love encircling you at such gatherings.\n\nEven if you do not do anything really sociable, preferring instead to read a good book or do some handiwork, it is still a change from the monotony of working life. That in itself is a welcome change from the hassle of balancing work schedules and adapting to the different temperaments of colleagues. Thus, it is definitely true that we do enjoy our leisure. However, it is not true to say that we do not enjoy our work.\n\nAfter all, there are people who go into job areas of their personal interest. This could range from the exciting like scuba diving to the conventional like banking. Thus, people could very well enjoy their work because they have chosen to pursue their interests as working adults. A sporting enthusiast could go into the promotion of sports in a state or country and truly enjoy doing it as a job.\n\nFurthermore, work also involves group dynamics. Thus, if you have built up good relationships with your colleagues, it is akin to having social gatherings with friends and family. In fact, many people have formed lasting relationships with colleagues who go on to become strong family friends. Thus, work is not necessarily not enjoyable.\n\nWork can be enjoyable because it gives one a sense of achievement. At work, we are constantly challenged to perform our best, and to overcome that is in itself a wonderful feeling of accomplishment. Thus, it is certainly not wholly accurate to say that we do not enjoy our work, only our leisure. In fact, it is a fact of life that human beings are extremely resilient and flexible and thus will find enjoyment in what they do, be it work or leisure."

        "content": "It is not unusual to hear of millionaire sportsmen who are raking in the dollars with endorsement contracts. Even before they have truly proven their worth, sportsmen deemed to be endowed with potential are already signing contracts involving large sums of money. Today, the value of a sportsman is less likely to be measured by performance than his contractual amount.\nOf course, one cannot underestimate the lure of money. Sports have become careers instead of just interests as they were in the past. Sportsmen employ agents who work out deals with sponsors as well as the clubs to ensure that they are well paid for their performances. In fact, each superlative performance seems to fuel speculation over whether the salary paid out in the existing contract will be increased by the club to keep the sportsman in its fold. It is not unusual to hear of sportsmen who refuse to renew their contracts until they get more money and perks. Thus, sports appear to have become a big business in which money does call the shots.\n\nFurthermore, the use of performance-enhancing drugs and match-fixing in the world of sports are increasingly reported. This could be due to the fact that a gold medal in an international sporting event is a guarantee of wealth since sponsorship and advertising deals are always worked out with the winners. To win at all costs thus becomes an obsession. Even in regional tournaments like the Malaysia Cup, match-fixing was rampant as players take bribes from bookies to lose games. As a result, the real thrill of sports is lost since results are predetermined by the bookies. This bodes ill for the sport as it means that sports lovers would be disgusted.\n\nHowever, not all sportsmen are guilty of such things. There are sportsmen who desire more than just the extrinsic rewards. The recognition that comes with a gold medal is certainly more rewarding than money. Sports are challenges that the best sportsmen hope to conquer. In certain countries, you hear of ardent sportsmen who take on lower-paying jobs in order to pursue their game. Many a time, representing the country in international tournaments means taking one's own leave from work and even paying for own expenses. These people are doing it not for money but the game itself.\n\nTo the real sportsman, the reward of monetary gain is only secondary to the sense of achievement. They challenge themselves to push the boundaries of their ability so as to maximize their potential. It is unfortunate that in the age of television, viewership concerns have resulted in the `marketing' of sports to promote products. Money has become an inevitable part of sports, but the issue remains whether its motivation is of primary or secondary importance."

        "content": "Choice has become the catchphrase of a generation reared on the rallying cry of democracy and freedom. As such, the common perception today is that the individual must be allowed to develop his potential and interest in all areas in order for him to truly become a whole person. But is this choice something that should be encouraged in the area of school education?\nChoice in school subjects and activities is good because it allows students to explore and expand personal interests and strengths. In education systems like the ones in Asia which have been attacked as producing students only to plug the gaps in the economy, allowing to select their areas of interest can plant the seeds for a more diverse and vibrant society where different abilities are encouraged. This will give each person the sense of esteem that comes from having his capabilities and interests recognised rather than being forced to conform to a prescriptive education.\n\nFurthermore, allowing students to choose a few subjects or activities to specialise in can foster depth in knowledge rather than breadth. Thus, students will be masters in their chosen areas of study or activities rather than merely possessing superficial knowledge of a wide range of subjects. A student of the latter type could end up knowing \"an infinite deal of nothing\". A student who has to choose his subjects and activities is made to go through the process of studying each choice carefully and evaluating his own needs and interest. Thus, he has to learn how to make informed choices, as well as to take the responsibility for his choice, whether flawed or otherwise. This is something that every child has to learn if he is to be a success in his own right.\n\nHowever, a broad-based education with grounding in a wide repertoire of subjects may not be a bad thing. After all, it will ensure that each child has a taste of each subject, allowing him to fully understand his own talents. If he has no real idea of what each subject is about, he may develop an opinion of each based merely on peer influence or hearsay. This is not healthy at all. Furthermore, if he does only a few subjects or immerses himself in a few activities, he may not be able to handle real problems and challenges in the world which are, more often than not, interdisciplinary and multifaceted.\n\nAlso, subjects that are compulsory at the early stage of education allow the child to discover his real abilities. Activities that are compulsory for all students will also expose them to a wider range of experiences that will enrich them. In their later school years, there should be choices made available in both areas as by then they will be able to choose wisely.\n\nHence, it is not a case of either choosing to make all school subjects and activities compulsory or that all should be given up to the students' free choice. The school should undertake to expose students to a range of subjects and experiences by subjecting them to the full repertoire of school life before allowing them to specialise later on when they are more mature. This will ensure a good balance in their education."

        "content": "Today, most people equate a job with the material comforts that it would bring rather than the satisfaction. It does appear that most people would look for a job that pays well, even if it means sacrificing your interests in the process. Just how important is it to enjoy your job?\nIf one enjoys one's work, doing your best in it is no longer a tedious task that requires backbreaking effort. In such a situation, there will always be the motivation to go to work and enjoy what there is to do. Take the example of a marine enthusiast who has a job in the Underwater World. Going to work with the marine life would be the draw itself. Thus, one will be keen on one's job rather than be a clockwatcher all the time in a job that does not appeal. Even if one is paid very well, it will be the money at the end of the month that one enjoys, rather than the work. In such a situation, one looks forward to only one day in a month, rather than every day.\n\nBut the reality of life is that money does make the world go round. How can one truly have a good life when one is constantly worrying over unpaid bills? It is important to enjoy work, but not at the expense of making a living. Only when one's basic necessities are met can one truly look to the other aspects of life. In most cases, enjoying your job is a luxury open to only a select few. For the rest of us, it is the money that counts more.\n\nFurthermore, earning a lot of money allows one to enjoy life outside of the job. The woes and joys of life are then well balanced since the job that you do not enjoy is giving you the chance to enjoy your leisure. For many of us, this is a good trade-off. So one only works at a mundane or highly unenjoyable job for the sake of making a living, and then goes off to relax after work or during the weekends. This is also an acceptable state of affairs since most people do not equate a job with enjoyment.\n\nIf one enjoys one's job, then it is not work at all. The line between leisure and work could be blurred as a result. Such a situation may not be positive as it means that there are no clear demarcations in terms of time allocation. On the other hand, keeping work and play separate allows for one to leave either of the two behind when necessary so that one will not bring the stress of one into the other.\n\nYet, it must be noted that the best compromise is to find a job that pays comfortably rather than too much and is not detested by you. As such, you can grow to like your job (not necessarily enjoy it) and still be able to live well. This will be a happy situation indeed!"

        "content": "War is by no means a stranger to us, even if we have not had the tragedy of having to live through it. Whether in movies or real-life accounts of war experiences, we are well exposed to the horrors of human crimes, sufferings and destruction. Many feel that such depictions are usually sensationalized in order to get an audience, but in my opinion, war can never be as cruel as they are shown via third-person accounts. In fact, it is worse.\nThe tremendous suffering that results from war is unimaginable. Innocent civilians are maimed or killed, while the soldiers face irreparable physical and mental damage even years after. A recent news article revealed that the effects of Agent Orange used in the Vietnam War more than twenty years ago are today still felt by the young children with enormous heads swollen from the inhalation of the gas. The kind of destructive rampage that soldiers, excited by blood lust, inflicted on the people during the infamous Nanjing Massacre is testimony to how much suffering is unleashed during wars. How then can war ever be justified?\n\nFurthermore, everything around us suffers when there is a war. In Kuwait, the Gulf War might have liberated them from the invasion of Iraq, but the damage done to the environment and economy took months to subside. When the Iraqis set fire to the oilfields in an attempt to create difficult conditions for the Allied forces to maneuver safely in, they also inadvertently created one of the worst ecological disasters of the century. Thousands of wildlife died from the pollution of their habitats and the air remained black and foul for many months thereafter. Kuwait had to struggle to rebuild its economy from scratch. Once an affluent country it was barely able to support its people.\n\nIn a war, there are no winners. How then can one say that it is justified since it does nothing but condones violence in trying to solve the problems? The amount of resources and lives that are lost by both sides does not convince anyone that it is good to have war. During the World Wars, both victors and losers spent years trying to recover from the devastation. This could have been avoided if other peaceful means had been employed to forestall the problem instead of letting it balloon to a stage where nothing else save war will do.\n\nThe only justification for going to war is to defend one's liberty. The very basic right of every human being is the right to freedom. If that is taken away from any me, all else pales in comparison. When one is enslaved by another country's tyranny, the primal urge to free oneself and survive is understandable. Only in such a case, when one is truly threatened, should war ever be a consideration.\n\nYet, what is the price of freedom if so much is destroyed in the process? In the same way what is life if one has to live in shame and slavery? It is an unfortunate fact of modern living that this is a Gordian knot that has yet to be untied."

        "content": "In examining this statement, one must clarify the word 'important'. What is this importance? In which area is importance most necessary? Are grandparents important in these areas? ('Importance' is clarified here as 'significance'.)\nIn this harsh world, where everyone has to work for a living to survive, provision of material wants is important to keep up with the daily cost of living. This is especially so for parents with kids.\n\nYoung people may chafe at the restrictions of authority and feel that the powers in control of their daily life do not understand their problems and needs. But when they mature as adults (physically, morally and emotionally), they realise the tasks of society's leaders are to provide them with secure jobs, to ensure a decent standard of living and to meet their aspirations. An orderly and peaceful society with honest leaders will be what they will appreciate to deliver the goods.\n\nIn this light, grandparents do not fulfil the bill of providing this political and business leadership. Most of them will be retired and do not hold full-time jobs. Therefore, they will not be important in this critical area (the exception will be those who are still working as important leaders).\n\nParents are, however, important people in society. They are the economic providers of their family. This is especially so for fathers who are usually the breadwinners. However, nowadays, with the increasing cost of living, mothers find they have to work to supplement the household income to pay the monthly bills. In this sense, their role may be even more important than the fathers as they are also household keepers.\n\nFathers usually do not do the housework. Many mothers without maids have the thankless task of doing household chores like cleaning and cooking for the family. Often, it is she who is the main source of inspiration for the children. A mother is usually more accessible to the children. She provides earthly advice and the much needed emotional support. It is usually mothers who look into the nitty-gritty of their children's education and welfare.\n\nThis is not to deny the role of fathers. Many fathers too are transmitters of good values and help guide their children' s lives. However, in this fast-paced society and a host of rising expectations, fathers are often caught in the rat race and may have less time for the family.\n\nThis is where grandparents come in to fulfil a vital role. Very often, they have already retired and are in their golden years. Their children have all grown up. \\Kith time to spare, they are the ideal people to fulfil the role of caregivers and moral advisors to their grandchildren.\n\nMany parents bemoan the fact that maids do not provide the ideal form of guidance for their children. However, they themselves have little time at the end of a long working day to provide the much needed interaction with their own children. This is especially so on weekdays.\n\nGrandparents take on the nurturing role which many parents are sorely lacking in providing. They have the time to provide a listening ear to the children, fetch them to and from school, ensure that they have proper nutrition and rest, and help cultivate good habits.\n\nIt is the area of transmission of moral values that grandparents are especially important. They have gone through the hardships of life and are wiser. Being benign authority figures whom the grandchildren are familiar with, their advice will be more readily accepted by the children.\n\nI remember particular occasions when I saw grandparents lovingly bring out their grandchildren for meals or outings. I remember clearly the love, care and consideration for their charges which maids often fail to provide. Hence, grandparents fulfil this important role in bringing up a generation of healthy and responsible kids.\n\nGrandparents play an important role in society, especially in certain areas. But to say that they are the most important people in society is to deny the role of the parents, politicians, business leaders and other important figures in society. Hence, the statement cannot hold."

        "content": "Man is one among many types of life forms living on this planet. Since the first man arrived on this sphere, he has adapted and used his intelligence to prosper and increase in numbers. Today, he is the dominant species on Earth. One trait that distinguishes Man from animals is his curiosity. In this essay, we are concerned about his interest in new places, fueled by his exploratory urge.\nTo a certain extent, the Earth has been explored thoroughly. Mountains, oceans, deserts, rivers, forests - these are habitats Man has launched expeditions to satisfy his curiosity about and to achieve certain aims.\n\nMount Everest was scaled to satisfy Man's ego to reach the highest mountain just as attempting to cross the Sahara desert or the North Pole was a landmark to Man's resourcefulness, determination and bravery. Natural scientists explored the Amazon forests or Galapagos islands. Colonial powers like Portugal, England and Spain went to India, America or China to trade, see glory, proselytise their religions or simply to conquer new lands. In this way, colonies were created and empires like the British or French ones were established. Whole countries like the United States were formed by Man's need for dominion (the Whites subjugated the Red Indians) and the need for new lands for settlers.\n\nMan has so thoroughly explored and mapped this planet that it seems he has practically covered every inch of this place. But this is not so. There is that part of a forest, ocean, river or desert ever waiting to be explored. However, we can safely say that almost every inhabitable part of Earth is now his. This is understandable when we consider his need for arable land to feed an ever increasing population.\n\nSo where does he go from here? The answer is the expanse above his head, the skies above or what is called space. Of course, there are those who say that he can explore what lies beneath the Earth, but the exploratory expeditions and studies made have convinced many that the land below is mostly inhospitable, made of hot rocks, soil, gases and lava. The space above seems to beckon more invitingly and has a more glamorous allure.\n\nSpace has always challenged Man's curiosity. It is not only the discovery of the planets in orbit but unknown worlds also beckon. Are there other planets out there? Is there life in space? Can Man solve the problems of his increasing population by investigating possible inhabitable colonies? Also, scientific investigations like those into gravity or the study of organisms are also possible in space.\n\nThe Cold War between America and Russia in the 1960s was not only a race for military supremacy. There was national pride involved as each nation tried to be the first to land a man on the Moon. Apollo's mission by landing the first man on the Moon in 1969 climaxed the struggle and was sweet victory for the Americans. The easing of the Cold War with financial constraints have led to drop in space travel for strategic and scientific purposes.\n\nYet, space holds much promise for Man. Planetary probes and cameras recently have found that the planet, Mars, contains evidence of water, raising the hopes of existence of life there. Space stations where Man can live and work while orbiting for long periods like what the Russians did, raises the possibility of Man living in space. The need becomes more urgent as increasingly, more areas of Earth become uninhabitable because of pollution and desertification.\n\nIn space, telecommunications satellites generate business benefits and military and weather satellites are of great importance to nations. Space laboratories may yield important scientific benefits. And there is the ultimate dream of many scientists: Can they find aliens in space?\n\nSpace beckons and the possibilities are endless. Man has almost literally explored his planet and space is the only option left to explore. It is also the most exciting!"

        "title": "Entertainers and sports stars have the right to be paid huge sums of money for their work and performances. What are your views ?",
        "content": "The public needs entertainment. This is without a doubt and is a fact. It needs entertainment daily especially when work becomes more difficult and people's lives become harder, more harried and stressful with the daily battle for survival. Entertainers in the form of singers, musicians, film stars and sports superheroes supply this entertainment. However, fans and followers of sports and other forms of entertainment are increasingly demanding and sophisticated in their requirements for entertainment. The stars who are able to command their fan's loyalty and following will therefore command higher fees than entertainers who cannot pull in the numbers.\nIt is a fact of life that the market rules in deciding how much a product is worth. Entertainers who have better skills or talents will be paid more by their employers.\n\nLet us take the case of the famous basketball legend, Michael Jordan. He was not only a good shooter, but he was also a man of many talents. He was also a charismatic entertainer. In many cases, his presence on the court ensured the success of the team he played for. This was the reason for the Chicago Bulls' successes in the NBA Championship. Jordan was not only a rare sports talent but he also had a respectable public image. He not only ensured a large following in America by his mere presence, but he also had legions of fans abroad. The NBA show was telecast to many countries. Jordan's image as a famous sports personality could be used to market numerous consumer products. Despite Jordan commanding hefty fees for his match appearances, he made substantial profits for his management. Even though he was paid excessively (in the opinion of some critics), he ensured prosperity for his backers.\n\nThe same thing could be said of David Beckham, the famous football player from Manchester United Club who later switched to Real Madrid. He had to be paid millions of pounds to renew his contract. However, Beckham with his famous bending kick ensured revenues for his club and attracted scores of screaming fans. In Japan, he is the most recognisable figure on consumer advertisements and people are even willing to pay to sleep in the rooms he last occupied in the hotels he stayed in.\n\nTherefore, fan base and skills are used by agents to justify the fees they pay to famous sports figures. Some can be leading sports figures in their countries but only a few can be sports heroes. The same arguments can be used to justify the astronomical sums paid to leading public entertainers like famous musicians, film stars and singers.\n\nMadonna, the pop singer, sells millions of records worldwide. However, she fares less well when she acts. Her fees are substantially higher as a singer than as an actress. Pavarotti, the famous tenor and his fellow singers like Dominigo can command sell-out performances when they tour globally. Hence, their concerts can command high ticket prices and fans are prepared to queue up and pay for these tickets. Some cast members of 'Friends' (the hit American show which is syndicated globally) were paid five-figure sums per episode.\n\nThe arguments against the payments of these stars are that the sums are too uncomfortably excessive. Paying excessive sums to these stars increases the costs of their performance. Even some football stars like David Beckham admit that they are overpaid excessively. The salary of Leonardo Di Caprio, who starred in the hit film `Titanic' increased after it attained cult status. Hence, high ticket prices may have to be borne by the average cinema goer to view their performance. Producers may think twice before hiring such stars who require superstar salaries, and there may be fewer performances from them, a\nloss to the public.\n\nAgain, the sums paid to these people seem astronomical compared to the paltry wages of poor workers in the world. A night's performance earned by a superstar may be a lifetime income to the poor. \"Where is the fairness?\", critics will ask regarding these excessive fees.\n\nSome shows, like television shows and sports matches, may not be held if superstars do not obtain the fees they demand. However, I am glad that a move has been made to water down the increasing tendency to raise fees of star performers in order to obtain their services. The recent global recession has also lowered the high fees. My view is that superstars should command more but not the excessive amounts they are paid presently."

        "content": "On the surface, a kind observer would agree with the statement. Who, among us, would not want to enjoy the freedom and independence to move about? Why should we deprive animals and birds of this right too?\nThe author had kept some pet birds in the past. Gradually, he became fond of these kissing budgies. However, he realised that the creatures he loved had wings and were meant to fly and soar into the vast expanse of space. Just as he would be happy exploring the world and not be confined to a box, his pets were not meant to be imprisoned in a cage. If he loved them and wanted them to be happy, he had to release them. His heart was lighter after he set them free and he knew he done the right thing. He has not kept any birds ever since.\n\nRecently, he also went on a trip to Pattaya in Thailand. While he was there, he saw a chained elephant pacing up and down dully and fretfully. It was sad to see such a magnificent, fully grown creature with its long beautiful white tusks in captivity. Though it was kept there after a walking trip with tourists, he really pitied it as it had lost its freedom and independence.\n\nHowever, there are some instances when animals need to be kept in cages. We have to acknowledge that animals provide food. Animas are raised for their meat. As a source of protein and fat, they supply Man's nutritional needs. Not all men can be vegetarian. The breeding of cows in cowsheds for milk and fowl in cages is a necessary evil especially where increasingly, farming land is getter scarcer.\n\nAgain, some animals are kept as pets. Dogs may have their ancestry in the wild wolf, but they have been domesticated. Even the fierce Alsation police dog has lost much of its aggressive instincts. Pet animals like dogs, rabbits and cats and their progeny are used to a life under the care of their masters. In return for their companionship and affection, they lead a sheltered life with meals provided. In this case, the author does not see much cruelty for these animals to be kept in cages at times when their masters are not with them.\n\nA recent article in the Straits Times touches on this topic stating that animal lovers and birdwatchers are always eager to jump on the ethics of confining birds in cages and breeding them for mass markets. It quoted Dr Quek, an animal expert and breeder, as saying, \"It is true that wild birds should never be caged. But the birds bred by humans are a different matter.\" A tame parrot released into the wild would find it difficult to survive in a hostile environment. Scientists are constantly researching on ways to improve Man's health. Animals are quite akin to Man in their biological make-up. Therefore, rats, hamsters or frogs may be confined in containers for experiments. For this use, the author feels that it is a necessary evil.\n\nMan has destroyed a great part of his environment like forests for his own use. In the process, some wild animals like lions, snakes and birds may have their environment threatened. They may find it hard to survive after losing their natural habitats. In these cases, the author feels that if a wild animal like a lion is left to roam and threaten mankind, it should be kept in zoos not only for public education but also for its own survival. Also, certain birds like the hornbill and animals like the polar bears are now propagating their own kind in animal enclosures. Left on their own, these species may become extinct under the predatory actions of poachers.\n\nSumming up, I feel that wherever possible, living creatures should not be confined by Man but left to their freedom. The exceptions are the examples I have outlined."

        "title": "To what extent are young people influenced by what they view on television and in films ? Discuss",
        "content": "The young can be defined as those who are below 21 which is the official age of adulthood. This is a diverse group of pre-schoolers, students between primary and secondary schooling age or young people working on a part or full-time basis. We must also be reminded that the young are from different cultures and nations.\nAs for influences, there are various sources and television and films are only two sources of influence from the media. Parents, the government and faith also influence a young person's lifestyle on what he thinks, believes and how he eats, dresses or spends his money and time. A vast majority of the world's youngsters are poor. Many are working part-time to supplement their family incomes. For those who can go to school, educational workloads consume a major part of their time. Hence, there is limited time for leisure.\n\nWhatever free time they have, today's young are spending more time with their peers. Many studies have shown that the main influence on young people are their peers. This is especially so with the trend towards smaller families and parents being more busy with their working lives. For kids, parents and siblings or teachers may be pivotal influences. For those who can afford it, music, handphones and computers are increasingly engaging their attention.\n\nWhat influences a person of his values and behavior is also dependent on how he is educated by his family, school, religious institution or nation. Therefore, though the media is a powerful influence on a young person's life, it is just one of the influences. The Columbine Massacre in America where a teenager shot his peers, the September 11 tragedy showing the evil acts of terrorists and other newsworthy events shape a young person's perceptions of life. These were reported by the media: newspapers, radio, television, film. The latter two are only some of the influences on people. That said and done, even the limited time teenagers view films in cinemas or on recorders, can have an influence on them. The film 'Titanic' was a hit among youths worldwide and made the leading stars film idols. Madonna, the pop star, influences young people in her music videos. Her dress sense is keenly noted.\n\nDifferent nations have different television programs. However, young people all over the world like music, action or love dramas. The kids love the characters in cartoons like `Finding Nemo' or 'Ninja Turtles'. Very few young children have not seen cartoons or educational films like 'Sesame Street'. These have positive and negative values. Whatever it is, a western reality series like `Survivor', a Chinese kung fu epic, Bollywood musical or Korean dramas, youngsters like adults, will tune in and be influenced by their favorite programs.\n\nThus, the tastes of many young people are guided by what is 'cool' or popular in the group they belong to. What to wear, where to meet and how to spend their time is dictated by their peers. Tastes are influenced by the media, schools and the Internet but it is up to the group to adopt them. If teens find a certain fad `hot' or a pop idol `in', this will ensure their allegiance. It is also evident that the young have adopted smart phones and jeans as necessities. This is irrespective of whether they are rich or poor.\n\nThe young who view films or television programs may be influenced by the increasing violence or liberal values found in them but many also recognize and are aware that these programs belong to a world of make-believe.\n\nIn conclusion, young people have less time for films or television. There are many other factors that compete and demand for a slice of their time. Television and films are significant influences, but they are among other influences affecting their lives. Therefore, what they see on television and films only influences them to a certain extent."

        "title": "Both parents should continue working even if their children are very young. What are your views ?",
        "content": "To answer this statement requires a consideration of various factors. Let us examine them. Firstly, the statement implies that there is more than one young child. Children, when young, are very dependent on their caregivers, not only for their physical but also their emotional needs. Ideally, the mother should provide this nurturing role. Looking after the children from young would establish a bond between the mother and her young, something which cannot be replaced. She will be there to share the child's first attempt at walking, to comfort him when he cries or to laugh with him.\nIt has also been proven by child experts that a child's early years are those in which he can easily learn new knowledge and skills. That is why some parents talk to their unborn children when they are still in their mother's wombs or send them to some hothouse environment like education programs where they are taught language, mathematical or musical skills at a tender age. If the mother is an educated woman, she is best placed to educate her own children.\n\nOf course, all these are based on the presumption that the father is not interested in giving up his work to look after his children. There is, however, a minority of men who are interested in being househusbands and who show a liking for childcare like feeding, bathing or changing their children's diapers. If the family can afford the father not to work, there should be no objection to the husband being the 'house minder' in the family.\n\nHowever, it is usually assumed by society that the mother is the one who looks after the children if she wants to be the 'house minder'. There are increasing numbers of highly educated women who earn considerable income and have good career paths, but may not be prepared to forgo the glamour of such work to become involved in domestic issues, or being a housewife.\n\nIn considering whether both parents should go to work, much depends on the financial commitments of the family. Couples will calculate what their properties are. If the family is burdened with the expenses of maintaining a car, servicing a house mortgage, or providing for elderly parents, both husband and wife may decide to have a dual income by working to provide for family expenses and to keep up an expected standard of living.\n\nIf one is to consider whether the mother should work, the factor of childcare comes in. Does the state subsidize childcare well and have a system of good childcare centers so that the children are looked after while the mother is working? In this respect, an employer's support for the working mother is also significant for a mother to consider working.\n\nIf the mother's income from working is barely enough to cover the expense of fostering out her children to childminders, then she would seriously consider staying at home instead. Again, the question of alternative sources of childcare arises if the mother were to consider going out to work. If she has parents or relatives who would love to look after her children, she may decide to go out to work.\n\nMany parents are aware of the disadvantages of having nannies or maids to look after their children. These childminders are not looking after their own children and thus they may not show the love and concern of mothers. Again, some maids may be preoccupied with domestic chores so the children are neglected. These children are often `planted' in front of the television set to keep them occupied and entertained.\n\nTherefore, as to whether both parents should go to work when their children are very young, is dependent on many factors and the parents themselves have to make the decision carefully for the sake of their children and the welfare of their family."

        "content": "As we progress and advance in a very demanding world, there is a need for new laws, rules and regulations in small and large environments. Without these new controlling institutions, life would probably be far more difficult and people will do what they like whenever they please.\nThere are rules and regulations everywhere. In schools and institutions of learning, the young have to observe the rules instituted. Likewise, in the workplace, employees and employers have to abide by the regulations of employment. At social and family gatherings too, there are unwritten rules of behaviour to comply with. In our homes, parents make house rules for the children such as the time we should be home, when to watch television, the friends we may go out with and how long we may speak on the telephone, and more.\n\nRules and regulations are necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of society. Without them, chaos would prevail as everyone applies their own code of conduct. The code implies that certain expectations are demanded of us if we are to live peaceably in society. Rules ensure that there is fair treatment of workers and fair play on the playing fields. They ensure that no person or group may take advantage of others and there is respect for one another's rights and property. It makes for harmonious living and forms a basis of discipline so that children can be guided and socialised.\n\nAlthough some rules may appear to be childish and ridiculous such as the penalties imposed on those caught littering and soiling lifts, these are justifiable as there is evidence of thoughtless and inconsiderate people. It may seem unfair to the quiet, peace-loving majority of the community, but without the existence of rules and laws, respect for human life may come to nought. Thugs and gangsters may rule the day and secret societies dominate society if laws do no prevail. It may also mean that strong countries will intimidate or take advantage of weaker ones.\n\nTherefore, even though we may find some rules hard to accept, we have to acknowledge that they are essential as they do contribute to better living. Without laws and legislation, freedom would not be possible."

        "title": "The pitfalls of the working world for a fresh school leaver",
        "content": "The prospect of leaving school is certainly an exciting one. This is because such a move would entail a lot of things like the person having to exercise independence, decision-making and risk-taking. Such necessary steps are an integral part of learning to deal with working life. As such, it is important to watch out for pitfalls that could plague such a bright-eyed first-timer in the real world.\nThe first danger to watch out for is definitely that of unrealistic expectations. Many people who are stepping into the working life for the first time do not do so cautiously but take plunges instead. They do not consider if their expectations match the reality they are about to encounter. For example, many think that armed with a university degree or other relevant qualifications, the world is their oyster and hence they are assured of a well-paying job with excellent benefits. But they fail to realize that these qualifications are merely the passports to the respective jobs they desire. To do well will take effort and proven ability. Many young people fail to realize this and they end up disillusioned by their experiences. Many resort to job-hopping to find that ideal job, failing to realize that the ideal job is not to be found but to be created.\n\nAnother danger to watch out for is the tendency to overspend. Young people who have their first taste of working life see the need to present a good image of themselves. This means dressing up in appropriate clothes, which they have had little contact with when in school. Proper suits, jackets, blouses or shirts as well as leather shoes are certainly not de rigeur apparel for a student. As such, the young person would find the need to deck himself out in presentable outfits so as to create a good impression. This could mean that they would have to rely on their parents' generosity or even the many credit facilities that are targeted at them. Coupled with the busier social life that they are sure to get caught up in, the young school-leaver may spend more than he can make. Such a danger can be blurred by his natural optimism that he is still young and will be able to repay all debts. Unfortunately, that may not be the case and it may be far too late when this is eventually realized.\n\nThe working world is certainly not a hothouse environment. Instead, there are many dangers, one of them being the ill intentions of people who are out to prey on unsuspecting people. These may be people who aim to lure the naive school-leaver into the seedy underworld of vice and drugs by offering him a great deal of money. Others may deceive him into believing that they are able to offer him a job with high salary and opportunities for a fee. These may be obvious ploys but may still escape the unsuspecting school-leaver. Thus, it is important that one checks out all offers before signing on the dotted line.\n\nEntry into the working world is definitely worth planning for and being cautious over. As it determines the future of the entrant, it is always advisable that one consults people who are more experienced in this area. In this way, it will ease the way into the next stage of life."

        "content": "My school is reputed to be one of the premier schools in Malaysia. It boasts a tradition of good academic results as well as active involvement in sporting activities. In the last five years, a few changes have taken place in the school in the areas of leadership, sporting emphasis, cultural activities and academic curriculum. These have added tremendously to the vibrancy of the school culture.\nThe biggest change has to be in the leadership of the school. The last principal we had was Mr Adam who had gained our respect through his quiet demeanor and benevolence. He was always walking around the school and chatting with the pupils to find out more about them. His relationship with the staff was also good, with the latter always supportive of his plans for the school. But we were sorry to see him go when he was posted to the Ministry of Education five years ago. Initially, his replacement, Mr Ismail, was viewed with much skepticism when he came. After all, we were used to Mr Adam's friendly style of handling matters. Mr Ismail was very professional in the way he handled the school. He introduced a firm discipline and professionalism into the school. With time, the entire school was convinced that his different style had ultimately the same aim which is to make our school the best in the country. For that, he won our respect and support. The results of his leadership became obvious when our school topped the school rankings four years in a row.\n\nAnother change that he brought about was a different emphasis in our co-curricular activities. Before his arrival, we participated in all sports regardless of whether we were good at them. This meant that we had spread our resources thin because a total of twenty sports were on our school calendar. When he reviewed our sporting achievements, Mr Ismail decided that we should consolidate our position in the sporting arena by concentrating on a total of twelve sports. As a result, twelve of the most popular sports were selected and pupils were redeployed to them from the other eight. The pupils were trained intensively in their preferred sport and in no time at all, posed a serious challenge to the champions at school level. As a result, we won the coveted title of `Top Sporting School' for two years running. We are looking forward to making it three times in a row this year.\n\nOur school had never been particularly concerned about cultural activities, probably because we were a boys' school. But Mr Ismail ensured that we obtained a regular dose of culture by inviting cultural performances to our school during the assembly. As a result, we were introduced to Chinese opera, Malay wayang kulit, Indian classical dances and instruments as well as folk dancing. These were at first greeted by much derision because the prevailing opinion was that boys did not need these developments. But we came to realize that we stood to gain from understanding more about the local culture, and our attention was gradually arrested by these weekly performances. In the end, we added a new dimension to our development.\n\nOur curriculum also got an overhaul with Thinking Skills being incorporated on every level and into every subject. This was because the Ministry of Education had emphasized the need to imbue the pupils with Thinking Skills as it would enable them to be proactive and creative working adults. This shift in mindset was welcomed by the teachers who were often heard lamenting that the testing system had been created for the exam-smart students. They launched full-steam into using Thinking Skills in lessons and project work began to take the place of tedious homework. As a result, lessons have become livelier and more creative. We have also become more independent in problem solving.\n\nMy school has certainly blossomed into a more dynamic learning environment in the last five years. Whether it is in studies or sports, all pupils have been given the opportunity to develop their potential with expert guidance. It has become a school that I am proud to be associated with."

        "content": "Customs are important for the identity of any country. They ensure the continuity of history and lock in the uniqueness of its people. Similarly, laws are essential for the smooth running of a country, for they spell clearly the boundaries of responsibility for every citizen and non-citizen alike.\nIn my country, some of the most important customs are the showing of respect for the elderly and the special rites for weddings, births and deaths. The most important laws to me are those dealing with the protection of the citizens and unfair discrimination.\n\nShowing respect for the elderly is certainly a crucial custom that must be upheld today. The young are increasingly westernized and deluded into thinking that having a mind of their own means not having to listen to anyone else. This results in them resenting any sort of control or advice from the elderly, whom they see as old-fashioned and therefore unimportant to the modern ways. It is an Asian trait to be respectful to the elderly, but this is unfortunately much neglected these days.\n\nRites are a way of lending importance to ceremonies and nowhere is this more essential than in the dealings with birth, marriage and death. Such rites are so heavy with tradition and symbolism that they ensure that these important occasions are laden with significance. Thus, marriages begin with much auspicious cheer, while births are celebrated with much ceremony. Similarly, deaths are dealt with great pomp that serves to reflect the importance of the deceased. Thus, these customs must continue to be observed.\n\nIn the area of laws, I must say that one of the most important ones is the protection of the citizens. This refers to laws enacted to ensure that its citizens are safe from physical and mental harassment, as well as threats to life from direct and indirect sources. Such laws assure the citizens that the police are ever vigilant and crimes are dealt with harshly. As such, many arc deterred from committing these acts because of the severity of punishment.\n\nUnfair discrimination is an area in which the law ensures that offenders are dealt with promptly and severely. This can be discrimination in terms of age, gender and race. Being a multi-racial society that we are, it is important that the law is impartial so that everyone is assured of fair treatment. Laws that legislate against discrimination go a long way to making sure every citizen is not unfairly treated for reasons they cannot help.\n\nActually, all laws are important as they regulate the lives of people living in the same society. Without laws, all will degenerate into chaos, which could spell the disintegration of that society. Similarly, customs are usually symbols of the past that define its people. Of course, not all customs are good. There are those which border more on superstition than tradition. Yet, it is important to recognize the richness of the culture that all customs originate in."

This eventually became a subject of much public discussion in the local media as experts and observers alike gave their views on this social phenomenon.\n\nTrains, buses and taxis converge onto the area. There are massive traffic jams on busy Saturdays and festive occasions. Despite this, Orchard Road remains the most popular place for both the lunchtime and weekend crowds. Buying something from Orchard Road stamps an undeniable mark of glamour on the purchase. It is certainly a place worth visiting."

        "title": "Why is resisting temptation considered difficult ?",
        "content": "The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English defines temptation as a strong desire to have or to do something even though you know you should not. Therefore, the word connotes that if we yield to a temptation, we are being ill-disciplined and perhaps want to taste the forbidden fruits. It has a negative connotation if we yield to that temptation as it is not socially sanctioned.\nTemptations exist everywhere in the world. They can be in the form of buying branded goods, eating fried food when one's health does not permit it or being tempted to take things easy, laze around and not do a task easily and efficiently even though the deadline is drawing near.\n\nTemptation is a perennial problem in life and whether one gives in to it depends on one's character or more specifically one's discipline and will. Discipline and will are formed by one's values or the lessons learnt from giving in to temptations in the past. For example, a student may be tempted by his peers to go shopping and take things easy even though a major test is drawing near. If he does not yield to the temptation, it is perhaps because from young, he has been trained to recognize that indulging in short term pleasures like shopping or frittering away one's time will hinder one's pursuit of desired goals in life such as studying to do well in the examinations. It could also be that in the past he had yielded to temptation before and in this case, a lack of discipline to study, which resulted in bad grades.\n\nA young student may be tempted to indulge in illegal methods like cheating, lying or stealing. As a teen, the temptations of illicit pleasures like smoking, taking drugs and gambling beckon to him. As a young adult, he may be tempted to drink, charge immoderate expenses to his credit card, or lie in his resume. Growing older, he may be tempted to eat foods which are not suitable for his health or age. Elderly people may sometimes succumb to the temptations of con men who lure them with get-rich schemes if they were to invest their hard-earned savings with them.\n\nWhy is giving in to temptations socially frowned upon? This is because of the harmful results from giving in to such. A person who tries smoking harms his body and may even move on to drugs. A drug addict is a burden to himself, his loved ones and to society. An accountant who yields to the temptation of siphoning off his company's funds will face the odium of social disgrace to himself when the crime is discovered.\n\nAll said and done, temptations are attractive by nature. This is often in the nature of forbidden fruit. The grass always looks greener on the other side. That milk shake may add unwanted calories to the slim woman, but it is itself a temptation because it is forbidden and seldom indulged in. A diabetic craves for a dessert because of the joys of sugar which he is forbidden to indulge in.\n\nSomeone who does not yield to temptation is respected in society. A politician who is incorruptible or a husband who is faithful upholds desired moral standards in society. Imagine a society where people give in to temptations like beating traffic laws or going on spending binges. The moral fabric of society will be eroded. Temptations must therefore be recognized for what they are - seductive attractions not to be succumbed to."

        "content": "Smoking is unfortunately a habit that is catching on with the younger generation. In the past, it used to be that stress and undue pressure were the reasons for the young turning to smoking, but today, most teenagers take up smoking because it is a trendy thing to do. Most teen groups who hang around shopping centers doing nothing much usually sport a lighted cigarette between their fingers. Thus, if I have a friend who is a smoker or who is even thinking of picking up the habit, I would do my best to dissuade him.\nA good way to start will be to bring to his attention the advertisements that serve to alert smokers of the dangers of smoking. These advertisements, particularly the print ones, usually provide detailed information about the tragic consequences of smoking. Anyone reading them will be appalled enough to want to stop smoking or even refrain from taking the first puff. Motion advertisements on television are also powerful deterrents because of their use of visual effects to show clearly the blackened lungs. The thought of a persistent and terrible cough that comes with smoking long term will certainly make one uneasy. I am sure my friend will be horrified enough to reconsider continuing such a harmful habit.\n\nIf my friend is unable to stop smoking even after this, I will resort to showing him medical articles on the undesirable effects of smoking. These are usually more comprehensive than the advertisements mentioned earlier. They give a clear picture of what smoking does to the human body as well as the mind. It will be through this that my friend will get to see both the physical as well as the psychological effects of smoking on him. Hopefully, he will be dissuaded.\n\nAnother way of convincing him that smoking is bad will be the use of emotional blackmail. He can be made to see how much he affects those he loves, and how his smoking creates secondhand smoke that can actually cause more harm to his loved ones than him. As he probably loves his family greatly, I am sure it will make him think twice before smoking.\n\nLastly, I will constantly remind him of the dangers of smoking to reinforce his resolve. After all, smoking is a habit that is probably difficult to kick, but with the constant encouragement of friends and family, I am sure that any smoker will be able to find the strength and will to kick the habit."

        "content": "A threat given by a party is an intention in whatever form, written or spoken, which augurs harm to the threatened party.\nThe party making such statements or signals of harm obviously means ill will to the party receiving the threat. Obviously, he must be feeling animosity towards the other party or body to resort to such intimidation. The objective of a threat is to make the threatened party comply with some action, or request or unfortunate results may occur. For example, a simple threat by person A to person B may be: \"I will beat you up.\" In another form of a threat, he may say: \"I will beat you if you do not give me your money.\"\n\nThreats can come in all forms. In a simple form, a bully may threaten to beat up a small boy. It may also take the form of a nation threatening another nation. A mighty country may threaten other countries by virtue of its military might. If the other country refuses to comply with its demands, it may be invaded. Countries commanding valuable resources such as water may threaten to cut off the supply to the other countries who depend on it if their political demands are not met.\n\nThreats may come in written form such as letters, or the telephone or through the Internet. Terrorists or gangsters have been known to broadcast their threats live over radio or television, threatening damage to institutions such as blowing up a bank or killing hostages.\n\nBeyond inflicting bodily harm on a person, a threatener will also cause mental stress and duress for the sufferer. Terrorists may threaten governments that they would detonate bombs in public places if the latter does not comply with their demands. Sometimes, superpowers resort to threats. In the Cold War of the 1960s, the United States and Russia were engaged in a race for military and political supremacy. When Russia under Khruschev installed missiles in the Bay of Pigs in Cuba, which could be aimed at the Americans, President Kennedy sent counter threats. Either the missiles were removed or Russia would face swift counteraction. Russia complied in the face of such a strong threat.\n\nThe world is getting more vulnerable to threats of a more insidious kind on a wider scale with the increase in technological and communication advances. Criminal elements can learn how to make bombs through surfing the Internet. There are more poisonous chemicals and gases which can be used by unstable elements to threaten harm on a city's water supplies or transport network.\n\nIn recent years, threats have been received to harm people using trains or planes. There was a case of a man who poisoned some snacks of a famous brand and issued threats. The poor company not only had to comply with his demands but had to remove all the items of the particular brand. It incurred great financial costs. Such is the power nowadays of a few individuals who can hold mighty bodies to ransom. It is no longer a simple case of kidnappers issuing death threats to a person if their ransom demands are not met.\n\nIn the case of two parties involved in a personal dispute, it is not for us to judge who is at fault, especially if we do not know the facts. However, when one party issues a threat to the other, then the former is going against the law. People who make threats go against the grain of an orderly society. Threats are unpleasant matters, cause harm and should be firmly dealt with by everyone concerned."

        "content": "Darkness is always associated with the worst things like vengeful spirits and serial murderers. Even in movies, the night is always depicted as a time when the nasty supernatural forces are at full play doing their mischief. It is, therefore, not surprising that many people are afraid of the dark and find it more oppressive than exciting.\nTo me, the dark is a mysterious blanket of ink that conceals and makes the situation highly exciting. It is a time when my imagination runs wild. I think of the romantic lovers Heathcliff and Catherine in Wuthering Heights wandering on the moors eternally united, a picture which lends credence to my romantic notions of love. It is a time when I see Peter Pan flitting about the dark corners with Tinkerbell, ready to whisk me off into their world of adventure and magic.\n\nHowever, the dark is transformed into an ominous entity after a horror movie during a stormy night, or when alone on deserted streets. Then, I would see it as a threatening presence with demons and evil men at corners waiting to pounce on me. Images from movies where young girls are stalked by crazed murderers or are the unwitting targets of ghostly apparitions crowd my mind to create fear and tension in me. Even a long corridor that is unlit conjures up familiar scenes of girls and boys running endlessly on it trying to escape a maniacal killer.\n\nAt other times when I am just too tired after a hard day at school, the dark is a welcome signal for me to take my rest. At times like this, it becomes reassuringly familiar to me and lulls me into a restful sleep. In fact, many a time I have actually looked forward to the dark as a justification for my desire to sleep !\n\nWhen I was young, I remember being so afraid of the dark after watching a particularly gruesome horror movie that I simply refused to sleep with the lights off. My poor parents had to slowly ease me into accepting darkness as a natural condition. With time, I felt braver and consequently was able to overcome my childhood terror of the dark. Now, I am glad that the dark has come to mean so many different things to me and has made my life a more exciting and imaginative playground."

        "content": "One would think that a learning institution would be the last place that dishonesty occurs. Unfortunately, in the ten years that I have been in school, what I have seen is the creativity of students in redefining the boundaries of dishonesty.\nAn incident that has remained firmly etched in my mind is that of a classmate keeping excess change that was given to him by the harried vendor for his purchase of a bowl of noodles. We were only in Year Three then and surely keeping the extra change would not have crossed any innocent mind, but that was not the case for my friend. He not only kept the excess change of RM2 gleefully, but also went on to proudly declare to the rest of us how clever he was to have made the extra cash. Needless to say, we were speechless at his dishonesty.\n\nGetting parents to sign test papers was implemented by the school authorities when I was in primary school to ensure that parents were kept in the know about their child's performance. However, I have seen many cases of students forging their parents' signatures to get away with not having studied for a test. In fact, one such forgery case involved a close friend of mine who diligently forged his father's signature on a test paper that he had failed badly in. It did not pay at all because he was eventually found out by the suspicious teacher who wondered at his father's lack of response on the matter. It seemed that the teacher and his father were always contacting each other regarding his academic performance. In the end, the matter came to light and he was given demerit points.\n\nAnother kind of dishonesty that I have witnessed in school is that of students lying about their homework. Each time the teacher pressed for the missing assignments, the reply from the students would inevitably be that it was lost or that it had been handed in. Even though it was obvious that the student is at fault, he would stick to his story come hell or high water. This meant that the teachers could hardly punish the student for an assignment that had gone missing, especially when the poor hapless teacher was alleged to be at fault for losing it. Given the fact that teachers have so many things to remember, it is not surprising that they would be thrown into self-doubt on this matter. Thus, the student invariably gets away with it.\n\nPerhaps, it is because the school is a microcosm of the real world that these acts of dishonesty also occur, despite it being a place to educate the future leaders of the country. Yet, it is still sad that students as young as nine years old can be guilty of such dishonesty."

        "content": "Secret agents! The very word conjures up mystery and intrigue. There is an atmosphere of glamour and stealth behind this word which is synonymous with the word 'spies'. But the harsh reality is that secret agents have existed since immemorial time when men need to get information about something or someone for their own ends. Three meanings are attached to the word 'secret agent': (1) a person employed by a government to obtain secret information or intelligence about another, usually hostile, (2) a person who keeps a close and secret watch on the actions and words of another or others or (3) a person who seeks to obtain confidential information about the activities, plans, method of an organization or person. The usual association of a secret agent is one who works for a big institution like a ,government or company. A private investigator does spying but on a personal level for someone.\nWhat are the actions associated with spying? Government secret agents engage in the art of espionage. These are people who engage in gathering intelligence or secret information about a party in which their employer is interested in. The information is usually confidential information about the character, plans, methods or activities of a person or organization. The secret agent needs to operate furtively and to observe stealthily. His identity or intentions cannot be exposed, or his information or sources of such will abruptly cease.\n\nGovernments employ secret agents to obtain information about other countries or parties. During the Cold War, there was much competition for military and political supremacy between Russia and America. Russia had its much feared intelligence service, the KGB, and the United States had its CIA network. Dictatorial and communist regimes may also employ secret agents to keep an eye on troublemakers and on citizens who voice out their opinions. After the communist regime collapsed in East Germany, many citizens were surprised and incensed at the amount of intelligence gathering or spying on citizens by the secret service and its informers. This happened even in a democratic country like America when the secret service files were declassified and open to public scrutiny.\n\nThe public perception of spying for one's country is that it is honorable. However, during wartime, secret agents or spies who were caught were executed by hostile countries. Governments, companies and individuals have long recognized that information obtained by their secret agents gives them an edge over their rivals. Spying was and has been a serious business. The advances in technology have enabled information to be obtained more easily. Secret agents, of course, need to be intelligent, brave, resourceful and discreet but they have a plethora of aids and methods to help them. Miniature cameras, telephone bugs, spy planes, satellites, surveillance cameras, effective disguise aids, you just name them and the secret agents employ them.\n\nThe movie industry has glamorized the secret agent as an attractive figure. In the popular James Bond secret agent series, the British hero is always one step ahead of his enemies. At times, secret agents are betrayed by their enemies who are secret agents themselves and posing as friends. The movies often portray these as beautiful seductresses.\n\nSecret agents have always been fascinating to the layman. Mata Hari, the famous female secret agent, is known in spy folklore as the sensuous female spy. In reality, she was a dancer and courtesan who was  shot by the French on charges of spying for Germany during the Second World War. The spy genre book has been popularized by well-known writers like John Bunyan, John Le Carre and Robert Ludlum.\n\nSpy films never fail to attract audiences with their secret agents, beautiful women, non-stop actions, stunts and technological gadgets. Even for children, the successful blockbuster, 'Spykids', a light-hearted take on spying whetted their appetite for secret agents. Spy shops selling spy gear do good business. Recently, the American CIA cashed in on the growing popularity for secret agents. T-shirts and underwear bore their logo! Welcome to the world of secret agents !"

        "content": "All around the world, traditional dress nowadays has become the attire that is taken out for an airing only during special festivals or occasions. Modern dress has become the norm because its design and fabric tend to be kinder in our increasingly hotter global climate. However, I am of the opinion that traditional dress also has an important place in our world.\nTraditional dress, as its name suggests, provides a link to one's cultural heritage. It tells the wearer a little of the history that surrounds its design, fabric and even color. For example, in Japan, the kimono is worn in different styles for people of different status. The color also sets the people apart in terms of social importance. It conjures up images of a time long past when valiant heroes used to do battle for honor and pride, while the women themselves were testimony to the grace and beauty of the oriental lady. Thus, understanding the traditional costume of a culture is tantamount to learning its history.\n\nFurthermore, the traditional dress is usually handcrafted and thus intricate in its workmanship and design. Take, for example, the Peranakan attire, which boasts delicate sewing and a filmy hug of the figure. These flatter the feminine figure, thus making the female form a delight to behold. In the same way, traditional dress for men is normally cut to present a stoical and masculine figure. It is obvious that the traditional dress across all cultures basically serves to clearly delineate gender roles.\n\nHowever, a traditional dress can be uncomfortably fussy and difficult to wear. The beautifully flattering Indian sari can take a lot of time and skill to tie as it involves sometimes up to twelve yards of soft textile! In the same way, the kimono requires one other person to tie the sash properly, or it will look terribly untidy. Even the heaviness of the traditional dress can be a problem as it is usually an outfit with many different layers. Obviously, ease was not the top priority in days gone by.\n\nA modern dress is far more comfortable as it is usually made of lightweight material and simple styles. Gone are the time-consuming sashes and yards of cloth that marked the traditional dress. In their place are comfortable cuts which serve functional needs. In fact, the modern dress can be so androgynous that they are unisex. This further makes shopping easier and less of a headache.\n\nHowever, therein also lies the problem with modern dress. There is little identity associated with the attire. They are mass-produced and hence one can run the risk of encountering similarly clad people. But the good thing is that one's personal style then comes into play if looking like one of the crowd is to be avoided. This allows far more room for individuality than the traditional dress would.\n\nWhether it is the traditional or modern dress, the issue should always be the comfort of the wearer rather than its looks. This is because a person can be clad in a fussy traditional kimono and still feel comfortable and look good while someone in a cyber-punk outfit may be decidedly uncomfortable with its figure-hugging cut. Thus, both types of dress are still relevant today whether as sources of history or simply as a daily attire."

        "content": "The number of deaths on the road is staggering. Each year, hundreds die as a result of traffic accidents. Many a time, these accidents could have been prevented if both the drivers and pedestrians had taken more care on the road.\nOne of the greatest dangers on the road are the irresponsible drivers. Whether they are drunk, sleepy or in a hurry, they show little consideration for other vehicles and pedestrians whose safety is in peril just because they refuse to be more thoughtful. The greatest threat comes from drunk drivers. After all, it is not unknown that alcohol dulls one's reactions as well as vision. Without both in tip-top condition, choosing to drive is an act of terrible willfulness. Many fatal accidents have occurred during festive seasons. The traffic police have taken the pains to plant roadblocks to ensure that drivers do not have high levels of alcohol in their blood as well as put up posters and advertisements to warn against drink driving. Yet, many still choose to believe that they will not be caught.\n\nOther drivers who are in a hurry also show little care for the safety of others. They zigzag in and out of traffic lanes to get ahead of everyone else, oblivious to the menace that they are. This could result in fatal accidents as the drivers have little time and inclination to react to flaws in their judgment, which could be something as simple as assuming that the road ahead is clear in the next lane. When an obstruction suddenly appears before them, they instinctively swerve the car away, sometimes into the car next to them or onto the pavement where innocent pedestrians are. When they are finally sorry for being so careless, it is almost always too late.\n\nFaulty traffic lights are also a hazard on the road. When green lights flash simultaneously at a cross-junction, accidents can occur as drivers are confused by them and end up in a messy pile-up. Also, drivers who are cautious tend to adopt a wait-and-see attitude because they are not sure if the lights are really not working. As a result, the drivers behind in the congestion become impatient and angry, which could lead to lots of honking and shouting. This could result in unpleasant flare-ups and quarrels.\n\nPedestrians themselves can be hazardous to safety on the road. Many of them do not obey traffic signs and signals, choosing to cross the road as and when they please. Rather than walking fifty meters to the pedestrian crossing, many prefer to take their chances with the heavy traffic. They fail to realize that the pedestrian crossing was there for the sole purpose of ensuring their own safety. Others choose not to walk on the designated pavements but on the roads instead. This causes problems to drivers who find themselves having to 'invade' the next lane temporarily or even stop hastily. Many accidents have been caused by such inconsiderate pedestrians.\n\nThus, it is clear that road accidents are caused more often than not by human errors. It is important that both the drivers and pedestrians take care to ensure their own safety as well as that of others to minimize the dangers on the \"highway of death,\" as roads are commonly dubbed."

        "content": "Many teenagers see their civic roles as only starting when they enter the working world. This is because they see themselves as being powerless to change anything before that and therefore, postpone any responsibility towards the country. But little do they realize that there are roles that they can assume, no matter how small, to help improve life in the country.\nOne such role is that of pressure groups to raise awareness of important social issues in the country. The voice of the young can make itself heard in areas like conservation of the environment, protection of wildlife, as well as the arbitrary raising of school fees without consultation with the relevant groups. These are issues that directly impinge on our lives and thus should be taken note of by us. Furthermore, we can also put pressure on irresponsible advertisers who discriminate against certain groups in the society or even use sexually explicit messages or visuals in their promotions. By showing that we care about our society, we can make a start in ensuring that sound moral values and correct practices prevail.\n\nWe can also help the community by taking an active role in raising funds and even volunteering as workers for the less fortunate. Old folks' homes and other welfare groups are always in need of volunteers to help them. Thus, by offering our services on a weekly or monthly basis, we are building a caring society that will augur well for the future. Simple tasks like cleaning the homes, entertaining or listening to the old folks, or doing voice recordings for the visually-impaired are all within our means and infinitely more meaningful than shopping or hanging out at 'shopping centers.\n\nIn the end, the best thing that people my age can do for the country is always to avail themselves of the opportunities that are presented to them so that they are able to arm themselves well with the knowledge and skills to contribute to the society in future. There are many things that we cannot do now, like influencing public policies, but we can prepare ourselves to be ready when the day comes for us to play our part. A great deal of investment in both effort and money has gone into nurturing us as young leaders of tomorrow, and we must not ignore our roles. In the end, embracing our responsibilities to our society is a big step in helping to improve life in our country."

Many resort to unusual ways of doing so, like dipping in the fountains found all over the major cities of the world. Others go to some lengths to swim in their own pools filled with ice cubes. In Malaysia, the heat is something that we have grown accustomed to. Yet, there is still the need to keep cool nonetheless.\nThe conventional ways of keeping cool include sitting in front of the fan or staying enclosed in an air-conditioned room. Both ensure that one is cool, but upon exiting the room of such cool comfort, the heat becomes even more oppressive. As a result, many prefer to spend the greater part of the searing afternoons in shopping centers, cinemas or even coffee clubs. Hence, it is not unusual for the shopping centers and coffee houses to be crowded even during office hours.\n\nIn Asian countries, it is believed that certain foods are 'cool', while others are 'heaty'. In the latter category are foods that are fried, chocolates, cakes and pastries. 'Cool' foods include birds' nest, winter melon and green bean soup. Thus, if one intends to keep 'cool', he will consume more of the food in the second category. It may seem ludicrous to a non-Asian to believe that foods have such qualities, but I am testimony to the efficacy of such `cool' foods.\n\nFiguratively, keeping cool can also refer to keeping one's anger in check. Thus, to keep cool under trying circumstances, one can try a few things. The first is to practice breathing exercises. This means that at the point of feeling an oncoming flare-up, you should calm yourself down inwardly and regulate your breathing. Try to count to twenty slowly and you will feel less likely to explode in fury. Otherwise, you could also try thinking of pleasant things when you are riled up. It could range from beautiful surroundings to someone or something that you love.\n\nAnother way of looking at the phrase `keeping cool' is looking chic. It can refer to both adopting the latest hip fashions or an attitude of icy arrogance. Both are popular with teenagers today, who try to ape famous people or beautiful models. Thus, there are really many ways of keeping cool, both literally and figuratively."

        "content": "Understanding yourself is the first step towards capitalizing on your strengths and working to minimize your weaknesses. It is indeed interesting, once in a while, to sit back and carefully appraise yourself so that you do not develop an unrealistic image of yourself.\nIn my case, I know that my determination in every endeavor I encounter is a strength that allows me to achieve what I have today. When I was in primary school, I was a rather mediocre player trying out for the school netball team. My sister then was playing netball for the Malaysian team, and I was understandably very proud of her. In fact, I was so proud that I even wore her national training jersey to my school training one day. When the coach saw me in the unmistakable national colors, she stormed up to me and lectured me on how I did not earn the right to don national colors. Her parting shot was: \"If you want so much to wear it, earn it!\" I never forgot what she said. I trained very hard every day from then on. After school, I would be sweating it out on the court tossing the ball into the net. At the end of all this, I was spotted by the national team manager as a potential netball player, and that started my sojourn as a national netball player. Had it not been for the fact that I was determined to be worthy of the national colors, I would not have managed to endure those afternoons of baking under the sun and trying to perfect my aim.\n\nI am also an intensely loyal person. It is not easy to get to know me because I am a reticent person. But once I have made a friend, I am always loyal to that person. I do not believe in blindly siding with my friends; my loyalty is the sincerity that I show in letting you always know that what I do is never meant to hurt you. When my good friend was in trouble because she had thrown a shoe at the fan and caused it to malfunction, I persuaded her to own up as it was the right thing to do. But I would never tell on her. In fact, I spent the afternoons when she was `sentenced' to detention walking with her all over the school grounds to collect litter. It was my way of saying that I stood by her no matter what.\n\nBut I have certain weaknesses, which are detrimental to my health. A good example is my hot temper. When I am irked, I find it incredibly difficult to control my outburst. I will usually become very red in the face as the blood would rush to my face. Looking like a dragon then, my voice would bellow at the unfortunate soul who has incurred my wrath. At times like this, even my friends would stay away from me! This hot temper is compounded by the fact that I have very little patience. People who are slow in reacting to me or in doing things would set my temper off. These are the two traits that I must change.\n\nI can also be terribly lazy. This may seem strange, considering the fact that I am a national netball player, but it is true. At home, I love nothing more than simply lounging about in my comfortable bed. When my mother needs help in getting some things done, I actually pretend to be asleep. Unfortunately, she has grown wise to that now and will drag me out of bed even if I am really asleep! I suppose this is my retribution.\n\nAlthough there are things that I must change about myself, I still find myself immensely likeable. My honesty in evaluating myself is a good stepping stone to accepting myself. I guess this is why I have such a positive self-image."

        "content": "An emergency is a serious situation that happens suddenly and unexpectedly and needs immediate action to avoid harmful results. To me, an emergency can be as serious as an injury, or as trivial as a pimple on my face before an important date. Once, I was so distraught over a party dress that had shrunk after washing, my sisters had to step into the picture to calm me and persuade me to alter it to save it. What a big fuss over a little thing !\nIn any emergency, my eldest sister is always a good source of assistance and advice. She is calm and decisive, which is important in any emergency I remember once when my father suffered a mild heart attack. While the rest of us were in a panic and too busy crying to know what to do, she took control of the situation, called for the ambulance, and then proceeded to talk to my father continuously to ensure that he did not fall into a coma. Had it not been for her, I cannot imagine how my father could have survived the ordeal as well as he did. Not when the rest of us just collapsed in fear. Hence, she will always be the right choice for me in any emergency.\n\nMy brother-in-law is also good at handling emergencies because he has a multitude of contacts whom he can appeal to for help. He knows many people from all walks of life that, whether it is a punctured tyre or simply buying a house, he never fails to deliver. Furthermore, he is always willing to help those in need. A good example of this was when our family car stalled in the middle of' a highway in the early hours of the morning. Without a clue as to what to do, we called him and he responded promptly. Within twenty minutes, our car was towed away and he was driving us back home. That is how efficient he is.\n\nIf I need someone with a cool head and intelligence, there is no one else I would approach but my good friend, Jason. He is always full of ideas on how to tackle problems that I have grown reliant on him whenever a situation arises that I cannot cope with. When we were in form Two, I had to complete a research project on the business of shares trading. But I was in a fix because the trading firms would not entertain a call from a fourteen-year-old. Jason came up with the idea of pretending to be an interested customer with lots of money to invest. His deep voice and confident articulation convinced the trader and we managed to get a first-hand account of trading.\n\nThus, I know that in times of emergency, I will have people to whom I can turn. But in truth, the best person to rely on is always yourself as you may not be able to find help all the time. Unless you learn how to handle problems on your own, you will never feel confident about meeting life head-on."

        "content": "Favoritism is, as its name suggests, the showing of favor to certain people. Showing favor can be in the form of overly treating the person better, being nicer to the person, or even as simple as not punishing the person as much as you would to someone else.\nFavoring a person usually happens because you want to reward them for being nice to you. Being human, it is only natural to like people because they actually show that they like us too. We want to feel good and therefore show preference for those who create that feeling in us. Furthermore, teachers or employers can show favoritism when they view a student or subordinate as being capable or innately good. This is because we are always inclined to feel positive about those who endorse our own beliefs about work ethics and values.\n\nHowever, the consequences of showing favoritism can be highly negative. In a workplace, the group dynamics can be badly affected by the employer favoring a worker. The rest will see this as being unfair and unprofessional. It does not reflect well on the employer as he is not seen to be objective about matters in the workplace. In the same way, teachers who favor certain students run the risk of incurring the jealousy and displeasure of other pupils. The latter may then be hostile to the teacher and pupil involved, resulting in unhappy relations in the classroom.\n\nFurthermore, the unhappiness created by favoritism is certainly unnecessary in any situation. The person favoring someone will lose his credibility as he is viewed as being unable to be a good model of behavior. It is acceptable to like certain people, but showing favoritism goes beyond tolerance. The person being favored could also be subjected to the hostility and sarcasm of his peers. The situation is certainly not favorable to him although he is favored !\n\nIt is most important that we do not create unnecessary problems for other people and ourselves by not imposing our own attitudes to other people."

        "content": "How often have we heard someone say that they have wasted an opportunity? There is a mixture of regrets and of wistfulness. In fact, it could be even one of pure frustration. For example, a businessman may have been given an attractive proposition but did not take up the offer. Later on, he lived to regret it.\nWhat exactly is an opportunity? It is a chance to have or to do something which one thinks would be beneficial to oneself. For example, a student may be offered a scholarship to study overseas. Everyone tells him that this is a good opportunity for him to further his lot in life as an overseas degree is deemed prestigious and augurs well for his future career. However, he may not take it up if his family does not allow him. Then many will say that he had wasted an opportunity.\n\nOpportunities are like these, you have to recognize them and hope that by seizing them, they will lead to certain desired outcomes. For example, a guy may be a secret admirer of a girl. One day, he finds himself with a chance to ask the girl out for a date. If he does not seize the chance to ask her out, he may not know whether she would accept his request. Others would then say that he had wasted his opportunity.\n\nOpportunities arise as one goes through life, whether at home, in studies or later on at work. Those who are born with rich or educated parents have a head start in life. A rich son can enter a better school or an educated parent can give informed advice to his children. It is up to these fortunate people to seize the opportunities presented to them, or these would be wasted. Hence, opportunities present themselves at certain times. The person who does not grab those chances would have wasted them.\n\nAt work, a woman may have been presented with an opportunity to know her boss better. If she declined a date with him, she may have denied herself an opportunity of a fine husband provided that he were of good character. Again, a man may see an opportunity to display his talents in a project. If he jumps at the chance and does well, his potential may be recognized in the form of a promotion by his appreciative boss. Then people would remark that he had not wasted the opportunity which came by.\n\nOpportunities may present themselves, but one must be ready for them. A person who has prepared himself by acquiring the right qualifications and work experience would be well equipped to seize the opportunity if the job he desires comes by. He would not let such an opportunity slip away and waste it. Hence, opportunities should be taken. There is a saying, 'Fortune favors the brave'. After all, people may think there is no harm trying.\n\nSuch is life. Life presents us with opportunities. It is up to us to seize them. If they result in undesirable outcomes, one will not blame oneself. After all, one has tried.\n\nWhat would be sad to hear would be about people who bemoan their lack of opportunities or not seizing the opportunities which would have led to desirable outcomes. We can only commiserate with the person who says that he should have married that good girl or that he should have pursued that course which would have led to fortune. But luck is the name of the game of life and if you were to ask every person, he would have his tale of wasted opportunities."

        "content": "My grandparents are the loveliest people in the world, for they can conjure up images of an era long past through their interesting recollections of their lives, as well as understand instinctively what I feel when I am in conflict with my parents. Thus, it has always amazed me when I hear that my friends are not just distant from their grandparents but secretly dislike them as well for being slow and traditional.\nWe must understand that grandparents are a valuable resource for transmitting values and culture to the next generation. Without their experiences, we would not be where we are today. They are a treasure trove of memories, which lends credence to the values that they are trying to teach the younger generation. The generation gap comes about only when we are too impatient to try to understand or communicate with them. With parents so busy, grandparents are the best for passing down instruments oral history and family tradition.\n\nFurthermore, they are worthy of our respect because they are living testimonies to the values they uphold. Having lived such a long time, they would have gone through many hardships, experienced changes in the socio-political climate as well as the changing fortunes of the world. In fact, many of them would have had first-hand experience of the second World War! Such experiences are invaluable because they attest to our grandparents' success in having come out on top of the situation.\n\nAlso, grandparents are good caretakers of children. Traditionally, all grandparents wait anxiously for the arrival of their grandchildren, as it would mean that they can now enjoy the company of the bundles of joy. Grandparents are very proud of their grandchildren, and often do a good job of taking care of them. In fact, they have such a wealth of experience bringing up children that one should not be in doubt over their suitability as caregivers.\n\nYet, grandparents are vulnerable to age and illnesses that debilitate them. When the society starts to view them as useless baggage, they are dealt with a cruel blow to their self-esteem, especially when they had spent more than half their lives toiling for their family. At times like this, they require a great deal of love and care so that they can live their twilight years content in the knowledge that they are appreciated."

        "content": "The adage `No man is an island' presupposes that man cannot possibly live on his own. To a large extent, this is true. However, the merits of privacy should not be underestimated as it allows for the recharging of one's energies. My personal preference is a healthy mixture of both, depending on the situation.\nI enjoy the company of others when I am in high spirits and want to share my joy. Trying to keep my joy to myself will only dissipate it, which will render my happiness null and void. Thus, I would prefer to have my friends around when I am high-spirited. The company of my friends will result in the trading of jokes, experiences and stories which will lead to a general camaraderie. Such company will only serve to further my joy. Also, when I am depressed, the concern of my friends will naturally lift my spirits. Their presence will go a long way towards helping me get over the unhappy circumstance that plagues me. At times like this, I can fully understand the meaning of 'friendship'.\n\nWhen I take my meals at public places like the hawker centres or fast food restaurants, I dislike eating alone. It is very awkward to try to avoid looking at people around you and usually, I will end up trying very hard to finish my meal quickly. Eating alone seems to be a sign of loneliness, especially when everyone else around me is happily interacting in groups. Thus, I will always rather have my meals packed and brought home to be eaten in front of the television set than to sit alone at a public place.\n\nHowever, when I am shopping, I like being alone. Having people with me at such times serves only to distract me, as I will always feel obliged to devote my attention to the company. This will mean that I may not be able to concentrate on the business of shopping. Also, having company while shopping will mean having to compromise on the places to go. This will undoubtedly cramp my style as my taste in clothes and accessories may clash with my friend's. Thus, I would rather be alone when shopping.\n\nWhen I feel exhausted by schoolwork or family problems, I would prefer be left alone. This is because such occasions require time for reflection, which will help me sort out my problems and begin to recuperate from the stress. Thus, such times will be better spent on my own. I will not be disturbed by the opinions of other people, who might affect the decisions that I would need to make. Furthermore, when alone, I would be best able to judge the situation without the need for bias or defensiveness.\n\nThus, I am not a person who totally enjoys the company of others or my own solitude. Like all things, different responses are needed for different situations. When I need to be alone, I will enjoy the time by myself. But when I feel the need for company, I will certainly not deprive myself of that."

        "content": "An increased use of motor vehicles indicates an increased development and prosperity in the country. Consumers and companies would have an increased preference to buy and use these vehicles because of increased incomes or profits. Consumers want the increased mobility and convenience that cars can bring, while businesses need vehicles to deliver goods, services and clients.\nHowever, with increased vehicles comes attendant problems. The first and most visible effect will be clogged streets with traffic jams. Unless the government moves quickly, the infrastructure will not be able to cope with the increased number of vehicles on the roads. There will be a need for more roads, highways, traffic policemen and controls like traffic lights.\n\nTraffic jams will negate the very mobility which vehicles are supposed to provide. There will be decreased productivity in the form of wasted hours of people waiting in stalled vehicles. People will have to leave for work or school earlier and come home later. There will also be the psychological impact of citizens' frustration over traffic jams, and air and noise pollution. Politicians and authorities would have to consider remedial measures like improved transport systems such as the light rail system.\n\nWith the increase use of vehicles, there will also be the problem of air pollution. Vehicles emitting fumes and waste products will foul up the atmosphere. Large cities like Mexico City and Los Angeles sometimes have a permanent smog in the air. Oxygen levels will decrease. In Tokyo, citizens to buy and use oxygen masks. Traffic policemen in Mexico and Bangkok wear face masks to protect their lungs. Increasing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) emitted pierce the ozone layer which, in turn, create the greenhouse effect and cause innumerable problems to the world's environment.\n\nGovernments have recognized this and taken measures to restrict the growth of vehicles which hamper the very economic growth which they were supposed to engender. Restricted traffic zones and controlled vehicle licenses are some of the measures which the authorities have undertaken. All these measures are implemented in our country which implements to ensure a smoother traffic flow and cleaner atmosphere.\n\nOn the plus side for increased traffic growth, governments have benefited from the revenue derived from taxes on motor vehicles. Foreign countries which export vehicles see the automobile industry as a vital engine of growth. Sometimes, however, the very foreigners who export these vehicles to the countries may not be fond of visiting their capital cities. An example is Bangkok, where tourists and businessmen are deterred from visiting because of the massive traffic jams. Thus, these are some consequences of increased use of motor vehicles."

        "title": "Television plays a major role in influencing the society of today",
        "content": "I would say that television has an influence on our lives today but not too much. It is a significant influence but not a prime one. A majority of the world's population, coming especially from the poorer countries, do not have television sets. Watching television is, therefore, a luxury. It is in these areas that the statement does not apply at all.\nIn America, however, watching television is the most popular pastime for the average citizen. An average of two hours per day and more so on weekends is spent in front of the set. The trend is similar in other developed countries like Japan. However, in an average developed country like Malaysia, where the average person spends an average of an hour or so a day passively being entertained by this medium, the influence is less felt.\n\nThere are other competing demands on one's time in this fast paced, modern world. Even in poor countries, work takes up a lot of a person's time as he engages in the harsh struggle to eke out a daily living. Often, children are also roped in to work part or full time to help their families survive. In many developing countries like China and Malaysia, the middle classes spend much of their time working to pay their bills like utilities, housing mortgages and provisions. The children too are caught in the rat race. School is a continuous struggle to keep up with studies, homework and parental expectations. Watching television is consigned to what spare time people have, usually not more than an hour a day except during weekends.\n\nYet, in spite of the limited time left for, television, whatever is transmitted from the box is influential. This is especially so for young, impressionable minds and especially so for American children who have less homework and spend more time in front of the set. For those children, the messages from the screen may have a negative influence on them. Advertisers try to persuade them to buy goods and toys which may be undesirable or beyond the parents' budgets. They may also like to imitate the make-believe actions and antics of heroes like the 'Ninja Turtles' or `Power Puff Girls'. Children have been known to harm themselves as they tried to imitate their idols.\n\nAdvertisers try to influence the viewers to buy merchandise or services with persuasive power, or to subscribe to certain lifestyles. This fuels the demand for fashionable goods and services. Television may promote greatly the consumer culture, but the values they uphold may be undesirable. Dubious ethical values like liberal sex and violence would have effects on young, impressionable and uneducated people. Thankfully, surveys have confirmed that people recognize that much of what is shown on television is not real.\n\nAgainst these insidious influences, knowing parents, teachers and lawmen try to counter them. There is limited time for watching television, but its influence can be substantial. The forces for good will try to channel the appetite for watching television to watching more educational programs or healthy dramas or game shows. There are other media like the mobile phone, the radio and computers which compete for a person's time. Other pastimes also take up a person's time.\n\nMost people in this world will have access to television. However, they will be caught in many other pursuits like work or alternative leisure which will mitigate the influence of television. Television is a significant influence, but it does not exert too great an influence on life today."

        "content": "In the past, traveling overseas was a luxury for the majority of students. Studying overseas was an even greater luxury, beyond the reach of everyone except for the bright scholarship holders and the rich. Nowadays, however, there are more students going overseas to study. Higher education is seen as essential to secure a good job. Parents are willing to use their hard-earned money to give their children an overseas education, especially if their children could not make it into the local university or polytechnic.\nThose who are fortunate usually head for western countries like the United States or Britain which have established institutions of learning. Australia and New Zealand are also increasingly favored. Graduating from these universities would usually mean an edge over their local counterparts who have not studied overseas as an overseas education is seen by some employers favorably.\n\nMany of these institutions and those which conduct courses for secondary or primary levels, have a less regimental study culture. Unlike Asian countries which assess students heavily on the grades obtained from the all important examination and tests, western institutions encourage team and project work and a climate of creativity and open discussion. Teachers are seen more as collaborators of learning rather than authority figures and transmitters of knowledge. Asian students therefore find it very liberating to have this atmosphere where they are free to air their views. Also, they are free to set their own timetables on when they intend to graduate. They are allowed to drop out of their courses to go to work and then resume them at a later date.\n\nThe responsibility is placed on them to dictate their studies. Free from the mollycoddling and interference of well-meaning parents, many Asian students, who are hardworking, have obtained a degree in a period faster than they would have done in their homelands. My cousin obtained a Masters in Engineering in four years of studying. He was working as a checkout cashier in a supermarket and even had time to backpack across America. All these accomplishments would not have been possible to achieve in his hometown in Malaysia. He was constantly annoyed by the restrictive classroom methods, experienced stress as a result and was spoilt by his mother and maid at home.\n\nThat brings me to the next point. My cousin had a sudden taste of independence thrust on him. Like most overseas students, he had to learn to rely on himself for his daily household needs, meals and budgeting. He learned to be responsible for his own time and to prioritize his activities. Like many students, he realized that it was a privilege to study overseas and that he was consuming his parents' hard-earned savings. It was his responsibility to study and to use his time wisely so as to earn his parents' faith in him.\n\nNot all overseas students are Asians however. Non-Asians, like Westerners and Africans, learn the cultures of their host nations to survive. Hopefully, by the time they head back to their home countries, they would have understood and appreciated the cultures of the lands they were studying in so that they would be good ambassadors of these. However, studying overseas has its disadvantages. It involves considerable expenses and many families have to scrimp and save to finance their loved one's education.\n\nA student who is not social may also be homesick. It is not easy to adapt and live in a foreign country, and to be suddenly torn away from the comforting network of family, relatives and friends. Some lonely students, who are under stress to perform well in their studies, may develop developmental disorders. Recently, there was a case of a mainland Chinese who felt ridiculed by his peers and teachers. He was lonely and lashed out by shooting several of his peers and teachers.\n\nSome students may miss the moral guidance of their parents and friends. Left alone, they might mix with the wrong crowd. There have been cases of students partying, taking drugs, neglecting their studies and exceeding their budgets. Some students indulge in dubious moral practices, especially in the more liberal climate of Western campuses. Ultimately, whether students benefit from their overseas studies depends very much on their characters and how they use their new-found independence. Like many of life's matters, there are always pros and cons to an issue."

        "title": "Natural disasters around the world",
        "content": "A disaster as defined by the Grolier Encyclopaedia is a `sudden, extremely unfortunate event that affects many people'. Basically, there are two kinds of disasters. The first kind are the natural catastrophes, such as earthquakes, floods and tsunamies. The second type is man-made when Man interacts with nature with horrific consequences. For the purpose of this essay, I shall deal with the first type and look into the what, where, when, why of the subject and who are affected by it.\nNatural disasters can occur in the form of earthquakes, floods, landslides, volcanic explosions, hurricanes and others. They are the natural forces of mother nature let loose in her unbridled fury. Much widespread destruction and damage are inflicted on the landscape. Misery is brought down on the people who become injured or lose their loved ones.\n\nEarthquakes are caused by the shifting of tectonic plates underground. They are measured by a standard called the Richter Scale. Usually, tremors precede a major quake and are enough to send alarm bells ringing. In December 2004, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed tens of thousands of people in Indian Ocean coastal communities. More recently, the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 triggered powerful tsunami waves caused 15,883 deaths, 6,149 injured, and 2,652 people missing across twenty prefectures, as well as 129,225 buildings totally collapsed, with a further 254,204 buildings half collapsed, and another 691,766 buildings partially damaged, hence known as the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan after the end of World War II.\n\nMeanwhile, a harder task awaits governments in persuading people who live in the path of volcanic and hurricane activity to take precautions or move elsewhere. The land around volcanoes are coveted for volcanic deposits known to produce rich agricultural lands. In the United States, hurricanes sometimes sweep across farmland which farmers have cultivated for centuries. America and Hong Kong have systems for warning about destructive winds and have shelters for people whose residences lie in their destructive path. However, in the case of a poor country like Indonesia, the government has limited capacities for prevention and education. The poor Javanese who tend to the fertile soils around volcanoes put their fates with the gods.\n\nSometimes, Man has a part to play in triggering off disasters. Floods and landslides may be caused by Man's abuse of his environment. These are known as man-made disasters. Many disasters like earthquakes are just the unleashing of blind natural forces. To adopt a philosophical note, one can just reflect on the fact that we live in a world where man cannot claim he has total dominion over nature. The fury of winds, rains and seismic forces are beyond his control. Man-made disasters like the nuclear leakage at Cherbonyl, Russia, may start preventive measures after investigation of tragedies, but natural disasters often are within the realm of nature's destructive whims.\n\nThere will always be good people, charitable organisations and governments who will help in relief efforts in the wake of disasters. Medicine, temporary housing and funds will be offered. The light of man's humanity shines out in these cases. Nature wills, but men can try their best to prevent and alleviate the suffering."

        "content": "Fire is the heat and light that comes from the burning of something. It can be a boon or bane for people depending on its effects - harmful or useful.\nOne of the best uses of fire is the production of light. Early man, who retreated to caves in the night, was in constant fear of wild animals which could harm him. Under the cover of darkness, they could spring on and attack him. Fire allowed him to see his environment more dearly Fire can injure and burn animals that attacked him. In fact, animals retreated when he brought his flame torches forward.\n\nWith the light which emanated from fire, could turn his night into day He could be more productive and efficient, thus making him survive better in his harsh environment and making him superior to other animals. Fire has the ability to cook food. Meat and vegetables may have virtues to being eaten raw, but no one can deny the tasty delights of cooked vegetables or roasted, barbecued and steamed meat. More foods could also be made palatable to early man. Man also learned to fashion weapons and tools especially the metallic ones with fire.\n\nWith improved technology, Man has learned to better his employment of fire which provides the energy for machines in industry. Fire generates electricity and provides the power to drive our transport vessels like planes, ships and trains. It incinerates metals, and its heat melts metals for separation from ores. Metals are bent and shaped into desired products used by Man. Hence, fire used by Man and properly controlled by him has been the boon of mankind.\n\nFires, however, which are uncontrolled, destroy and kill. The bush fires in countries like Australia consume valuable forest and farmland. In Indonesia, uncontrolled burning by greedy people to achieve their own ends, lead to a haze yearly over neighbouring countries. This has caused health problems, decreased visibility for people, vehicles and aircraft and has led to a decreased productivity for many.\n\nThroughout history, fires which have broken out without control for some time, have caused enormous loss to life and property. Fires erased large parts of the city of London (1666) and Tokyo (1923). No doubt, the modern cities which rose from the ashes of the destruction are better planned now, and there are few slums now. But no one can deny the enormous suffering they had caused.\n\nFire- friend or enemy? It all depends."

        "content": "If we were to view life as an unequal contest between beings, there will always be winners and losers for the objectives strived for. Whether it is a grim fight for food between two predators, or a sports contest between athletes, it is a case of the winners getting the spoils sought after and not the losers. In the lyrics of the above song, it indicates a competitive element. The participants in a contest would be of unequal talents and varying motivations. Finally, one would emerge the winner, having succeeded by will and capitalizing on his attributes like strength, cunning or talents. For example, the winner in a talentime contest for singers would have displayed his talents for singing and delivery But along the way, he would have displayed perseverance and stamina to outlast the other contestants. In any contest between two participants equal in abilities, for example, two tigers pursuing a deer luck may come into play. The leading tiger may pull a muscle or stumble on a stone. Then the less able contestant would snare the prey and emerge the winner.\nThere must be advantages of being a winner, or there would no participants in contests. However, there are also benefits acquired along the way for those striving to be a winner. The contestants could have learned the virtues of hard work, perseverance and fortitude. They could also have been rewarded for learning to seize opportunities and when to be aggressive, patient or discrete. The winners like those in a marathon or the first man to achieve a medical breakthrough, would receive the praise and accolades due to them from an admiring people. Monetary rewards and fame could follow. What about those who have lost? It is said that no one loves a loser. Take the Olympics for example. People remember the recipients of the gold medals but do not quite remember the silver medal recipients. For the losers, it would be hard to remember their participation !\n\nWe should, however, commiserate with the losers. They have displayed the courage of striving participants in a contest or competition. They should be encouraged to continue taking part in future quizzes or essays where the losers do not take away anything. Far be it for us to discourage and add to the feelings of sadness and inadequacy of those who lose. Losers should also learn to accept their losses as no one loves a sore loser. Those who had lost should also learn to acquire the skills which winners employed to emerge winners like skills of cultivating the necessary talents, patience, courage, perseverance and so on.\n\nWe should also consider whether there should always be winners and losers. Why should there only be two parties, the winners and losers? The business world has learnt to recognize the benefits of a win-win situation. For example, let us consider this scenario. A firm could introduce a superior product, to the public at a reasonable price. The public would take to the product and the company could increase its profits through increased volumes even though the company has lowered its usual price. The firm and the public would both benefit or be 'winners'.\n\nWe could introduce this 'win-win' philosophy in schools. Otherwise, the top students are often feted, while the poor students at the bottom will be regarded as dunces. This is not to disregard that competing or striving to be number one fuels and achievement-based culture. However, it is good to recognize that every participant in a contest is probably trying his best. Also, not everyone can be a winner. Our role as non-participants should be to encourage all competitors regardless of winners and losers. In the case of schools, a student should be encouraged to develop his talents in whatever field he is interested in or has an aptitude for. In this way, he can emerge a winner in his own right, if not in school but later on in life."

        "content": "Crowds are groups of many people in large numbers at a certain location and time. The statement implies that crowds are unmanageable at times and especially so in the future. It also implies that trouble is caused by increasingly disorderly behavior of some people in crowds.\nWhy is there increasingly errant behavior of people in crowds which cause them to be difficult to manage? Perhaps, these stressful times and an increasing erosion of moral values prop up decadent conduct especially that in the observance of decent order in a large mass of people. However, the question requires us to examine not the causes for errant crowd behavior but how to control this increasingly difficult task of managing crowds. For this, the author proposes that we examine the different types of crowds which may turn unmanageable.\n\nLet us begin with a shopping crowd. A crowd in a shopping centre is invariably drawn to it because of its popularity. As in any crowd situation, security personnel is important in controlling possible disorderly behavior of large numbers of people. There must be sufficient guards with communication devices to ensure an orderly environment. Crowds are increasingly drawn to sales. I would suggest that promotions on heavily discounted items be done on non peak hours on weekdays. In this way, there would be a reduction in the numbers of shoppers and the propensity for disorder. A queue or draw lots system for popular sales items could also be implemented. The last thing any store should do is to have popular sale items in open bins. This would simply invite a frenzy of pushing and shoving to get hold of these items.\n\nA football crowd is different from a shopping crowd. There is more of a male presence and an increased predilection for violence in a crowd which turns uncontrollable. Besides increased security personnel, perhaps the entrance gates may be opened earlier for a popular match. An eye should be kept on gatecrashers and troublemakers who stir up the crowds. Liquor and any possible material for missile throwing should be disallowed. Guard dogs and police patrols stationed near the railings separating players and the crowd should be employed in case the fans get physically abusive or agitated. Of course, riot police could be used as a last measure.\n\nCrowds visiting exhibitions would also require our attention to certain details. The car parks should be closed if there are too many people and the entrances monitored for increased flow of people. Lines should be kept moving and for popular exhibits, a limited time should be set for viewing.\n\nFestival celebrations and street parties which attract large crowds of people also need control measures. Points where people are likely to congregate need to be monitored to avoid overcrowding. A crowd intending to view fireworks would arrive early. I remember the recent opening of the Arts Centre in Singapore. The crowds at the Esplanade were kept entertained by buskers and musical performances. This was to foster a good mood in the spectators. When the fireworks lit up, the large crowd was orderly and peace-loving even though they had waited a long while and they were standing shoulder to shoulder in certain spots.\n\nHence, these are the suggestions I have given to control crowds which are increasingly difficult to manage."

        "title": "Bright ideas, anyone ?",
        "content": "Bright ideas! There are positive values attached to the concept. Thinking about bright ideas is an idea by itself Bright ideas spell smartness, improvement and progress for mankind. They imply improvements in efficiency, a better way of doing things or even a new invention in the making. Who has bright ideas? Bright ideas are not the monopoly of only the bright people. Anyone, and everyone, can have a bright idea. One has heard the tone someone uses in exasperation when a bright idea turns out badly in practice. \"You and your bright idea!\"\nHowever, on the whole, bright ideas are to be encouraged. Isaac Newton gleaned the idea of gravity when he observed the flight of a falling apple. The great scientist, Einstein, wondered about the relationship between time and space and researched on the warping of space and the changes in orbits when planets moved around. Thus arose the famous theory of relativity. Bright ideas have often spawned important scientific discoveries and technological applications. Archimedes discovered his idea that a body or mass displaces a volume equal to it when he immersed himself in a tub to bathe. This important scientific notion, later confirmed as a theory and law, led to ships now plying the oceans and carrying goods and passengers. These are large hulks which float using his bright idea. Similarly, the people who observed the birds and bats flying in the air and dreamed of flying machines were the ones who brought about the airplanes and other aircrafts that we know today. The progress and improved standards of living we have now are because of such ideas.\n\nIt is in Man's nature to want to improve his life and so he will strive for bright ideas. A father driving his children to school will conceive of a faster and better way to reach school quickly and beat traffic jams. Similarly, a harassed mother will think of better ideas to meet the needs of a brood of children or to improve her efficiency in running her household. Someone, somewhere, will want to improve on a machine, a system, or a way of life.\n\nIn business, bright ideas are very much encouraged. A better coffee-making machine, for example, would mean an edge over rivals and improve profits for a company. Corporations and governments encourage their employees to form quality control circles and suggest improved methods of working or ways to cut down costs.\n\nMalaysia is looking very hard into its educational system to make appropriate adaptations so as to churn out students who have creative minds in a very competitive global economy. Gone are the days of the system which encouraged learning and testing by archaic methods like memorization or conformity to past methods. The global economy and sweeping changes brought about by technology like the Internet has meant that countries place a premium on good ideas. An invention can later be imitated by others, but fame and fortune await the first person with an idea which could turn out to be a practical invention.\n\nThe old, traditional systems of education particularly in Eastern countries did not foster a conducive environment for people to have creative ideas. Einstein himself was stifled by the lectures. Nowadays, some schools, and particularly those in the west, have classes devoted to creative thinking to foster entrepreneurship.\n\nMany bright ideas have fallen by the wayside. Mankind is still waiting for cures for diseases like diabetes and cancer. Many have attempted to air condition or heat up entire cities. We should applaud any bright idea for it may spell progress for mankind. Man is able to master and improve his harsh environment because of his bright ideas."

        "content": "To answer this question, we must examine the words in this statement. `Young people', as I understand, would those in their teens and early twenties refer to. The challenges in life would be what life throws up for the growing young person, be it physical, moral, mental or emotional. The point is that he has to put in a struggle to meet with a challenge when it presents itself. Except for a few who cannot cope mentally and emotionally, and who buckle under the strain, challenges will bring out admirable qualities in people, the young included.\nAn example would be the first day in school. A young child would have to learn to be brave, independent, adaptable and resilient when he enters the brave, new world of primary schooling. Similarly, a young person who enters high school or university and especially those who study overseas, would have to marshal all the resilient qualities in himself to be able to cope on his own. While overseas, he has to cope with loneliness. All these demands should hone desirable qualities in him.\n\nThe local press sometimes brings up cases of children who have lost their parents. The elder children would have to take care of their younger siblings. The role of a guardian is suddenly thrust on their young shoulders, making them mature beyond their years. They have to learn to do housework and provide emotional support for their young siblings.\n\nA competitive education system places great strains on students. Demands are made on them to cope with a that competes in tests and assessments and performs in co-curricular activities so as to be assessed accordingly. Sometimes, the weak students cannot cope and end up as physical or mental wrecks in the rat race. However, the vast majority learn to cope with the system and adjust to it.\n\nStudents will learn that discipline, hard work and a willingness to forgo present pleasures for future gains are needed in studies. In competing in games or sports, perseverance, determination and moral courage would come into play. An example would be in running a long distance race. Also, students who embark on canoeing or mountaineering expeditions would learn to be brave and to cope with pain and suffering.\n\nWhen students become workers, the qualities which they have cultivated to meet the demands of their educational system will be needed to cope with the rigors of working life. Students-turned-workers will be challenged to cultivate qualities like honesty, efficiency and learning on the job. Life will throw up challenges for young people, but it will bring up the best in them too."

        "content": "Cats belong to the class of feline animals which include lions, tigers, pumas and leopards. These animals are predators, relishing hunting in the wild with their lean, nimble bodies, speed and alertness. They live and hunt in groups and families and because of their speed and size, they are practically masters in their own territory.\nHowever, the subject of this essay are the cats of the domestic variety, those kept as household pets. They are generally solitary creatures. Being easy to maintain and clean by nature as a cat will clean itself and has good toilet habits, cats have been kept as pets for centuries.\n\nThe stray cats that we see in our neighborhoods are generally able to fend for themselves. Their food is any living creature which is smaller than them although they have a preference for rodents such as rats and mice and fish too. They are foragers and once they have found their niches as shelters, they will exploit the opportunities for food in the neighboring area. After fighting with numerous cats, it makes its rightful home in a disused drain which can only be accessed by going into a gap under a fence.\n\nCats are independent creatures and are able to leap and land well. Their ability to survive is amazing. In Medieval Europe, they were persecuted because they were thought to be able to transform into witches. They were feared because of their moon-like eyes and their ability to walk away unhurt despite being hurled from a tower. Cats know how to relax and can sleep anywhere. Who has not seen a cat relaxing under a table or sleeping in the middle of a crowd of people? Cats are also able to reproduce quickly.\n\nThroughout history, cats have fascinated men. The Ancient Egyptians worshipped the cat as a god. The Japanese regarded the cat as one bringing luck, while the Chinese saw the cat as part of nature and respected it. Farmers kept cats for their ability to ferret out pests and rodents.\n\nThe English language has many words to indicate how cats have crept into their culture. A person may be described as 'catty' or have 'kittenish' behavior. Fashion describes the path models tread on as 'catwalk', while a person whoescapes death often is seen to have the 'nine lives' of a cat.\n\nCat lovers abound all over the world. There are clubs devoted to different breeds like the Persion cat. Each breed has its own personality, colors, stripes and thickness of fur. Cat lovers keep cats as pets and breeders breed them for profits.\n\nA cat may not be as faithful and as obedient a pet as a dog, but it is its independence which endears it to cat lovers."

        "title": "How would you care for a sick person at home ?",
        "content": "This is not a glamorous topic to write on. Life, however, has its realities, and the harsh facts of life are that we cannot avoid sickness and death. Someone in the house must care for a sick person in the home. Mothers usually end up shouldering the burden of sick members in the family. Of course, their care usually extends to their sick children, usually the young ones. It is a fact that young children become sick more often, as they are more prone to infections and have lower immunity.\nMore often than not, when children are not well, they are suffering from the common cold or fever. The younger they are, the more important it is for the mother or caregiver to notice the symptoms. This is especially so for high fevers which could damage the child's brain or be life-threatening. Mothers are also the ones who have to bring the sick children to the doctor and follow up with whatever treatment prescribed. They also have to coax the young ones to take the prescribed medicine at the right times and watch out for their diet or rest.\n\nA sick person is usually not in the best of moods. At worse, he can be downright irritable. Hence, caregivers have to be tactful and tolerant. It is at these times that the sick person at home really appreciates the tender love and compassion of their caregivers. Who among us cannot but remember our mother tucking us into bed when we were sick or our mother feeding us a bowl of hot porridge? It was also our mother who ensured that we drank plenty of water as the doctor instructed or avoid oily or fried food when we had sore throats. Psychologists have discovered that patients who had tender loving care recovered faster than those without.\n\nAs children grow to become teenagers, they fall sick less often. However, be it bruises, sprains or headaches, care given in the form of ointments or pills is much appreciated. When someone in the family has a serious illness, the burden of caring becomes heavier and usually falls on more shoulders. Older people are prone to more serious illnesses. When it comes to caring for the old, the burden of caring for them is much heavier. Some may have difficulty walking about or are incontinent.\n\nA child or adult with a serious disease like cancer needs all the help available. Visits to the doctor for follow-up treatments like chemotherapy or radiation sessions must be arranged. Emotional support at home is also important. A member in a family who has kidney failure places a burden on his family members. Everyone should chip in to help out in this sad situation. For old people or young children, it is important they be monitored and reminded to take their medicine as old people may be senile and the young immature or irresponsible.\n\nThe task of caring becomes even heavier when a person is handicapped. For an old person, a fall may be life-threatening. A young child who is handicapped needs encouragement and may be easily depressed or weak-willed. For those with life-threatening diseases like AIDS or cancer, the task of caring becomes even more important. Sometimes, the care given is more psychological than physical. A tender look, sympathetic advice or human touch is as important as the medicine given.\n\nDisease sufferers who faced bleak medical futures may even attempt suicide, so caregivers have to be vigilant. If a person is in great pain, caregivers would have to be on standby to render help. Mentally unstable patients need to be watched constantly as they may be a danger to themselves or their families.\n\nCaring for sick people at home is no easy task. These tasks have to be taken by people who care for them at home. When the tasks of caring become onerous and family members cannot cope, they may be farmed out to hired nurses. However, care from loved ones is always the most appreciated."

        "content": "Some people say that the aim of education is to produce a well-rounded individual with a desirable character. Others believe that education enables you to learn for yourself, while others view that education is the learning of knowledge and skills to equip a person for employment in society. I hold the view that education should incorporate all of those objectives.\nAll students are aware that their education prepares them for the working world. Learning languages like English and Chinese Language means preparing myself to communicate better in the working world, both in the spoken and written mediums. A knowledge of technical subjects like Engineering Drawing and science subjects like Physics, Chemistry and Biology is necessary in this world which is increasingly shaped by technological forces. Our educators have wisely included the study of Living Skills for boys like me. I believe this will come in useful as cooking and housekeeping skills are important when I become an adult and establish my new home. Our studies are becoming multi-disciplinary. A knowledge of subjects like History and Geography is useful, not only in providing students with general knowledge but also to understand the sensitivities of other cultures and countries.\n\nOur education system is stressful with examinations, tests, projects and co-curricular activities. An average student needs to be disciplined to undergo and complete these. In the case of my school, teachers have taught us to focus on our goals and realise our objectives. The discipline I acquire and the values I imbibe forgoing present pleasures for future gains will help me in adult life when these character qualities will stand me in good stead.\n\nThe new education system is a departure from the old one where there was an undue emphasis on assessment of content in examinations. Students survived on rote learning, regurgitation of facts and learning model answers. The new system encourages critical thinking, communication skills and teamwork.\n\nHence, students like us are trained to work in teams in projects, do presentations and learn critical thinking skills. This will prepare us for the working world of the future where change is irreversible and we have to constantly learn and relearn.\n\nHowever, for students like me, education is not confined to academic work. We have co-curricular activities. I help, in the Computer Club and have learned some skills in computers and projectors. These will help me in later life as I intend to go into sales for my career. Then I will need to do presentations. Besides Computer Club activities, I am also a member of the athletic team. When employers view my school record in future, they will be impressed as they know that sportsmen have qualities desired in workers. Sports has enabled me to have a more well-rounded education.\n\nFinally, when I think of my education, I think of the love and concern of my teachers. Their hard work also encourage me. Some teachers are my role models when I step into the adult world.\n\nHence, these are the aspects of education which I think will be useful for me in adult life."

        "title": "\"Preserving the past is a waste of time. We should concentrate on the future instead.\"",
        "content": "The statement definitely does not stand. Everyone knows that the past is valuable. It is history for us. Preserving the past includes past records, buildings, customs, artifacts, food and so on. Let me illustrate by using an example. The first hand phones or computers were big, bulky and unwieldy compared to the light, portable ones nowadays. We must keep examples of these inventions to remind us of the efforts of the pioneers and to compare how far we have advanced.\nSimilarly, a walk in the old part of any city will remind us of the old way of life there. A look at ancient forts, castles or the ruins of the Acropolis, Colosseum or the Great Wall of China will remind a nation of its past civilization. In some capital cities, many existing parts of the city were planned years ago. For example, in my country, Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, since its beginning still fulfilling its role as a central business hub hitherto. To date, The Dataran Merdeka, which was the scene of its declaration of independence, is still used as a focus of loyalty.\n\nA writer was in Beijing, China, recently. He was sad to see many ancient parts of the city being torn down to make way for modern buildings. Ironically, foreigners played a part in getting the authorities to preserve the old courtyard houses of Beijing. A tour through these and the protected historic sites of Beijing like the Forbidden City will remind tourists of the great Chinese civilizations of the past. It is indeed ironic that sometimes foreigners are the ones who are more appreciative of a country's past than many local residents.\n\nThe author is not saying that every aspect of the past must be preserved. Some ancient parts of a city must go if they are not that valuable historically and are instead standing in the way of much needed development. But preservation is a must if a country is to keep its heritage and identity. Someone has said, \"To know who you are, you must know where you come from.\" Thus, a glimpse of ancient temples or the preserved quarters of poor immigrants in the past will remind a people of their roots. Maintaining historic sites and museums is not only for tourists. It is not that the Pyramids of Egypt or the Tower of London are not profit-making ventures as tourism today is a major money earner for many countries. It is because all of us will stand to lose if the world's past, whether in the form of past buildings, cultures or artifacts man used for daily living in the past, is wiped out.\n\nI read an article in Malaysia's newspapers recently of a man who kept things of the country's past, like household appliances or bus tickets. There is also a drive by some Malaysians to preserve some fast disappearing ethnic games or food. They feel that if these were to be gone, it would be the loss future generations. A tourist would want to see the old and modern aspects of the areas visited. Teenagers, however, like myself usually patronize clean, bright supermarkets rather than old, smelly wet markets. However, I would like to see some of these old markets preserved for the identification of future generations. If I possess the latest mobile phone, it does not mean that I do not appreciate the first and early hand phones.\n\nOur lives have improved because we are constantly striving for progress. However, preserving things of the past would not stand in the way of inventions for the future. It is by building on the knowledge and experience of inventions like the telephone and the car that we have built the modern ones to raise our life quality and standard of living. We must look into the future, but the past must be preserved. We will progress more by learning from lessons from the past."

        "content": "On the surface of it, one tends to agree. All schools in Malaysia, except those in the tertiary level, require student to wear uniforms. Students are identified by their uniforms, and most would give a second thought if they want to break a school rule, or smoke while being seen in their school uniforms. They would lower the dignity of the uniform they were wearing. Hence, in this sense, students wearing school uniform fosters discipline in the student.\nTertiary students, whether in polytechnics or universities, do not wear school uniforms. They are regarded as young adults and it is thought that they would chafe at the lack of freedom of requiring them to wear a uniform of their institution. They are supposed to be more mature than primary or secondary school children. Hence, it is assumed that there is no serious ill-discipline among them. For the younger ones, a school uniform would be a good check on ill behavior and a means of identification for the public to report to the school authorities if a student is seen engaging in behaviors that is not wholesome, for example, swearing, vandalizing and so on.\n\nIn Malaysia, all primary school boys wear white shirt and navy blue short or long trousers. Meanwhile, the non-Muslim girls wear navy blue pinafore over white shirt and the Muslim girls wear white baju kurung over long navy blue skirt. For secondary school students, boys wear white shirt and olive green long trousers whereas non-Muslim girls wear turquoise pinafore over white shirt and Muslim girls wear white baju kurung over long turquoise skirt. Some non-Muslim girls wear the baju kurung. Therefore, all primary and secondary schools in Malaysia have their school uniforms. This encourages a sense of identity, healthy rivalry and competition among the primary and secondary schools in their inter-school games, competitions or academic pursuits. They encourage competition for the sake of improvement towards excellence.\n\nMalaysia has some top schools where their pupils are proud to belong to and which many parents aspire to send their children to. However, this reputation was not achieved overnight. For example, Sekolah Tuanku Abdul Rahman (STAR), a fully residential school as the leading boys' school, has a proud tradition of academic scholarship and sporting prowess. The motivated pupils and teachers work together to realize their achievements year after year. There is a tradition of excellence which the school is well known for and a name and reputation to uphold. The discipline comes from within the pupils' hearts. Therefore, the reputable image which their school uniform represents is a reflection of their achievements derived from discipline and hard work, and not vice versa.\n\nContrast this with some low-achieving schools where some pupils actually feel self-conscious about being seen in their school uniforms. They may come from a school where students have been known to engage in gangsterism, vandalism or done acts which vex the public, like openly smoking in public. An atmosphere of low morale is associated with the school and students do not identify with the uniform. In fact, many in school would be ashamed to wear the school uniform. Therefore, a vicious cycle sets in when the school can only attract low-quality pupils into its school admission exercise.\n\nAn efficient and enlightened principal and hardworking, motivated teachers could improve a school's lot. As the school starts improving in the academic and non-academic spheres, parents and pupils begin to recognize it as adding value to a student's education, and more able students will be attracted to the school and identify with it.\n\nConversely, a good school's standards may slide if its students and staff become less disciplined and focused on achieving good results. If an ineffectual weak principal is appointed, standards may drop further. Then the school uniform would not be a source of pride or identity. It would also not encourage discipline as only the uniform of a good school can inspire."

        "content": "Flight is the process of flying. Man has become the dominant animal on Earth, but one thing singularly lacking among his abilities is to fly. He may have invented the nuclear bomb, built huge dams and tall skyscrapers but in the aspect of flight, he loses out even to the most humble insect like the housefly.\nMost animals which fly have wings or a wing-like structure. When they spread these out and launch into flight, the wind catches these wing constructions they are flying Thus, we can witness the magnificent flight of the eagle as it soars over the ocean from its mountain nest or witness the nervous light fluttering of little sparrows as they escape into the sky at the sighting of a predator. On the other hand, we can witness the more clumsy flight of the flying foxes as they stretch their narrow folds of skin beneath their arms when they attempt to leap from tree to tree.\n\nSuffice it to say that Nature has equipped winged creatures to escape from their predators by using their wings or having the vantage point of height to hunt for prey as the eagle or the owl does. This is a very superior advantage for a winged creature.\n\nSince his early days on Earth, Man has always dreamed of being able to fly. The Greeks have the tale of the boy who attempted to fly by inventing wings attached to his arms. Unfortunately, the wax holding the wings melted when he flew too high and near to the Sun. His attempt at flying caused him to crash to Earth. The Chinese and Japanese expressed their urge to fly by inventing kites in the form of winged creatures or box-like contraptions. The Americans and Russians have tested each other in the battle for space supremacy by launching rockets or shuttles into space which navigate the vast unknown expanse of space.\n\nThe Wright brothers, after numerous failures, time and effort, finally succeeded in inventing the first airplane. Before that, pioneers were already strapping themselves into wing-life contraptions called gliders.\n\nSince then, the airplane has improved by leaps and bounds. Airports are built from which jet-propelled engine aircraft traverse the world. Man has realized his dream to fly and explore any part of his world where his aircraft can reach. Besides exploring new lands and new civilizations, the explorers using flight like the early European navigators, fostered trade and established new colonies.\n\nHaving discovered the power of artificial means of flight, Man has brought new ideas and products to underdeveloped countries at a speed faster than using ships to navigate oceans. Currently, Man has flown using other artificial means like hot-air balloons or paragliding to survey his wonderful world from a height.\n\nHowever, Man has also used evil in using flight to reach other lands. Fighter planes from Japan bombed America's Pearl Harbor and brought it into the World War. It only ended when American planes retaliated by dropping the atomic bomb onto Japanese cities. Widespread destruction and untold suffering occurred before Japan surrendered.\n\nThus, flight can be used by creatures, whether human or non-human, for different purposes. It is especially important for Man to realize his responsibilities since he has mastered flight."

        "content": "Education is the most important concern of almost all parents today since it is widely regarded as the key to a successful future. Therefore, it also seems to be a concern of our government because it concerns the future of Malaysia. Our education system is quite demanding on children. With the introduction of the ranking of schools according to their performance, more competition and thus additional pressure have been exerted on the students.\nSome argue that ranking benefits the student, as such a merit-based system will encourage not only hard work from the child but also the teachers, who will strive to ensure good results. Input from the teaching staff is always an important factor in education, and high grades are often derived from high quality education. Furthermore, schools will be more likely to improve their facilities in order to increase their chances of attracting and nurturing good students. Improved facilities usually mean a more stimulating study environment, which presumably cultivates a better study ethic. Parents will therefore encourage their children to attend such schools. At the same time, the schools will expect to produce high-achieving students. With innovative methods spurred on by the ranking system, it seems as though the children will be the ones to benefit the most.\n\nHowever, the flaw of the ranking of schools is that it focuses quite exclusively on academic achievement. Naturally, it is the more progressive schools and the more ambitious principals who will want to secure a place for their school in the top ten listing. As such, it is the responsibility of the students to ensure that they contribute towards achieving these aspirations and live up to expectations. Naturally, it is they who are the least excited about such issues. Even before the implementation of the ranking system, pressures were high, with parents continually monitoring their children's grades right down to the relatively minor class tests. Many young children reportedly study beyond 10.00 p.m. each night, spending their evenings doing homework, while their weekends are devoted to grueling tuition classes. They are not spared during their holidays either, with similar schedules continuing into their holiday periods. These were already rampant before the introduction of the ranking system, and now, in order to meet examination and streaming requirements, stress levels can only escalate.\n\nStreaming is another form of ranking, this time being a more specific categorization within the individual institutions. As such, besides having to worry about gaining entry into the school of their choice, students have to work hard in order to get into the stream that they wish to. In general, children are expected to pass their examinations well, otherwise they would have to face angry parents and disappointed teachers. What is more, they need to work for the recognition of their school. Therefore, it appears that the ranking system hurts the students more than anybody else, since the onus is on them to please so many. With all the emphasis placed on this particular aspect of school life, the academic, others will inevitably be compromised, and the possibility of receiving a well-rounded education will be lost.\n\nAt first glance, the ranking of schools seems like an excellent idea to encourage competition between students and thus push them to strive and achieve. In the long run, however, the negative effects may overcome the positive, and irreparable harm may be inflicted on the Malaysian society."

Great explorations, inventions and designs have been successfully realized through the field of mathematics.\nHowever, great mathematicians are born and not taught. Not everyone has the aptitude to become one, but everyone is given an opportunity to study mathematics at school. Some can only work through the basic principles of this, whilst others may have more ability and are able to develop theories in advanced mathematics. Large numbers and strings of figures may scare and confound many people. From a young formative age, students are offered the challenges and are encouraged to progress along through the various levels of the subject. Those with a gift and show promise of great insights into the world of numbers advance into further, applied and advanced mathematics and eventually undertake to study it at university.\n\nWhether it is at general or advanced level, mathematics has a fundamental importance in our lives. It develops logical thought, giving us the ability to reason things out. We apply it in our everyday living, from simple sums at the market to calculating quantities for cooking and baking. It is used in computing and crunching numbers and figures in finance and banking as in civil construction and architecture, shipping, aeronautics or in a playing field during a game. Mathematics is very much a part of our lives.\n\nBefore the age of technology, all sums and figures were done manually using books, instruments and simple mental calculations and results were not as precise or accurate. Schools ensured that students learnt all rules and tables by rote and emphasis was on the mental abilities of the student. However, with new age technology and computer, electronic calculators have made it easier and we now do not put as much importance on memorizing multiplication tables and simple arithmetic. Rather, emphasis has now changed to the abilities to work scientific calculators and understanding the methodology of deducing the answer to a mathematical problem. More complex calculations can now be worked out and a more accurate answer achieved. Unfortunately, with advancement in such technology, it has made people lazy and dependent more and more on these devices. For those with a love of the subject, it has made it more interesting and exciting as they are able to achieve their goal of final deductions quickly. In some ways, the result of such advancement is that those with lesser aptitude for the subject will be left behind, puzzled by the conundrum of numbers.\n\nEducationalists are becoming more aware of this and are streaming students of mixed abilities to encourage better understanding of the basics and fundamentals of numbers and mathematics. We know that the study and understanding of mathematics will always be a part of our lives."

        "content": "It arrived in a nondescript-looking brown box, strangely out of place in our well-equipped and modern kitchen. We were all curious, wondering what could be in it. Our mother refused to open it until our father was home from work. According to her, it was a gift from our father and it should not be unveiled unless he was present. Itching with curiosity and almost crying out in frustration, my siblings and I spent our time sitting in front of the box and surreptitiously poking at it whenever our mother was not looking. The clock ticked away, so slowly it seemed, until it finally reached 5.45 p.m. We whooped with delight because our father was usually home by then. Almost immediately, the door opened and the long-awaited person walked in. He saw our eager faces and laughed.\n\"Well, let's open it, shall we?\" Our father said with a glint in his eye. We swarmed around the box and proceeded to tear away the brown wrapping. Our eager efforts revealed a metal white box within a cardboard one with colorful pictures of cooked food pasted all over it. Our father then proudly explained that it was an oven that cooked food in the shortest time possible. All we had to do was to put the food in and hit some buttons for the delicious-looking dishes pictured on the box to materialize. We were overawed. How could a little box like that do all that? Our mother had to slave for hours over the stove before all that could be done. It was truly magic !\n\nPleased that he had our undivided attention, our father then proceeded to demonstrate the `magic' of the machine. He took out some pieces of raw meat from the refrigerator and poured some sauce over them. Putting them in a microwave-safe container, he placed it squarely on the turntable in the machine, closed the door shut and pressed a button. Fascinated by the confidence with which he did all that, we stood stock-still and waited with bated breath. The machine was amazingly silent, I thought. It was surely a wondrous machine. After a mere three minutes, our father took out the container and proudly laid\nit on the table for all to see. In great eagerness, we clamored to be the first ones to get the first look.\n\nSwimming in a sea of dark-colored gravy, the pieces of raw meat stared back defiantly at us. We could feel the air of anticipation disintegrating into palpable disappointment. Our father's face flushed crimson as he spluttered to explain away the inconvenient embarrassment. Suddenly, a hoot of laughter escaped our usually stoical mother. We turned to her, shocked to see her collapsing in hysterical giggles as she gestured at first towards our father and then the machine. One by one, the rest of us succumbed to the irony of the situation. The house rocked with our unrestrained laughter.\n\nSome time later, we sat down and tried to decipher the technical jargon found on the instruction sheet. At the end of the valiant hour, we decided collectively that the machine was definitely not worth the grief that we were putting ourselves through. Our mother got up quietly and quickly lowered the machine into its box, taking care to close it securely. Then, our father took the box and stored it neatly into the furthest corner of the storeroom. There the box remained until we moved to a new house many years later.\n\nAt the new house, we gathered together and opened the box. As soon as the microwave oven came into sight, the memory of that day so many years ago came back to us. In no time at all, we were once again collapsing over each other in laughter. We decided there and then that the microwave oven would never be thrown away; it had too much sentimental value."

        "content": "The last few weeks had been a whirlwind of activity and emotional ups-and-downs. Both my academic results and sporting achievements have been a source of tremendous joy and pride to me. Of course, the road to such accomplishments has not been without their stumbling blocks.\nThe first thing that had happened was my school team's participation in the National Schools' Hockey Championship. I was part of the team which trained very hard in anticipation of our final clash with traditional rival SMK Victoria. We knew from the start that it would be a difficult match. Our rivals boasted at least six state representatives in the game and we were understandably daunted. Yet, we trained consistently for long stretches every day, hoping that the standard we reach would be sufficient to defeat Victorians. On the much-anticipated day, we stepped onto the pitch with great trepidation. Initially, our performance suffered from nervousness and anxiety. Luckily for us, we managed to shake them off and play at the standard we were capable of. The match eventually ended in a 3-0 win for us. We were jubilant! I had gone down on my knees in tears, overpowered by the victory to do anything else. My team-mates were jumping onto each other on the pitch, yelling hysterically. The moment of hoisting the trophy above us on the winners' rostrum was a fine moment of pride and exhilaration. It was a moment I would never forget.\n\nThe next few days saw me going through the motions of school in a dreamlike state. I could not help but feel a wonderful sense of well-being. The delirium was further buoyed up when my teacher-in-charge of hockey came to me and informed me that I had been selected to train with the national team. I was thrilled to bits! Imagine being told that you are good enough to play for the country! I was in seventh heaven, my active imagination already creating scenarios of me weaving my way past defenders of traditional powerhouses in hockey to score the all-too-crucial winning goal. However, when training actually started a week later, my illusions were laid to permanent rest. Training with the national team meant a first-hand acquaintance with the superior skills and fitness level of experienced players. I was daunted, but not defeated. I resolved to put in more effort to polish up my skills so as to don the national colors one day. Instead of being demoralized, I was motivated. It felt very good to know that I would have a hand in carving out my own destiny in hockey.\n\nHowever, as a result of my enthusiasm in proving myself in hockey, I ended up neglecting my studies. Instead of being one of the top three scorers in the school mid-year examinations as usual, I barely clinched the second-last spot. When I saw my name so far down on the list, my mind convulsed with horror. How could this be? I had expected a slide in the results, but certainly not a plunge! My face was warmed with embarrassment and my hands shook as I read my report book.\n\nAfter school, I ran all the way home and threw myself onto my bed. It took four whole hours for me to cry all that anguish and humiliation out of my system. After that catharsis, I got up and resolved to rectify matters. I sat at my desk and proceeded to work out a timetable for revising my school work. The next week before the re-examination was grueling. But I could stand tall at the end of it because I had not only managed to regain my previous academic standard but also improved on my ranking. I was now second in class!\n\nIn the space of a mere few weeks, I have found myself in the heights of glory and euphoria as well as in the depths of despair and fatigue. Looking back, I feel that it had all been worth it. I have proved to myself that I am able to muster all my courage and determination to overcome obstacles. This is a confidence that I know will stand me in good stead in my future endeavors."

        "content": "I looked at myself in the mirror, the look of discontent marring the ageless beauty that was reflected back at me. I was tired of it all, all this endless monotony that marked the life of every citizen on Sector 5. Sector 5 was a cluster of planets in the universe banded in the year 2555, thus the numbering of it as 5. It was a world of tremendous beauty, where all the citizens were gifted with immortality. They had all been fertilized in a pod-like container that accelerated their growth, completing what would have taken twenty years in a mere two days. Somehow, the process also froze their ages at twenty, allowing them to live out their eternity in the prime of their youth and beauty.\nWhat everyone took for granted as their right was understood by me as eternal hell. How else would you define existing forever without change, challenge or chance? Everything was provided for; all that a citizen had to do was roam about every day in a state of vacuity, occupying a statistic in the annals of the Population Regulators' Department (PRD). All that ever changed was geography: whenever the maximum limit of the population had been reached, the PRD would assign some citizens to `liberate' a newly banded sector. This meant that no one would ever have to give up the gift of life. But to me, this merely meant that all citizens existed merely to justify the warped control of the all-powerful PRD, the\nlatter being also the legislative council that decided on the affairs of the Sectors.\n\nI had no idea when my disenchantment with my life began, but I knew exactly what I was unhappy with. The sheer boredom of living without any aim horrified me. I remembered all the classics that I had accessed in the electronic library. In all the historical records like the \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\" magazines, I voraciously drank in all the events that obviously showed my ancestors as being people of tremendous drive and vision. I was inspired. I had labored over the problem in my mind and finally had the solution to the problem all wrapped up. I knew the ultimate weapon that would bring down the foundations of my society - death.\n\nI realized that any death at all in Sector 5 would create a pandemonium in a population reared on a diet of total trust and docility. When they were thrown on shaky ground, perhaps they would wake up from their stupor and see the need to grasp their destiny in their own hands instead of listening blindly to a largely faceless voice called PRD. I would be the catalyst of change, I thought. I would be the undisputed turning point in the history of mankind. My death would be it all.\n\nI was to put my plan into action soon. The right day would be the Commemoration Day, which was the celebration of the establishment of Sector 5. Everyone would be there to lend presence to this important day. I had done my homework, which was, of course, an enterprise that was practically unheard of in the present day and place. No one ever had to work at anything; their sole task was just to be there in Sector 5. But I knew that there was more to life than this and I was going to prove it.\n\nThe day of reckoning was finally here. I got ready for my moment of glory. I packed the syringe of lethal poison that was designed to cripple my body systems carefully into a plastic carrier. I had spent so much time over it, taking care to test it on myself in increasing doses. My body was slowly winding down. I suffered from fatigue, hitherto a condition that was unheard of. But I was still strong enough to drag myself to the Coliseum.\n\nOutside the imposing facade of the Coliseum, I found myself forced to rest by the large pillars as I clutched my weakening heart. A twinge of fear gripped me when I thought that I might not make it to the Coliseum. Everyone else had already gone in. I was left all alone. My death would have no impact if there were no one to see it. I struggled to stand up but could not muster enough strength. I tried to call out, but no sound escaped my parched throat. Slowly, I sank lower to the ground, feeling my life draining away.\n\nWhen the crowd thronged out of the Coliseum after another equally wonderful celebration, they failed to see the strange-looking heap of brown dust on the ground. What they failed to see was also the nondescript remains of one of their own who had tried to bring them the meaning of real life. What I had failed to realize was that, together with the accelerated growth, was the very clinical and convenient accelerated decay of my body."

Where he was the basketball captain and star player on the school team, I could only lay claim to the dubious honor of being the only one in the class to fail the annual fitness test. As a result, everyone saw me as the resident nerd, and Jamie, who used to be my childhood friend, took to ignoring me although we were in the same class. There were times when I would reminisce about the happy times we spent together wrestling and playing cops-and-robbers in the backyard of our homes. However, these happy memories were always erased by the realization that we were now alien to each other. But this was all to change.\nI was always the bookish one, and enjoyed going to the local bookstore to browse through the latest publications and paperbacks. It was always my habit to sit at a quiet corner of the crowded Borders bookstore and enjoy a tranquil afternoon reading. Even the store attendants were used to my presence.\n\nI was again in my cozy corner in the store one day when a young and good-looking girl came up and flopped down onto the seat beside me. I was not particularly disturbed by her presence, being totally engrossed in the exciting sci-fi paperback that I was reading. But after a while, it was getting difficult to ignore her because she kept making clearly audible sounds and disturbing my peace. If she was not sighing loudly over the magazine that she was poring over, she was munching noisily on a huge packet of crisps. I tried gesturing to her to show her that she was disturbing me but to no avail. Either she was\ntoo insensitive or she preferred to ignore me. Frustrated, I finally resorted to spelling out my dissatisfaction clearly to her.\n\n\"Excuse me. Could you please not make so much noise? I'm trying to read here,\" I said in as amiable a voice as I could. But my efforts at being pleasant backfired. Clearly incensed at my audacity, she started railing loudly at me for what she saw as my unreasonable behavior. I was astounded. Never did I expect to be so embarrassed over such a civil request. Her shouts eventually drew a small crowd who, unaware of the true circumstances, began pointing their fingers at me in undisguised disapproval. After all, it did sound as if we were having a lovers' spat! Totally flabbergasted by her behavior and increasingly embarrassed by the awkward situation I was in, I looked around for some avenue of escape.\n\nIt came in the most unexpected form. Jamie's voice drowned out the girl's railing and had the effect of shutting her up immediately. What he said was only one sentence, \"Stop shouting at him when it's your fault for being so noisy in a bookstore.\" It must have been the icy tone with which he said it that shocked her. Or maybe it was simply the grim look that he shot in her direction. But whatever it was, he succeeded in making her embarrassed and she quickly left the bookstore. When there was nothing else to gawk at, the crowd dispersed. I turned to Jamie, grateful for his help. But all he said to me was, \"No problem. I've always had to rescue you, right?\" With that, he grinned and left the store. I was left speechless.\n\nBut since then, Jamie and I have enjoyed the same friendship that we used to have when we were mere boys."

        "content": "When Granny realised that it was missing, she turned the entire house upside down in her frenzy to locate it. Everyone in the family caught on to her mood and also frantically turned out drawers to help her. But it was to no avail. It was truly missing. Like any self-respecting matron in a traditionally Chinese household, Granny immediately sat on the floor and started wailing her heart out.\n'It' was actually a beautiful gold hairpin of the antique variety, so exquisitely crafted that it looked good enough to have adorned the empresses of centuries past. Inlaid with pearls of a rare luminosity, the hairpin was a much-treasured heirloom that represented, particularly for Granny, our family's aristocratic lineage. Its loss was akin to a slur on the family's impressive heritage, which we could not allow. It was not so much that we minded its physical loss; it was Granny's obvious trauma that prompted us not to cause her any distress. We resolved to search the whole house for it.\n\nThree hours and fourteen willing helpers later, we still had not found the hairpin. Dispirited by our failure, we trooped back to the living room to report the bad news to Granny. Her pale face almost stilled our tongues, but Father was incredibly brave. He went forward and took her limp hands in his, coaxing in a low whisper that we could not hear. But the effect of his words was clear to all - Granny began wailing afresh and wringing her hands in earnest. We were so distraught that someone suggested that we redouble our efforts to find the hairpin.\n\nSuddenly, Ah Siew, Granny's bondmaid since she was only two, rushed into the room to tell us that the family dog, Georgie, was seen burying something in the garden a few days back. As Georgie had free access to the entire house, it was likely that he had hidden the hairpin. What lent this conclusion weight was the fact that he was fond of dragging stuff out of the house to bury them in the garden. Father took control of the situation and assigned us to dig up the spots where Ah Siew vaguely thought she remembered Georgie digging at. Although her dim memory meant that there were a total of fourteen spots that we had to work on, we were nonetheless grateful to her for offering this clue. We set to work immediately, secretly glad to get away from Granny's hysteria.\n\nWe kept digging for the rest of the afternoon. The work was hard but everyone was exceptionally cheerful at the thought of finding the missing hairpin. If our enthusiasm was all it needed to locate the hairpin, we would definitely have found it hours ago. But obviously it was not enough. Even when darkness threatened to overwhelm us as dusk approached, we kept on digging, no longer out of enthusiasm but frustration instead. Finally, we were forced to give up when we could not even clearly make out the ground that we were churning up.\n\nHowever, the house was no refuge from our frustration. Granny's wails had given way to a cold sullenness. My sister, jenny, finally decided to storm over to Granny to talk some sense into her. Before she could cross the distance to her, jenny slipped on the carpet which sent her sprawling over the rest of the distance. Suddenly, a yelp escaped her as she excitedly pointed at Granny's shawl. \"The pin! The pin!\" she shouted almost hysterically. We all stared at what she was pointing at. To our surprise, the hairpin was hooked onto the threads of Granny's shawl! We were so happy that we practically danced around Granny, who was herself almost delirious with joy. No one thought of chiding Granny for her carelessness - we were too happy that the near tragedy had come to the end."

Is this what it meant to give in to the tyranny of the school gang? The school gang had operated for as long as I could remember. They were always using their superior numbers to terrorize the other students into paying extortion money, giving up their seats, doing their homework for them and even buying food for them at recess time.\nThe group I was watching had been their victims just a few days ago. They were new students who had transferred from another school. Initially, I had thought that they would hold out against Tom's gang, seeing that they numbered seven as a group. I was sure that I had found kindred mates when I saw that they were determined not to be cowed. Each time Tom's group harassed them, they banded together even tighter and staved off the attacks. I was proud of them, as they made my resolve to hold out against the gang even stronger. I had been in their situation when I first came to the school two years ago. But up till now, I still resisted their attempts to cow me into joining their gang. I thought that this group of students would succeed as well.\n\nBut I was wrong. The frequent harassment by the gang proved too much for them. It was intolerable really, the taunts and physical bullying that the gang dished out in such intensity. The group finally caved in after a particularly terrifying encounter. Tom's gang had surrounded them at a back alley and proceeded to throw rotten fruit at them. Coupled with loud taunts and threats, the group finally capitulated and joined the gang. Now they were in high spirits, bullying the other students and feeling good now that they were on the other side. It was sickening the way they were enjoying their \"power\" over the other students.\n\nFrom then onwards, I had to sit by and watch them glory in their triumph over the other students, bullying them in the same way that they had been treated before. It was disgusting. I could not understand how they could bear to put others through the same experience that they had suffered. But they were not to enjoy such bullying for long. During a gang fight, they learned the error of their ways. The fighting was particularly horrific, with a few of them seriously maimed by steel pipes and knives, while one member lost his life. It was a terrible lesson to learn. In the end, the gang broke up, much to the joy of the other students. But it was a bitter way to know that I was right all along."

I could tell myself a thousand times that I had warned him of the consequences and he had refused to listen, but to no avail. The terrible guilt that I felt did not tell me that I was right. I could not look him in the eye, not after telling the teacher that my best friend had cheated in the examination.\nAwangku had been my best friend since we were in kindergarten. We shared the most wonderful memories of playing in the mud and learning our alphabet. If I erased him from my memories, there would be a huge void that cannot be filled. Yet, I had single-handedly destroyed his future.\n\nAwangku had always been an outstanding student and athlete. In fact, he was in the running this year for a scholarship awarded only to the best all-round student. It was an honor that would ensure the awardee's entry into an elite college as well as an all-expenses-paid education. Although Awangku's family was relatively well-to-do, he still coveted the scholarship because it was a prestigious way to cover his secondary school education.\n\nBut all his dreams were destroyed in one fell stroke when his father was killed in a tragic hit-and run accident. His entire future was thrown into jeopardy as his father had been the sole breadwinner. His anguished mother fell gravely ill as she could not cope with the loss. With no income forthcoming as they had few relatives willing to help, Awangku had to find a job after school to keep the family going. He was the oldest child and in between school and work, he also found himself the guardian of his two younger siblings. As a result of this debilitating schedule, Awangku had no time for his studies. Gradually, he found it difficult to even find time to revise his work.\n\nIn the end, Awangku realized that winning the scholarship was more than just a matter of prestige; it became an issue of survival. If he won it, he would be given RM1,200 a month to cover his expenses. This would go a long way towards helping the family survive. He resolved to work hard. But it was a case of the mind being willing but the flesh not. Fatigue overwhelmed him every night after his tiring job at the fast food outlet. In the end, he managed to keep his family afloat but was unable to study well enough to ensure winning the scholarship.\n\nHe confided in me just before the examination that he planned to cheat. It was a difficult decision for him, as by nature, he was a very honest person who believed strongly in integrity. But this time, he felt that he was left with no choice. I knew that he was right; if he had the time and energy to study for the examination, he would certainly have excelled. Unfortunately, all the odds were stacked against him. But I could not condone his intention to cheat. I told him that I would report him if he did that, but to no avail. He was set on his decision.\n\nIn the end, I carried out my threat. I saw him copying from notes that he had written on the sleeve of his jacket and reported him immediately. He was caught red-handed. The last time I saw my best friend, he had looked at me with unshed tears glistening in his eyes. I could not say anything. When he walked away, out of the life he had always known, my heart splintered into a thousand pieces. I knew that the look of pure sorrow that he gave me then would haunt me for the rest of my life."

Thus, it was quite an exciting prospect for me when my school organized a trip for the Boy Scouts to the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia in Kepong during the June holidays.\nThe work at the Institute focuses on the conservation of one of the last stretches of primary forest left in the world. In fact, the trees could be as old as a few hundred years! We were to spend a day there to learn about the work done and its implication on our lives in a rapidly depleting world. Once we reached the Institute, the natural surroundings held us spellbound. I had never seen such tall trees in my life or such a dense canopy above me. It was really awesome. I felt like a stranger to the land, unable to reconcile the experience with what I was used to back home.\n\nWe started the day at the Institute by trekking through the dense forest. The trails were sometimes overgrown by roots and creepers, making it difficult for us to confidently cross the unknown terrain. We were obviously used to concrete slabs guiding our footsteps and road signs directing our way. Here, we could not tell one tree from another, or even distinguish if we had been through that path. Even the insects and little animals native to the forest were alien to us. In fact, we felt a strange mixture of confusion and excitement.\n\nAs we walked through the forest, we came upon some native tribes of our country who still practiced their traditional lifestyles in the forest. This was the Institute's way of ensuring the authenticity of the culture and nature that was peculiar to all of us. We were allowed to watch them cook their mid day meal and how they made some of their traditional hunting weapons. It was an interesting experience.\n\nThe last Highlight of the trek was the canopy walk, which meant crossing a distance of 300 meters on a thick rope bridge suspended more than 100 meters above ground level. It was really thrilling! I had a terrible fear of heights and the prospect of walking literally on air sent shivers up and down my back. I could feel myself shaking with fear and breaking out in cold sweat. In the end, I was forced to walk on the rope bridge as the alternative was walking back the way we came, which was a full two hours' walk! When I was suspended on the bridge, my exhilaration came as a surprise. Instead of being scared out of my wits, I actually felt a high. This was compounded by the sense of achievement I felt when I completed the walk.\n\nThe day at the Institute was indeed a wonderful experience, despite the fact that the surroundings were strange to me. I had learnt a great deal about nature conservation and the natives' tribal way of life. At the end of the trek, a more valuable insight that I had gained was the self-knowledge that I could conquer my fears no matter how frightened I may have been."

Not only was I lauded as an intelligent team player, I was also the undisputed top scorer in the schools' national tournament. As a result of this, I grew too big for my shoes and began to assume an inflated importance that would eventually cause my downfall as a rising soccer star.\nAt that time, I had an English Language teacher who was rather elderly and dowdy. None of us took her seriously, but she certainly took her job seriously. In fact, she was so serious about her role as an educator that she took it upon herself to \"save\" me from myself. My results had always been among the top scores in the class, but this soon changed when I became \"addicted\" to my morale-boosting victories on the soccer field that I began neglecting my studies. The teacher, Miss Ram, was immediately alerted and began detaining me in school after lessons to ensure that I caught up with the rest of the class in their curriculum. But things did not change.\n\nFinally, she sat me down one day and seriously spoke to me about my future. Her argument was that good results were necessary even if I was an undisputed star player on the school team. She advised me to work out my priorities and concentrate on passing the year instead of spending all my waking hours training on the field. As she was seriously telling me all these, I was secretly sneering at her ignorance. After all, what could she possibly know about playing soccer? I was not even sitting for my SPM this year, so why was she making a big fuss, I thought crossly to myself. But to her, I was a model of contrition, nodding my head at the right times to allay her worries and get her off my back. In the end, she was contented with my remorse and decided that the detentions were no longer necessary.\n\nAfter that session with Miss Rani, I went right back to my usual routine, trainings, trainings and more trainings. Each time I saw her along the corridors, I would run like a bullet to avoid her lecturing me on my poor performance in class. I still lived under the delusion that everything would turn out well because I was a star player. After all, surely they would take into consideration the fact that I had brought the school glory in soccer and promote me despite my poor results. In all my worst fears, I had never imagined that I would even come close to failing. But I did.\n\nI was so preoccupied with my training that I totally neglected my studies. When the mid year examination results were released, I had failed all my subjects. It was a terrible blow to me, for I had never thought it could happen to me. To compound the shock, I was immediately suspended from the team. In my fury at being treated so unfairly after all my dedication to the sport, I gloated over the fact that they would surely miss my presence on the field. Unfortunately, I was proven wrong when the school won the national championship, testifying to the fact that I was not indispensable after all. Regrets began to surface."

        "content": "Many people my age would think of their greatest success as having topped the class in an examination or even winning a national sporting title. This is probably due to the fact that we have very little opportunity to explore other challenges since we are in a competitive education system. I was lucky to have had the chance to help a classmate reform his ways. His success in overcoming his past is also my greatest success.\nSince he became my classmate in Form One, Ah Seng was known to all as the \"little terror of SMK Munshi Sulaiman\". Even years later when his skinny frame filled out to make him an imposing 6-footer, he was still known in awed whispers as \"little terror\". Besides generating the fear in us, Ah Seng went on to bully and extort money from the rest of us. Soon, he became a member of the local street gang, which meant that his misdeeds simply became more audacious. His name alone struck terror into our hearts.\n\nBut where he was the \"king\" in all the areas outside of the classroom, in the classroom itself he was merely the dunce. Ah Seng's academic studies suffered from his frequent gang activities. It was not unusual to see him listless and yawning away in class after having spent the entire night and early morning at a discotheque or coffee shop with his gang. At times like this, everyone kept out of his way for he was bound to be really hot-tempered. But one day, the police rounded up Ah Seng's gang after they had taken part in a gang fight. A member of the rival gang was beaten to death and it was discovered that Ah Seng was one of those in the front line beating him. He was thrown into the lock-up for a few days while awaiting trial. Those were sobering days for him. For the first time, he felt real fear and regret. After the trial, he was released but was put on probation. This meant observing curfews and doing well in school, or he would be put into a boys' home. Ah Seng resolved to reform himself.\n\nBut it was easier said than done. His former gang came back to him to cajole and sometimes threaten him into joining them again. No one in school wanted to associate themselves with him due to his terrible reputation and past. But one day, I saw him in the toilet, tears brimming in his eyes as he stared at his test paper. He had failed the test again. I could hear him mumbling to himself that he had really tried to study hard, but to no avail. My heart went out to him then and I saw him for the vulnerable child that he was. That was the beginning of our friendship.\n\nI literally took him under my wings. Initially, people thought that I was probably coerced into hanging out with him, but my tenacity in initiating him into my circles of friends soon put those rumors to rest. For the first time, Ah Seng could enjoy the simple pleasures of real friendship. He no longer needed to \"act tough\" with his friends; with us, he could be the normal sixteen-year-old that he was. He began to feel good about himself.\n\nWe also studied together after school, which resulted in a slow but steady improvement in his results. His former gang members would often come around to jeer at him for being a \"useless bookworm\", but Ah Seng withstood all their taunts. He was determined not to make a mess of his life again. When the year-end results were released, Ah Seng's joy was immeasurable as he realized that he had finally achieved decent results for once. Instead of always faithfully hovering at the bottom of the rankings, he was now a respectable 25th in class. When he reached for my hand in a firm handshake to say \"thank-you\", I was the proudest of all. I had set out to help him, and I did. It was really my greatest success."

        "content": "In the past year, many things have happened to me which are memorable. I had scored very good results in school and even been selected as a trainee for the national junior squash team. But the one event that has indelibly imprinted itself on my memory is the resolve of a good friend to the death of his father.\nHakim and I had been best friends since we were in primary school. We shared the same interests and played the same games. In secondary school, we both tried out for the school squash team and were successful. In fact, he was the superior player and made it into the first team on the first try. I was a slow learner and made it into the same team only after several tries. Hakim was also an excellent scholar and scored distinctions in his exams all the time. Although I was always in his shadow, I never felt an instant of envy as I felt that he deserved them all, as he was really a very good person.\n\nBut just eight months ago, Hakim's father passed away suddenly after a heart attack. The family was left destitute, as he had been the sole breadwinner. Luckily for Hakim, he was an only child and thus had only to fend for his mother and himself. With the resolve and resourcefulness that I had always known him to have, Hakim launched into a cycle of work, school and squash that would have daunted anyone else.\n\nHe found a part-time job at a factory that required him to work from eight in the night till three in the early morning. To him, the mundane work of operating machines was a godsend as it provided him with the money to supplement his mother's meagre income as a factory operator in the day and office cleaner at night. After a few hours of sleep, he would be off to school where he kept himself awake purely with steely determination and discipline. His homework was done in between training hours, after which he would go home to prepare dinner for his weary mother before catching an hour of sleep. Then it was off to work at the factory.\n\nAll of us at school were worried for him. He was a good friend and we did not relish the thought of him collapsing from all that overwork. Even the teachers came into the picture to help him as they paid extra attention to him and helped him whenever he was too tired to absorb what they taught in class. It was not unusual to see the teachers staying back after school to re-teach certain topics to him. Through it all, Hakim remained the optimistic and responsible boy that we knew him to be.\n\nIn the end, he graduated from secondary school with results good enough to get into one of the top colleges on a scholarship. He also made it to the national team to represent Malaysia in the Asian Games. His philosophy of  \"never say die\" impressed me greatly as I saw for myself that he had made it despite overwhelming odds. Above it all, he was not embittered or discouraged, but he made it his responsibility to provide well for his mother after his father's demise.\n\nI was proud of being his friend, as was everyone who knew him. I am not sure if I could have survived the ordeal of losing a parent, and a breadwinner of the family at that, as well as he did."

        "content": "Contrary to what many people believe about lives that are written in autobiographies, my life story is not one full of adventure or fraught with bitterness and disaster. Instead, it is a common life - one that offers a few particularly memorable events in a timeline of ordinariness. Out of these events, there are two that are immeasurably pertinent to my development as a writer.\nI had always been an apathetic student in school. School was nothing to me but a daily grind of boring lectures, mundane relationships and fruitless homework. I could never understand how knowing logarithms would enhance the quality of my life, or learning the workings of a weather station was going to make me a more scintillating person socially. In all, I felt that school life was merely a stage of interminable monotony that everyone had to go through to justify the existence of the Ministry of Education, administrative staff and teachers.\n\nBut this was to change with the entrance of Miss Kulip in my life. She practically bulldozed her way into my consciousness with her booming voice and intolerable sarcasm. I was merely an average achiever in my tests and examinations, which to her was nothing short of a cardinal sin. With each test paper that she returned to me, she taunted me loudly with comments like \"Looks like your usual miserable marks\" and \"What a terrible waste of paper and ink.\" Everyone in school knew her to be an unhappy lady who found tremendous pleasure in pulverizing our self-esteem. Gradually, her jeering tone and snide remarks penetrated my lackadaisical attitude. I began to feel particularly irked by her very presence and resolved to show her that I was definitely worth more than the slug that she had compared me to once in her tirade. When I started doing better in tests, Miss Kulip showed even greater displeasure. Her remarks grew more derisive, even though I obviously deserved praise for having done better. Soon, I found that I was getting to her merely by doing well in my studies. It was sweet victory! After she had left the school, I realized that I actually enjoyed doing well in school. It was a revelation that spurred me on to greater heights of achievement in my examinations. I began to top the class consistently and made my family very proud. Now that my ego was boosted, I found school a delight!\n\nThe other noteworthy incident was the day the entire school was called into the hall for an assembly when I was in my final year. At the assembly, my school principal announced that a student had won the prestigious \"Young Writer's Award\", which was given annually to outstanding young writers. He said that the class teacher of this student had been impressed by the quality of wit and depth of his class assignments and had sent them in for the competition. He then called me up to receive the school's congratulations!\n\nI was elated! I had never thought of myself as a good writer as I was only enjoying the outlet to express myself after my skirmishes with Miss Kulip. In fact, a lot of my compositions were hilariously biting essays on a fictitious Miss K. who was obviously modeled on her! I went up to the stage to shake the Principal's hand Amid thunderous applause. He looked at me with a straight face and then said, \"May you find other sources of inspiration just as sidesplitting as the inimitable Miss Kulip!\"\n\nImagine my surprise at the Principal's joke! But I recovered in no time, pleasantly warmed by the realization that even the usually laconic Principal had a sense of humor. That was the beginning of my interest in writing."

        "content": "It was the most important occasion for the Boy Scouts in Malaysia. They would be gathered at the Pintu Gerbang Sibu to witness the award ceremony for the senior scouts. Receiving an award on such a day was the most prestigious honor for any scout, and all would aspire to be the scout selected to give the summary of the year's activities for the association. I was not the one selected to give the summary and for that, I was grateful. I could never stand in front of a large crowd to make a speech, but Sean could. He was selected to do the honor because he was the President of the Boy Scouts for schools.\nMy job was much simpler. Being the Vice-President, I was very much behind the scenes, content to ensure that everything was in smooth running order. It was an hour to go before the ceremony began, and I had put the final touches to the stage. Walking down the stage, I saw the ushers in a state of panic. When they saw me, they ran to me to tell me that Sean was caught in a traffic jam and would not be able to make it on time. Someone else had to give the summary. All of them looked meaningfully at me, and I could feel my knees beginning to buckle.\n\nAll their arguments against my reluctance were valid. I had a copy of the speech as well as the benefit of having seen Sean rehearse it. I was the Vice-President and therefore should rightly take his place. Finally, when I had exhausted all my excuses, I was firmly told not to decline any longer and they left then, content that I would do the right thing. Once alone, I sank down onto the floor, totally devastated by the situation.\n\nI could not do it, I knew I was not a confident speaker, and the thought of presenting a summary in front of so many distinguished guests horrified me. I would definitely shame all boy scouts, as I could not even come close to Sean's effective and eloquent style. To think that the prestige of the scouts would take a beating because of me! The burden of responsibility troubled me greatly.\n\nBut there was really no way out of the situation. In the end, I quickly rehearsed the speech and got ready to go on stage for the presentation. I looked calm and collected but inside, I was a trembling mass of jelly. Just before I was called on to the stage to do the presentation, I suddenly felt faint and unable to think straight. I could not remember what I was supposed to say, and then, the realization that I was going to fail caused me to break out in cold sweat. I held the side of the wall tightly and tried to move my leaden feet forward.\n\nSuddenly, I felt a friendly pat on my shoulder and turned around. It was Sean! He had made it on time. Smiling at me, he walked onto the stage and proceeded to speak into the microphone. I was so relieved that I started laughing uncontrollably. There was mercy in the world after all."

They had always been close to us as my family often invited them home for meals and our parents would sit down in the evenings and chat. Their two children and us were also childhood playmates who scraped our knees rolling down the slope behind our flats and picked the mangoes off the trees in Pak Ali's garden.\nThus, when Uncle Ng fell ill with kidney disease, we felt the impact as much as his family did. He was the sole breadwinner in the family, with Auntie Ng staying home to take care of the family. Uncle Ng was always a responsible husband and father, ensuring that they were well-provided for. But he had only a basic diploma in electronics and could not put aside much each month as savings. As a result, his family was cash-strapped when Uncle Ng was warded in hospital in serious condition.\n\nAuntie Ng had not worked for the past twenty years and going back into the job market now was a harrowing experience. It was tough finding a job with her lack of experience. So when she finally found a low-paying job as a factory operator, she took it immediately. But going to work was difficult. She had to rush home at lunchtime to cook for her children and then go back to work. After that, she rushed back again to cook dinner, following which she reported for work as an office-cleaner in the business district. In the midst of this busy schedule, she still found time to visit Uncle Ng in the hospital.\n\nWhenever we could, my family helped out. My mother would offer to cook for the children and watch them after school so that Auntie Ng would not have to dash about. Yet, she grew increasingly haggard and thin, worn out by her commitments. Uncle Ng showed little signs of recovering, and this added to her problems. Her children were also faring badly in school as they were too immersed in their misery to concentrate on their studies. They missed both their mother and father. Somehow, they could feel that things were only going to get worse.\n\nSix months after Uncle Ng was hospitalized, his kidneys failed completely and he passed away after some severe complications. His family was devastated and so was mine. We were united in our grief, sitting together each night reminiscing about the good old days when Uncle Ng's booming voice and hearty laugh was still with us. In the end, Auntie Ng emerged a new person, stronger because she had no choice. All this time, our families grew closer, and vowed to support each other in the tough days ahead."

Yet, something gnawed at me, trying to get me to remember it. Suddenly, I realized where I had seen the jewelry. They were identified as stolen from the owner's house a few weeks ago. Apparently, the owner's son was badly hurt in the robbery. I was aghast.\nWhen Ah Gna came to see me a few days ago, I should have suspected something. After all, we moved in different circles ever since he joined the local street gang a few years back. He hardly acknowledged my presence in school, so his visit came as a big surprise. When he asked me to keep a small parcel safe for him for a while, I did so without hesitation. Perhaps, it was fear of his connections that made me do so unquestioningly. But when he did not turn up in school after that, my suspicions were aroused. In the end, I had come home to open the parcel only to realize that I was holding stolen property in my hands!\n\nIn the end, I decided to go to the police with the parcel. On my way to the nearest police post, I chanced upon Ah Gna loitering about the void deck. He came up to me quickly and asked where I was going with the parcel. He looked so menacing that at first I thought of lying to him. But in the end, my indignation won out. After all, why should I be afraid when I was innocent in the entire thing? He had implicated me in his trouble and for that, I would never forgive him.\n\nWhen I told him calmly what I was going to do, he almost spat out threats to kill me if I did that. But I stood firm, knowing that I was doing the right thing. That was until he whipped out a lethal-looking knife and threatened me with it. I found myself capitulating; I handed the parcel over meekly and then walked home quickly. For that act of cowardice, I earned myself the burden of shame forever. Even after he was caught and sent to the reformatory, I could not forgive myself for not having the nerve to stand up to him."

Anyway, I was at my wits' end and could think of no better idea. I resolved to take his advice about getting a street gang to resolve the problem with Ah Tong's gang. When the latter had come up to me to extort money, I had foolishly said \"no\". That was the beginning of all my problems.\nEvery day in school, I would see members of the gang everywhere I went. They would stare at me with meaningful nods and gestures, silently intimidating me into complying with their demand for protection fee. I thought it was ludicrous that I had to pay them to protect me from them! So I resisted them until the day I came back to class from recess to find my bag and books missing. After a frantic search, I found them soaked through in the dirty drain outside the school. I knew then that they meant business.\n\nI had then gone to Adnan for advice. He was a good friend, always full of ideas. His advice was that we were unlikely to convince the gang of anything. Only another gang could talk the same \"language\" as them. I decided to heed his advice and approached the Dragon Scar gang for help. Their leader, Seng Poh, was a familiar figure in the neighborhood. He was always swaggering about and everyone who had heard of his reputation gave him a wide berth. I almost trembled when I sputtered out my request. To my surprise, he was congenial and even patted me on my back to reassure me of his help. I felt so\nelated. Adrian was right!\n\nSoon after, the two gangs really did meet and Ah Tong's group agreed to back off. I was floating on air for the next two weeks, proud about being able to remain untouched by the gang. But my problems were only just starting. Seng Poh's gang soon came to me to demand payment for their \"services.\" They claimed that it had taken quite a bit of effort on their part to warn Ah Tong's group and therefore, they should be compensated accordingly. To my horror, what they asked for was three times what I was initially extorted for.\n\nI had no choice. I realized how foolish it was to think that gangs would be so kind as to help me. In the end, I paid up, content to be left alone finally."

I had thought that it was a brilliant idea to spend the day as an intrepid explorer, rising to the challenge of conquering the confusing maze of streets that crisscrossed the sleepy town we had arrived in days ago. But it seemed that a conspiracy was underfoot to thwart my conquest.\nSlowly, frustration mounted in me as I began to curse the reason why I was virtually \"trapped\" in this poor town. If May had not developed a fever so suddenly, we would be enjoying the beautiful sights of Acapulco instead of wallowing in this heat trap. My bitterness at being inconvenienced by the inconsideration of my best friend's fever soon escalated into a galling fury. I felt victimized and was aggrieved.\n\nThe proximity of the squalid houses around me seemed to suffocate me. White-hot anger simmered in me as I fed the growing resentment at May for having inconvenienced me time and again. I recalled the time when I had planned to go trekking in Nepal but was persuaded by her to wait till the June holidays. But when the time came, she fell ill with chicken pox. My twenty-first birthday celebration at a famous seafood restaurant was totally destroyed by her developing ugly red rashes while feeding on chilli crabs! I had to spend the most important birthday of my life in hospital with her. And now, her fever has forced our trip to revolve around the terribly unexciting prospect of trying to discover a place that was largely unworthy of any such effort. As I indulged in these angry thoughts, my indignation rose to such a feverish pitch that I simply had to run or I would burst. My feet started moving towards the dilapidated hotel that we were staying at.\n\nI looked up to the window of our room, trying to harden myself to storm up and pack my things to carry on with the trip without May. Why should I curtail my plans just because she could not come along? She should just stay in this godforsaken place and recuperate, I thought, trying to convince myself that I was right. Finally, I gathered up enough steam and proceeded to rush in.\n\nSuddenly, a heavy hand on my shoulder halted me. I turned around and looked into the face of the hotel-keeper. He looked at me sadly and uttered only three words in his gravelly voice: \"She no more.\" I was paralyzed on the spot. A knot of fear tightened in my stomach as I fought to quell the scream that was building up in me. I was not aware of how I had gathered my legs to thunder into the room upstairs, but I did. When I entered the room, the foul stench of death seemed to cling to everything, even the curtains. May was lying on the bed, in a still repose that chilled me. Hot tears scalded my eyes as I moved closer.\n\nThrough the mist of my tears, I saw May's unadulterated joy when she found out that I had won a prestigious scholarship years ago. Her unswerving friendship had been my constant companion through twelve years of our lives, and now it was lost to me forever. I crumpled slowly to the floor, as my strength ebbed away slowly."

It must be a reflection of our increased levels of tolerance, I thought as I started to clear my books from the table. Suddenly, an ear-piercing scream sliced through the noisy atmosphere, stunning everyone into silence.\nJohn's hands were clasped over his ears, his face contorted into a mask of agony as his rounded mouth emitted the continuous scream. His chest was heaving, as if he had just expended a great deal of effort. It was not so much that he had shouted so grotesquely that appalled us; rather, it was the fact that he had actually forced himself into our consciousness that was galling.\n\nJohn was considered an outcast in class. Nobody liked him or wanted to have anything to do with him, not after we had found out from a reliable source that he was a brat. A brat is defined as someone who insists on displaying his intelligence in class and consequently humiliating the rest of us. For that transgression, John was excluded from all class activities and camaraderie. He was dismissed by our frosty reactions to his overtures. When he finally realised how undesirable his friendship was to us, he retreated into his shell in defeat.\n\nBut now, his frustration had broken through that resignation and asserted itself. We were upset at his audacity. John looked around him, hoping to find some sympathy but found only reproving stares and tightly-pursed lips. His voice came out as a croak, \"I'll like to read, please\". We turned away from him, sealing the impression that we did not care. But our stony hearts could not shut out the smothered sobs that came from his corner. Seeing that we were angry with him, Tim's wickedness went to work and he produced a tin of glue, which he flourished in front of us. We did not like Tim either, for he was a bully and played awful tricks on other people. But he ranked on the same level as John in our minds, and we were not bothered by his tin of glue.\n\nSuddenly, Tim ran over to John and poured the glue at him. It trickled down his cheeks and mouth. Tim laughed merrily and announced, \"Now he can't scream anymore! Isn't it great?\" The deathly silence that greeted his triumphant announcement was broken only by the muffled cries of pain that came from John. His cheeks were an angry red now, looking like they were blistering. His mouth was slightly glued at the sides and with each moan, his lips tore a little and became bloody. We sprang into action. Someone rushed out to call the teacher while the rest of us tried to calm him down by telling him that it was not too bad. We had to stop him from crying as it only split his flesh further. When the ambulance arrived, a few of us decided to accompany him to hospital. We were all aggrieved by how much unnecessary pain our silly pride had caused him.\n\nAt the hospital, the doctor attended to John and fortunately, he recovered soon after the doctor injected him with painkillers although the burnt marks from the glue were still discernible. We were amazed at how lucky John had been when the doctor told us that had the glue got into his eyes, he would be blind. We rushed in to see him at the ward, clamouring to tell him how lucky he had been. But he only smiled and said that he was truly lucky because he finally felt our concern for him. The hard knot of pride that kept us from being his friend melted away with the tears that we now shed when we realised how cruel we had been. It was a lesson that we would never forget."

The strange thing about our relationship was that we never exchanged photographs and hence, had no knowledge of how the other person looked like. Part of the reason was that I did not want him to know that the descriptions I had written of myself were actually overrated!\nI reached the KLIA airport bright and early to avoid the possibility of the plane landing early. This was Pierre's first time in Malaysia and I did not want to be a bad hostess. But my early arrival at the airport only added to the anxiety of waiting for him to arrive. All the while, I kept thinking of how Pierre would react when he finally saw me. My impression of a Frenchman was one who was suave and dashing - every schoolgirl's dream of a Prince Charming. His letters were always charming and humorous, adding to my impression of a gorgeous pen friend.\n\nBut how would he view me? I am an average-looking schoolgirl with no outstanding physical features. I began to perspire under the weight of being discovered to be a fraud, even though the airport terminal was air-conditioned. The plane was to arrive in an hour's time, and that left me little time to do anything to improve my appearance. I started to panic.\n\nYet, a part of me was excited about finally meeting Pierre. This was due,  in no small part, to his exceptional good looks. Suddenly, I realised that he could have exaggerated his physical appearance as well. Then, I began to worry about how he could actually be quite monstrous-looking. How would I be able to show him off at all the activities that I had arranged for him then? My friends would laugh at me!\n\nThe announcement that Pierre's flight was delayed shifted my thoughts to more pertinent ones. I wondered at the delay; he was arriving on a carrier that was normally trustworthy. What could possibly delay it? I began to entertain thoughts of the plane being in trouble, and soon, I was frightening myself with thoughts of Pierre's plane crashing as a result of engine trouble. I tried to stop such unwholesome thoughts, but failed miserably as my hyperactive imagination took control.\n\nThings got worse in my imagination as the hours dragged on. I could not understand the delay and the airline counter was not helpful either. They merely said that the plane was due soon and there was nothing to worry about. I was reaching the end of my patience with their politeness when it was announced that the plane had landed. I rushed to the arrival hall and tried to make out which of them was Pierre once the passengers started streaming out. But it was in vain. Everyone and no one looked like Pierre to me. It was extremely frustrating. Suddenly, a hand tapped me on the shoulder and I heard a voice saying, \"You must be Clare. Every bit as lovely as I had imagined.\"\n\nI turned around to look at Pierre. I grinned as I realised that Mr Prince Charming had arrived."

        "content": "Uncle Lee came into my life in 1998. I was then studying in the normal stream in Form One in a neighborhood school. Although derogatory labeled as a slow learner by teachers and a non-achiever by relatives, I remained unconcerned. It suited my indolent nature. \"Let my overachieving big sister garner all the laurels and praise,\" I thought.\nUncle came from Ipoh. He was a lazy layabout like me and a luckless gambler. Auntie Mabel, his wife, had divorced him. When Uncle came to live with us, we hit off famously. I followed him as often as I could after school. He would regale me with stories of his bravery during the Japanese Occupation. Sometimes, he would talk of his gambling exploits. Uncle had no job, and no steady sources of income except for his wins once in a while at mahjong sessions. Whenever he won, we would fritter our time at McDonald's. Naturally, my school grades deteriorated even further.\n\nHowever on 31st December, 2012, I received a telephone call which changed my life. I was about to retire to bed on New Year's Eve when the phone rang harshly. It was from Uncle. He was gasping in a drunken voice,\" Matthew.. I think I am dying... in Pearlee pub... come fetch me... do... do not follow my way. \" His voice trailed off brokenly. Heart beating and cold with fear and panic, I informed my family. We rushed over to Uncle's favorite pub but it was of no use. He was stone dead when we arrived.\n\nBesides us, Uncle had no relatives or friends to mourn his passing. But I remembered his parting words to me very vividly on the night of his funeral. I reviewed my wasted life in the past... how I frittered my time away in unhealthy and unproductive pleasures and pursuits. There and then, I decided to heed Uncle's advice and he the man Uncle and my parents or teachers would be proud of. I would not follow Uncle's ways.\n\nFrom then on, my elders and friends detected a marked change in my character. I applied myself faithfully to my studies. In no time, I was promoted to the express stream and at the following year's end, was commended as the most improved pupil. My parents also noted a marked change in my discipline. I no longer frittered away my time after school. I became an active Boys' Scout and also a youth leader at the local boys' club. My neighbors remarked on my polite ways and I made new friends who were good role models.\n\nWhat gratified me most, however, were the happy looks of my parents who praised me and my teachers who commended me. On the first anniversary of my Uncle's death, I was chosen to give a speech. What I said moved those present to tears. I commended Uncle for his generous ways and love for me, but most of all, I noted that Uncle regretted his bad ways on his deathbed and gave me the best present I ever had - his parting words of regret and advice to me to mend my ways."

        "content": "Whenever November 15 approaches, I feel a twinge of remorse and guilt with some considerable sadness, for it was on this date that I failed to remember the birthday of my then beloved and best friend, Masitah.\nWe had been together since primary school. Our tastes and interests were similar and we were as inseparable as twin peas in a pod.\n\nOn November 15, 2012, the eve of her birthday, we had our first and major quarrel. She had gone to a friend's party without informing me. It happened to be a Saturday and that party she had gone to was one I would kill for. To add insult to injury, she knew the organiser and had been invited to bring along a friend. \"Why did she not invite me?\" I kept brooding over it. Then the truth dawned on me. She knew that I was interested in a cute guy called Kelvin who was attending the party. There it was - the answer loud and clear - she did not want any competition as she was also interested in that guy. How selfish of her!\n\nI decided to have an \"eye for an eye\". The next day would be her birthday. I decided not to attend her celebrations but to visit Singapore with my mum instead.\n\nThe day of Masitah's birthday saw me in Singapore shopping happily with my mum. However, halfway through my lunch, I regretted my decision of not attending her birthday celebration. I knew that she was very sentimental about her birthday Her mother had died in a tragic car accident on the day she was celebrating her twelfth birthday. This was the day in which she would be sad and moody. I always accompanied her on this day. Mine was the shoulder on which she sobbed on whenever she remembered her mum.\n\nThere and then, I decided to terminate my visit to Singapore and return to Johor Bahru. Mum was initially flustered and irritated on learning about this. However, when I explained the situation, she was understanding as all good mums are. We drove back to Johor Bahru but horror of horrors! There was a massive jam at the Causeway.\n\nInitially; I thought I would be held up by an hour. However, it was a good two-hour wait before we reached the immigration checkpoint. At that point, I realized to my horror that my bag containing my passport was missing. My heart sank, but after I collected myself, I thought back and knew that, barring a thief, it must have been left at the restaurant in Singapore. We made a dash back there and to our relief, the items were there. We received them gratefully from the staff.\n\nBy this time, it was 5 p.m. Driving back to the Causeway, my spirits sank again. The traffic jam was even worse than before. I knew that I would never make it on time to invite Masitah to blow the candles on her birthday cake. Having no next of kin, I was always the one who acted as her parents to preside over her birthday party which she always celebrated without fail.\n\nMum offered me the use of her mobile phone to call Masitah, but it was to no avail. We could not reach her as the phone line was perpetually busy. All the while, I was feeling remorseful and sick at heart. What would she he feeling at my absence and betrayal of our friendship? No doubt she had done me a wrong the day before, but this was a major slight on my part which she would not forget.\n\nSuffice it to say that I made it her party at 9.30 p.m. Belatedly, I handed her the teddy bear which she had hinted she would like as a birthday present from me. She seemed composed, thanked me graciously and then... totally IGNORED me! How could she? After all the trouble and pains I took to reach her place! But when I thought it over, I knew that she must have felt that I had betrayed her. Moreover, she may have had no inkling that the hurt I felt was so deep when I realized that she had not brought me to the party the day before.\n\nTill today, I have not been with Masitah again. My attempts at contacting her and explaining to her have been rebuffed. It really has been a case of \" an eye for an eye\"."

        "content": "\"Zhi Hao, let's go and buy something for Syahirah,\" Wei Zhi asked me. He was thrilled to have received a birthday invitation from her. Everyone knows how rich and snobbish Syahirah was. She had a personal driver who brought her to school in a posh car.\nOn close checking, we found that only two other boys, Karan and Adi, had received similar invitations to her classy home in Century Heights. Then, we were presented with a problem: What were we going to give to the birthday girl? We decided, after some discussion, to make a trip to 1 Utama Shopping Centre to make our purchases. Karan and Adi had never visited the place and were thrilled to bits by the numerous shops selling the latest in sports fashion and gear. However, I directed them to our objective and after some window-shopping, we made our choices. Karan wanted to buy her a mammoth jigsaw\npuzzle, Adi a Barbie doll, Wei Zhi an Umbro jacket and as for me, I would present her with a crystal figure of a swan. It was then that the group showed signs of division.\n\nWei Zhi started teasing Karan, \"Why would a girl want a jigsaw puzzle?\" The sensitive Karan then answered angrily, \"Same to you, no brains.\" Why would a rich girl like her don such a cheap sports jacket?\" I tried to get them to make peace with each other but by then, they turned mild Adi. \"Use your head, Adi,\" they chortled, \"do you think she would want a Barbie doll... it's so childish.\"\n\nOur group carried on bickering over what to buy outside a restaurant. Seeing the curious stares of a few passers-by, I urged my friends to settle their differences along the corridor outside. After some discussion, they decided to pool their resources to buy an expensive present for her. But what present were we to give her? A few minutes of pondering led my three friends to turn and look at me. \"Let's go with Zhi Hao's suggestion. We'll get the swan. It's classy and not too expensive. \"\n\nAt once, we headed to Uncle All' s crystal shop. However, as we gazed at the figure behind the shop window, we noticed the price tag. It was too expensive as it bore the figure RM628 which was way above our budget even if we had pooled our resources together. It was then that they became unreasonable to me.\n\nThey blamed me unfairly for choosing the swan. I spluttered out in hurt that I had made an honest mistake. I had not seen the last figure \"8\" and had thought the price was RM62.\n\nBy this time, we had spent a considerable amount of time in the centre looking out for suitable gifts. Then, to my horror, Karan and Wei Zhi proposed that we draw lots to see who the unlucky one was who would bear the full cost of the gift. They stared down at humble Adi, who meekly accepted the decision. I was the only dissenting voice. Very unwillingly, I watched them prepare the lots. I drew my lot and as luck would have it, I was the sacrificial lamb to bear the cost. However, in my heart, I decided there and then to have none of their nonsense and fled the scene.\n\nThat was the end of our unsuccessful shopping trip. I learned that the boys felt shameful about the whole incident after that and departed from the place too, without buying anything. They apologized to me the next day. We attended Masitah's party. What they gave her individually, I did not know. All I know is that the unsuccessful shopping trip left a sour feeling in my mind for months."

        "content": "I remember that I was in Form 3 when I heard the much eagerly anticipated news. We were going to Genting Highlands! My sister and I had heard so much about the Theme Park there that we were raring to go and try out its rides.\nWe arrived there after a long and tiring coach journey. Wisps of clouds were scudding nearby only metres above our heads. After enjoying the free buffet lunch, we had much energy to expend. My sister had retrieved a sketch plan of the amusement complex it had two sections: indoor and outdoor. We decided to explore the outdoor rides first, while there was daylight and the weather was fine. Firstly, we had to consider the question of financing our quest to experience the pleasures of the park. After much cajoling, we managed to wheedle RM250 from our parents.\n\nThe first thing we headed for was the gigantic Rollercoaster. We had seen it rising like a gigantic steel super structure as our coach inched up the mountain passes. However, as we neared the structure, we spied a notice. It announced, much to our disappointment, that the rollercoaster was closed for repairs.\n\nNoticing just a slight queue, we made a dash for the choo-choo train ride. \"So childish!\" My sis scorned. However, its path went round the outdoor park and we could have an overview of the fair's rides. Having made a round of the park, we headed for our desired. The outdoor lake had only a smattering of paddle boats. As the sky was overcast and the pond water had a dirty slimy-green appearance, we decided to give it a miss. Instead, we decided to try the \"Giant Octopus\". This was a contraption which had box-like seats at the end of its tentacle-like arms. We got ourselves securely strapped. Then, without warning, we felt ourselves lifted by its arms to a height of about ten metres. We had a view of a fair number of the park's rides, including the dark, bobbing heads of the jostling crowd below. Then we were swinging round. Just as I was feeling dizzy, the Octopus let out a \"sigh\" and suddenly deposited us at ground level.\n\nMy sis and I had enough of being passive participants. We had a go at trying our luck at some game stalls. After garnering a few miserable packets of crackers, we decided that our money would be better spent on the Bumper Cars. What a time we had! We had a go at ramming our own and other cars silly. Having emerged from these vehicles feeling slightly dizzy and winded, we decided to take a break. It was a relief to slake our thirst with icy cold cola drinks.\n\nNext, we visited the indoor section. This was within the hotel complex. We nearly got lost moving about the numerous passageways. When we finally found the place, a noise like a roaring waterfall hit us. Scores of arcade machines were being operated by eager young people. Amid the flashing lights and electronic sounds, we made our way to a queue forming beside the entrance to a room. The sign outside proclaimed `Journey to the Stars Have a thrilling space experience you will never forget.\" After a half-hour wait, our patience was wearing thin and our nerves were being frazzled by the noisy din. Suddenly,\nI spotted the entrance price. It was RM 15 and not RM5 as I had thought. My sister scolded me for my carelessness. Making mental calculations, we decided that the money would be better spent on a pizza meal at the nearest pizza outlet.\n\nThere and then, we broke out from the queue and headed back to Mum and Dad who were waiting for us outside the park. Thus ended our visit which was thoroughly enjoyable."

        "content": "Ranee was her name. This much I gathered in a somewhat rambling conversation one day. Everyone in my neighborhood, however, called her the \"Mad Woman.\" She lived alone in a one-room flat in the block opposite mine. Once in a while, I could see her in the corridor outside her flat. She would invariably point at the sky and chant the same refrain, \"Shanti, you cheat. I curse you.\" She would repeat this, again and again. No one knew who she was - not even the neighbors. Frequently, folks would see her scrounging for leftovers at food centers or searching in the rubbish bins nearby. Once in a while, some folks would pity her and go to her flat to bring her some food. However, she would scold these kind souls and fling the food out onto the corridor. She would shout out to all and sundry that she was not a beggar.\nOne Saturday, my friends and I were slated by our school to do some charity work. We were asked to visit some old folks. We decided to visit Madam Ranee out of compassion for a lonely soul. However, we were dreading the thought of her scolding us when we knocked on the door. Therefore, we were astonished when we heard a sweet voice welcoming us in. She thanked us for the food parcel we brought her and in the conversation that followed, we realized that we were talking to her in one of her sane moments. However, after ten minutes had elapsed, she started shouting at us and chased us out of her flat.\n\nThis much, however, we gleaned from her past. It seemed that she had an only daughter, Shanti, who had cheated her of her life savings. Shanti had run away from her home with her lover. My classmate, Mary, and I were wondering how to help her when suddenly Mary asked me.\n\n\"Li Lian, didn't Madam Ranee mention that Shanti studied in SMK Convent before?\"\n\nI nodded in the affirmative. Then we realized that Shanti, her daughter, had studied in the same secondary school we were now in. We decided to try to find her. To do this, we paid a visit to Mrs Low, a teacher, who had been teaching in our school for decades. When Mrs Low was briefed by us on the situation, she tried her best to help. From Madam Ranee, we gathered that Shanti would be twenty-six years old by now. Mrs Low decided to look through some old school magazines some ten years ago, around the year that she would have left school after her SPM examination. As she was flipping through some old, musty pages, our old teacher suddenly shrieked, \"There she is!\" We stared at the page and saw a class photo. Mrs Low was pointing at a name below, \"Shantimani a/p Rajah\".\n\n\"So where do we go to from here?\" we wondered aloud. Suddenly, I had a brainwave. \"Why not go through some telephone directories to see if we could locate her there?\" It was a faint shot, but we got down to it eagerly. I then suggested that we look into other issues of the directory. We struck lucky with Directory 1993 - there it was: \"Shantimani d/o Rajah\" and the telephone number. With beating hearts, we waited for a response when Mrs Low called up the number. When we saw Mrs Low's face brightening up, we knew that we had succeeded in contacting Shanti. Mrs Low spoke to her at some length.\n\nLater, we learnt from Mrs Low of Shanti's joy in learning about her mother. She had tried frantically to contact her mother the day her lover left her. On that same day, she realized the enormity of her sins. She had tried contacting her mother to repay the money she had taken and to express her love. She was now a successful businesswoman. It was fortunate that Shanti's maiden name was listed in the directory as she had not married yet.\n\nShanti was soon reunited with her mother. The joy of seeing her long-lost daughter restored Madam Ranee's sanity. As for Mary and me, we were commended by our principal when she learnt about our kind acts. Shanti donated a sum of money to our school and later brought Mary and me out for a special treat."

The end of November saw us brimming with excitement and relief Relief because we had just finished our SPM examination and excitement because we had planned and were about to embark on a trekking trip in Northern Thailand.\nSiti had been to Thailand before. She always waxed lyrical about the fabulous hawker food there and the endless shopping bargains. We were planning to indulge in the food and to visit the famous Chiang Mai night market. But most of all, we were looking forward to trekking in Thailand's mountains and visiting the hill tribes there. All three of us loved the outdoors and had gone on expeditions in Malaysia. The night before the trip saw us packing. We especially took pains to arrange our camping gear and mountain equipment. As luck would have it, Sid got herself involved in a physical fracas that night. We did not know this until much later when the troubles were over.\n\nShe had gone down to the void deck of her block to escort her sister up to her flat. Her sister was on her way back from tuition. While Siti was there, she noticed a group of girls staring at her. When she bravely approached them to ask them what the matter was, they set upon her. She was punched in the chest. It was fortunate that she had fallen down and a male passer-by appeared just then. The girls fled from the scene. Siti managed to stand up with his aid. She seemed all right and made a quick check to see if there were bruises or cuts.\n\nSomewhat shaken, she made her way back to her flat and her room. It was there that her sister found her crying when she came back from her tuition. Sin told her the matter and elicited a promise from her not to inform her parents or any of her friends. It was Siti's nature not to trouble and worry others. Hence, we embarked on our expedition with her, not knowing about the beating.\n\nSoon, we were caught in the joys of our trip. The shopping done and the food savored, we embarked on our third objective - that of trekking Thailand's famous forested mountains. The morning air was fresh as we placed one energetic foot after the other up the slopes. Every interesting flower, plant or animal life was an occasion for stopping and to observe. Siti was our leader and led the way. However, halfway up the hill, we noticed her panting and visibly tired.\n\n\"What's wrong, Siti?\" we asked. \"Are you all right?\" She replied in the affirmative but five minutes later, she stumbled and suddenly fell. We rushed towards her. She was pale but what horrified us was the dark blood that had covered her lips. We surmised that the blood came from internal injuries. Siti needed help quickly. But how were we to obtain medical assistance in such an isolated area? There was no other option but to bring her down the slopes to the nearest village. This we did, taking turns to give her a piggyback. It was a tortuous descent, in contrast to the earlier climb. In addition, hordes of pesky mosquitoes decided then to gorge themselves on our defenceless sweet Malaysian blood. At one stage, I stumbled and sprawled onto the ground, bringing the hapless Siti onto the ground with me.\n\nWords cannot describe our relief when we finally bore down on the village and found medical help there. An assessment by the local doctor confirmed internal injuries brought about by a fight and subsequent fall. Through his kind help, we were able to summon a helicopter to ferry Sin to a hospital in Chiang Mai. Sin was in a state of unconsciousness as the craft took off into the air. We tried our best to reach Chiang Mai Hospital in a hired jeep quickly When we arrived, we learned that her condition was critical and she had to be operated on. Sin's parents were informed. We paced the wards, praying and hoping.\n\nSiti survived the operation which was a success. Her parents arrived to learn of its success. Her condition improved steadily. Mr Ali and his wife thanked us profusely. We stayed in Chiang Mai until Sid was better. When she was conscious, she revealed her fight and injuries to her parents. Her parents scolded her for keeping it a secret and remarked that she had caused much trouble to us, her friends. However, we defended Sid by saying that it was typical of her selfless nature. We also made a vow to return to Chiang Mai with Sid to complete the unsuccessful climb up the hills."

Not only do they bring us into the world, they are our household keepers and our moral and emotional confidants when we face problems.\nI have a small family. My elder brother and I have been dependent and close to our mother. We love our Dad, but we seldom see him. When he is with us, he advises us to study hard and to be good, useful people. However, he is very strict. It is Mum who saw me through my childhood to where I am now. I was a naughty hyperactive child who was prone to illnesses. Mum looked after my health, advised me about my studies, friends, money and so on. Now that I am a teenager, I see Mum less often and spend more time with my friends. However, unlike some of my friends who drift further away from their parents when they grow older, my relationship with Mum is still very close.\n\nI am quite an over-achiever. This goes with my hyperactive nature. In primary school, I took part in too many activities. However, nowadays I am more focused in my studies. I am also a prefect and athlete. Consequently, Mum is a bit concerned about my busy schedule. When I am feeling down, I seek Mum's consoling words for she is always the one who asks me to slow down, rest more often, sleep earlier and drink more water. There was a time when I skipped meals owing to my heavy schedule. Consequently, I developed gastric problems. Mum read much about this ailment and always give me advice when I experience discomfort.\n\nLike typical teenagers, my friends and I are followers of fashion. However, I am wise enough to consult Mum on what is wear sensible. She always advises me not to set myself apart from my classmates as she knows how important it is for us to look \"cool\". However, when I asked her if I could dye my hair or have facials, she would put her foot down. She felt that the first request was not decent and the second was unnecessary expense. However, as I grow older, my tastes in fashion grow increasingly dissimilar from Mum's. I have, on a number of occasions, not taken her advice regarding fashion. There was once when I bought a dress although my mum did not think it suited me. I had to admit later that I had bought it on impulse and the style was indeed not quite suitable for me.\n\nLike most teenagers, my friends are important to me. I always consult Mum about my relationship problems with friends. I heed Mum's advice about boys too - about understanding their nature and not developing any close relationship at this stage. If I have any problems with the opposite sex, I will always consult Mum unlike some of my friends who consult their friends on these. I tell my friends that their mums are more mature and have experience so they can advise them better than their young, immature friends.\n\nStudies mean a lot to me. Currently, I am unsure about whether I should enrol in the Arts or Science stream. Also, the holidays are looming ahead. Should I take a part-time job? Guess who will I consult for advice? No prizes for guessing the right answer !\n\nI have found that Mum's advice is often well thought-out and fair. I really believe that mothers know best."

Some are ministers, businessmen or scientists. There is a strong parent-support group which organizes activities to help the school. However, the person the school feels the most indebted to is Mr Lee Kim Zew, the famous philanthropist. His forefathers had donated generously to our school, but Mr Lee exceeded their generous donations.\nOn the evening of June 12, 2008, the school staff gathered in the Imperial Restaurant. They had come to attend a dinner to honor Mr Lee for his generous help in the past. The teachers and representatives from parents and students were at their tables awaiting the arrival of the philanthropist himself The majority of philanthropists are humble people and they shun the limelight. Mr Lee, however, was an exception. He was a businessman and liked publicity. It was therefore gratifying to him that his arrival at the restaurant was greeted with arousing applause. A few reporters were present and light bulbs flashed as his pictures were taken. He was ceremoniously escorted to the VIP dining table which was covered in a resplendent red. A plate of cold appetizers promptly appeared on the table for the consumption of the distinguished guests.\n\nThe Chairman of the night's proceedings, Mr Tan, went on stage. He lauded the distinguished guests' generosity and help to society. Then he invited Mr Lee to the stage to make a speech. As Mr Lee got up from his chair, an inexperienced waiter moved forward with a bottle of champagne. Mr Lee, upon rising up, collided with the waiter. The contents of the wine bottle spilled all over the visibly shocked guest. There was a pinkish stain on his spotless white shirt. Everyone at the table was momentarily shocked. Then, all at once, they moved to help the guest.\n\nIt was then that Mr Lee showed his indignation. Face flushed red with irritation and embarrassment, he brushed aside all attempts at helping him wipe his shirt. We could see that his pride had been hurt and he was trying to recover his lost dignity. The Chairman wisely left him alone beyond the act of offering a clean dry cloth for him to wipe his shirt. Directing a baleful stare at the cowering and unfortunate waiter, Mr Lee made his way as dignified as he could, to the stage. The guests recovered from their embarrassment at seeing the sorry spectacle. They warmly applauded his courage in going up to the stage.\n\nMr Lee mounted the steps, pleased that he was on top of the situation. But as he faced the microphone and reached into the breast pocket of his coat, we saw him frown. His notes for his speech were all soggy and limp with the spilled wine. Mr Lee flushed again, but only for an instant. Then he regained his composure and showed why he was such a great businessman. With dignity and charm, he declared, \"Only I can make a speech in such wet weather.\" When everyone clapped and cheered, he knew that he had carried the day with him. He had saved himself and the organizers from a potentially embarrassing situation. Mr Lee carried on with his impromptu speech, punctuated by spontaneous clapping and cheering by the guests. At the end of his brief ten-minute speech, the people gave him a standing ovation.\n\nThe next day, the press carried an article on the dinner. Mr Lee was praised for his courage and dignity in carrying out his speech despite the accident. Mr Lee must have felt very pleased that he had got the better of the incident. The next year, he even increased his donation to the school. As for the unfortunate waiter, he was spared any recrimination as everyone recognized that it was not his fault and his remorse was punishment enough."

However, one night, I personally witnessed its demise.\nWhile I was switching channels, I saw the screen light slowly flicker and die off.\nMy brother, the DIY expert, when summoned, could not restore it to working\ncondition. This set had held many fond memories for my family. We had seen\nnumerous drama series on it and viewed many National Day Parades together.\nWe were thus determined to obtain a set of the same brand and size. However,\nwe had a problem. Dad had lost his job and wanted a smaller set. My sister and\nI surveyed the shops and sadly concluded that we could not afford one with our\noriginal size and brand for less than RM1,000.\nSo it was with surprise and mounting excitement when I heard from my\nbrother that Summit Parade was celebrating its tenth anniversary by having\nspecial offers this Saturday. And guess what? The best offer was a television set\nat half its original price. As soon as I heard the news of the special offer, I knew\nwhat I had to do. A close scrutiny of the newspaper advertisement on this\nspecial event revealed that the set was of the same brand and size as our spoilt\none.\n\nAt 1.30 p.m. on Saturday, the deejay would announce the shop where the\noffer was to take place. I knew that there were only three shops selling electrical\ngoods in that centre. On Friday afternoon after school, I reconnoitred the\ncentre. From the deejay stand, I made a mental map of the nearest route to\neach electrical store, noting down the nearest stairs, lifts or escalators.\n \n\nSaturday morning dawned bright and clear. However, when I woke up, I\nreceived a call from my classmate that there would be an athletic practice that\nafternoon. My heart sank and I was just about to ask my brother to take on the\ntask of securing the offer when another call came. My classmate informed me\nthat our coach was indisposed and the practice was called off.\n\nWhew! I then decided to go early to queue up and survey the territory.\nAt 1 p.m. sharp, I approached the deejay stand. You could not miss the place\nbecause of the loud booming voice of the deejay who was rattling off the\nday's offers to a growing crowd around him, greedy for the day's offers.\n\nMy heart sank when I saw the crowd. There was a hundred-odd people and\ngrowing. Suddenly, there was a commotion at 1.20 p.m. It was not, however,\nabout the television offer but an announcement of free goodie bags on the\nsecond floor. Half the crowd made a noisy beeline for that. I thanked my lucky\nstars for the organiser's foresight. This would mean less of a crowd at the\nelectrical store and better security and order.\n\nSure enough, when the crowds had thinned out, on the exact minute, the\ndeejay uttered the words I was waiting for. \"Our best offer of the day, the\nSamsung television set will be at Ha...\" Before he could finish his announcement,\nI was off in a flash.\n\nHeart pumping and adrenaline coursing through my veins, I steeled my\nbody into a \"flying\" missile. I knew the store on the third floor. The lift was\nfurther away and the escalator would be crowded. The stairs to my left would\noffer the best route. I ran pell-mell with bewildered shoppers making way\nfor `this crazy boy'.\n\nSuffice it to say, I was panting and exhausted when I reached the store\nentrance. I was greeted with loud applause by the manager and his sales staff. I\nwas first and the set was mine!\nNeed I say more? My family was jubilant that night watching our favourite\nprogrammes again. Once again, I saw my dad's face light up after a month of\nunemployment. All the preparation was really worth it just to see him smile."

        "content": "I have a neighbor, Mrs Lim. She is a career woman -- pretty, smart-looking but constantly wearing a harassed look. This is because she has a baby to look after. Her husband is constantly overseas. She had a succession of maids, but none of them stayed for long.\nOne day she called for me. \"Nina\", she smiled in her sweetest manner. \"Can you do me a favor? Please look after my baby. My maid has just left. I need to go to town to meet my boss.\"\n\nHow could I reject a request couched in such a sweet cajoling manner? I agreed to try looking after Jeremy until her return. Anyway, I was on school holiday. I always had a fondness for babies. I used to play with baby dolls when I was young. Now, I would have a real, live one! It would be cute and fun. Mrs Lim gave me some instructions on feeding the baby and burping him. Then she left in a hurry. I was now the guardian of a little plump baby.\n\nJeremy, the \"cutie\", however turned out to be a pesky \"monster\". His wails were heard upstairs shortly after his mother left. The persistent cries summoned me up. I tried my best to cradle him comfortably but his wails did not cease. Thinking that he needed a change of environment, I walked around the house and even ventured into the garden. However, it was to no avail. Mrs Bala, my neighbor to the left, saw me and gave me some disapproving stares. Finally, she blurted out, \"The baby might be hungry, you know?\"\n\n\"Food! Why didn't I think of that?\" I thought. Putting Jeremy in his cot, I mixed some milk powder with hot water and eagerly gave the little one his bottle. However, the baby took a few hungry sips before he rejected it and started wailing again. At my wits' end, I called his mother but her line was busy. In desperation, I tried to remember my Living Skills lessons and suspected that the milk powder was not enough. Sure enough it was! The baby stopped crying after I had put in more scoops of the milk powder!\n\nThe next two hours were the happiest hours of my child care. Jeremy smiled and chortled as I sang lullabies or acted silly poses for him. Then, as he started crying again, I took him in his arms. The next moment, he yawned, nodded sleepily and instantly fell asleep.\n\nAfter depositing him in his cot, I went down wearily to the kitchen to fix myself a meal. However, this was not to be. While I was taking a drink, the familiar wails started again. When I entered his room, I saw that his diapers were loose. He was wet and had soiled himself. Yucks! It took me ages to clean him up and change his diapers.\n\nJeremy slept after this and I lay down on the floor to have a nap. Before I could nod off to sleep, I was awakened by the tyrant's screaming again. I carried him out of the house when I could not stop this. I noticed Mrs Bala in her garden. This time, the nasty lady was very helpful. She came over to my side. After examining him, she pronounced \"Colic!\"\n\nIt seemed that the baby was not burped properly and now he had stomach discomfort. Then my guardian angel appeared in the form of Mrs Bala. She volunteered to look after him until the mother came back. I was to be her assistant.\n\nWhen Mrs Lim came home, Mrs Bala briefed her on my misfortunes. The two of them had a good laugh at my expense while I glared at them. Mrs Lim gave me a pair of tickets to a concert that I badly wanted to go to. She thanked me and mentioned casually that she could make me the permanent babysitter. I turned down her offer politely, knowing very well now that I should not underestimate the responsibility of this seemingly easy job."

        "content": "An Inter-school Fashion Designing Competition was being held. Our art students were encouraged to participate. I was not an art student, but I had friends in the Art Club and they invited me to help them with some ideas. They thought I had creative ideas as I was always the one who came up with suggestions for posters and presents. They asked me to come up with designs for skirts and blouses, something completely new to me.\nI spent quite a bit of time poring through fashion magazines and books. Then, I got to work. Somehow, the designs I produced looked commonplace. I felt they lacked originality. I asked my sisters for their opinion. They politely praised them, but neither showed any extraordinary keenness and interest in getting their dresses sewn according to my designs. I was at a loss for ideas. My suggestions were due in two days' time and I did not want to let my friends down. In desperation, I asked my brother, who was good at digital art, to sketch a few ideas for me. He came up with several designs, but they were rather flamboyant.\n\nIt was at this point that Grandmother came to my rescue. She asked me to go into the garden and pick a few orchids and other wild flowers. I was very puzzled by her request. Nevertheless, I complied. She asked me to sit by her side and gave me what was probably the best lesson in fashion designing. She picked up the orchid and turned it upside down. Then, she drew my attention to the little \"fairy skirt\" that she held before me. Truly, it was a beautiful skirt. The petals flowed beautifully. Next, she asked me to note how Mother Nature chose her colors. They were exquisite. The orchid had a pale shade of yellow blending into a subtle shade of mauve. Grandmother went on to show me the marvels of nature in the other flowers I picked. Nature indeed is the best example of creativity and beauty.\n\nIn two days, I had four designs for my friends. The art teachers were fascinated by my designs and choice of colors. My friends then added their technical skills to my designs and produced the skirts and blouses.\n\nOn the day of the competition, I brought Grandmother along. On the runway were our girls parading in our nature-inspired clothes. I felt the pride swell in me with each step they took. And we took home the second prize that day. Grandmother only told me later that she was an art student herself."

        "content": "Human beings are daily being exposed to various experiences, ranging from the everyday to the exceptional. Naturally, there are many pleasant ones that people desire. On the other hand, however, there are some experiences that everyone would like to avoid. These are not necessarily terrible experiences; they can sometimes be periods of self-doubt and depression that we go through.\nA couple of years ago, I was quite close to a girl named Julia. For reasons unknown, Julia experienced a nervous breakdown during that time. No one, not even her best friend, could understand what had come over her. She began talking to thin air and sometimes lapsed into fits where she desperately tore at her hair and clawed her face, all caused by hallucinations. It was very problematic for her family. They tried to handle it for as long as possible, but they finally had no choice but to send her to mental hospital. When she arrived, she became agitated and had to be sedated. She was admitted for and kept under observation for a whole week.\n\nJulia's mother gave us regular updates about Julia's peaceful life in hospital. Everything was regular and methodical. The day would start with a shower at 7.00 a.m., followed by morning exercises and then a simple breakfast of soft bread and coffee. Patients would be given their medication, while doctors examined them on their rounds. Afterwards, the patients would clean up the ward and the corridors. Later in the day, there would be a one-on-one session with the resident psychiatrist. Julia herself later recounted how patients would fill the rows of small green chairs, waiting for their names to be called, and how the psychiatrist would ask her all sorts of strange questions. He discussed her hallucinations and the voices they represented, trying to understand their significance as mental images. Julia, however, never explicitly talked about what was actually said.\n\nEverything seemed aimed at building the patients' sense of purpose. After lunch, Julia would spend time in the Occupational Therapy hall, threading pastel-colored glass beads together to make wall hangings. These hangings were later sold to raise funds. She and the other patients would help to wash the crockery and cutlery after every meal, including the mid-afternoon Milo and biscuits breaks. There were also group singing sessions after dinner. The woman who conducted these sessions, according to Julia, was a serene middle-aged lady who smelt of talcum powder. Some others learnt how to prepare simple dishes under the supervision of a short, moustached man, but Julia usually chose the singing sessions as she missed singing in the school choir. It was her favorite time of the day because it most resembled her life outside the hospital.\n\nAt 9.30 p.m., the patients would begin getting ready for bed, and lights would be out by 10.00 p.m. Julia, however, often lay awake long into the night. Although the nurses and attendants were kind and friendly, trying to make the patients feel comfortable, it was not the same as home. Merely being there was a constant reminder that she was what others labeled \"crazy\".\n\nThree weeks passed in this fashion before Julia was discharged. She was not completely cured and was advised to be on medication as long as necessary, but she was more able to control her fits. However, she resented the whole affair and seemed very embarrassed about it. She did not seem able to face any of her friends after that. It certainly was a very difficult experience for her."

        "content": "My parents wanted me to learn the piano. No matter how much I protested, they eventually found and hired a tutor to coach my playing.\nFrom then on, a regular lesson schedule was implemented with the tutor, Mr Peterson, coming in on Friday afternoons at around three o'clock. This was my daily nap time, and I was always grumbling about having to forgo it every Friday. The tutor was very strict in the first few months, forcing me to repeat a problematic piece several times until he was satisfied. Mr Peterson was a good tutor, despite his strictness, and his explanations were very clear and simple. Soon, I could play several tunes adequately, and Mr Peterson decided to sign me up for a music examination.\n\nThe examination was about eight months away, a long time to me, but Mr Peterson made me work hard, giving me increasingly difficult pieces. I could not understand why I was being made to practise so hard. Every time I protested, my tutor told me very firmly that I was to strive to achieve success. Naturally, I was forced to continue struggling with increasingly complex chord progressions and often felt deep-seated resentment towards the glossy piano that sat in our living room. Towards the fourth month, however, things began to change. Mr Peterson began to skip lessons occasionally, and when he did turn up, he was very often rather late. I was usually much too frustrated to take notice of the dark circles growing around his eyes.\n\nOne day, he asked me to play two examination pieces, which I grudgingly did. I started with the first one, nervously pushing at the keys with my fingers. I ended up missing several chords and hitting the wrong keys, and stopped at the end in anticipation of a scolding. Nothing. Without looking at Mr Peterson, I began to repeat the first piece, certain that he wanted me to. This time, my fingers flowed easily over the keyboard, and I made no mistakes. However, Mr Peterson remained absolutely silent. I found it very strange, since he was usually either scolding me or praising me. After a moment, I launched into the second piece. As I was playing it, I noticed him nodding out of the corner of my eye. I assumed that he was acknowledging my skilful playing and I played on, heartened. Gradually, however, the nods became more and more pronounced, and my hands began to waver. Finally, Mr Peterson gave a rough grunt, and I jumped slightly. This was too much for me, and I turned to look at my tutor. He was bent over the keys, fast asleep.\n\nI stared at his half-open mouth, mesmerized, but eventually snapped out of it. Turning back to the musical sheet, I slowly lifted my hands and began playing the second piece from the beginning. I kept glancing round at him and could see that Mr Peterson was continuing to enjoy his nap. It was a warm afternoon, and the more I looked at him, the sleepier I became. Soon, my hands began to slow, and I fell into a deep slumber. Suddenly, someone was tugging at my sleeve, and I sat upright, rubbing my eyes vigorously. \"You must be tired,\" my tutor said. \"You fell asleep during the lesson. Nobody falls asleep during a music lesson, understand ?\"\n\nI was tempted to tell him what I had seen, but I did not want him to tell Mother that I had fallen asleep, so I obediently echoed, \"Yes, Mr Peterson. Nobody falls asleep during a music lesson.\""

        "content": "In an old town near the sea, there once lived a selfish and miserly merchant. He earned huge profits by fair and foul means. He cheated many innocent people into parting with their house leases. He lent money at high interest, knowing very well that the desperate borrowers would not be able to pay back. When that happened, he would confiscate their collateral, normally houses, land and other forms of property. He started raking in huge profits, but as more profits flowed in, he became more and more greedy.\nUnfortunately, even though he was doing well, he led a frugal life at home. He grumbled when his wife wanted money to run the home or to buy new clothes for the children. He criticised her when she prepared sweet dishes; he would scold her when she bought some costly jewellery or trinkets for their two young daughters.\n\n\"Money doesn't grow on trees,\" he would snap at his children when they asked for money to buy books and new dresses. They had to make do with torn books and old clothes which his wife would obtain from second-hand shops. Many clothes were hand-me-downs from relatives living nearby, who realising the merchant's miserly attitude, condescended to do so reluctantly. They disliked him intensely for treating his wife and children so shabbily but could do nothing about it.\n\nWhen his brothers, sisters and other relations came to ask for help, he insulted them cruelly and chased them away. There came a time when they began avoiding him or talking to him.\n\nAs he grew richer, he became more miserly. He dismissed the cook, the maid and the gardener. \"Now, who will pay them? All of us must share the work and thus, avoid wastage,\" he told his wife and children sagely.\n\n\"What will you do with all this money?\" they asked in perplexity. But he drove them away, screaming like a demon, \"I will do what I like with my money. I earn it. So I will hoard it if I want to. No one will question me, do you understand? Soon, I will become the richest man in town. Wait and see.\"\n\nIt took him many years to become the richest man in town. But none had a good word to say about him. The people sneered at him when he walked by, calling him `Money Bags'. They dubbed him `King Miser'. Some even went as far as to spit on the ground when he passed them.\n\nThe merchant finally realised that he had become the most hated and most despised person in town. He pondered over the matter for some time, irked by the cold reception he was getting from everyone. How could he redeem his name? How can he earn their respect? He went to an elder in the family, whom he had not visited for a long time, to seek his wise counsel. \"Should I open a charitable hospital? Should I establish a school for the children of the poor? Or open a chain of orphanages to help the underprivileged?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not a bad idea. In fact, I would normally have commended it. But it will cost a lot of money,\" the elder pointed out.\n\n\"I am ready to spend some money to win name and fame. I must regain my lost respect and popularity,\" the merchant replied. He imagined that he had been a much-loved and well-liked person before he had fallen in the eyes of the people in his town.\n\nThe old man smiled knowingly, \"How can you even think of helping strangers? Shouldn't you be attending to the needs of your near and dear ones first? Can't you see your wife and children walking around in rags? Don't you see how famished they look? Do they get even a square meal every day? Listen, my boy. Do your duty to your family first. Help your brothers and sisters and other members of your family who are poor. Opening hospitals for the poor or schools for the children of the poor must come later. You see, charity begins at home.\" Saying this, the wise man sent the merchant away.\n\nThe merchant returned home. He looked around his home with new eyes. For the first time, he noticed the forlorn and hopeless looks of his wife and children. They were badly dressed in old clothe which had seen many washes. They were frayed and sported some ghastly holes here and there. He also saw how skinny and starved his wife and children were looking. With tears in his eyes, he quickly walked out to the nearest restaurant, where he ordered all the food which he and his family had not enjoyed for a long time. He watched as his family ate the food ravenously, glad that the wise man had finally pointed out his greatest flaw. He promised silently to take better care of them as well as all his poor relatives who came to him in need.\n\nCharity indeed begins at home."

The Internet is a vast global computer network that provides access to all kinds of information. The biggest part of the Internet is known as the World Wide Web. It allows users to jump from site to site using links. The Internet offers many benefits. These have eased modem life and helped to increase the speed at which news and information is spread around the globe.\n\nOne benefit of the Internet is that it is a valuable resource for information. So much knowledge is now made more accessible to the public. All it requires is a mere click or tap of the finger of the computer mouse. This is truly amazing! Because of the Internet, we are kept well-informed and up-to-date about issues and events around the world. This is done in almost no time at all. For example, we can get news updates, the weather forecast and even recipes for our favorite dishes. Furthermore, if we need to find out more about a particular disease, its causes, symptoms and treatment, we can get the necessary information through the Internet. Thus, the Internet has made information more accessible.\n\nThe Internet also plays a pivotal role in modern communication. It is both effective and efficient. Also, it is remarkably reliable. When we send an e-mail for example, we are able to contact a person who is miles away within a very short space of time. Distance seldom hinders communication. Gone are the days when we had to wait days or even weeks before we got news from a relative or friend living abroad. Communication is almost instantaneous. Other means of communication include Skype, Facebook, and Twitter, all of which enable users to make instant contact with another user or users, regardless of where they are.\n\nLast but not least, the Internet offers the user the option to engage in online shopping. This means there is no need for the user to leave the comfort of his home in order to make purchases. Data is transmitted online, goods are viewed and selected online, payment is made online, and the goods are delivered to the doorstep. The online shopper is spared the inconvenience of being caught in a traffic jam, driving round looking for a parking space, and pushing past crowds of people. It is no wonder that more and more people find e-shopping a more appealing option than shopping at a mall.\n\nWith each passing day, the Internet is becoming more and more indispensable to modem living. It is impossible to imagine life without the Internet. Rapid changes have taken place since the advent of the Internet and this is ongoing. Almost every aspect of modem life is now dependent on the Internet as a means of communication, a tool for the transmission of information and for business and commerce. It is indeed hard to imagine life without the Internet."

        "title": "The benefits of sports",
        "content": "Every student needs attention and respect but not all can get it through academic excellence. Participation in sports is another way for students to excel. It offers the unique arena in which students can gain both attention and respect by exerting their natural abilities. These include strength and speed, vision and coordination, creativity and responsiveness. Most young people possess these characteristics and sports provide them with a satisfying and enjoyable way to develop their talents. Although on the surface sports activities are fun, they offer benefits and lessons that carry over into all aspects of life.\n\nFirst and foremost, sports are important from the aspect of health. Students who participate in organized sports are generally healthier. We are familiar with the expression `a healthy mind in a healthy body'. Sports ensure students do not merely develop academically but are also involved in healthy, vigorous outdoor activities which develop physical fitness in a way that is fun. These activities help counter health problems such as obesity and poor health. At the same time, students develop a healthier body image and lifelong habits that are good for their health.\n\nAn added benefit of sports is that they help students clear their minds of academic and social pressures. It has been said that `all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy'. Many students complain of boredom with the day-in-day-out routine of student life. Sports activities help to counter the dullness that results through keeping their noses in their books. Students are able to work off the pressures and tension that accumulate in their muscles through long hours of studying. After playing really hard, students feel better because engaging in sports helps blow the cobwebs away. Sports activities take their minds off matters that are bothering them, so that when they resume studying they will be able to concentrate better.\n\nBesides, as students train for sports they learn to push themselves to their limits in order to achieve and excel. Their personal effort may help them become good at something they are interested in. When they do something well, they feel good about it. They will be more confident. More importantly, they will learn about the process of how to improve, and work more effectively. They will see that learning a skill involves practice, and practice is essential for improvement. They may even carry this knowledge over to their studies and do better academically. Just as sports activities teach them to achieve their highest potential, so too they may push themselves to excel in their studies as well.\n\nIn conclusion, sports is essential for students as it provides an opportunity for students to develop their natural talents. At the same time, it creates a more balanced individual. Also, sports promotes good health and is also an excellent outlet for the stresses and pressure of student life. Through sports, students recognize the importance of hard work and see how practice makes perfect. More importantly, these benefits are not confined to school life but carry over into the future and have lifelong benefits."

        "title": "Social problems among teenagers",
        "content": "Parents play a crucial role in guiding their children and instilling values in them. Unfortunately, the influence of parents is steadily diminishing. This is because often both parents hold full-time jobs and their children are left in the care of babysitters or foreign maids. Because children spend less time with their parents, they are deprived of the essential guidance and discipline parents should provide. This effect is not apparent until it is seen in their behavior and attitudes when they become teenagers. The social problems among teenagers are examples of these attitudes. These include gangsterism, loitering, vandalism, alcoholism, smoking and drug abuse. These problems arise because teenagers, left in the care of maids, tend to do as they please. Consequently, they rebel against any form of authority because they feel it as an infringement of their rights.\nHowever, the absence of parental guidance is not solely to blame for social problems among teenagers. Another critical factor is the influence of friends. Teenagers need to belong to a group and have a circle of friends with whom they can identify. They feel they need to conform in order to belong. This is peer pressure. Members of a group will all try to do the same things. For example, they may even begin to look like each other, sport the same hairstyle, speak in the same way, dress like each other and so on. This helps enhance the sense of belonging. Imagine how left out a teenager would feel in a group of friends who smoke. The influence of peers and his desire to belong would compel him to take up the habit or leave the group.\n\nIn addition, there is the all pervading mass media that influences impressionable teenagers. It affects their values, behavior, thought patterns and expectations. The influence of the mass media is so great that teenagers cannot tell where fantasy ends and reality begins. In other words, they believe what they see in the movies is reality. They expect things to happen like they do in the movies. They enter into relationships and expect everything to be romantic and rosy. When this does not happen, they get angry, frustrated and extremely disappointed. Many resort to socially unacceptable behavior such as vandalism to give vent to their frustration. Others may turn to smoking or worse still, to drugs. It is a form of rebellion against reality because it does not meet their expectations.\n\nTo make matters worse too much pressure is put on teenagers. Their parents, as well as their teachers, have high expectations. They expect their children to excel. To this end, parents rush them here, there and everywhere for extra classes and tuition just to ensure they score straight As in public examinations. And this begins at a very tender age! It is not surprising therefore, that many teenagers react in silent protest. They refuse to work hard; they prefer to go out and have fun with friends. It may be that they feel they have been robbed of their childhood. They have not experienced the care-free days of fun and laughter. It is always study, study and more study. So now, in their teenage years, they are protesting. The pranks they resort to as an expression of their protest may have more serious consequences, and may even be criminal.\n\nTo conclude, social ills among teenagers are increasing as parents and society demand more from them than they can give. Parents cannot be blamed entirely as much is beyond their control. The influence of peers, the subtle messages of the mass media and the resulting boredom with life and its pressures all play a part in creating an environment that gives rise to social ills among teenagers."

        "title": "The benefits of co-curricular activities",
        "content": "Co-curricular activities are carried out in school after the regular lessons of the day. It is compulsory for every student to join these activities. This ensures students receive a balanced education with an emphasis, not only on academic success, but also on mental, physical, social and emotional development through active participation in co-curricular activities.\n\nThe benefits of co-curricular activities are many. First and foremost, they provide the environment in which we can not only discover our hidden talents and skills, but also exercise and strengthen them effectively. For example, as president of a club, a student is responsible for the proper functioning of the club. He organizes activities and mobilizes the members to carry out these activities. In the process, he develops good leadership skills. As he sees the positive outcome of his leadership, his confidence will receive a boost. This will encourage him to move on to other successes even after he leaves school.\n\nAnother benefit of co-curricular activities is that it enhances social interaction. We learn to get along with students of different ages from other classes in the school. We learn to communicate effectively with them and to work together with them. As club members we learn how to give and take, and how to cooperate in order to achieve a common goal. We also learn that we cannot always have things our way but have to compromise for the sake of harmony. Thus, as we develop our communication skills we learn to work as a team for the good of the team and not just ourselves.\n\nA third benefit of co-curricular activities is that we learn to use our time constructively. Many of us achieve very little in our free time and then complain of boredom. We have heard the saying `An idle mind is the devil's workshop'. If left on our own we might engage in negative activities with serious consequences. It is therefore important that we channel our energy towards constructive activities. Co-curricular activities provide a positive and safe environment where we are neither idle nor destructive. Consequently, we are prevented from wasting precious time. Participating in a sport, for example, entails regular practice. This would keep us out of mischief as we will not have the time to get involved in undesirable activities such as loitering and vandalism.\n\nLast but not least, co-curricular activities teach us discipline and self-control. When meetings are held we have to be punctual. Even after the regular lessons of the day are over, we do not give in to tiredness but attend meetings and discussions. If tasks have to be completed for a specific purpose, we learn to complete them on time. Thus co-curricular activities provide a framework for us to appreciate the importance of discipline and self control.\n\nIn a nutshell, co-curricular activities are an essential part of the education curriculum. They ensure that our mental, physical and social needs are met. They provide us with opportunities to cultivate confidence and discipline. At the same time, we develop new skills and discover hidden talents. We learn the importance of time and how to use it constructively. Indeed, co-curricular activities are an indispensable part of school life because they build our confidence, train us to get along with others, and prepare us for later life."

If a student brings an expensive phone to school it may be stolen. There have been instances where students have lost their expensive mobile phones. Losing a mobile phone is like losing one's wallet. It contains all one's contact numbers and losing it means losing all of this.\n\nSecondly, a mobile phone can become a distraction. Students will find it difficult to concentrate during lessons. For example, if the phone is not on silent mode, it can ring during a lesson, disrupt the lesson, and break the students' concentration. Another distraction is the stored music on the phone that one can listen to. Thus, instead of concentrating on the day's lesson, students can plug in to their favourite music during lessons without the teacher's knowledge. Ultimately, student performance in school will be affected.\n\nAnother reason why the mobile phone should not be allowed in school has to do with the text messaging mode. It allows students to communicate with others discreetly. A student who sends and receives text messages during lessons cannot concentrate on the lessons. That student's performance in school will certainly be affected. Furthermore, during a test, a student could resort to using his mobile phone to communicate with a friend in order to get answers to questions. Thus, mobile phones could encourage dishonesty. Cheating on the test would be much easier. This would be unfair to those who have worked hard for the test and do not cheat.\n\nIt has been said that possessing a mobile phone is necessary for students these days because it keeps them in touch with their parents. Parents worry less, knowing their children can contact them in emergencies. However, if every student brought a mobile phone to school, it would be difficult for teachers to ensure effective teaching and learning. Students would engage in all kinds of surreptitious activities and teachers would be at their wits' end trying to monitor this effectively. To prevent these problems students should not be allowed to bring mobile phones to school."

        "content": "To : Police Station\nCar Catches Fire Along Jalan Arkid\n\nOn 27th March 2011, I saw a car catch fire along Jalan Arkid. The road was quite busy but traffic was moving smoothly despite the congestion. It was one o'clock in the afternoon. I noticed a bright yellow Proton Saga in the distance. It had its high beams on, which was strange. Many motorists began to honk impatiently at him because he was going rather slowly. However, the motorist in the yellow Proton Saga (registration ARR 1234) did not seem to be bothered by the honking. He continued going slower and slower until he finally came to a complete halt just along the side of the road near Giant Supermarket.\n\nAs I was waiting at the bus stop just a few meters away, I was able to observe the driver. He seemed preoccupied. I thought he was looking for something. Suddenly, I heard someone yell and point at the car. There was smoke rising from under the bonnet. Before we could do anything, the car burst into flames. We saw the driver unsuccessfully try to open the car door. He became frantic. He was shouting as he pounded on the car window. We stood by, watching helplessly, too shocked to do anything.\n\nSomeone must have summoned the police and fire brigade because they arrived within minutes, followed by the ambulance about five minutes later. Unfortunately, it was a little too late for the poor driver. The flames had already died down and he was slumped in the car seat. We could not tell if he was dead or only unconscious.\n\nAfter the firemen had hosed down the car, they tried opening the car doors but they refused to budge. Obviously, the heat from the fire had jammed them shut. The firemen then proceeded to cut through the metal to get the motorist out. After twenty minutes they got him out. He was carefully lifted on to the stretcher and quickly put into the ambulance and rushed to the nearest hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, a bad traffic jam had built up along the road. Police had to control the traffic. Cones were placed around the blackened car. After half an hour, the jam eased considerably. We heard later that the motorist had sustained some serious burns on his face and arms but was out of danger. The cause of the fire could not be ascertained but was most probably caused by a short circuit.\n\nReported by"

        "content": "To: The Principal\nUnsatisfactory Condition of the School Canteen\n\nDuring the months of April and May 2012, ten members of the Health and Cleanliness Club of Sekolah Menengah Taman Kunning observed the school canteen and rated it in terms of hygiene, affordability of food sold and student satisfaction. Here is a report of our findings.\n\nMost students are not happy with the cleanliness of the canteen. The drains that surround the canteen are always clogged and give off a stink. Students who occupy the table close to the drain say that sometimes the stench is so unbearable they have to move away and eat whilst standing. Because of the stinking drains, there are many flies in the canteen. Students have to constantly wave their hand over their food just to prevent the flies from settling on the food. This makes eating a rather stressful experience. Besides, the canteen floor is oily and slippery. The canteen emits a distinctive musty smell. None of us have witnessed the canteen being washed although we have heard that it is washed at weekends. This is hard to believe as the canteen seems no cleaner on Monday than it is on Friday.\n\nWe have also noted that those serving the food tend to use their hands instead of a pair of tongs. For example, they sprinkle peanuts and slices of cucumber over a plate of nasi lemak using their bare hands. This can be quite off-putting as we are not sure if the workers have washed their hands prior to handling food. We have also noted that food is handled with the same hand that has handled money. This is definitely unhygienic. Certainly the canteen needs to give more priority to hygiene when handling food.\n\nAnother problem students have with the canteen has to do with the prices of the food sold. Most of the food is too expensive. A plate of plain rice with two servings of vegetables costs RM2.60. Not many students can afford to pay this price every day. Those who decide to buy the fried rice are disappointed. The portion is very small but it costs RM1.2. Many students have complained they cannot afford to eat at the canteen every day as most of the food is too costly.\n\nGenerally speaking, students are not satisfied with the services rendered by the present proprietor of the canteen. More and more students are staying away from the canteen. They bring sandwiches or a packed meal from home. This is not very convenient. We would like the canteen to meet our needs. We hope they will improve and make a greater effort to please the students of the school.\n\nName : Tan Ah Kaw"

        "content": "To: The Principal\nA Fight in the School Canteen\n\nOn 14 June 2011, I was in the canteen during recess between 10 and 10.20 in the morning. The canteen was noisy and packed. Many students were frantically pushing and shoving to get their food. As usual, there were prefects around to control the students and make sure they were orderly and moved quickly.\n\nI was standing in queue waiting to buy a plate of fried rice. Just as I was about to get my plate of rice, I heard an angry yell behind me. One of the boys in the queue accused another of cutting the queue. They began to shout angrily at each other. The boy insisted he had not cut the queue. Before we could do anything, the two boys began to fight. They rained punches on each other and were soon rolling on the floor.\n\nMany students gathered round, yelling at them to stop fighting. Some prefects dashed over to stop the fight. Another hurried off to fetch the discipline teacher, Mr Sau. Fortunately, two strong prefects were able to grab one boy each and pull them apart. The prefects kept a hold on them to make sure they did not begin fighting again. By the time the discipline teacher arrived, the boys were sitting apart glaring angrily at each other. One of the boys began to scold the other but he was told to keep quiet by the prefect.\n\nBoth boys looked very angry. Their uniforms were in a mess and they had sustained some scratches on their arms. Both of them were bruised on their faces. One had a sore eye and was bleeding from his nose. The other boy had a swollen lower lip which was bleeding. Some students from the Red Crescent Society administered first aid to the boys' injuries.\n\nMr Sau noted the boys' names and the classes they came from. Ong Chee Meng was from Form 4 Lili 3 and the other, Lee Boon Keong, who cut the queue, was from Form 5 Mawar 1. Mr Sau instructed two prefects to accompany the boys back to his room as he wanted to talk to them. Before he left the canteen he asked us if we had seen what caused the fight. We told him what had happened and he instructed the prefects to monitor each queue carefully. Five minutes later, the bell rang for us to return to our classes.\n\nReported by:"

        "content": "To: The Principal\nRecycling Campaign\n\nThe Environment Club of Sekolah Menengah Taman Bahagia organized a month-long recycling campaign. The campaign began on 15 March 2014 and ended on 15 April 2014. All the students of the school were encouraged to participate in this campaign. The purpose was to instil environmental awareness among the students through recycling.\n\nSeveral weeks earlier, members of the club prepared for the month-long campaign. Three sets of clearly-labeled colored recycling bins were placed in different parts of the school compound. The club also got permission to use an empty storeroom for the newspapers collected. They arranged for a lorry to come twice a week to pick up the recyclables. A small group of committee members made a huge banner for the campaign. Others prepared charts which were put up on notice boards around the school to inform students about the campaign.\n\nTo kick off the campaign, Aziz Ahmad, president of the Environment Club, gave a speech on Monday, 11 March, during the morning assembly. He encouraged students to participate in the campaign by sorting out their recyclables at home and bring them for recycling. He also highlighted the newspaper collection competition. He said he hoped it would encourage students to bring along as many old newspapers as possible. The class that collected the most newspapers would be awarded a prize.\n\nNeedless to say, the response to the campaign was overwhelming. Although the students of Sekolah Menengah Taman Bahagia were the target group for the campaign, parents and teachers also participated actively in the campaign. Throughout the campaign period, they enthusiastically brought along bundles of newspapers, old books and magazines, plastic containers and aluminium cans. Club members busily sorted out all collected material. By the middle of each week the bins for recyclables were overflowing.\n\nThe month-long campaign ended with a brief closing ceremony. The champion class for the newspaper collection was Form 2 Daisy. They received a huge hamper during the closing ceremony. The Club advisor, Mr Vincent, thanked the students for their active participation and positive attitude. Most students agreed that the campaign had shown them how to make recycling a way of life. We look forward to another such campaign next year.\n \n\nReported by:"

        "title": "It is Environment Awareness Week in your school. During the morning assembly, you have to give a speech to encourage the students to care for the environment.",
        "content": "Good morning, teachers and friends. I'm so glad to have this opportunity to speak to you at the launch of Environment Awareness Week. The title of my speech is 'Caring for the Environment'. I'll begin by explaining to you briefly why we observe this week. After that I'll describe how we show care for the environment by simply changing some of our habits.\nLet me ask you a question. What do we mean by the word `environment'? Yes, if you're thinking it means our surroundings, you're right. When we talk about our environment we refer to our air, water and the land. We know that the pollution of our environment is a great problem all over the world. We're polluting our air, water and land. I'm going to tell you how we can look after our environment. That's the purpose of Environment Awareness Week - to make us aware that care for the environment is our responsibility.\n\nThere are simple ways in which we can care for the environment, not just during this week, but all the time. These involve simply changing the way we normally do things. In other words, changing our habits. Our habits have an impact on the environment. Unfortunately, the impact is usually negative. We can show care for the environment by reducing the negative impact of our actions on the environment. For example, it is our habit to throw away whatever we don't need. Stop doing that!\n\nHave you heard of the 3R's - Reduce, Reuse and Recycle? We need to practise the 3R's! What does `reduce' mean? It just means we should throw less rubbish out. If we do that we'll reduce land pollution. There'll be less need for landfills and incinerators. How can we reduce household garbage? One good way is to buy goods with less packaging. Another is to try to recycle items, such as paper, plastic and aluminium cans, that we would normally throw out. We must separate our garbage. We can take all recyclable items to recycling centres in the area. In our efforts to reduce garbage, we will also help to preserve the Earth's limited natural resources. Furthermore, we could try to reuse items such as paper and plastic. For example, we can use both sides of writing paper, use old exercise books as note books and use old newspapers to line shelves. I'm sure we can all think of other creative ways to reuse these items. We just need to think before we throw anything away. Let's not be in a hurry to dump things. Instead, use them in different ways.\n\nAnother habit change that would show care for the environment involves the way we travel. We know that cars cause many problems. We can't live without them, but they pollute the air. It is better for us to walk and use the car only when we have to. If you live close to your school, why not walk or cycle to school? Imagine if all of us did that! Not only would we reduce air pollution, we would also be fitter because of the daily exercise! I suggest using the car only when there is no other choice. Use public transport - it's cheaper and less stressful.\n\nWell, before I conclude let me encourage you to put these simple suggestions into practice. I'm sure you'll all agree that we can practise the Ms. Also, we can certainly try to change the way we travel. Please do not wait to make these changes. Let's begin today and show that we care for the environment. Remember, it should become a habit so that all of us will naturally do things that show care for the environment. Caring for the environment is really everyone's responsibility. Each of us can make a difference. So, let us together protect and care for our environment. Thank you."

        "title": "You are the president of the Consumer Club in your school. During the launch you have to give a speech on how to be a wise consumer.",
        "content": "Good morning teachers and friends. I am glad to have this opportunity to speak to you today as we launch Consumer Week. All of us are consumers. We buy all kinds of goods and services. Unfortunately, not all of us are wise consumers. We need to know how to be wise consumers so that we do not fall victim to unscrupulous retailers who are out to take advantage of our ignorance. We need to be smart consumers so that we can get the most of our money. I'm going to give you some tips on how to be a wise consumer and receive fair exchange for your money.\n\nHere's my first tip. As a wise consumer, you should not buy too much on credit. This is because when you buy on credit you are actually adding to the cost of the product when you pay interest to the credit card vendor. Therefore, make sure you budget your money before you go shopping. Plan before you buy and make sure you have sufficient money before you go shopping.\nWhen out shopping, you shouldn't buy the first item you see. As a wise consumer you should realize that you need to shop around. Look for available discounts and special deals. You may find the same product going at a lower price at different outlets. Thus, shopping around will make you a wise consumer who can find the best price for the item you wish to purchase. This will certainly save you your hard-earned money!\n\nLet's move on to my third tip. To be a wise consumer you should avoid impulse purchases. Do not make a purchase just because it's on offer, or because the salesperson is very persuasive and you find it difficult to say `no, thank you'! Always remember that retailers will do their best to lure you into buying their products. If you are armed with a list and are determined to stick to that list, you won't spend money unnecessarily on items you don't need.\n\nNext, as a wise consumer try to buy in bulk. This is a good practice because it means you have to make less trips out in the car. That will save you fuel and time. However, you should only buy as much as you can use before the item spoils or expires. There is no point in buying so much that you have to throw away most of it because it has passed its expiry date and is not fit for consumption. So buy in bulk, knowing it usually works out cheaper, but do so responsibly.\n\nFinally, as you go down the aisle to select purchases, search the shelves carefully. Look for items that are placed high or low on the shelves. Such items are often cheaper compared to the higher-priced brand name products gnat are conveniently placed at eye-level. Manufacturers actually pay to have their products placed at the consumer's eye-level. That is why the products' at eye-level are more expensive. As a wise consumer it is good to search for the cheaper products.\n\nIn short, being a smart consumer is not difficult. All you need to do is to make a few small changes to your shopping habits, and exercise some self-control. You will find that it will have a huge, positive impact on your bank account. And, as you continue to make smart consumer choices you will learn to operate within a comfortable budget, and in so doing, live within your means. Thank you."

        "title": "You have been invited to give a talk to members of the Computer Club on using electronic mail.",
        "content": "Good morning boys and girls. It is a privilege to be able to speak to you this morning. I am sure most of you know how to use computers and communicate electronically. This is essential for all of us nowadays so I assume most of you are familiar with Cut, Copy, Paste, and other basic word-processing functions. I would like to give you some advice on an additional computer skill, namely writing electronic mail or e-mail, as it is commonly known. In my talk, I shall cover e-mail basics such as composing and sending messages, responding to messages and, observing Internet etiquette.\nLet's begin with some essential features of an e-mail message. Before you can contact a person electronically you should first enter his or her e-mail address in the To or Recipient field. Make sure you type the address exactly: an incorrect symbol or letter will send the message astray. Once that's done, give the message a subject heading that describes its content. This helps the reader to know what priority to assign the message. If you intend to send copies to others as well, then you should include their addresses in the Cc field. When you have done that, compose a suitable message. It should be concise and relevant to your recipients' concerns.\n\nWhat if you wish to respond to an e-mail message? Use the Reply feature of your e-mail program, keeping the following in mind. You need to check that the response addresses the appropriate person. When you use the Reply feature it will prompt the email program to provide a message screen with the original sender's address inserted in the To field. Your address will be inserted in the From field, and the addresses of the recipients of the original copy, in the Cc field. If a message is only for a single person, delete any additional addresses. Finally, you should check that the reply still has an appropriate subject heading.\n\nI shall now tell you how to communicate effectively online. To do this, you'll need to abide by some simple courtesies. Not everyone observes this netiquette, or Internet etiquette, but let me assure you that those who do observe it receive thoughtful and considerate replies. When sending online messages you should not scold or be rude to your reader. Some users tend to use capital letters only in their messages, which is equivalent to a SHOUT. This is not a good idea. When composing a message, remember to address your reader by name if possible, and sign off with your own name. It helps your reader if you use short, well-spaced paragraphs. This makes reading much easier. It also helps if you take the time to read and edit your message before you send it off. Proofreading helps get rid of errors (in grammar, punctuation and spelling). Also, try to condense and clarify your ideas as well as moderate your tone. A good way to indicate emotions, for example, is to use emoticons, such as the smiley, which can help to moderate your tone.\n\nFinally, when, reading and responding to messages try to be less critical. For example, you should avoid nitpicking over spelling or other surface errors. Always keep in mind that attitudes are sometimes difficult to convey, so give authors an initial benefit of the doubt. It is important not to be judgmental. Before I close, let me remind you to always exercise courtesy and consideration just as you would in any communication. In this way you will be able to e-mail more effectively. Thank you."

        "content": "Good morning teachers and friends. I am glad to have this opportunity to speak to you today as we launch English Language Week. This is an important week when we encourage all of you to improve your English and to use it more actively in your daily communication. The theme this year, as you can see from the banner in front of you, is \"Read to Improve\". All of us want to improve our language skills and a good way to do this is by reading. We are focusing this year on the reading of the newspaper. We want everyone to make the reading of newspapers a daily habit. That's why the title of my speech is \"Read the Newspaper, Everyday\". In my speech, I am going to tell you why we should read the newspaper. I shall give you three main benefits of reading newspapers.\n\nWhy should we read the newspaper? The first reason is that newspapers give us the latest news. We read about what is happening around us. We become aware of current events. We don't just get news about events and happenings in Malaysia but also from around the world. We get information about the latest events, discoveries, and improvements in the various fields of science, technology, arts and medicine. Thus, newspapers inform us and keep us updated about changes that are taking place in the world.\nLet me go on to another benefit. Newspapers help to increase our knowledge. As we read the news items, for example, we learn the names of towns and cities within Malaysia or around the world. Our knowledge of geography improves. We might read about leaders of various countries and become familiar with their names and their policies. We also become more aware of social and environmental issues, health concerns, and technological advancements. Thus, our general knowledge will improve and we will find it easier to talk to others and to join in discussions. We will be able to contribute to conversations because we know more. We will be more confident. We will also appear more interesting because we will be able to speak on various topics.\n\nThis brings me to the third, but by no means the smallest benefit. When we read the newspaper regularly our language skills will improve. We will be able to speak and write more effectively. How does this happen? As we read, we are exposed to new vocabulary and a variety of words, phrases and idiomatic language. As time goes by, we will realize that our vocabulary has widened, and our grammar and sentence structure has improved. This will make us feel more confident in social situations or when having to express ourselves in writing.\n\nBefore I conclude, I would like to encourage all of you to read the newspapers. It is affordable and definitely of benefit to us. Now that you know that reading the newspaper can improve your language skills, increase your knowledge, as well as bring you the latest news, you really have no reason not to read the newspapers. You don't have to go far to get a newspaper. It is easily available. Let's take up the challenge, boys and girls. Read the newspaper, every day! Thank you."

        "title": "You are a health officer. You have been invited to advise a group of students on how to keep healthy.",
        "content": "Good morning to the principal, teachers and students. I am here today to speak about how to keep healthy. The title of my speech is 'Be Wise, Keep Healthy'. As students it is important for you to look after your health. Your health can affect your performance in school. If you do not ensure that you are healthy you will fall ill often and be absent from school. You will miss lessons and have to work extra hard to catch up on what you have missed. The strain may cause you to fall ill again. And so begins the vicious circle. My advice to you is to be wise and maintain your health at all times. Here are three simple, yet important, ways in which you can do this.\nFirst, make sure you eat well. Your body needs nourishment. You need protein, carbohydrates and vitamins. You should eat at least three meals a day. It is not enough just to eat, though. You must eat a balanced diet at all times. Use the food pyramid as your guide. Avoid junk food as it is full of fat and empty carbohydrates. It is best to eat home-cooked food. It is good for you. It is clean, and much cheaper than the fast foods many of you seem to enjoy. So remember my first point - eat well but make sure you eat healthy food.\n\nSecond, you need to exercise. As students, many of you have no time to exercise. You come to school, rush home, have lunch, nap, rush for tuition, do your homework and then you're off to bed. How many of you know the saying 'all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy'? if you want to do better in your studies, make time for exercise. It doesn't have to be every day. Three times a week is good enough. And it doesn't have to be exhausting. Just a brisk walk round the block for half an hour should do. It's a good way to blow the cobwebs away and get the oxygen into your system. You'll be surprised how energetic you feel after that. Your concentration will improve and you will not feel so lethargic. So do not neglect regular exercise.\n\nFinally, you need to have a good night's sleep - about eight hours. Many of you may be going to bed very late. As a result, you will not be getting enough sleep. This is why you find it difficult to wake up in the morning. When you are in school you struggle to stay awake when the teacher is teaching. I am sure you enjoy watching late night movies. Or, you may be addicted to computer games. They can be so absorbing that you forget the time. When you finally do go to bed it is well past midnight. My advice is, don't cheat on your sleep. It will affect your health. It will also affect your studies. What is the use of falling asleep while the teacher is teaching? You may as well not come to school. Remember your body needs proper rest.\n\nBefore I end my talk let me stress that you should not take your health for granted. You must look after it. The best way to do this is to ensure that you eat good nutritious food, exercise regularly, and have sufficient sleep. These are as important as breathing. They ensure your body is healthy. When your body is healthy you will be able to concentrate on your studies. On the other hand, if you continue to neglect your health with bad eating habits, a lack of exercise and insufficient sleep, you will fall ill and your studies will be affected. The choice is yours. I hope you will, therefore, be wise and keep healthy. Thank you."

        "title": "Giving gift cards in lieu of gifts is acceptable. Do you agree ?",
        "content": "Everyone gets one at least once in his or her lifetime - a gift card. And as I see it, there are two main reasons why someone might only give someone a gift card. Either the person giving the gift card feels as though he or she genuinely wants to give the gift receiver a gift but does not know him or her well or well enough to know what to get. Or the gift card giver feels somewhat obligated to present a gift but does not genuinely want to present either a personal gift or any gift at all to the person in question.\nSome gift card receivers argue that getting the gift card really is no gift at all. Why? One, because the gifted feels as though they were not thought of enough on a personal level to be worthy of a more individually tailored gift. If your gift receiver feels this way, it is likely that he or she might cast aside the gift card and hence, not remember to use it for a period of time. If this occurs in your case, you, as the gift giver, run into your second and more pressing problem which is that the more time that elapses before your gifted uses the gift card, the more chance you run as the gift giver that the gift card will expire.\n\nThat being said, giving money in a card as a gift has become a very popular method of giving a gift for weddings, birthdays, anniversary celebrations or other special occasions in a person's life. While it is an excellent idea when you don't have any idea of what would make a suitable gift, it can also be very boring and give the suggestion that you could not take the time to buy a gift and wrap it for the occasion. An alternative to giving cash or a check in the card is to purchase a gift card from a store of choice where the recipients can buy something of value that will have special meaning for them.\n\nThere is no doubt that everyone likes to receive money as a gift. The problem is that quite often the money gets spent for necessities, which is fine, but then there is nothing left to remind the recipient of you and your generosity. For wedding gifts, it is best to ask questions about what the couple's needs are in the type of gifts they receive and even if you do present them with money as a gift, you can use a unique display that they will remember. For example, if the couple would like to use the money they receive as a down payment for their house, you can purchase a small toy house and fill it with bills of your choice.\n\nChildren like receiving money as well. For young children, you can start a bank account to which you add money as gifts for all the special occasions in their life. This is a gift that parents will appreciate because it gives the child a head start on college when they want to start such a fund. You can also buy a money box and fill it with coins so that both parents and the child can spend the money in whatever way they wish and will still have the money box after the coins have been spent.\n\nCoupons and gift cards make suitable monetary gifts from all stores. The man who loves tools will enjoy a gift card from a home improvement or hardware store. Teenagers always love gift cards from video stores, music stores and clothing stores. For the lady who is into crafts will really enjoy receiving a gift card from her favorite craft store. The same thing applies to those who love to read.\n\nSending money to those who live far away is a viable option to purchasing gifts, packing them to send in the mail and taking the risk on them getting lost or broken in transit. Even if you do pay extra for insurance, it is still disappointing for both parties when a gift does not arrive on time or is unusable when it does. The main thing to remember when sending money by mail is that you should always use a check or money order rather than sending cash.\n\nGift cards also make great gifts because you want to be careful not to offend someone who may have different beliefs than yours when you are selecting a gift. When you have presented a gift card as a gift, you have left the option open for the receiver to select the appropriate gift, whether it is an article of clothing, a piece of jewelry or even dinnerware. This will alleviate the concern of selecting the right texture, size or even color.\n\nGift cards make great gifts because they offer flexibility and convenience for the spender, and they are loaded with endless shopping possibilities. Furthermore, gift cards alleviate frustration and worry about selecting the perfect gift or selecting an appropriate item. You can't go wrong when you present gift cards as a gift. There is no doubt that your monetary gift will be appreciated, especially if you take the time to make sure it is well presented.\n\nAll in all I have to say that giving gift cards in lieu of gifts is aptly acceptable."

        "title": "Describe how the saying became significant in your life. 'The evil you do remains with you; the good you do comes back to you.'",
        "content": "My mother always had a saying for every occasion. But she especially loved one saying which she constantly used on me whenever I hurt any person or animal. She kept telling me, \"The evil you do remains with you; the good you do comes back to you.\" I scratched my head every time she said it, trying to understand what she meant. But it was only when I was ten that she finally explained the meaning of her favorite 'mantra' and that too, through a story. This is how the story went.\nA woman baked chapatti (a type of bread) every morning for the members of her family. She made an extra one for any hungry passer-by who came by and kept it on the windowsill for whoever passing by to take it away. Every day, an old hunchback came and took away the chapatti. But instead of expressing gratitude, he muttered the following words as he went his way. \"The evil you do remains with you; the good you do comes back to you.\" This went on, day after day. Every day, the hunchback came, picked up the chapatti and uttered the same words. No one else came by to take the offering.\n\nThe woman felt irritated. \"Not a word of thanks,\" she said to herself. \"Every day this hunchback takes my chapatti and utters this jingle! What does he mean?\" One day, exasperated and sick of hearing his refrain, she decided to get rid of him. \"I shall do away with this hunchback and stop hearing his silly jingle every day,\" she said to herself. What could she do? She thought for a while and then decided to add poison to the chapatti she prepared for him!\n\nAfter making the poisoned chapatti, she was about to keep it on the windowsill when her conscience pricked her. Her hands trembled. \"What is this I am doing?\" she said in horror. \"How can I even think of taking away life?\" Immediately, she threw the chapatti into the fire, prepared a fresh one and kept it on the windowsill. As usual, the hunchback came, picked up the chapatti and muttered the words, \"The evil you do remains with you; the good you do comes back to you.\" This time, he gave her an enigmatic look as if he could read her thoughts.\n\nThe hunchback proceeded on his way blissfully, unaware of the war raging in the mind of the woman. Every day, as the woman placed the chapatti on the windowsill, she would offer a prayer for her eldest son, who had gone to a distant place to seek his fortune. For many months, she had no news of him, so she prayed for his safe return and kept her mind strong in this way.\n\nThat evening, there was a knock on the door. She opened it and was surprised to find her son standing in the doorway. He had grown thin and lean. His garments were torn and tattered. He was hungry, starved and weak. When he saw his mother, he said, \"Mum, it's a miracle I'm here. While I was but a mile away, I was so famished that I collapsed. I would have died, but for an old hunchback passing by. I begged him for a bit food and he was kind enough to give me a whole chapatti. As he gave it to me, he said that it was what he ate every day but today, he would give it to me as my need was greater than his! It was very kind of him, Mum! It really revived me and gave me the strength to reach here.\"\n\nWhen the woman heard these words, her face turned pale and she leaned against the door for support. In horrified shock, she thought of the poisoned chapatti she had made that morning. Had she not burnt it in the fire, it would have been eaten by her own son and he would have lost his life!\n\nIt was then that she realised the significance of the words, \"The evil you do remains with you; the good you do comes back to you.\" Do good and don't ever stop doing good, even if it is not appreciated at that time. But one day, you will reap the reward for what you have done. She had fed the old man and he had saved her son with the very food that she had given him.\n\nThe story touched me and I too, understood the meaning of her words finally. I decided that I would do good in future in order to be blessed with good fortune."

        "title": "To improve relationship between friends and reduce negative relationships, you have been asked to write an article on 'How to be a Good Friend' for your school magazine.",
        "content": "We know that `No man is an island' and that we should have friends. A good friend is like a precious gem. We do not live alone like a hermit. We need others to appreciate, encourage, love and accept us for who we are. The benefits of having a good friend are many and varied. There are times in everyone's life when we need a friend to talk to, to lean on or just to have a company and feel the benefits of having someone near.\nFriends give meaning and satisfaction to our lives. We need their encouragement and comfort when we are sad or disappointed. We like to share our triumphs and achievements with them. What a relief to have a friend whom we can call upon for help in times of crisis. A friend in need is a friend indeed.\n\nThe benefits of having a good friend include having someone to talk to freely and confidentially about any problems one may be having. The benefits of having a good friend to talk to in the above sense also mean that it is having someone to lean on and reach out to for support. When we are troubled, our friends lend us their ears. Having a good friend to pour their hearts out could prevent many depressed persons from taking their own lives or banning themselves or others. Knowing that someone cares gives strength to the downcast friends to stand up again.\n\nA good friend is someone with whom one is likely to share common interests and favorite pastimes. Sharing activities such as these with a good friend can alone give great pleasure. We laugh at our friends and we laugh with them. Laughter is like a good medicine to our souls. We enjoy telling jokes to one another. Laughter brings friends closer together. It takes away tension and friction. Your good friend will also help you extend your circle of friends as you may not know everyone whom your friend knows. It will be lots of fun to meet new people who may one day become good friends of yours too.\n\nA good friendship does not sprout overnight. It takes time and effort to cultivate and nurture a relationship. For a start, we ourselves have to be a friend first before we can have friends. We must acknowledge them and be thoughtful of them. We should not look down on those who are less privileged or successful than us. Acts of kindness strengthen a friendship. To begin with, learn to remember your friends' names. A name is very important to someone. If you don't take the time to learn someone's name, it indicates that you are not interested in him or her. When someone remembers your name, it gives you the feeling that you are interesting and important.\n\nIt is important to remember that there are times when it is important to be a good friend yourself. Everyone needs their good friends at certain times in their lives. We must remember that there will come a time where our good friends need us and we have to ensure that we are there in every aspect described above. A good friendship should be seen in this respect as a partnership in a sense all about giving and taking.\n\nA good friend will first of all listen in this respect and thereafter, perhaps offer pieces of advice. It is likely that we can discuss the solutions to such problems with our friends, and the old saying that `Two heads are better than one' can effectively be applied. Very often, the simple act of listening to a good friend can in itself bring comfort if not solutions to problems. This can help to relieve stress and tension, and start the process of healing or simply feeling better.\n\nYour friend will also appreciate you keeping her confidence and not spread gossip. By showing that you are trustworthy, your friend will trust and rely on you. As a good friend, you should also be prepared to stick by your friend through thick and thin as nobody likes a fair-weather friend. So don't be one.\n\nInterestingly enough, as much as you want to be supportive to your friend, you should not be seen as a pest. You may find this amusing but your friend needs his or her space and time on his or her own; you too, should set boundaries so that you get your time alone too. This will allow both of you to discover things on your own and grow personally.\n\nOne important aspect of being a good friend is to accept correction from your friends. Your best friend gets your back, and he or she cares enough about you to correct you and point out your mistakes so that you can improve and be a better person.\n\nDo not have a big ego. Always be humble. If you give the impression that you know it all, that you are superior, you make it hard for people to like you. Compliment your friends and congratulate them on their hard work and achievements, or express sympathy when they are in sorrow or if they feel discouraged or down. Give strength to your friends by supporting them. Help them to be stronger and they will give you affection in return.\n\nA lasting friendship is built on trust and a spirit of give and take. Friendship means helping one another as the saying goes, `One good turn deserves another'. We must be thankful for having good friends. A friendship takes work and is a partnership where both parties need to give and take for it to work. Selfishness must be put aside and you will benefit greatly from your friendship."

        "title": "Describe a significant event in your life and the impact that it had on you",
        "content": "Most people would consider a significant event in their lives in relation to some great truth or revelation or to an action made by someone else, probably a significant relative or something similar. To me, my significant event is more mundane. Although experienced by countless teenagers around the world, it still had an impact on my life. I remember all too well, my first traffic ticket. Being seventeen and done with the SPM examinations, the driving license was a rite of passage that announced to the world that I was a 'man' with freedom and mobility. Admittedly, I was a bit of a brash adolescent but the new-found freedom of driving was a bit intoxicating. At least there was nothing else in my system to impair my 'rough-around-the-edges' driving skills.\nMy dad's red Proton Saga had clicked its 300th kilometer mark on the milometer. Still, he was probably as nervous as any parent should be when 'required' to hand over the key to a 'man' and pray he will return with both car and kid in one piece. I was not so concerned with such matters. \"Hey, at that age, we're all bulletproof... invincible... immortal! A car crash? No, that would never happen.\"\n\nFortunately, I did not hit anything or anybody. But that hill along Jalan Kelisa was a tricky one for an auto with manual transmission. It rose at a good thirty degree angle, maybe more. At the time it felt like ninety! I kept inching the clutch in and out, riding it like I was told never to do and trying to keep the engine from stalling while not ramming into the car in front. There was plenty of traffic too on this hot and humid day. \"Come on!\" I muttered. \"Will the light ever turn green?\" Drawing that balance of trying to keep cool, not let the car roll back and switch radio stations was a tricky business.\n\nThe traffic light did change to the splendid color of go and the cars moved forwards through the intersection. Just as I reached it, left foot pushing in the clutch, left hand trying to find the gear, the light all too quickly hit the warning yellow. I shifted. The car stalled. Horns honked. It was Kuala Lumpur after all, people had lives to get to and money to make.\n\nFace burning as red as the color the light now glowed, I managed somehow to restart the car and roughly jerk through the intersection. All this while, I tried to avoid the angry glances from the cars waiting their turn at the traffic light. After gaining confidence, I sped down the road and headed for an easy intersection. Seeing the familiar amber traffic light flash, I knew I would be able to make it before the red light flashed even if it was my dad's ancient Proton Saga, I was expecting to race.\n\nAs I 'zoomed' past the intersection, my eyes caught the flash of headlights synchronized with the `whoop whoop' of the police siren. \"Oh, just great!\" I thought and my heart sank. I pulled over and started living for real all those scenes in television shows about traffic violations and uber-cops. The humiliation continued with each passing minute feeling like a day as I tried to find the registration for the impatient policeman. After locating that offending document and wrestling with the license that always seem to get stuck in the plastic clear section of my wallet, the officer wrote the ticket and handed it to me. It felt like a death sentence.\n\nMaybe it was only a moving violation, but I knew facing Dad was going to be harder than any city judge and it was. With burning ears and tiny giggles from my 15-year-old sister, that event changed my life for the better. I got over it, like most teenagers and time healed my wounded pride. The lesson was learned about proper driving skills, keeping your cool and the responsibility of showing up for court and taking my medicine. My wish for a dismissed charge never materialized, but a sincere contrite appearance and first offence lessened the verdict from what could have been reckless driving to just running a red light. The wheels of justice turned and in this case, made me a better driver."

        "title": "How does fashion create identities ?",
        "content": "My mother always said, \"You can tell what a person is like based on what he or she is wearing.\" Was there any truth in her words? Clothes do define a person in many ways. In the past, clothes were the easiest article on the body to make a statement, to stand out from the masses, to convey a message and many more. Some examples of these 'standing out' became very popular and were followed by more people. This was the moment when fashion appeared.\nNowadays, fashion is sometimes defined as a 'constantly changing trend, favored for frivolous rather than practical, logical or intellectual reasons'. I can imagine the images of fashion catwalks where fashion houses display the season's hottest hits, and many are almost impossible to wear, yet these pieces are evaluated, commented and practically obsessed by the fashion world each time a fashion show date arrives. Nevertheless, clothing has become an integral part of self-realization of every person.\n\nThe type of clothing completely depends on the person who is wearing it, therefore, it becomes a reflection of his perception of himself, which leads us to the term - personal identity. The choice of clothing is as important as identification through the color of hair, height, skin and gender. Clothing nowadays is a media of information about the person wearing it. It is like a code that needs a decryption in order to understand what kind of person is underneath it. As every cloth carries a strong message about its owner, every owner places a certain value in it, depending on his temperament, mindset or today's mood. Therefore, the clothing of a person is a means of communication with the outside world of the identity he or she wishes to portray to the world on that day.\n\nClothes have an immense impact on the perception of people around and on the perception of the person wearing them too. A suit can make a person feel more confident and organized, which would eventually change even the gestures and the manner of talking of the person. Wearing jeans after a suit may change the conduct of a person to a very liberal and feeble one. The perception of people around can be very predictable in terns of their reaction on a person wearing this or that style of clothing.\n\nFashion is one of the most powerful means of communication, which sometimes may play a vital role in the life of a person; it especially concerns the cases of getting a desired job. The preference is always given to people who dressed in 'business style', personifying their dignity and seriousness in everything. This is one of the primary reasons that even the smallest companies make wearing a suit one of their requirements for their employees. Do you remember shaking your head in amazement that people put on suits in our tropical climate? Now you know why. The customers feel more confident in such 'consultants' too. So fashion is a very important instrument to manipulate people's perceptions of social class, culture and even gender.\n\nIt is no surprise to any of the people who at least know what fashion is that the clothes that people wear are usually very symbolic. The symbolism of clothing is another part of delivering the message that a person tries to put into it. Every observable symbol may carry a deeper meaning that it is visually understandable. Expression of symbols through clothing is a very popular tendency nowadays. For instance, a man with a tiger on his T-shirt may seem aggressive to one person, and a Green Peace member for another. A bird may be a symbol of freedom. In the present day, actual statements that directly spell out certain ideas are very popular.\n\nFashion and identity are inseparable companions. Fashion, with all its symbolism and attributes, forms an outstanding base for personal and cultural identification. Identity is a necessary process of a healthy personality. It is a part of self-realization of a person that is so much required for finding a place in the life of every person. Fashion has become a tool for achieving harmony with the inner world and a way of revealing or concealing peculiarities. Fashion possesses a specific meaning, and the more diverse is the society around us, the more fashion trend will appear and surprise us. As long as it does not hurt people around, fashion symbols are acceptable. Therefore, fashion does create identity indeed."

        "content": "Treatment of the Old by Our Society\nDear Sir,\n\nI recently visited an old folks' home and had the opportunity to see the treatment meted out to the old. The conditions there were so appalling that I could not help but wonder how children can treat their parents in such a way. It is obvious that modern society is built by the young for the young, with no consideration for the old, sick, handicapped or incapable. They are merely tolerated as a liability or nuisance. So these hardly wanted people are thrown into homes instead of faring better, they are forgotten and left to the mercies of the caretakers, limited donations from the public and financial problems.\n\nThe old, who was once young, must have helped to make the present society as it is today. They would not have paid heed to the needs of the older generation, thus they themselves are neglected and unappreciated now. But it is still not a reason for neglecting the elderly in our society. An old person does not have the physical ability of a young person. Walking itself is an effort, so crossing the road, especially with today's traffic, can be impossible without assistance. I have seen old men and women who could not cross a busy road that had no pedestrian crossing. No driver stopped for them. So these old folks had to wait patiently until a kind soul lent a hand. I have helped a number of them and most of them were very grateful while some simply cursed the traffic. What is clear here is that traffic rules are unfriendly to the old and the impaired, and people themselves have no patience or respect for them.\n\nThe busy world today is certainly not kind to old folks. Getting onto a bus is another problem they encounter. The old person is usually the last to get on, if he manages. I have seen a bus conductor refusing entry of an old man, telling him to wait for the next bus because his bus was full. If the old man does get on, the likelihood is that he will have to stand. Rarely does anyone give up his seat for an old man or woman as that is the culture our youth follows nowadays.\n\nYou see this trend in public buses and trains. While authorities are trying the best to help them by allocating seats for special people, there are many who misuse them. Many pretend not to read the signs or to see an old person standing with several bags or simply feel they have more right to sit as they had boarded earlier. Obviously, their upbringing did not include respect for the weak and disabled.\n\nFormerly, the family unit was strong and practical as most people did not go very far from their birthplace. Today, the family unit is breaking apart as young men and women travel widely in search of better jobs. So, the old are left alone and neglected. Sometimes, they are not wanted by their children. They are left to pine their lives away in their empty house or in an old folks' home where their children dump them and relinquish their responsibilities. This neglect is a very real problem in our society and it is what the old dread the most - being unwanted and uncared for in the time of need.\n\nThe indifference and lack of filial piety shown by the young is what has to be addressed. Many countries have laws to safeguard the interests of the old. While we cannot force the young to take care of their old parents, I suggest the authorities take action against those who are found to have neglected their parents, leaving them to starve, unable to take care of themselves. Even if they have no choice but to place their parents in homes, they should visit them regularly to check on their welfare and the care given by the caretakers. Failure to do so should be reported, and these uncaring children should face the law like any other criminal. The matter should be taken seriously. We must remember that soon, our parents will die and we will take their place.\n\nConcerned citizen,"

        "title": "Living in the city or the countryside. Which do you prefer ?",
        "content": "Although I was born and brought up in the countryside, I spent most of my time in the city. However, a comfortable life in the city has never appealed to me at all. And the countryside with its advantages still appeals to me more than the city.\nFirst of all, the clean and fresh air of the country would make me feel healthier. It would be relaxing and pleasant to enjoy the pure air wafted with the soft fragrance of roses and jasmines mixed with the mango, rambutan and lemon trees in my garden! I can take a stroll around the garden every morning and night. You would say that people living in cities have many chances to widen their knowledge. They can go to evening classes to learn foreign languages, such as French, Russian, German, Korean, Japanese and Chinese. Experienced teachers and professors are ready to provide them with what they want to know. Besides that, they can go to public libraries or English-speaking clubs to broaden their knowledge and improve their English-speaking skills. But, I would say that there is no necessity to overburden our lives with these pursuits, rushing through the overcrowded streets, waiting for buses, getting caught in traffic jams to reach these centers. Nowadays, we can do this from the comfort of our homes using the Internet and other technological gadgets. The stifling and polluted atmosphere of a crowded city makes us suffocated and annoyed. It may breed neurosis and other fatal diseases, so it is definitely safer and healthier being in the countryside.\n\nSecondly, people living in the countryside feel safer than the city dwellers, who are in a state of continuously being afraid of ending in violent deaths caused by careless drivers or foolhardy motorcyclists. Furthermore, in the past few years, the crime rate in cities has escalated to such a degree that people are afraid to even walk in the streets for fear of falling victim to a snatch thief, a gun-toting gangster or robber or a rapist on the prowl. While there are cases of crime in the villages and small towns, they are not so rampant or serious. We can go for a walk safely without being accosted by unsavory individuals. And we will meet any number of friendly, helpful neighbors who are all smiles and full of warmth, unlike the unfriendly city dwellers. When there is a function, happy or sad, all the villagers are there to lend a helping hand, something that is quite unheard-of in the cities.\n\nNext, people with a poetic soul will find the countryside a source of 'divine inspiration'. For me, nothing can be compared with the moonlight streaming through the thick foliage found in the countryside or the gorgeous glow of the sunset on yellow rice fields or other forms of cultivation. The silvery moonlight in the country clearer because of the unpolluted air has a mystic power to soothe our pains and sufferings, and it does help us escape from the material world of the city with its artificial man-made beauty and dazzling neon lights. Besides, if you are an avid gardener, you can spend your free time digging, planting and watering. You will feel a serene joy watching your fruit trees grow amid the melodious twitter of birds.\n\nOf course, there are many advantages if you live in the city. There are many comfortable means of communication and entertainment in the city. You can go anywhere you like, and after a hard day's work, you can enjoy minutes of recreation by watching interesting films on a large screen in a modern and air-conditioned cinema. But with the advent of modern communication, you can watch movies and keep up to date with current events on television as well as your computer, even in the countryside. Here, you can rest from the noise and bustle of the city. Even though you have to get up early to catch buses to get to work in towns, you can sleep better at night without being disturbed by deafening sirens of cars or machines running noisily all the time.\n\nFinally, our country is open to all foreign investments and the city is the cradle of industrial development. Therefore, upon graduating from university, city dwellers have innumerable opportunities to get lucrative jobs and upgrade their lives. Youths would prefer this as they want to carve a bright future for themselves and their families. But this is at the cost of their safety, health and peace of mind. Children too, are being exposed to all the wrong values practiced by the very modern materialistic city dwellers. Is this what we want for our children, the future leaders of our nation? Therefore, I prefer living in the countryside than in the city."

        "title": "You are studying in a residential school. During assembly, you, as the Head Prefect, were asked to give a talk to students who have just joined residential school on how to manage stress to ease their life there.",
        "content": "Good morning, principal, teachers and friends. First of all, I would like to welcome all the new students who have joined residential school and hope you are enjoying your new life here. As it may be the first time you are away from home, I am sure you are feeling the stress of this new life, especially managing things all by yourself. Therefore I am taking this opportunity to give you a few tips on how to keep your stress in check and how to relax when things get to be too much. At any given point in time, most students are stressed about something. But don't worry - it is just part of going to residential school where you have to be independent and cope with things on your own.\nWhile having stress in your life is normal and often unavoidable, being stressed is something you can control. There are several things you can do to overcome this. First of all, make sure you get enough sleep. Your sleep schedule is, most likely far from ideal now, so getting more sleep can help your mind refocus, recharge and re-balance. This can mean a quick nap before study hours, a night when you go to bed early, or a promise to yourself to stick with a regular sleep schedule. Sometimes, one good night's sleep can be all you need to feel charged and energetic once again.\n\nAt the same time, you should eat healthy foods. Just like your sleep habits, your eating habits too, may have changed when you came here, especially as you have to follow a new schedule and a new diet. Think back on what and when you had eaten over the past few days. You may think your stress is psychological, but it could just be physical stress if you are not fuelling your body appropriately. So, on outing days, get something balanced and healthy: fruit and vegetables, whole grains and protein. Starting your day with breakfast is necessary - don't ever go to class on an empty stomach. That spells trouble and illness! Studies were conducted in which students were asked to perform tasks after either having eaten or not eaten breakfast. Much evidence pointed out to improvements in learning and memory, and general well-being.\n\nNext, get some exercise. You may think that if you don't have the time to sleep and eat properly, you definitely don't have the time to exercise. However, don't worry about this. You have extra-curricular activities and games where you can let off your steam and lessen stress. If needs be, you can go for a relaxing 30-minute walk while listening to your favorite music and even take a power nap during rest time. I assure you, you will definitely feel much better. And during weekends, you can play games with your friends.\n\nAnother thing is to cultivate friends - socialize and have some fun. If you have been working on some projects or coursework for 3 straight days, then you could be extremely stressed because you are focusing too much on getting things done. Don't forget that your brain is like a muscle, and even that needs a break every once in a while! So have fun with your friends -play games with them, crack jokes or watch a movie on television with them. You will be building the social side of your character that will help you when you leave school.\n\nFellow students, learn to relax yourselves. The body's natural antidote to stress is called the relaxation response. It's your body's opposite of stress and it creates a sense of well-being and calm. Ensure you stay relaxed by incorporating time into your schedule for activities that are calming and pleasurable: reading a good book or making time for a hobby.\n\nOf course, don't be afraid of getting a little help if you need it. It can be hard to ask for help, and your friends may not know how stressed out you are. Nevertheless, most students are going through the same things at the same time, so don't feel shy to vent your frustrations for 30 minutes over coffee with a friend. It will help you refocus and make you realize that the things you are so stressed about are actually quite manageable. Alternatively, you can see the counselor who will be only too glad to listen to your woes. Keep the lines of communication open, especially to somebody you can trust.\n\nTry to solve your everyday problems can give you a sense of control. Develop skills to calmly look at a problem, figure out options and take some actions towards a solution. Feeling capable of solving little problems builds the inner confidence to move on to life's bigger ones and it can also serve you well in times of stress.\n\nAnother important thing is watch what you are thinking. Your outlook, attitude and thoughts influence the way you see things. A healthy dose of optimism can help you make the best of stressful circumstances. Try to be positive and learn acceptance. Accept that there are things in life that are beyond your control. It is pointless to dwell on the negative experiences and poor results but more fruitful to plant positive thoughts as new seeds of the mind. If you were unhappy yesterday, unhappy today, there is a certain unhappiness awaits you tomorrow. All in all you will only cause much stress to yourself.\n\nIt is amazing what laughter can do for us. Laughter has a two-step action on the physical body: step one, it stimulates; step two, it relaxes. During laughter, the body is stimulated and exercised; after laughter, the body relaxes and calms itself. Your laughter may help you feel better and put that spring back in your step.\n\nFinally, residential school can be overwhelming. But you must get your perspective right. You should always remember the reason why you are here: academics. No matter how exciting your co-curricular life is, you cannot enjoy any of it if you don't pass your examinations. So, make sure to keep your eye on the prize, and then head out and change the world ! Thank you."

        "content": "Dad's birthday this year's was special. He had just retired a few months ago and was beginning to show his boredom at home. He was beginning to feel unappreciated and was snapping at everyone. We could not turn up the volume of the television or music. We could not yell or scream at each other as we usually did when we got back home. We could not even laugh loudly at jokes. He would get irritated and would march up to his room in a huff.\nAt first, we shrugged and laughed at his 'childish' behavior. Then, Mum explained that it was the 'after-retirement syndrome'. After working for so many years, he was at a loss, not knowing what to do. So, we put our heads together and came up with a marvelous idea. We would celebrate his birthday in a different way. No more bearing little gifts, wishing Happy Birthday and going back to watching TV or sleeping (which is my favorite pastime on Sundays). We would take Dad and Mum out for a treat and make him feel appreciated!\n\nWe checked out all the hotels, restaurants and activities organized in town and out of town, and finally decided on a trip to Genting Highlands. My elder brother and sister, the only working members in our family, agreed to sponsor the trip, and we booked into a hotel for a night. Not wanting to spoil the surprise, we did not tell Dad about our plans, or the reason for going there. We had to listen to him grumble about wasting money all the way to the hotel that Saturday afternoon. We pretended not to hear him and kept our spirits high in spite of his grouching. Finally, realizing nobody was listening to him, he lapsed into silence.\n\nWhen we reached the hotel, we checked in and whisked him up to his room immediately before he decided to take up where he had stopped - on the present state of economy, inflation and the importance of saving money for the future. Poor Dad, he simply did not know what was lying in store for him.\n\nThat night, we took him for a show. A famous magician was on the itinerary that evening, and we clapped and cheered loudly when he conjured up a motorbike on the stage, among others. We stole a look at Dad surreptitiously, and saw that he was smiling and enjoying himself too. Still, we did not enlighten him. That was to come the next morning. But one good thing had come out of the entertainment. When we went up to our rooms that night, he was his usual cheerful self. He forgot to grumble for once!\n\nThe next morning, we knocked on Dad's door at sharp eight o'clock. Mum let us in quietly. Dad was still snoring away blissfully, so we organized everything before waking him up. Breakfast was brought up by room service, the cake was lit and all our presents arranged strategically so that he would see them when he opened his eyes. Then, we began singing Happy Birthday. He awoke with a start, confused and befuddled with sleep. When he finally realized what was happening, his eyes misted and he was lost for words.\n\n\"You brought me here for this? Thank you, my children,\" he said at last, reaching for the knife and cutting the cake. He then made it a point to feed each one of us a piece of cake before opening the presents. We had a fabulous breakfast in the room amidst laughter and jokes.\n\nAfter breakfast, we decided to do the theme parks. We gave him a choice of Ripley's Believe It Or Not! Museum, the Climbing Wall, Snow World and the fierce wind turbine tunnel for a simulated skydiving adventure. He chose to go to the Snow World, saying that his heart would not be able to take the others. We joined him, stepping into a winter wonderland and taking in the sights of a snow-white landscape of Snow World, including the Cresta Run snow slide. After this, we went outdoors, where I went for some fun rides, while the older generation watched or ambled around. It was there that Dad met Mr Lim, his former boss. They spoke for a long time before they went their separate ways. We then went for lunch before checking out.\n\nDad declared that it was the best birthday he had celebrated because the next day, Mr Lim called him and offered him a contract job at another branch of the company. He accepted it with joy, happy that he was going to be useful once again."

        "title": "Most accidents are caused by rash driving. What is your opinion ?",
        "content": "Since the year 2003, the number of fatalities due to road accidents in Malaysia has consistently been above 6,000. Between 2004 and 2013, the death of 65,850 people in road accidents had resulted in as much as RM78 billion being lost in economic contributions with an average of RM1.2 million each. This trend is not only obvious in our nation but in other countries too. A WHO report claims that road accidents take the lives of nearly 1.3 million every year and injure 20 to 50 million more in the world, with India, along with China, listed among countries with the highest number of deaths. Even in the United States, road accidents are on the rise - someone is killed in a road accident every 10 seconds! What is tragic is that most of these accidents could have been easily avoided.\nOver 95% of road accidents involve some degree of driver behavior combined with other factors. Drivers always try to blame road conditions, equipment failure, poor road maintenance or other drivers for those accidents. When the facts are truthfully presented, however, the behavior of the driver is usually the primary cause. Most are caused by excessive speed or aggressive driver behavior. Therefore, while I agree that rash driving is the cause of most accidents, other factors should also be considered.\n\nWith more people in today's fast-developing world owning personal vehicles, the number of people driving recklessly, without heeding road conditions and pedestrians on the road, has increased. People, especially younger drivers, tend to speed with alarming frequency on highways and through residential areas, school zones and urban streets. What they do not realize is that the faster you drive, the harder it is to stop, making the potential for disaster greater. Combined with speed is recklessness. Some people blatantly disregard the traffic regulations that make our roads safer. They sneer at the rules of the road and exhibit a sense of power when driving. Many of them also show aggressive driving tactics, such as changing lanes without signaling.\n\nOn top of these two behaviors, driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs is also on the rise. Youth aged 17 to 29 are the most common culprits and victims of such accidents. A drunken driver cannot perform his task without risk and would endanger traffic safety as alcohol affects the central nervous system of the driver. Even at a level of 0.05 per cent alcohol in blood, the sense of judgment is impaired and the ability to control steering is affected. Similarly, drugs like marijuana can affect a driver's perception and his ability to drive. The driver drives rashly, usually ending in disaster.\n\nNevertheless, accidents on the road can also be due to road conditions and poor road maintenance. Highway maintenance is very important. When many roads exhibit unsafe conditions like potholes, uneven pavement and various other types of defects, serious road accidents can take place. The best to do is to be wary and keep a lookout for such defects.\n\nDrivers who pay little attention to the condition of their vehicles too, can be blamed for causing accidents. Brake failure, poor tyre condition and blown light bulbs, especially when traveling at night, can also result in vehicles going out of control.\n\nAnother cause of accidents that is of increasing concern now is the use of mobile phones. Even a hands-free mobile phone or the use of Bluetooth technology does not guarantee that an accident would not occur when chatting on a mobile phone and driving. These drivers are four times more likely to cause an accident. Besides this, children, animals and construction sites often distract individuals as much as any mobile phone use. We are only human and it can be near impossible to keep our attention on the road when a child in the car is pulling his sister's hair. If the issue requires discipline, it is best to stop at a rest area.\n\nDespite numerous safety measures and tighter laws, accidents continue rising. What is sad is that the brunt of rash driving and drunk driving is faced by pedestrians, cyclists or people traveling in lighter vehicles. The road crashes, which cause grief and suffering for the family members of the deceased and the injured, also result in economic losses to victims, their families and nations as a whole. The only way to reduce this is through education. As most accidents are caused by rash driving, drivers, especially youth, should be made aware of their responsibility when on the road. Thus, we should always be aware of other motorists and pedestrians around us when driving."

        "title": "How can we help to reduce food waste ?",
        "content": "At a time when the world is apprehensive about food security and the looming dark days when humanity will run out of food, millions of tons of food are wasted because of our poor habits of consumerism. In industrialized nations especially, retailers and consumers discard around 300 million tons that is fit for consumption. Ironically, one in every seven people in the world go to bed hungry and more than 20,000 children under the age of 5 die daily from hunger.\nWhen food is wasted, two other vital commodities are also wasted - the energy used to produce food and water necessary for producing and cooking food. Indeed, Malaysians waste up to 8,000 tons or 8 million kilograms of food a day - and this amount can easily feed 6 million people.\n\nEnvironmentally, food waste also means that chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, and fuel used for transportation of these foods are also wasted. It also leads to more rotting food, which creates more methane, one of the most harmful greenhouse gases contributing to climate change. Methane is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. Thus, the vast amount of food going to landfills makes a significant contribution to global warming.\n\nThe best way to help reduce waste is to adopt and practice the theme 'Think. Eat. Save', as a way of saving the environment. If we observe what is happening around us in school, we will see many students eating only half of the food they have ordered and throwing away the rest. At home, we only eat what we like and discard the rest of the food that has been served on our plates because we dislike it. Some of us heap food on our plates without any intention of finishing it. In restaurants, for example, many families order unnecessary amounts of food and waste a lot of it.\n\nIn fact, Malaysians have for too long lived in affluence and have a compulsive affinity for food. It is said that if Malaysians are not doing anything else, they are eating. It is a fact that while the British may be obsessed with the day's weather, the first thing two Malaysians ask each other when they meet is \"sudah makan?\" or \"have you eaten?\" Malaysia could possibly be the only country in the world where food is available in street corners throughout the night, while the rest of the world is sleeping. Given this kind of lifestyle and the resultant devastating effects on the environment, the theme 'Think. Eat. Save' will encourage us to become more aware of the environmental impact of the food choices and informed decisions we make.\n\nTo put this theme into practice, we should start from the home and then witness the power of collective decisions we have made to reduce food waste, save money, minimize the environmental impact of food production and force food production processes to become more efficient. If food is wasted, it means that all the resources and inputs used in the production of all the foods are also lost. For example, it takes about 1 000 liters of water to produce 1 liter of milk and about 16,000 liters goes into a cow's food to produce a hamburger. The resulting greenhouse gas emissions from the cows themselves, and throughout the food supply chain, all end up in vain when we waste food.\n\nTherefore, we should eat only what we are able to eat. Do not heap your plate with food you know you will not be able to finish eating. In restaurants, make sure you or your friends or parents do not over order food, or even for that matter, order dishes that many do not like. It is more prudent to order less food than too much - if insufficient, you can ask for more.\n\nParents too, need to change their attitude towards food consumption and educate the young about the downside of food wastage. Even in the school system, some effective kind of awareness on food wastage must be impressed upon the younger generation as they may not be aware of another world where food is scarce or the looming food security issue which is threatening the world.\n\nAs for making informed decisions, it simply means that we purposefully select foods that have less environmental impact. One example is buying organic foods that do not use chemicals in the production process. No doubt organic food is more expensive, but if more people buy organic produce, their production will be increased and subsequently, production costs will fall. Foods that are produced using fertilizers and pesticides only harm the environment and our health.\n\nAt the same time, we should also support our local market. Choosing to buy locally produced vegetables, fruit and farm products can also mean that foods are not flown halfway across the world. It not only saves our money but also limits carbon emissions from planes.\n\nMany countries are taking the problem of food wastage seriously and trying to curtail it by imposing fines on people who wantonly waste food. Restaurants in some countries fine diners who leave behind large amounts of food on their plates. Food wasted for these restaurants means more rubbish, which will only add on to the millions of tons of household and commercial trash thrown out daily, leaving a greater impact on the environment. By imposing fines, people will be more conscious of wasting food.\n\nLastly, we should all join hands to create a safe and green world. So think before you eat and help save our environment."

        "content": "I felt the heat of the morning sun on my still-closed eyelids. Annoyed, I rolled to the other side to get out of the way of the strong rays. I yawned and stretched, wondering why it was so bright. It is normally quite dark when I get up for school. I forced open my eyes to look at the little, round alarm clock on my bedside table ... and screeched in alarm!\nBounding out of my bed, I swung open the wardrobe door to take out my school uniform, which I threw on the bed. Then, I dashed to the bathroom. But halfway, I stopped, deciding not to brush my teeth. I grabbed my school bag and ran downstairs. Soon, I had shoved my feet into my shoes and pounced onto my bicycle. My parents stood motionless, staring at me as I whizzed past. As I had had no time to comb my hair, I ran my fingers through it, making it look as tidy as possible.\n\nAs my bicycle raced down the road to school, I noticed a group of schoolgirls looking at me with great interest. Oh boy! I must still be looking attractive even with uncombed hair. My heart pounding furiously in my chest, I shot past a few cars on the road. In all the confusion and haste, I managed to notice the drivers staring in disbelief at me. They were probably incredulous that one could pedal so swiftly. Soon, I reached the school gate, which the security guard was about to close.\n\nWithout bothering to explain myself to the two priggish prefects on gate duty, I hopped off my bike. Locking my precious iron steed at the bicycle parking lot, I sprinted to the school hall. As I burst into the hall, I slowed down to turn left to go to the back of my class, where I took my place behind my classmates. I released my breath - the assembly had not started yet. But just as I was congratulating myself, I realized that I was the centre of attraction. It did not matter much to me at the moment for I was used to being looked at. However, to say the least, I was a little surprised when everyone stopped staring blankly at me and started to giggle. Suddenly, the whole hall was reverberating with loud laughter. Everyone was laughing, pointing or looking at me. Some teachers were smiling while others were trying to control the situation. Smiling at my audience, I took a bow, though at the back of my mind, I was wondering what was so amusing.\n\nAs I took my bow, I noticed -that the bottom half of my trousers were not olive-green but had blue and white stripes. My line of vision moved upwards, revealing that the rest of my trousers were also the wrong color - and so was my shirt. In profound shock, it took me some time to figure it out. \"Sammy! Why on earth are you in pyjamas?\" my friend, who was standing beside me, blurted out amidst the bellows of laughter. Tears were streaming down his cheeks, not from sadness, but from hilarity, I realized in chagrin.\n\nA feeling of sheer horror swept through my entire body. My mouth opened in a silent `0' for a few long seconds. I stood there in shock and embarrassment. No wonder Dad and Mum had looked nonplussed as I was streaking past them. No wonder everyone in the hall was laughing. I had stupidly thought that it was my riding skills that had fascinated people on the street and my handsome face that had made the girls stare at me. I felt darkness slowly starting to engulf me.\n\nI awoke with lights playing on my eyelids. A group of people, including some boys in the Red Crescent uniform, were peering down at me, grinning quite lunatically at me. My teacher was also there. He patted me on my back, saying with a wicked wink, \"You must have been in a real hurry, eh? Never mind, your parents will be here soon with your school uniform.\"\n\nI must have looked like a beetroot. But one thing was clear - it was the most embarrassing moment in my life."

        "content": "Reuben -- The Leader\nLast month, a group of us from 5 Cemerlang attended a leadership camp in Kuantan. The camp was organized by our school. At the camp, we were divided into a few groups, and each group had its own group leader. Unknown to us until the end of the camp, an award for the Best Group Leader would be given. When the winner of the award was announced, none of the members of my group were surprised. We knew the winner would surely be Reuben, our group leader.\n\nWe were so sure that Reuben would win the award because he is born a leader. Reuben's full name is Reuben Raj and he is the eldest of five children. He turns 17 this year. During his primary school years, he studied in SMK Sungai Teguh. He comes from a humble background where his mother sells nasi lemak for a living. His father has passed on when he was still a baby.\n\nAs a child, Reuben grew up helping his mother care for his other four siblings while his mother works hard to earn a living for five of them. Through his difficult childhood, Reuben acquired a great sense of responsibility that has shaped him to be who he is today. He is well known among his friends to be a man of caliber and very responsible in all the tasks he is given. Through the years, the care that he has shown to his siblings also overflows to others. People often mention his name with a smile on their faces, remembering his genuine care and concern for the people around him. He always remembers to greet people and makes sure no one feels left out around him. During the camp, I remembered how Reuben cared for those who were sick although he was busy with his own tasks. His people skills proved handy during this time.\n\nMore than his outstanding character, he also possesses great debating skills. He is a natural and charismatic orator, so it was no surprise that he received the Best Speaker award during the camp debate competition. Besides that, he was also voted as the most cooperative camper at the camp. Every teacher and student just loved him as he would never say no to people who need a helping hand.\n\nMost of all, Reuben is an exceptional leader that inspires others. This was perhaps the main reason he was given the award. The best kind of leader is a humble one. He leads by example. During the camp, whenever we go through an activity together, he often does it first and makes sure he tests the activity before we do it ourselves. If there is any trouble to go through, he goes through it first. Even during the obstacle course, he had a slight injury on his leg because he was the first to go and the obstacle course was faulty. He affirmed that he would not have wanted it any other way. He proved that he is a sacrificial leader. By this example alone, I believe that Reuben truly deserves the honor of being the Best Group Leader.\n\nThe award entitles Reuben a Certificate of Achievement and a cash prize of RM500. Reuben, we are so happy with your achievement and hope that you continue to inspire others in every way that you can."

After an hour, we decided to go for a drink at Pak Kia's stall. On seeing us, Pak Kia greeted us warmly.\nAfter our drink, we started to walk home. We had to cross a busy road near Pak Kia's stall. I asked Luke, \"My father is coming to fetch me. How about you?'\n\nLuke replied, \"I'll take the bus home.\"\n\nWe were standing at the roadside and were about to cross the busy road when we saw a girl come running down the road. As she did not see me standing there, she knocked into me. She said, \"I'm so sorry.\"\n\nI looked curiously at the girl. Oh dear! She was crying. I wondered why she was crying.\n\nThe girl said quickly, \"It's my father. He is at home. He had a heart attack!\"\n\nAnd she continued, \"I'm looking for a taxi. The taxis will not stop.\"\n\nI knew that it was difficult to get a taxi on this busy road. However, I also knew the girl's father had to go to hospital. The girl looked very worried. Her father might die at home.\n\nWithout hesitation, I offered to help. \"I am waiting for my father. I will phone him to come now.\"\n\nThe girl replied, \"You will? Oh, thank you so much!\"\n\nSo I quickly phoned my father to ask him to come at once. In a very urgent tone, I told him about the man's heart attack. \"Please come now, Dad. Someone may die of a heart attack!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Luke and I ran to the girl's house. the old man was lying on the floor looking very pale. The girl ran to her father. I helped her to get the old man up to his feet. It was not an easy task as the old man was a big man. Moreover, he was very weak. He could not stand up at all. Fortunately, Luke and I were strong boys. We managed to drag the old man all the way to the grout gate.\n\nBy then, my father was outside waiting for us. He got out of the car and rushed over to help us. We reached the hospital in ten minutes. The hospital attendants were waiting with a stretcher. They carried the old man inside the hospital and put him in Ward 5.\n\nThe doctor checked him and told the girl who was looking very concerned, \"Luckily, you all brought him to the hospital on time. And now, we have to perform surgery on him. He should survive the surgery.\"\n\nThe girl turned to Luke, my father and me. She extended her hand and thanked us for helping her.\n\nShe then introduced herself to us. She said, \"I am Janet. I don't know how to thank you all for saving my father's life.\" Her voice started to break with emotion. Tears were flowing down her cheeks.\n\nMy father replied, \"The fact that your father is going to be all right is enough thanks for us.\" Luke and I agreed. We shared this mutual feeling that saving someone in need and seeing that person coming out of it well was the best reward we could ever have."

When doing so, he never failed to stop to look at the latest laptops in the computer shop.\nHe was thinking, \"I would love so much to own that laptop. But nobody will buy it for me.\"\n\nSo Kumar thought hard of what to do. The school holiday was coming up next week. An idea struck him. He would do odd jobs to earn some money. Yes! That was what he would do.\n\nHe designed a plan of working in his neighbors' gardens. First, he would approach them and ask them to let him clean up their gardens. Each owner would probably pay him RM50 or RM60. Working in more than ten gardens would enable him to accumulate enough cash to buy his beloved laptop.\n\nThe next day, he went around his neighborhood and asked the residents if he could clean their gardens. He asked them politely, \"Excuse me. Can I work in your garden during the school holiday?\"\n\nMany of the owners replied `Yes.' They liked the courteous boy.\n\nSo Kumar started work in his first house. He woke up early that morning. He took three hours to clear the rubbish and cut the grass. It was not easy work. He had to mow the grass. After that, he had to pull the weeds. Then, he had to arrange the flowerpots. This arduous work went on for a week. Consequently, he had no time for games or even watch television.\n\nBakri told him, \"Heh, forget about your laptop. Come and join our football game.\"\n\nHis mother feeling concerned for her son's well-being told her husband, \"Just give him the money for the laptop.\"\n\nHis father said, \"No. It is better for him if he works hard for it. He would appreciate his laptop more.\"\n\nAfter two weeks, he managed to save RM700. All this money was kept safely inside a drawer. He was thinking, \"Not too bad.\" After this, he needed another RM300. That would mean another week of clearing gardens.\n\nAt the end of November, he had saved up enough money. He now had RM1,000. Early in the morning, he went to the computer shop. The owner of the shop smiled upon seeing Kumar. As usual, he asked, \"Come to look at the laptop again?\"\n\nThis time, Kumar said, \"Oh no, not just take a look. This time I came to buy it.\" Then he walked inside the shop knowing that he deserved his reward."

Five minutes later, she came out and walked out of the cafe without looking back.\nMary saw the handphone on the table. She quickly told Keith, \"Keith, the girl left behind her handphone.\"\n\nKeith looked at the handphone. It took his breadth away. It was one of the latest models on the market. Looking very sleek, it was red in colour with a black cover. The handphone must have cost about RM2000.\n\nKeith had always wanted a handphone. But his parents had told him, \"You don't need one. You can always use the house phone.\"\n\nHe stared at it for some minutes. Then he said slowly, pausing on very word, \"I want to take the handphone.\"\n\nMary could not believe her ears. She merely stared at her brother. \"You can't! What if the owner comes to look for it?\"\n\nHaving made the decision, Keith quickly grabbed the handphone and put it in his schoolbag. Then, he took Mary's hand and led her out of the cafe quickly. Outside the cafe, he ran to his bicycle. Mary had to run after him.\n\nOnce back home, Keith locked his house door with trembling hands. Inside his room, he took out the piece of beauty. Oh, he liked it so much. Now he had his own handphone. Soon, he was polishing it happily.\n\nBut Mary told him, \"Keith, you cannot keep the handphone. What will you tell father about this? He will ask you how you got the handphone.\"\n\nKeith said quickly, \"I will say a friend lent it to me.\"\n\nMary said, \"Now you are lying too.\" Oh dear!

We will talk to her and ask her to come and take back her handphone.\" She was trying her utmost to talk some sense into him.\n\nThat night, Keith was tossing and turning in bed. He had difficulty sleeping. Of course, he liked the new handphone. However, he was feeling sorry for the owner. The lady looked young. She would be very sad at the loss of her handphone.\n\nIn the morning, he decided to return the handphone to the owner. After school, he old Mary, \"I am going to phone the owner.\"\n\nMary was elated to hear that. Back home, they phoned the owners' house phone. A girl answered the phone.\n\nKevin asked, \"Are you the owner of the handphone ? I m Keith. I have your handphone. Can you come and get it ?\"\n\nThe girl replied excitedly, \"Yes, yes ! I am the owner. Thank you ! Thank you ! I will come now.\" Ten minutes later, she was at the same cafe to meet Keith. Handing back the handphone to her and seeing her smile happily, Keith realized that honesty was indeed the best policy."

There were chicken, egg, tuna and sardine sandwiches. The sandwiches were spread out on a mat on the sand. Next to the sandwiches were bottles of mineral water. Their mother had also brought a flask of hot tea. She knew their father liked a cup of hot tea after eating sandwiches. The whole family enjoyed the sandwich meal. Somehow, they were thinking that those were the best sandwiches they had ever tasted.\n\nAfter eating, Gopal's mother cleared the cups and bottles on the mat. Suddenly, they heard someone shout, \"Help! Help! Someone is drowning!\" Gopal looked far out into the sea and saw a child struggling in the water. The strong wave was sweeping the child away. The child was drifting in the water. It was obvious that she could not swim. And there were no lifeguards around.\n\nGopal could hear more shouts. A girl was saying between sobs, \"My little sister is going to drown. Please someone save her!\"\n\nThe girls standing around her also started crying. They were helpless for they could not do anything to save the little girl. Gopal knew he must act fast. He ran to the sea. He swam as fast as he could to the child. In a few minutes, he reached the little girl. With his strong arms, he grabbed the child and pulled her to him.\n\nMeena and her parents were standing on the shore. They were worried for Gopal. No doubt he was a good swimmer but the waves were very strong. But they felt relief when they saw him swimming back to the shore with the child holding onto him.\n\nThere was a big crowd of people by then. They saw Gopal carrying the little girl towards a deckchair. She was still alive! The girl's sister ran to her. She thanked Gopal for saving her little sister's life.\n\nShe kept on saying, \"Thank you, thank you! You are so brave.\" The crowd of people heard this. They too admired Gopal's bravery and quick action. Soon all of them were clapping and cheering him on. They even sang 'For he is a jolly brave fellow, for he is a jolly brave fellow.'"

        "content": "Helen is the daughter of a rich businessman. Being the only child in her family, her parents pampered her. They gave her anything she asked for. In school, she had no friends. Her classmates found her snobbish and arrogant. They did not want to be friends with her. Helen had no friends at school.\nOne afternoon, Helen was waiting for her driver after school. She was standing outside the school gate alone. The other girls were playing and laughing while waiting for their parents to fetch them. But none of them spoke to her.\n\nShe was pretending not to mind their ignoring her. \"So what if they do not talk to me. I don't need them to talk to me.\" However, she did mind being left out. A strong feeling of loneliness overwhelmed her. This made her feel very unhappy.\n\nWhile standing there, a thief came up from behind her. Helen was unaware of this. Very quickly, the thief snatched her gold chain which she wore under her white blouse. She felt a sharp pain and cried out loudly. But nobody went to help her. In fact, nobody was even looking at her.\n\nHer neck was red and hurt. It was bleeding. She was so frightened and started crying. But still nobody looked at her. She tried to approach a prefect to tell him what had happened. However, when the prefect saw her coming, he walked away. All the prefects knew her as being arrogant and rude. Even the school guard would not talk to her.\n\nAs her driver was late, she ran to the toilet and cried inside. She sobbed her heart out. Oh, why was she so lonely? Others were always with friends joking and laughing. Someone heard her crying in the toilet. Her class teacher, Miss Lim was passing by. She was surprised to hear a girl crying inside the toilet. She pushed open the door and saw Helen standing at the sink with red eyes.\n\nMiss Lim was shocked. \"Helen, what are you doing here? Why are you crying?\"\n\nHelen told her sadly, \"I must be the most unhappy girl in school. Nobody likes me.\"\n\nThen, she told Miss Lim how a thief had snatched her necklace.\n\nStill sobbing, she said, \"Nobody was looking at me. None of the girls wants to talk or play with me.\" There and then, Miss Lim told her, \"You want the girls to like you. Very simple! You must not be arrogant. Talk to your classmates. Be nice to them. Show them you want to be their friend.\" Helen listened to every word Miss Lim said.\n\nThe next day, she went to class smiling at her classmates. They could not believe their eyes. Proud Helen smiling at them! She even called out the names of some of her classmates and addressed them politely. That day, she offered to collect books and clean the blackboard. She then offered to bring the exercise books to the teachers' room.\n\nSoon, everyone said she had changed. Her classmates knew she wanted to be their friend. So, they included her in the things they did. In the school canteen, she shared her food with her classmates. They did homework together in the library. She was no longer the proud lonely girl in school."

Laila sat on the doorsteps and waited till midnight. Her mother did not come home. Her father, Mr Siva, came back late. He pretended that nothing had happened.\nSoon a year passed. There was not a single day Laila hoped her mother would come back. Every night, she went to bed hoping the next day, her mother would be there to wake her up for school. Every day, after school she hoped to see her mother in the kitchen when she came home. Her school grades were dropping badly. Her teachers complained about her homework and tests marks. They often caught her daydreaming in class.\n\nHer classmates and friends were finding her difficult. They thought she was strange. There was one day, her friend, Jill, saw her in the toilet talking to herself. She was talking to her reflection in the mirror! Jill felt frightened and ran out. After this, everyone avoided her like the plague.\n\nIt was then she decided to run away from home. She did wonder, \"To where?\" She did not have the answer. But she had come to a point where she did not care anymore. All she knew was that she just had to leave home.\n\nThat morning, she got up early. Somehow, her decision to leave home had made her stronger. She quickly packed her bags. For the first few days, she had nowhere to go. She had little money. So she had to be careful about what she spent on. At night, she slept on the staircase of a block of apartments. She would walk along the streets the whole day till she was exhausted. And she went back to the staircase late at night. This was after the residents were asleep.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Siva was very worried about his daughter. He checked with her teachers, classmates, friends and relatives. Nobody knew where she was.\n\nThey advised him, \"Go and make a police report. The police will look for her.\"\n\nOn the sixth day of her running away, Mr Siva heard a heavy knock on his door. He opened the door and saw his neighbour, Ah Seng. He was saying, \"Someone saw your daughter.\"\n\nMr Siva's hands were trembling. Ah Seng was holding a newspaper. He turned to the second page of the newspaper. \"Look! This is your daughter's picture.\"\n\nMr Siva looked at the picture. Oh yes, it was her picture all right. The picture was with an article. The headlines read: `Missing girl had an accident'. It continued to say that she saved a little boy who was running across the road.\n\nWithout changing his clothes, he rushed all the way to the hospital where his daughter was. He saw her lying on the bed. Daughter and father held each other and cried in happiness. They were so glad they had found each other again. Mr Siva vowed to his daughter that he would be a good father to her."

Oh no! I gasped in dismay. It was a quarter to eight. I was going to be late for school.\nAs I did not have time for breakfast, I could hear my stomach groaning. All I could do was just grab a cup of coffee. Unfortunately, my hand moved too fast. It knocked down the cup and the coffee flowed all over the floor.\n\nI did not have time to wipe up the mess. So I ran out of the house with my mother shouting at me. Boy, she sounded really angry. As I was late, I decided to take a short cut. This meant I had to walk through a muddy lane.\n\nAs I was rushing, I did not see the wooden plank in the mud. Before I knew it, I tripped and landed in the mud. You can imagine my school uniform and hair covered with mud. Groaning and cursing, I washed myself at a nearby tap. Then, I hurried to school. As I was so late, a prefect at the gate wrote down my name. That was really bad luck! When I entered the classroom, the science lesson had started. Miss Ong was writing on the blackboard. She looked at my dirty uniform and face.\n\nShe asked loudly, \"What happened to you? Why are you so late for class?\" before I could say anything, she shouted at me in front of the class. \"You get out and tidy up!\"\n\nWhen I got back to class later, everyone was looking at me. I wish there was a big hole where I could crawl into. Soon, the bell rang for recess. As I was so hungry, I quickly ran to the canteen. Not seeing a girl walking in my direction, I accidentally knocked into her. Her drink flowed all over her uniform.\n\nShe shouted, \"Watch out where you are going! What's the matter with you?\" As I was so hungry, I did not even bother to apologise. The bell rang again for us to go back to class. As I was late again, I had to run all the way to the classroom. Ibis time, I missed the bottom step on the staircase. So, I fell flat on the cement floor. Wow! It hurt my knee. The other pupils standing there watched me make a fool of myself. I felt like crying. My class teacher, who was walking past, asked impatiently, \"What happened to you? Why are you so clumsy?\"\n\nAfter school, I just wanted to get home without any more hitches. However, when I reached my house gate, it was locked. I put my hand inside my pocket and realised that I had forgotten to bring the house keys! I had to wait till my mother got back from work. That would be six o'clock.\n\nPoor me ! I was tired, hot, thirsty and hungry. It was only three o'clock. The sun was hot. To make matters worse, the owner of the house two doors away did not close his front gate. His dog came running out. Seeing me standing there, it charged at me ! I had to take to my heels and run for my life.\n\nThat night, I told my mother everything that happened. \"Today was really my unlucky day.\""

She just loved dancing and not being able to attend dancing lessons would be like ending her life.\nSo during the science test, Mei tried to cheat. She hid a piece of paper with answers on it. It was inside her pencil box. She pretended to open the box to take a pencil. Then, she tried to peep at the answers.\n\nIt was at that moment our teacher, Puan Salmah, happened to look in her direction. She saw Mei copying answers from the paper. Oh dear! Mei was so engrossed on writing that she did not know our teacher was looking at her. I happened to look up from my test paper and saw Puan Salmah looking at Mei. There was nothing I could do to alert her except wait to see what happened. By then, the class had seen Puan Salmah looking very angry and walking towards Mei.\n\n\"Mei! You are cheating! Shame on you!\" she shouted. Mei quickly threw the paper on the floor but it was too late. Puan Salmah picked it up. The paper had all the answers for the test. This time very softly she told Mei, \"I am giving you a zero for the test. Never cheat during a test again.\"\n\nMei was so ashamed and embarrassed. All her classmates were looking at her. She felt like crying. Puan Salmah asked her to take her bag and wait outside. The principal, Mr Chong, called her to the office.\n\nThere, he told her, \"What you have done is serious. We have phoned your father. He will be coming soon.\"\n\nMei's father came ten minutes later. He looked furious. But Mr Chong explained to him. \"It is more important to guide our children rather than force them to get good grades. Show them love and care instead of pressuring.\" As for Mei, she could not stop sobbing in the office. She also made a promise not to cheat during tests again.\n\nAfter that incident, Mci took her studies seriously. She did constant revision before any test. I must say that she does quite well in class tests. She is getting 55% or 60% for her tests. There is no need for her to cheat during tests again."

During the journey to the bride's house, many villagers join in as the procession passed by.\nOn the day of ceremony, the bridegroom and his party go the bride's village. During the journey, by boat or over-land, the bridegroom's party beats the gong and drum. The purpose is to avoid hearing the cry of bad omens. When they reach the vicinity of the village, the party will take a rest. This is the time for them to dress themselves in traditional costumes.\n\nAfter changing their clothes, they continue their journey to the village. As soon as the people in the bride's longhouse see their guests coming, they fire guns to welcome the guests. The groom's party then return the gun salutes with equal number of gunshots and proceeds to the longhouse.\n\nUpon entering the longhouse, the guests are invited to sit down, the men at the upper part of the gallery and the women in the hall. The ceremony begins with the initiation session. The session can be a lengthy affair as speakers from both sides give their speeches. In their speeches, they talk about how well they know the bride and groom. Later, both the bride's and the bridegroom's families introduce their relatives to each other.\n\nThe wedding ceremony takes place at the bridegroom's longhouse in the evening. The couple, dressed in traditional costumes, are seated side by side on brass gongs. By their sides are the bestman and bridesmaid who are also dressed in traditional costumes. Both of them have to stand in attendance. The village headman then performs the ceremony by holding and waving a cockerel over their heads, reciting his prayer of blessing. The significance of this is to bless and to wish the couple a happy married life.\n\nThe ceremony is then followed by the sprinkling of beads over the married couple. While doing this, the headman invokes a short prayer asking the spirits to bless, guide and guard them in their daily lives. As soon as this ceremony is over, food and the rice wine are served.\n\nIt is customary for an endless list of speakers to stand up to give words of advice to the newly married couple. The first to speak are the parents of both the bridegroom and the bride. This is followed by their uncles, aunts, grandparents, brothers, sisters and other relatives. The final speaker is the headman. After this is over, entertainment follows.\n\nThe merry-making commences with a lot of food, drinks and entertainment such as performances of traditional dances. This can last till dawn. The next morning the bridegroom takes the bride back to his village. Dressed in traditional costume she is accompanied by her parents and members of her longhouse."

It was on August 31, 1957 that on then Chief Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, opened Stadium Merdeka. It was a day of fun and great excitement. We had arrived quite early. Security and policemen got into position to welcome the delegates and representatives of various countries.\nThe two-hour parade kicked off at 8 a.m. with thousands of people flocking to the square to see the parade. The place was packed with locals and also tourists sitting on both sides of the path waiting to cheer their leaders. The King and Queen arrived with their entourage. People began to applaud and scream `Merdeka!' as helicopters billowed out the colors of the flag.\n\nDignitaries including the Prime Ministers of Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia graced the occasion. There was representation from US, UK, Australia, Sri Lanka, Japan and other countries. 'Malaysiaku Gemilang' (My Glorious Malaysia) was the theme of the event. The national anthem started and everybody sang with lot of passion and sentiment. Parade participants held up their right hands as they recited the National Oath.\n\nAlong with other students, I had assembled on the field of the state stadium. Some of my friends who were in the school band took part in the march past. I was in the cultural troupe, performing cultural dances in front of thousands of spectators from all walks of life. It was a proud moment for all taking part.\n\nAfter the performances, the Merdeka Day parade commenced. This was not only confined to Kuala Lumpur only. Simultaneously the national flag raising campaign began throughout the country. It had become a tradition for Malaysians, including those in rural areas, to display the-nation's flag at their houses, office premises, shopping complexes, and even stalls by the roadside. Mini flagpoles were also attached to automobile roofs.\n\nPeople turned out in droves, waving miniature Malaysian flags and singing as bands played songs at the Merdeka parade. The parade was made up of delegations representing hundreds of organizations, including government agencies, enforcement authorities and companies. The Guest of Honour inspected the parade and took the salute from the grandstand. Present were Chief Ministers, state cabinet ministers, members of the parliament and state legislative assembly, senior government servants and community leaders.\n\nIt was indeed an event to rejoice, celebrate and be part of a historic moment. These words aptly sum up a nation solemnizing its 51 years of independence."

No doubt, I see and hear the same things going on every day but the scene is familiar and comforting.\nAs I leave my front door and stroll down the street, I look up at the deep blue sky with occasional patches of white clouds spreading across. Sometimes, I take hold of my little sister's hand as we walk. We turn our heads as our eyes check for traffic on both sides, then we hurry across the street. The street is empty and serene on a Sunday morning and it shows no signs of cars or people. Many cars still are parked in the driveway.\n\nWe pass by many front yards with well-maintained gardens, with thick green lawns and colorful flower beds. Some sections of the sidewalk are still wet from the morning lawn watering. Our hands swing back and forth in leisure, in rhythm with our footsteps like two solders marching down the street.\n\nSometimes, our heads tilt back and our eyes look up to follow the sound of birds chirping overhead. However, we see no sign of birds but a ceiling of dense oak leaves. The leaves of the trees grown along the roadside rustle in the gentle breeze. Some leaves dance side to side as they fly down from high above.\n\nThe air carries the scent of citrus to our noses, as we approach the small lemon tree at the end of the sidewalk. Many ripe bright yellow lemons hang low from the branches. As we turn the corner, a long row of tall oleander trees greets us. The trees are planted along the sidewalk in a bed of earth raised about two and half feet high above the ground.\n\nA half a block ahead, we catch a glimpse of a monkey swinging from the branch of a tree. We try not to make any noise by tiptoeing forward to take a closer look at it. The friendly baker from the only bakery on the street comes out and greets us. He is covered with flour from his hair to his hands. At the same time, I inhale the aroma of freshly baked buns. It stirs up hunger pangs in my stomach and is a reminder that it is time for an early lunch.\n\nAfter a minute of looking around the bakery shop, we resume our walk. This time, we walk down the path in silence. I realize we are doing more than just having a walk on this Sunday morning for we are actually building a bond. This is an experience I hope, we will continue to have in our many more Sundays together."

It can also be reached by ferry from Changi terminal in Singapore where tourists need to pass through the immigration checkpoint at Tanjung Belungkur ferry terminal before their arrival.\nKota Tinggi is best known as a historical town because the Sultanate of Johor was established here. Many historical tombs are found here including the famous tomb of Sultan Mahmud Mangkat Dijulang (the last sultan of the Malaccan Sultanate line).\n\nThe town itself is of little interest, but the waterfalls at Lombong, located 15 kilometres north-west of the town are popular tourist destinations. Kota Tinggi Waterfalls, as it is called, is 36 meters high and is located at the base of the 634-metre high Gunung Muntahak mountain. The cool river water drains through a series of shallow pools ideal for swimming. However, the natural beauty of some parts of the location has somewhat been spoilt by resort development with artificial landscaping.\n\nThe waterfall area is a great place to have family picnics, but the place can get crowded during the weekends. The scenery is perfect as you watch the water cascading down with the view of the 600 m high Gunung Muntahak in a distance.\n\nThe Kota Tinggi park was made famous by the river and the waterfall. It is the focal point of the day's outing. Over the years and following growing demands, the park area has been continuously upgraded. The area of the park itself is relatively small. It has a gigantic car park, almost half the area of the park. There is a straight, direct path from the car park to the main waterfall area, along the bank of the river. This walking distance is approximately a kilometer.\n\nAll the way on the left are the food outlets and stalls. Then on the right, is the river itself. There are railings along the banks and the river itself is kept free of rubbish. Picnickers would be on a lookout for any empty spaces in the river.\n\nThere are also many beaches along the coastal part of Kota Tinggi. The most popular beaches are Tanjung Balau, Desaru and Batu Layar, which are 58 km, 55 km, and 62 km from Kota Tinggi town respectively. Chalets and hotels offering reasonable rates can easily be found along the beach.\n\nFor accommodation, one can always go to the Swiss style chalets built near the falls and stay overnight, equipped with cooking facilities. There are public changing rooms and camping grounds at the base of the waterfall. There is also a restaurant nearby that provides both Chinese and Western food. Food stalls are set up here as well. A camping ground has also been opened for those who wish to camp out. There are parking spaces available for cars, buses and motorcycles as well.\n\nMany visitors who have been to Kota Tinggi often leave the place after having a good time. Many go back for repeat visits."

        "content": "A trip to the Bako National Park in Sarawak is a trip my friends and I will always remember. To go there, we took a local bus from central Kuching to the town of Bako. We stopped a few times along the way. One stop is a colorful village on stilts, the wooden houses painted bright colors from which children stream in and out, goats huddle around and mothers do their cooking in.\nWe arrived in Bako and changed our mode of transportation to a longboat. The boatmen took us, crashing through the waves for about fifteen minutes until we were in sight of a beach with huge, multi-colored, limestone cliffs. They told us to take off our shoes because it was low tide. So they could not take the boat up to the jetty. We had to jump out of the boat and walked onto the beach with our heavy backpacks.\n\nAfter walking for half a kilometer, we checked into the Bako National Park headquarters. It was then we decided to take a quick walk into the jungle before it gets dark. We followed a plankwalk while the sun was setting, the best time to spot Proboscis monkeys. We rounded a corner and a black, thin snake slid through the water of a little pond. About fifteen minutes later, we heard something crashing through the trees. This made us stop to see what was happening. There were four of them overhead. At the moment before dark, it started to pour, tropical rainstorm-style, and we had to head back.\n\nThe next day we woke up early to start a hike while the sun was still low. To our right, in the trees, was an entire community of Long Tailed Macquaques. These monkeys were much bolder than the previous night's monkeys. They ventured really close to us, especially when we were taking our cameras out of our bags.\n\nFurther on down the trail was much more serene. We passed loads of pitcher plants: carnivorous, deep pockets with a liquid inside containing enzymes which digest their prey. They were eye-height, and we saw that many of them had dried up. We got to a plateau and the last part of the trail took us down through the rocks and down to the sea. Around the beach are huge, red lakes. The rocks here have deposits of iron throughout them. We ran down, all alone, and jumped into the salty water. This place is fantastic. We were bodysurfing in the South China Sea! While we were drying off, we watched mudskippers, small, fishy things that looked like salamanders, run right across the top of the rusty water.\n\nAfter a rest, we decided to go on another trail in the afternoon, this time through the dense forest. After two absolutely sweaty hours, we reached our destination, Tajor Waterfall. The waterfall itself is quite small and the rocks around the pool are covered in slippery moss. There, we played in the water enjoying the cool water running over our feet. On taking a closer look at the water, we realised that although it was red, it was crystal clear.\n\nThe trip is certainly one I would recommend to those who want to get away from the hectic city for a few days. The Bako National Park is truly a place of natural beauty."

        "content": "Cyber security is an important issue. A computer or cyber crime can be broadly defined as criminal activity involving an information technology infrastructure, including unauthorized access, illegal interception by technical means of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within a computer system, data interference, systems interference and electronic fraud.\nIn very clear terms, when a computer is manipulated to deal with data or a software program in a way that creates loss or damage, a computer crime takes place. This means that a theft or breach of trust has taken place by electronic means. There are several types of computer crimes. Hacking is one of them. It is unauthorized access by any person using a computer and any other communications device to break computer security or circumvent it to enter a computer system. It is air infringement that is at par with `breaking and entering'.\n\nThe gravity of hacking is to be weighed against what is actually done upon illegally entering the computer system. Data may be stolen or integrity of the information may be affected which is akin to sabotage and in both cases, there is damage. Some hackers may do nothing but browse. If the intention of a hacker is to destroy files, this can be classified a crime by electronic means.\n\nPirated software is often made available on unauthorized sites on the Internet and is fairly common. Some people download or purchase pirated software from these sites. Providing pirated software for others to use is a copyright infringement. When you buy software, you do not own it but only acquire the right to use it. Copying a program in its entirety is a contribution to software piracy whereas fair use only allows the reproduction of a part of the copyrighted work.\n\nComputer fraud is dishonest misrepresentation of fact intended to induce another to do or refrain from doing something which causes loss. the act of fraud will result in obtaining a benefit by altering computer input in an unauthorized way. An example is employees altering the data before entry or entering false data or by entering unauthorized instructions or using unauthorized processes. Another example is manipulating banking systems to make unauthorized identity theft with reference to ATM fraud.\n\nAs cyber crimes are skyrocketing, with one recent study finding that ninety percent of corporations surveyed have suffered a computer break-in in the last year, new laws have been passed to impose stricter penalties on those guilty. However, the crimes are best prevented not with new criminal penalties but with common sense and the use of simple digital architecture that enhances security. Since computer criminals are so difficult to prosecute, digital architecture plays an even more important role in fighting crime."

More often than not, people start to exercise or do other physical exertions when they are faced with some ailment or the other.\n\nThere are many options open to the person who has decided to pursue an exercise regimen. But there are some facts to be considered before setting out on a regular exercise schedule. The first and most important step is self-evaluation. Self-evaluation is important because it will save us from hurting ourselves by following regimens that friends follow. It involves taking a good look at our abilities and our disabilities. Not everybody needs the same exercise regimen. Consulting a qualified person to evaluate oneself is important. Equally important is that we choose a program that we can comfortably stick to. This involves a serious look at our resources of free time and convenience as well as the affordability.\n\nAnother important factor is to see that the exercise regimen does not become a chore that we hate doing. There must be some element of entertainment in the exercise that we accept. This would ensure a longer period of adherence. Giving up an exercise can sometimes leave us in a worse state than how we were before the commencement of it.\n\nThis takes us to the next important consideration. The regimen must be one that can be maintained over an extended period of time so that our body adapts to the rigors of it.\n\nAnother important consideration is to evaluate our physical disabilities. If we are on medication of any sort, it is best to consult the doctor in deciding on an exercise regimen. All exercise regimens must be complemented with a responsible eating habit. This also includes the avoidance of alcoholic drinks and the use of tobacco.\n\nConvenient location of gyms, dance halls, yoga centres or tai chi centres is of utmost importance. In the competitive world that we live in, time is of essence. We must ensure that no time is wasted. In fact, the waste of time is one of the causes for the abandonment of exercise regimens."

        "title": "Your company has been asked to give a talk on Electronic commerce to a group of Form 1 students.",
        "content": "Puan Maria bte Ahmad, respected teachers and my fellow students of Form 1, a very good morning to all of you.\n\nIt is a pleasure to address you this morning. I am here to speak to you about Electronic commerce which is also known as e-commerce. Being a student myself, I do not have much personal experience in e-commerce. I have done some airline bookings, cinema reservations and railway bookings over the net.\n\nMuch of what I tell you is the result of research over the internet. E-commerce has gone from being a novel idea to a reflect billions of dollars in transactions every single day. For many people, it has become a way of life.\n\nLet me give you an example of e-commerce. The largest movement of people in the world is when the Chinese leave the cities of China and travel to the rural areas to celebrate Chinese New Year with their families in the villages and outlying towns. About a billion people move during these celebrations. Do you know that more than 70% of them booked their bus, train and other tickets online? One of the biggest benefits of that is that 700 million people did not leave their homes to go out and buy a ticket to travel. 700 million people did not queue up to buy tickets anywhere. This single story of travel tickets sold during the Chinese New Year is enough to wake us all up to the convenience, necessity and relevance of e-commerce.\n\nWhen we go out shopping for gifts for the holidays we are mostly on leave. Being on leave means zero productivity. With the convenience of online shopping, we can save the hours that we would otherwise spend driving, hunting for parking space, buying and physically carrying the purchases to our car. A single working day is called a man day. Coming back to the example, when the 700 million people did not take leave to go out and buy gifts but continued working because they could buy the gifts online, they saved 700 million man days. Can you imagine the economic benefits of that?\n\nIn any business, there are two factors. They are the buyer and the seller. If you open an online shop, you become a seller. The buyer logs in to your website, views the things you sell, studies your prices, then goes off to some other website and compares your prices and guaranteed quality. Then, he makes the purchase. Now, you as the seller have to make arrangements to send the purchased goods to the buyer. Offhand it may sound like a very unsafe way to spend money. But believe me, there are checks and balances in place. It is quite difficult to cheat in online transactions, simply because all your actions are in the public domain. There is no place to hide. And there is no running away. In a cashless society, the minute you buy something with your credit card, you are automatically declaring where you are.\nThe internet is full of companies offering all kinds of services and goods. Besides buying and selling, the internet is also the ideal place for hotel reservations, airline bookings and even checking in for your flight. The methodology involved is quite simple. Most of the websites give simple step by step instructions on how to execute a purchase of a service or goods. Payment, of course, is by credit card.\n\nBefore I conclude, let me give you one more example. Stephen King is a novelist famous for his horror stories. His works are so sought after that his fans wait impatiently for each Stephen King novel to be published. His works become best sellers and usually sell more than a million in the space of six months. More than ten years ago, he decided to publish his latest novel online. Friends, it was a best seller and crossed the million mark in just one week! This, my dear friends, is the past of e-commerce. Can you imagine what the future will be like? I leave you with that thought.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "It is an honour to address you on this lovely morning when people all over the world are celebrating Nature Day. I stand before you to talk to you on how natural resources may be saved for the future generations.\n\nOver the years, we have been taught the importance of reusing and recycling. Through all the different lessons that we had, I do not remember the mention of natural resources. Friends, conservation of natural resources is one of the major reasons that we have been encouraged to reuse and recycle.\n\nLet me focus on just the paper industry. When we say recycling, it is the recycling that immediately comes to mind because as students, this is the one product we use in large quantities. When paper is recycled, it reduces the need to cut down forests. We all know that softwood trees are a big industry. It is from the soft wood that we make paper pulp. Plantations of softwood trees provide a necessary support for the industry. There are many environment impacts in the planting of these trees, their maintenance over the years, the use of fertilisers and herbicides that build up to their harvesting. Each of these activities has its own impact on the environment. Every plantation is also a forest. When the forest is cut down in the name of harvesting the trees, there is a direct impact on the plants and animals that have established themselves in that forest.\n\nWhen we recycle paper, there is no impact on flora and fauna due to deforestation. There is no threat to species due to loss of habitat. Thus, there is no disturbance to the natural environment. No workers are exposed to herbicides or the release of any dioxins. Consequently, there is hardly any acidification of oceans.\n\nThe forests that were not cut down to be replaced by plantations and the flora and fauna that live in that habitat remained undisturbed simply because we recycle paper. I have spoken to you only of the recycling of paper. Using paper as an example, can you imagine the beneficial impact that each one of us can have on the environment when we ensure that we recycle and reuse as much as possible? There are close to 7 billion of us on this planet. Can you imagine how much of the resources we could save by opting for reusing and recycling? I leave you with that thought.\n\nThank you.\nHappy Nature Day!"

        "title": "Takahe - A flightless bird",
        "content": "The Takahe is a flightless bird indigenous to New Zealand. It was thought to be extinct after the last four known specimens were taken in 1898. However, on the 20th of November, 1948, after a carefully planned search effort the bird was rediscovered by Geoffrey Orbell.\nThe New Zealand Department of Conservation started an intense management program with the intention of increasing the size and range of the Takahe population. An important feature of this involved habitat restoration. The red deer was an introduced species that proved destructive in the area where the Takahe naturally survived. The red deer were culled to increase the Takahe's chances of survival.\n\nCaptive rearing of wildlife species for release back into the wild is considered a useful management tool for endangered species. It potentially increases the rate of survival of the young by bypassing the dangers faced in the crucial years into adulthood. To assess the success rate of the program, it becomes necessary to monitor the survival rate of the released animals. This helps to assess the survival skills of captive reared animals. The survival rate of wild Takahe over the first year after being born was already known to be poor. The captive-reared specimens overcame this mortality rate because of captivity. In the wild, the survival rate was 30 - 40%, whereas in captivity it was 85%.\n\nRadio telemetry is the use of radio waves for transmitting information from a distant instrument to a device that records the measurements. Radio transmitters attached to the birds had batteries that lasted three years. It was used to track the movement and survival of the captive-reared Takahe that had been released.\n\nThe Takahe normally breed in pairs and both parents care for the eggs and chicks. Clutches normally consist of two eggs, but parents rarely raise two chicks. The Takahe management program involved the fostering of single eggs to the pair of parents. The second egg was systematically collected for artificial incubation and rearing.\n\nWhen the eggs hatched, the chicks were placed under a suspended model of an adult Takahe complete with a heated pad and hygienic cloth nest material. This was to simulate brooding by a real parent. A small speaker concealed in the nest played quiet calls recorded from brooding parents in the wild. Up to 5 chicks were thus reared with each model parent.\n\nAn important measure of the captive-rearing program was that chicks were unable to see their human keepers. The chicks were fed from a dish of food by a glove puppet simulating the head and neck of an adult Takahe. After about six weeks, the chicks are able to feed themselves from dishes. At that time, puppet feeding was discontinued.\n\nOne of the original long-term goals of the Takahe program was to establish a self-sustaining wild population of at least 500 Takahe. At the last count in 2013, the wild population of Takahe stood at 263."

They are noticeable especially by the raucous sounds that they produce each evening when they come in to roost. You have never seen any studies of birds in the city. Write a letter of appeal to the Mayor requesting that one be initiated and a program be instituted to monitor them regularly",
        "content": "I am an avid bird watcher. I have been observing the city birds of Kuala Lumpur. Due to the natural deforestation that occurs in areas close to Kuala Lumpur, many birds now find places within the city to reside. The most common is the triangular enclosed area behind the large advertisements boards on unipoles. It is a natural choice for the birds because the unipoles are similar to trees, tall and far from ground based threats.\n\nSir, there are several species that live in these places. The surprising thing is that out of necessity, there are easily more than five or six species that roost together. The number of residents at each place goes into the thousands.\n\nAll my efforts to learn more about these birds have led me to the conclusion that there have not been any consistent studies or the monitoring of these city dwellers. The innovative habitats, eating habits, adaptation to life in a city, diseases, mortality rate and such other information are not available.\n\nI humbly wish to submit that it is important to fill this gap. I would like to propose that a program be initiated to study about the birds that reside within the city. We would not know if they were facing extinction. The importance of the continued existence of all species cannot be stressed enough. It could be convenient to employ or at least commission bird watchers to do the initial studies by providing them with basic necessities for such study and the necessary guidelines.\n\nSir, who knows? Future city buildings may have to have facilities for urban bird species to build their nests. It is common knowledge that many wildlife species have adapted to city dwelling. Let me point out that no birds may be seen drinking from the many fountains in the city. It is as if they knew that we use chemically treated water to avoid the breeding of mosquitoes.\n\nI hope this appeal meets with your kind approval and we can create a historical chapter on the birds of Kuala Lumpur. I strongly believe that it will become a permanent part of the history of Kuala Lumpur. I am sure that it will spur cities all over the world to maintain up-to-date records of city-birds."

        "content": "Lately the environment in most housing areas have seen an increase in randomly strewn rubbish in the form of discarded plastic bottles, plastic bags and food wrappers of shapes and sizes. Unkempt hedges and clogged drains add to the general gloomy effect that is brought up by such neglect.\n\nMore often than not, rubbish bins get damaged due to the rough handling by the rubbish removal contractors. It is easy to imagine that this behavior of the workers is the same in all the other areas where they go. This is an irresponsible way to handle public property. Such matters must immediately be brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.\n\nMaintaining the cleanliness of the environment is everybody's responsibility. More often than not, it is irresponsible behavior that leads to the accumulation of rubbish everywhere. If people were to be diligent about discarding bottles and plastic bags in the rubbish bins provided, this problem would not arise. So, it may be suggested that a re-education program be instituted by the Residents' Association. This may take the form of letters to all the residents as well as posters placed in strategic places like the office of the RA as well as near the entrance to lifts.\nSuch efforts should coincide with a communal effort at clearing up all the accumulated debris. Organizing a gotong royong for the purpose not only clears away the rubbish, it is also a useful method for the residents of a locality to become more familiar with each other and build up the communal spirit.\n\nThere must be a conscious awareness of the pest population in the locality. Rats and cockroaches are the most rampant when given the chance. The presence of cats in a neighborhood can work wonders to reduce the rat population. Pest control is a serious matter that has to be reported to the correct authorities so that they may send professionals who are trained to handle the poisons usually used to control pests.\n\nAn important factor in controlling mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue is preventive action. It must be ensured that there is no stagnation of water where mosquitoes can breed. If the mosquito population is excessively high, we can always call the authorities to conduct fogging activities.\n\nA clean environment can only be achieved when we understand our civic responsibility and do not behave in a manner detrimental to the upkeep of a clean environment. It is not just the responsibility of the government to ensure that the environment is always amenably clean. It is up to the citizens to take up the responsibility to address issues when they are small than to wait for the government to recognize when a problem has become large and then address it top down."

        "title": "Ensuring Personal Health",
        "content": "Ensuring one's personal health is the responsibility of each citizen. It involves being disciplined in physical and mental matters. The former is relevant to maintaining physical health. Mental matters relate to having the right attitude and values. Both physical and mental discipline is important on more than just on the personal level. We are lucky to have a responsible government. The government has made medical expenses accessible at minimal rates. This is because the expenses are subsidised by the government. Many diseases that we see may be proven to be a result of a lack of physical and mental discipline.\n\nPhysical discipline involves maintaining the health of the body. There are many factors to consider in the matter. Many people feel proud at building up massive muscles. But they fail to remember that there is an age limit after which it would be impossible to do such exercises. In maintaining physical health, the better objective is to follow a regimen that ensures good toning of the muscles.\n\nA physical trainer's advice will be useful in creating a set of simple exercises that will benefit all the parts of the body. There is both and right and wrong way to do even simple exercises. The trainer's advice will be invaluable in getting to know how to avoid injuries. A nutritionist may be able to advice on an ideal diet that will be helpful for good physical health. Besides, we can also get a good understanding of what types of food should be avoided. Family diseases are a reality. Having knowledge of diseases that a family is prone to suffer will be helpful. The advice of a doctor may be sought to find out what may be done to delay or totally avoid the onset of family diseases.\n\nOn the mental level, it is important to have commitment to one's physical discipline. The danger is that one can be negatively influenced by friends. It is best to avoid such people. It must be remembered that the best friends are people who share common interests with you. So, it will always be better to have friends who have similar physical and mental discipline as you.\n\nWhen we start working, depending on the nature of the work, it may become difficult to follow the regimen of exercises. We must learn how to adapt so that one's physical health is not sacrificed for the sake of professional commitments. Adjustments must be made so that the physical discipline is maintained.\nAnother important area in mental training is developing good relationships with one's friends and relatives. The joy of living is in having good friends and relatives. All forms of physical and mental discipline will become meaningless if one is unhappy. The greatest wealth in life is good physical and mental health. Physical health can be achieved with the right personal habits. Mental health is achieved only with healthy relationship with one's peers.\n\nAs a footnote, it should never be forgotten that physical and mental discipline are just the path to healthy living. One should never allow physical and mental discipline to supersede the importance of having a happy and healthy life with ones' friends and relatives."

You were more impressed on how youngsters tend to overdo using the internet and become addicted to it. Your teacher has asked you to give a talk at school, on why it is necessary to limit time spent on the internet.",
        "content": "I recently attended a workshop by Ukub books on how to manage time spent on the use of the internet. I am here to share my experience with all of you. Much of what I heard at the workshop really altered my impression of the internet. I hope that you will agree with me by the time I finish my talk. First of all, let me draw your attention to a basic fact. Nearly all of us have a mobile phone. Gone are the days when you needed a computer to log onto the internet. Today, all mobile phones are internet enabled. When a computer was needed to get on the internet, there was the safety of parental supervision. The story is different with mobile phones. Nobody observes us when we use the mobile phone. Hence it is up to us to ensure that we do not create hazards for others when we use our mobile phones. At the same time we must also be alert to our own safety, too. If you check youtube, you will be shocked to find that so many people have been knocked down by all sorts of vehicles when they walked into the path of traffic while busy looking at their mobiles.\n\nAnother big drawback of constantly communicating via whatsapp, twitter and other such social media is that we meet face to face less and less. In the long run, we lose all sense of decent social behaviour. The importance of meeting each people is a totally different subject, so I shall leave it at just this mention.\n\nHardly any of us switch off our mobile phones at night. Many of us receive whatsapp messages and tweets even in the middle of the night. Disturbed sleep has been proven to have a direct impact on worsening grades in school. Worsening grades directly means worsening prospects for the future. Nobody dreams of becoming a menial worker. But without proper education, that could be the only option in the future.\n\nAfter drugs and alcohol, the internet has been discovered to the third most addictive thing on earth. If you don't believe me, just leave your mobile phones away for 2 days. Even the thought of it is traumatic. That is how closely we have become to the mobile phone which in other words means the internet.\n\nThe most important lesson that I got from the workshop was that with mobile phones, we have to regulate ourselves. As I said earlier, we are not supervised when we use a mobile phone. So, it is up to us to make rules for ourselves. We should vow never to look at the phone or its messages when we are walking anywhere. We must always sit down somewhere before we read our messages. We must turn off our devices before we go to sleep. If possible, we must communicate via social media on at pre-determined intervals. Once a day is okay, but the time must be limited.\n\nWhat I have mentioned is all in passing. I truly hope you will check out the facts that I mentioned, the next time you surf the net. Then, you will agree that mobile phones and the internet can be hazards in more ways than we know. The best thing is to treat them with respect and use them in moderation."

        "content": "Dear Johan,\nHow are you? I hope you enjoyed our meeting in the village as much as I did. It was totally fabulous.\n\nI write to tell you of my concerns about some of your personal habits. I don't mean to intrude, but I think I should tell you these things because nowadays people think it is not nice to advice one's peers. But I do not think so. I write because I really care for you. I have the best intentions in what I say. I hope you will understand my seriousness and sincerity.\n\nJohan, remember you used to stay from all sports and games in school simply because you were not very robust. When I met you last week, I was initially a little disturbed at how much your weight had increased. Gone was the skinny guy I knew so well. Over the week, I realised that you had changed your habits in some ways that worries me.\n\nJohan, I realise that you have picked up less than wise eating habits. I suppose it started because you used to be rather thin in school. Let me point out to you, there is a way to increase weight properly and healthy and there is a way to gain weight in unhealthy ways. I feel like screaming at you that you have chosen the latter way.\n\nJohan, we are still young and healthy. But you would be surprised at how fast all that can be spoilt because of various reasons. Our body is under our own personal care. Nobody else is going to look after it for you, unless you are sick all the time and will need nursing.\n\nDo you remember going through our grandfather's photo album? What stroke me was how healthy and robust our grandfather's parents were in the pictures. They belonged to the agrarian generation and used to work the fields for long hours. Besides, they had the freshest of vegetables, fish and meat because everything was sourced locally.\n\nJohan, I want you to get involved in some form of physical exercise on a regular basis. I already have my own regimen. Besides, you have to read up about nutrition and what types of food are bad for you. Believe me when I tell you from what I have observed, you need to make some serious changes.\n\nRemember that I beat Harris swimming across the river? How do you think I managed that when he was the school's athletics star? The answer is simple. I got into regular exercises and a controlled diet. He did not. See how fast things can change with exercise and watching one's nutrition? Johan, you can be the next one to defeat Harris. Don't forget, you have the genes for it. After all, we are descendants of some really healthy and sturdy Malay folks from the countryside.\n\nBest wishes\n\nJalal"

        "title": "You are the president of the Consumer Club in your school. During the launch you have to give a speech on how to be a wise consumer.",
        "content": "Good morning teachers and friends. I am glad to have this opportunity to speak to you today as we launch Consumer Week. All of us are consumers. We buy all kinds of goods and services. Unfortunately, not all of us are wise consumers. We need to know how to be wise consumers so that we do not fall victim to unscrupulous retailers who are out to take advantage of our ignorance. We need to be smart consumers so that we can get the most of our money. I'm going to give you some tips on how to be a wise consumer and receive fair exchange for your money.\n\nHere's my first tip. As a wise consumer, you should not buy too much on credit. This is because when you buy on credit you are actually adding to the cost of the product when you pay interest to the credit card vendor. Therefore, make sure you budget your money before you go shopping. Plan before you buy and make sure you have sufficient money before you go shopping.\nWhen out shopping, you shouldn't buy the first item you see. As a wise consumer you should realize that you need to shop around. Look for available discounts and special deals. You may find the same product going at a lower price at different outlets. Thus, shopping around will make you a wise consumer who can find the best price for the item you wish to purchase. This will certainly save you your hard-earned money!\n\nLet's move on to my third tip. To be a wise consumer you should avoid impulse purchases. Do not make a purchase just because it's on offer, or because the salesperson is very persuasive and you find it difficult to say `no, thank you'! Always remember that retailers will do their best to lure you into buying their products. If you are armed with a list and are determined to stick to that list, you won't spend money unnecessarily on items you don't need.\n\nNext, as a wise consumer try to buy in bulk. This is a good practice because it means you have to make less trips out in the car. That will save you fuel and time. However, you should only buy as much as you can use before the item spoils or expires. There is no point in buying so much that you have to throw away most of it because it has passed its expiry date and is not fit for consumption. So buy in bulk, knowing it usually works out cheaper, but do so responsibly.\n\nFinally, as you go down the aisle to select purchases, search the shelves carefully. Look for items that are placed high or low on the shelves. Such items are often cheaper compared to the higher-priced brand name products gnat are conveniently placed at eye-level. Manufacturers actually pay to have their products placed at the consumer's eye-level. That is why the products' at eye-level are more expensive. As a wise consumer it is good to search for the cheaper products.\n\nIn short, being a smart consumer is not difficult. All you need to do is to make a few small changes to your shopping habits, and exercise some self-control. You will find that it will have a huge, positive impact on your bank account. And, as you continue to make smart consumer choices you will learn to operate within a comfortable budget, and in so doing, live within your means. Thank you."

        "title": "You have been invited to give a talk to members of the Computer Club on using electronic mail.",
        "content": "Good morning boys and girls. It is a privilege to be able to speak to you this morning. I am sure most of you know how to use computers and communicate electronically. This is essential for all of us nowadays so I assume most of you are familiar with Cut, Copy, Paste, and other basic word-processing functions. I would like to give you some advice on an additional computer skill, namely writing electronic mail or e-mail, as it is commonly known. In my talk, I shall cover e-mail basics such as composing and sending messages, responding to messages and, observing Internet etiquette.\nLet's begin with some essential features of an e-mail message. Before you can contact a person electronically you should first enter his or her e-mail address in the To or Recipient field. Make sure you type the address exactly: an incorrect symbol or letter will send the message astray. Once that's done, give the message a subject heading that describes its content. This helps the reader to know what priority to assign the message. If you intend to send copies to others as well, then you should include their addresses in the Cc field. When you have done that, compose a suitable message. It should be concise and relevant to your recipients' concerns.\n\nWhat if you wish to respond to an e-mail message? Use the Reply feature of your e-mail program, keeping the following in mind. You need to check that the response addresses the appropriate person. When you use the Reply feature it will prompt the email program to provide a message screen with the original sender's address inserted in the To field. Your address will be inserted in the From field, and the addresses of the recipients of the original copy, in the Cc field. If a message is only for a single person, delete any additional addresses. Finally, you should check that the reply still has an appropriate subject heading.\n\nI shall now tell you how to communicate effectively online. To do this, you'll need to abide by some simple courtesies. Not everyone observes this netiquette, or Internet etiquette, but let me assure you that those who do observe it receive thoughtful and considerate replies. When sending online messages you should not scold or be rude to your reader. Some users tend to use capital letters only in their messages, which is equivalent to a SHOUT. This is not a good idea. When composing a message, remember to address your reader by name if possible, and sign off with your own name. It helps your reader if you use short, well-spaced paragraphs. This makes reading much easier. It also helps if you take the time to read and edit your message before you send it off. Proofreading helps get rid of errors (in grammar, punctuation and spelling). Also, try to condense and clarify your ideas as well as moderate your tone. A good way to indicate emotions, for example, is to use emoticons, such as the smiley, which can help to moderate your tone.\n\nFinally, when, reading and responding to messages try to be less critical. For example, you should avoid nitpicking over spelling or other surface errors. Always keep in mind that attitudes are sometimes difficult to convey, so give authors an initial benefit of the doubt. It is important not to be judgmental. Before I close, let me remind you to always exercise courtesy and consideration just as you would in any communication. In this way you will be able to e-mail more effectively. Thank you."

In my speech, I am going to tell you why we should read the newspaper. I shall give you three main benefits of reading newspapers.\n\nWhy should we read the newspaper? The first reason is that newspapers give us the latest news. We read about what is happening around us. We become aware of current events. We don't just get news about events and happenings in Malaysia but also from around the world. We get information about the latest events, discoveries, and improvements in the various fields of science, technology, arts and medicine. Thus, newspapers inform us and keep us updated about changes that are taking place in the world.\nLet me go on to another benefit. Newspapers help to increase our knowledge. As we read the news items, for example, we learn the names of towns and cities within Malaysia or around the world. Our knowledge of geography improves. We might read about leaders of various countries and become familiar with their names and their policies. We also become more aware of social and environmental issues, health concerns, and technological advancements. Thus, our general knowledge will improve and we will find it easier to talk to others and to join in discussions. We will be able to contribute to conversations because we know more. We will be more confident. We will also appear more interesting because we will be able to speak on various topics.\n\nThis brings me to the third, but by no means the smallest benefit. When we read the newspaper regularly our language skills will improve. We will be able to speak and write more effectively. How does this happen? As we read, we are exposed to new vocabulary and a variety of words, phrases and idiomatic language. As time goes by, we will realize that our vocabulary has widened, and our grammar and sentence structure has improved. This will make us feel more confident in social situations or when having to express ourselves in writing.\n\nBefore I conclude, I would like to encourage all of you to read the newspapers. It is affordable and definitely of benefit to us. Now that you know that reading the newspaper can improve your language skills, increase your knowledge, as well as bring you the latest news, you really have no reason not to read the newspapers. You don't have to go far to get a newspaper. It is easily available. Let's take up the challenge, boys and girls. Read the newspaper, every day! Thank you."

        "title": "You are a health officer. You have been invited to advise a group of students on how to keep healthy.",
        "content": "Good morning to the principal, teachers and students. I am here today to speak about how to keep healthy. The title of my speech is 'Be Wise, Keep Healthy'. As students it is important for you to look after your health. Your health can affect your performance in school. If you do not ensure that you are healthy you will fall ill often and be absent from school. You will miss lessons and have to work extra hard to catch up on what you have missed. The strain may cause you to fall ill again. And so begins the vicious circle. My advice to you is to be wise and maintain your health at all times. Here are three simple, yet important, ways in which you can do this.\nFirst, make sure you eat well. Your body needs nourishment. You need protein, carbohydrates and vitamins. You should eat at least three meals a day. It is not enough just to eat, though. You must eat a balanced diet at all times. Use the food pyramid as your guide. Avoid junk food as it is full of fat and empty carbohydrates. It is best to eat home-cooked food. It is good for you. It is clean, and much cheaper than the fast foods many of you seem to enjoy. So remember my first point - eat well but make sure you eat healthy food.\n\nSecond, you need to exercise. As students, many of you have no time to exercise. You come to school, rush home, have lunch, nap, rush for tuition, do your homework and then you're off to bed. How many of you know the saying 'all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy'? if you want to do better in your studies, make time for exercise. It doesn't have to be every day. Three times a week is good enough. And it doesn't have to be exhausting. Just a brisk walk round the block for half an hour should do. It's a good way to blow the cobwebs away and get the oxygen into your system. You'll be surprised how energetic you feel after that. Your concentration will improve and you will not feel so lethargic. So do not neglect regular exercise.\n\nFinally, you need to have a good night's sleep - about eight hours. Many of you may be going to bed very late. As a result, you will not be getting enough sleep. This is why you find it difficult to wake up in the morning. When you are in school you struggle to stay awake when the teacher is teaching. I am sure you enjoy watching late night movies. Or, you may be addicted to computer games. They can be so absorbing that you forget the time. When you finally do go to bed it is well past midnight. My advice is, don't cheat on your sleep. It will affect your health. It will also affect your studies. What is the use of falling asleep while the teacher is teaching? You may as well not come to school. Remember your body needs proper rest.\n\nBefore I end my talk let me stress that you should not take your health for granted. You must look after it. The best way to do this is to ensure that you eat good nutritious food, exercise regularly, and have sufficient sleep. These are as important as breathing. They ensure your body is healthy. When your body is healthy you will be able to concentrate on your studies. On the other hand, if you continue to neglect your health with bad eating habits, a lack of exercise and insufficient sleep, you will fall ill and your studies will be affected. The choice is yours. I hope you will, therefore, be wise and keep healthy. Thank you."

        "title": "Giving gift cards in lieu of gifts is acceptable. Do you agree ?",
        "content": "Everyone gets one at least once in his or her lifetime - a gift card. And as I see it, there are two main reasons why someone might only give someone a gift card. Either the person giving the gift card feels as though he or she genuinely wants to give the gift receiver a gift but does not know him or her well or well enough to know what to get. Or the gift card giver feels somewhat obligated to present a gift but does not genuinely want to present either a personal gift or any gift at all to the person in question.\nSome gift card receivers argue that getting the gift card really is no gift at all. Why? One, because the gifted feels as though they were not thought of enough on a personal level to be worthy of a more individually tailored gift. If your gift receiver feels this way, it is likely that he or she might cast aside the gift card and hence, not remember to use it for a period of time. If this occurs in your case, you, as the gift giver, run into your second and more pressing problem which is that the more time that elapses before your gifted uses the gift card, the more chance you run as the gift giver that the gift card will expire.\n\nThat being said, giving money in a card as a gift has become a very popular method of giving a gift for weddings, birthdays, anniversary celebrations or other special occasions in a person's life. While it is an excellent idea when you don't have any idea of what would make a suitable gift, it can also be very boring and give the suggestion that you could not take the time to buy a gift and wrap it for the occasion. An alternative to giving cash or a check in the card is to purchase a gift card from a store of choice where the recipients can buy something of value that will have special meaning for them.\n\nThere is no doubt that everyone likes to receive money as a gift. The problem is that quite often the money gets spent for necessities, which is fine, but then there is nothing left to remind the recipient of you and your generosity. For wedding gifts, it is best to ask questions about what the couple's needs are in the type of gifts they receive and even if you do present them with money as a gift, you can use a unique display that they will remember. For example, if the couple would like to use the money they receive as a down payment for their house, you can purchase a small toy house and fill it with bills of your choice.\n\nChildren like receiving money as well. For young children, you can start a bank account to which you add money as gifts for all the special occasions in their life. This is a gift that parents will appreciate because it gives the child a head start on college when they want to start such a fund. You can also buy a money box and fill it with coins so that both parents and the child can spend the money in whatever way they wish and will still have the money box after the coins have been spent.\n\nCoupons and gift cards make suitable monetary gifts from all stores. The man who loves tools will enjoy a gift card from a home improvement or hardware store. Teenagers always love gift cards from video stores, music stores and clothing stores. For the lady who is into crafts will really enjoy receiving a gift card from her favorite craft store. The same thing applies to those who love to read.\n\nSending money to those who live far away is a viable option to purchasing gifts, packing them to send in the mail and taking the risk on them getting lost or broken in transit. Even if you do pay extra for insurance, it is still disappointing for both parties when a gift does not arrive on time or is unusable when it does. The main thing to remember when sending money by mail is that you should always use a check or money order rather than sending cash.\n\nGift cards also make great gifts because you want to be careful not to offend someone who may have different beliefs than yours when you are selecting a gift. When you have presented a gift card as a gift, you have left the option open for the receiver to select the appropriate gift, whether it is an article of clothing, a piece of jewelry or even dinnerware. This will alleviate the concern of selecting the right texture, size or even color.\n\nGift cards make great gifts because they offer flexibility and convenience for the spender, and they are loaded with endless shopping possibilities. Furthermore, gift cards alleviate frustration and worry about selecting the perfect gift or selecting an appropriate item. You can't go wrong when you present gift cards as a gift. There is no doubt that your monetary gift will be appreciated, especially if you take the time to make sure it is well presented.\n\nAll in all I have to say that giving gift cards in lieu of gifts is aptly acceptable."

        "title": "Describe how the saying became significant in your life. 'The evil you do remains with you; the good you do comes back to you.'",
        "content": "My mother always had a saying for every occasion. But she especially loved one saying which she constantly used on me whenever I hurt any person or animal. She kept telling me, \"The evil you do remains with you; the good you do comes back to you.\" I scratched my head every time she said it, trying to understand what she meant. But it was only when I was ten that she finally explained the meaning of her favorite 'mantra' and that too, through a story. This is how the story went.\nA woman baked chapatti (a type of bread) every morning for the members of her family. She made an extra one for any hungry passer-by who came by and kept it on the windowsill for whoever passing by to take it away. Every day, an old hunchback came and took away the chapatti. But instead of expressing gratitude, he muttered the following words as he went his way. \"The evil you do remains with you; the good you do comes back to you.\" This went on, day after day. Every day, the hunchback came, picked up the chapatti and uttered the same words. No one else came by to take the offering.\n\nThe woman felt irritated. \"Not a word of thanks,\" she said to herself. \"Every day this hunchback takes my chapatti and utters this jingle! What does he mean?\" One day, exasperated and sick of hearing his refrain, she decided to get rid of him. \"I shall do away with this hunchback and stop hearing his silly jingle every day,\" she said to herself. What could she do? She thought for a while and then decided to add poison to the chapatti she prepared for him!\n\nAfter making the poisoned chapatti, she was about to keep it on the windowsill when her conscience pricked her. Her hands trembled. \"What is this I am doing?\" she said in horror. \"How can I even think of taking away life?\" Immediately, she threw the chapatti into the fire, prepared a fresh one and kept it on the windowsill. As usual, the hunchback came, picked up the chapatti and muttered the words, \"The evil you do remains with you; the good you do comes back to you.\" This time, he gave her an enigmatic look as if he could read her thoughts.\n\nThe hunchback proceeded on his way blissfully, unaware of the war raging in the mind of the woman. Every day, as the woman placed the chapatti on the windowsill, she would offer a prayer for her eldest son, who had gone to a distant place to seek his fortune. For many months, she had no news of him, so she prayed for his safe return and kept her mind strong in this way.\n\nThat evening, there was a knock on the door. She opened it and was surprised to find her son standing in the doorway. He had grown thin and lean. His garments were torn and tattered. He was hungry, starved and weak. When he saw his mother, he said, \"Mum, it's a miracle I'm here. While I was but a mile away, I was so famished that I collapsed. I would have died, but for an old hunchback passing by. I begged him for a bit food and he was kind enough to give me a whole chapatti. As he gave it to me, he said that it was what he ate every day but today, he would give it to me as my need was greater than his! It was very kind of him, Mum! It really revived me and gave me the strength to reach here.\"\n\nWhen the woman heard these words, her face turned pale and she leaned against the door for support. In horrified shock, she thought of the poisoned chapatti she had made that morning. Had she not burnt it in the fire, it would have been eaten by her own son and he would have lost his life!\n\nIt was then that she realised the significance of the words, \"The evil you do remains with you; the good you do comes back to you.\" Do good and don't ever stop doing good, even if it is not appreciated at that time. But one day, you will reap the reward for what you have done. She had fed the old man and he had saved her son with the very food that she had given him.\n\nThe story touched me and I too, understood the meaning of her words finally. I decided that I would do good in future in order to be blessed with good fortune."

        "title": "To improve relationship between friends and reduce negative relationships, you have been asked to write an article on 'How to be a Good Friend' for your school magazine.",
        "content": "We know that `No man is an island' and that we should have friends. A good friend is like a precious gem. We do not live alone like a hermit. We need others to appreciate, encourage, love and accept us for who we are. The benefits of having a good friend are many and varied. There are times in everyone's life when we need a friend to talk to, to lean on or just to have a company and feel the benefits of having someone near.\nFriends give meaning and satisfaction to our lives. We need their encouragement and comfort when we are sad or disappointed. We like to share our triumphs and achievements with them. What a relief to have a friend whom we can call upon for help in times of crisis. A friend in need is a friend indeed.\n\nThe benefits of having a good friend include having someone to talk to freely and confidentially about any problems one may be having. The benefits of having a good friend to talk to in the above sense also mean that it is having someone to lean on and reach out to for support. When we are troubled, our friends lend us their ears. Having a good friend to pour their hearts out could prevent many depressed persons from taking their own lives or banning themselves or others. Knowing that someone cares gives strength to the downcast friends to stand up again.\n\nA good friend is someone with whom one is likely to share common interests and favorite pastimes. Sharing activities such as these with a good friend can alone give great pleasure. We laugh at our friends and we laugh with them. Laughter is like a good medicine to our souls. We enjoy telling jokes to one another. Laughter brings friends closer together. It takes away tension and friction. Your good friend will also help you extend your circle of friends as you may not know everyone whom your friend knows. It will be lots of fun to meet new people who may one day become good friends of yours too.\n\nA good friendship does not sprout overnight. It takes time and effort to cultivate and nurture a relationship. For a start, we ourselves have to be a friend first before we can have friends. We must acknowledge them and be thoughtful of them. We should not look down on those who are less privileged or successful than us. Acts of kindness strengthen a friendship. To begin with, learn to remember your friends' names. A name is very important to someone. If you don't take the time to learn someone's name, it indicates that you are not interested in him or her. When someone remembers your name, it gives you the feeling that you are interesting and important.\n\nIt is important to remember that there are times when it is important to be a good friend yourself. Everyone needs their good friends at certain times in their lives. We must remember that there will come a time where our good friends need us and we have to ensure that we are there in every aspect described above. A good friendship should be seen in this respect as a partnership in a sense all about giving and taking.\n\nA good friend will first of all listen in this respect and thereafter, perhaps offer pieces of advice. It is likely that we can discuss the solutions to such problems with our friends, and the old saying that `Two heads are better than one' can effectively be applied. Very often, the simple act of listening to a good friend can in itself bring comfort if not solutions to problems. This can help to relieve stress and tension, and start the process of healing or simply feeling better.\n\nYour friend will also appreciate you keeping her confidence and not spread gossip. By showing that you are trustworthy, your friend will trust and rely on you. As a good friend, you should also be prepared to stick by your friend through thick and thin as nobody likes a fair-weather friend. So don't be one.\n\nInterestingly enough, as much as you want to be supportive to your friend, you should not be seen as a pest. You may find this amusing but your friend needs his or her space and time on his or her own; you too, should set boundaries so that you get your time alone too. This will allow both of you to discover things on your own and grow personally.\n\nOne important aspect of being a good friend is to accept correction from your friends. Your best friend gets your back, and he or she cares enough about you to correct you and point out your mistakes so that you can improve and be a better person.\n\nDo not have a big ego. Always be humble. If you give the impression that you know it all, that you are superior, you make it hard for people to like you. Compliment your friends and congratulate them on their hard work and achievements, or express sympathy when they are in sorrow or if they feel discouraged or down. Give strength to your friends by supporting them. Help them to be stronger and they will give you affection in return.\n\nA lasting friendship is built on trust and a spirit of give and take. Friendship means helping one another as the saying goes, `One good turn deserves another'. We must be thankful for having good friends. A friendship takes work and is a partnership where both parties need to give and take for it to work. Selfishness must be put aside and you will benefit greatly from your friendship."

        "title": "Describe a significant event in your life and the impact that it had on you",
        "content": "Most people would consider a significant event in their lives in relation to some great truth or revelation or to an action made by someone else, probably a significant relative or something similar. To me, my significant event is more mundane. Although experienced by countless teenagers around the world, it still had an impact on my life. I remember all too well, my first traffic ticket. Being seventeen and done with the SPM examinations, the driving license was a rite of passage that announced to the world that I was a 'man' with freedom and mobility. Admittedly, I was a bit of a brash adolescent but the new-found freedom of driving was a bit intoxicating. At least there was nothing else in my system to impair my 'rough-around-the-edges' driving skills.\nMy dad's red Proton Saga had clicked its 300th kilometer mark on the milometer. Still, he was probably as nervous as any parent should be when 'required' to hand over the key to a 'man' and pray he will return with both car and kid in one piece. I was not so concerned with such matters. \"Hey, at that age, we're all bulletproof... invincible... immortal! A car crash? No, that would never happen.\"\n\nFortunately, I did not hit anything or anybody. But that hill along Jalan Kelisa was a tricky one for an auto with manual transmission. It rose at a good thirty degree angle, maybe more. At the time it felt like ninety! I kept inching the clutch in and out, riding it like I was told never to do and trying to keep the engine from stalling while not ramming into the car in front. There was plenty of traffic too on this hot and humid day. \"Come on!\" I muttered. \"Will the light ever turn green?\" Drawing that balance of trying to keep cool, not let the car roll back and switch radio stations was a tricky business.\n\nThe traffic light did change to the splendid color of go and the cars moved forwards through the intersection. Just as I reached it, left foot pushing in the clutch, left hand trying to find the gear, the light all too quickly hit the warning yellow. I shifted. The car stalled. Horns honked. It was Kuala Lumpur after all, people had lives to get to and money to make.\n\nFace burning as red as the color the light now glowed, I managed somehow to restart the car and roughly jerk through the intersection. All this while, I tried to avoid the angry glances from the cars waiting their turn at the traffic light. After gaining confidence, I sped down the road and headed for an easy intersection. Seeing the familiar amber traffic light flash, I knew I would be able to make it before the red light flashed even if it was my dad's ancient Proton Saga, I was expecting to race.\n\nAs I 'zoomed' past the intersection, my eyes caught the flash of headlights synchronized with the `whoop whoop' of the police siren. \"Oh, just great!\" I thought and my heart sank. I pulled over and started living for real all those scenes in television shows about traffic violations and uber-cops. The humiliation continued with each passing minute feeling like a day as I tried to find the registration for the impatient policeman. After locating that offending document and wrestling with the license that always seem to get stuck in the plastic clear section of my wallet, the officer wrote the ticket and handed it to me. It felt like a death sentence.\n\nMaybe it was only a moving violation, but I knew facing Dad was going to be harder than any city judge and it was. With burning ears and tiny giggles from my 15-year-old sister, that event changed my life for the better. I got over it, like most teenagers and time healed my wounded pride. The lesson was learned about proper driving skills, keeping your cool and the responsibility of showing up for court and taking my medicine. My wish for a dismissed charge never materialized, but a sincere contrite appearance and first offence lessened the verdict from what could have been reckless driving to just running a red light. The wheels of justice turned and in this case, made me a better driver."

        "title": "How does fashion create identities ?",
        "content": "My mother always said, \"You can tell what a person is like based on what he or she is wearing.\" Was there any truth in her words? Clothes do define a person in many ways. In the past, clothes were the easiest article on the body to make a statement, to stand out from the masses, to convey a message and many more. Some examples of these 'standing out' became very popular and were followed by more people. This was the moment when fashion appeared.\nNowadays, fashion is sometimes defined as a 'constantly changing trend, favored for frivolous rather than practical, logical or intellectual reasons'. I can imagine the images of fashion catwalks where fashion houses display the season's hottest hits, and many are almost impossible to wear, yet these pieces are evaluated, commented and practically obsessed by the fashion world each time a fashion show date arrives. Nevertheless, clothing has become an integral part of self-realization of every person.\n\nThe type of clothing completely depends on the person who is wearing it, therefore, it becomes a reflection of his perception of himself, which leads us to the term - personal identity. The choice of clothing is as important as identification through the color of hair, height, skin and gender. Clothing nowadays is a media of information about the person wearing it. It is like a code that needs a decryption in order to understand what kind of person is underneath it. As every cloth carries a strong message about its owner, every owner places a certain value in it, depending on his temperament, mindset or today's mood. Therefore, the clothing of a person is a means of communication with the outside world of the identity he or she wishes to portray to the world on that day.\n\nClothes have an immense impact on the perception of people around and on the perception of the person wearing them too. A suit can make a person feel more confident and organized, which would eventually change even the gestures and the manner of talking of the person. Wearing jeans after a suit may change the conduct of a person to a very liberal and feeble one. The perception of people around can be very predictable in terns of their reaction on a person wearing this or that style of clothing.\n\nFashion is one of the most powerful means of communication, which sometimes may play a vital role in the life of a person; it especially concerns the cases of getting a desired job. The preference is always given to people who dressed in 'business style', personifying their dignity and seriousness in everything. This is one of the primary reasons that even the smallest companies make wearing a suit one of their requirements for their employees. Do you remember shaking your head in amazement that people put on suits in our tropical climate? Now you know why. The customers feel more confident in such 'consultants' too. So fashion is a very important instrument to manipulate people's perceptions of social class, culture and even gender.\n\nIt is no surprise to any of the people who at least know what fashion is that the clothes that people wear are usually very symbolic. The symbolism of clothing is another part of delivering the message that a person tries to put into it. Every observable symbol may carry a deeper meaning that it is visually understandable. Expression of symbols through clothing is a very popular tendency nowadays. For instance, a man with a tiger on his T-shirt may seem aggressive to one person, and a Green Peace member for another. A bird may be a symbol of freedom. In the present day, actual statements that directly spell out certain ideas are very popular.\n\nFashion and identity are inseparable companions. Fashion, with all its symbolism and attributes, forms an outstanding base for personal and cultural identification. Identity is a necessary process of a healthy personality. It is a part of self-realization of a person that is so much required for finding a place in the life of every person. Fashion has become a tool for achieving harmony with the inner world and a way of revealing or concealing peculiarities. Fashion possesses a specific meaning, and the more diverse is the society around us, the more fashion trend will appear and surprise us. As long as it does not hurt people around, fashion symbols are acceptable. Therefore, fashion does create identity indeed."

        "content": "Treatment of the Old by Our Society\nDear Sir,\n\nI recently visited an old folks' home and had the opportunity to see the treatment meted out to the old. The conditions there were so appalling that I could not help but wonder how children can treat their parents in such a way. It is obvious that modern society is built by the young for the young, with no consideration for the old, sick, handicapped or incapable. They are merely tolerated as a liability or nuisance. So these hardly wanted people are thrown into homes instead of faring better, they are forgotten and left to the mercies of the caretakers, limited donations from the public and financial problems.\n\nThe old, who was once young, must have helped to make the present society as it is today. They would not have paid heed to the needs of the older generation, thus they themselves are neglected and unappreciated now. But it is still not a reason for neglecting the elderly in our society. An old person does not have the physical ability of a young person. Walking itself is an effort, so crossing the road, especially with today's traffic, can be impossible without assistance. I have seen old men and women who could not cross a busy road that had no pedestrian crossing. No driver stopped for them. So these old folks had to wait patiently until a kind soul lent a hand. I have helped a number of them and most of them were very grateful while some simply cursed the traffic. What is clear here is that traffic rules are unfriendly to the old and the impaired, and people themselves have no patience or respect for them.\n\nThe busy world today is certainly not kind to old folks. Getting onto a bus is another problem they encounter. The old person is usually the last to get on, if he manages. I have seen a bus conductor refusing entry of an old man, telling him to wait for the next bus because his bus was full. If the old man does get on, the likelihood is that he will have to stand. Rarely does anyone give up his seat for an old man or woman as that is the culture our youth follows nowadays.\n\nYou see this trend in public buses and trains. While authorities are trying the best to help them by allocating seats for special people, there are many who misuse them. Many pretend not to read the signs or to see an old person standing with several bags or simply feel they have more right to sit as they had boarded earlier. Obviously, their upbringing did not include respect for the weak and disabled.\n\nFormerly, the family unit was strong and practical as most people did not go very far from their birthplace. Today, the family unit is breaking apart as young men and women travel widely in search of better jobs. So, the old are left alone and neglected. Sometimes, they are not wanted by their children. They are left to pine their lives away in their empty house or in an old folks' home where their children dump them and relinquish their responsibilities. This neglect is a very real problem in our society and it is what the old dread the most - being unwanted and uncared for in the time of need.\n\nThe indifference and lack of filial piety shown by the young is what has to be addressed. Many countries have laws to safeguard the interests of the old. While we cannot force the young to take care of their old parents, I suggest the authorities take action against those who are found to have neglected their parents, leaving them to starve, unable to take care of themselves. Even if they have no choice but to place their parents in homes, they should visit them regularly to check on their welfare and the care given by the caretakers. Failure to do so should be reported, and these uncaring children should face the law like any other criminal. The matter should be taken seriously. We must remember that soon, our parents will die and we will take their place.\n\nConcerned citizen,"

And the countryside with its advantages still appeals to me more than the city.\nFirst of all, the clean and fresh air of the country would make me feel healthier. It would be relaxing and pleasant to enjoy the pure air wafted with the soft fragrance of roses and jasmines mixed with the mango, rambutan and lemon trees in my garden! I can take a stroll around the garden every morning and night. You would say that people living in cities have many chances to widen their knowledge. They can go to evening classes to learn foreign languages, such as French, Russian, German, Korean, Japanese and Chinese. Experienced teachers and professors are ready to provide them with what they want to know. Besides that, they can go to public libraries or English-speaking clubs to broaden their knowledge and improve their English-speaking skills. But, I would say that there is no necessity to overburden our lives with these pursuits, rushing through the overcrowded streets, waiting for buses, getting caught in traffic jams to reach these centers. Nowadays, we can do this from the comfort of our homes using the Internet and other technological gadgets. The stifling and polluted atmosphere of a crowded city makes us suffocated and annoyed. It may breed neurosis and other fatal diseases, so it is definitely safer and healthier being in the countryside.\n\nSecondly, people living in the countryside feel safer than the city dwellers, who are in a state of continuously being afraid of ending in violent deaths caused by careless drivers or foolhardy motorcyclists. Furthermore, in the past few years, the crime rate in cities has escalated to such a degree that people are afraid to even walk in the streets for fear of falling victim to a snatch thief, a gun-toting gangster or robber or a rapist on the prowl. While there are cases of crime in the villages and small towns, they are not so rampant or serious. We can go for a walk safely without being accosted by unsavory individuals. And we will meet any number of friendly, helpful neighbors who are all smiles and full of warmth, unlike the unfriendly city dwellers. When there is a function, happy or sad, all the villagers are there to lend a helping hand, something that is quite unheard-of in the cities.\n\nNext, people with a poetic soul will find the countryside a source of 'divine inspiration'. For me, nothing can be compared with the moonlight streaming through the thick foliage found in the countryside or the gorgeous glow of the sunset on yellow rice fields or other forms of cultivation. The silvery moonlight in the country clearer because of the unpolluted air has a mystic power to soothe our pains and sufferings, and it does help us escape from the material world of the city with its artificial man-made beauty and dazzling neon lights. Besides, if you are an avid gardener, you can spend your free time digging, planting and watering. You will feel a serene joy watching your fruit trees grow amid the melodious twitter of birds.\n\nOf course, there are many advantages if you live in the city. There are many comfortable means of communication and entertainment in the city. You can go anywhere you like, and after a hard day's work, you can enjoy minutes of recreation by watching interesting films on a large screen in a modern and air-conditioned cinema. But with the advent of modern communication, you can watch movies and keep up to date with current events on television as well as your computer, even in the countryside. Here, you can rest from the noise and bustle of the city. Even though you have to get up early to catch buses to get to work in towns, you can sleep better at night without being disturbed by deafening sirens of cars or machines running noisily all the time.\n\nFinally, our country is open to all foreign investments and the city is the cradle of industrial development. Therefore, upon graduating from university, city dwellers have innumerable opportunities to get lucrative jobs and upgrade their lives. Youths would prefer this as they want to carve a bright future for themselves and their families. But this is at the cost of their safety, health and peace of mind. Children too, are being exposed to all the wrong values practiced by the very modern materialistic city dwellers. Is this what we want for our children, the future leaders of our nation? Therefore, I prefer living in the countryside than in the city."

        "title": "You are studying in a residential school. During assembly, you, as the Head Prefect, were asked to give a talk to students who have just joined residential school on how to manage stress to ease their life there.",
        "content": "Good morning, principal, teachers and friends. First of all, I would like to welcome all the new students who have joined residential school and hope you are enjoying your new life here. As it may be the first time you are away from home, I am sure you are feeling the stress of this new life, especially managing things all by yourself. Therefore I am taking this opportunity to give you a few tips on how to keep your stress in check and how to relax when things get to be too much. At any given point in time, most students are stressed about something. But don't worry - it is just part of going to residential school where you have to be independent and cope with things on your own.\nWhile having stress in your life is normal and often unavoidable, being stressed is something you can control. There are several things you can do to overcome this. First of all, make sure you get enough sleep. Your sleep schedule is, most likely far from ideal now, so getting more sleep can help your mind refocus, recharge and re-balance. This can mean a quick nap before study hours, a night when you go to bed early, or a promise to yourself to stick with a regular sleep schedule. Sometimes, one good night's sleep can be all you need to feel charged and energetic once again.\n\nAt the same time, you should eat healthy foods. Just like your sleep habits, your eating habits too, may have changed when you came here, especially as you have to follow a new schedule and a new diet. Think back on what and when you had eaten over the past few days. You may think your stress is psychological, but it could just be physical stress if you are not fuelling your body appropriately. So, on outing days, get something balanced and healthy: fruit and vegetables, whole grains and protein. Starting your day with breakfast is necessary - don't ever go to class on an empty stomach. That spells trouble and illness! Studies were conducted in which students were asked to perform tasks after either having eaten or not eaten breakfast. Much evidence pointed out to improvements in learning and memory, and general well-being.\n\nNext, get some exercise. You may think that if you don't have the time to sleep and eat properly, you definitely don't have the time to exercise. However, don't worry about this. You have extra-curricular activities and games where you can let off your steam and lessen stress. If needs be, you can go for a relaxing 30-minute walk while listening to your favorite music and even take a power nap during rest time. I assure you, you will definitely feel much better. And during weekends, you can play games with your friends.\n\nAnother thing is to cultivate friends - socialize and have some fun. If you have been working on some projects or coursework for 3 straight days, then you could be extremely stressed because you are focusing too much on getting things done. Don't forget that your brain is like a muscle, and even that needs a break every once in a while! So have fun with your friends -play games with them, crack jokes or watch a movie on television with them. You will be building the social side of your character that will help you when you leave school.\n\nFellow students, learn to relax yourselves. The body's natural antidote to stress is called the relaxation response. It's your body's opposite of stress and it creates a sense of well-being and calm. Ensure you stay relaxed by incorporating time into your schedule for activities that are calming and pleasurable: reading a good book or making time for a hobby.\n\nOf course, don't be afraid of getting a little help if you need it. It can be hard to ask for help, and your friends may not know how stressed out you are. Nevertheless, most students are going through the same things at the same time, so don't feel shy to vent your frustrations for 30 minutes over coffee with a friend. It will help you refocus and make you realize that the things you are so stressed about are actually quite manageable. Alternatively, you can see the counselor who will be only too glad to listen to your woes. Keep the lines of communication open, especially to somebody you can trust.\n\nTry to solve your everyday problems can give you a sense of control. Develop skills to calmly look at a problem, figure out options and take some actions towards a solution. Feeling capable of solving little problems builds the inner confidence to move on to life's bigger ones and it can also serve you well in times of stress.\n\nAnother important thing is watch what you are thinking. Your outlook, attitude and thoughts influence the way you see things. A healthy dose of optimism can help you make the best of stressful circumstances. Try to be positive and learn acceptance. Accept that there are things in life that are beyond your control. It is pointless to dwell on the negative experiences and poor results but more fruitful to plant positive thoughts as new seeds of the mind. If you were unhappy yesterday, unhappy today, there is a certain unhappiness awaits you tomorrow. All in all you will only cause much stress to yourself.\n\nIt is amazing what laughter can do for us. Laughter has a two-step action on the physical body: step one, it stimulates; step two, it relaxes. During laughter, the body is stimulated and exercised; after laughter, the body relaxes and calms itself. Your laughter may help you feel better and put that spring back in your step.\n\nFinally, residential school can be overwhelming. But you must get your perspective right. You should always remember the reason why you are here: academics. No matter how exciting your co-curricular life is, you cannot enjoy any of it if you don't pass your examinations. So, make sure to keep your eye on the prize, and then head out and change the world ! Thank you."

        "title": "Describe a recent family celebration you had",
        "content": "Dad's birthday this year's was special. He had just retired a few months ago and was beginning to show his boredom at home. He was beginning to feel unappreciated and was snapping at everyone. We could not turn up the volume of the television or music. We could not yell or scream at each other as we usually did when we got back home. We could not even laugh loudly at jokes. He would get irritated and would march up to his room in a huff.\nAt first, we shrugged and laughed at his 'childish' behavior. Then, Mum explained that it was the 'after-retirement syndrome'. After working for so many years, he was at a loss, not knowing what to do. So, we put our heads together and came up with a marvelous idea. We would celebrate his birthday in a different way. No more bearing little gifts, wishing Happy Birthday and going back to watching TV or sleeping (which is my favorite pastime on Sundays). We would take Dad and Mum out for a treat and make him feel appreciated!\n\nWe checked out all the hotels, restaurants and activities organized in town and out of town, and finally decided on a trip to Genting Highlands. My elder brother and sister, the only working members in our family, agreed to sponsor the trip, and we booked into a hotel for a night. Not wanting to spoil the surprise, we did not tell Dad about our plans, or the reason for going there. We had to listen to him grumble about wasting money all the way to the hotel that Saturday afternoon. We pretended not to hear him and kept our spirits high in spite of his grouching. Finally, realizing nobody was listening to him, he lapsed into silence.\n\nWhen we reached the hotel, we checked in and whisked him up to his room immediately before he decided to take up where he had stopped - on the present state of economy, inflation and the importance of saving money for the future. Poor Dad, he simply did not know what was lying in store for him.\n\nThat night, we took him for a show. A famous magician was on the itinerary that evening, and we clapped and cheered loudly when he conjured up a motorbike on the stage, among others. We stole a look at Dad surreptitiously, and saw that he was smiling and enjoying himself too. Still, we did not enlighten him. That was to come the next morning. But one good thing had come out of the entertainment. When we went up to our rooms that night, he was his usual cheerful self. He forgot to grumble for once!\n\nThe next morning, we knocked on Dad's door at sharp eight o'clock. Mum let us in quietly. Dad was still snoring away blissfully, so we organized everything before waking him up. Breakfast was brought up by room service, the cake was lit and all our presents arranged strategically so that he would see them when he opened his eyes. Then, we began singing Happy Birthday. He awoke with a start, confused and befuddled with sleep. When he finally realized what was happening, his eyes misted and he was lost for words.\n\n\"You brought me here for this? Thank you, my children,\" he said at last, reaching for the knife and cutting the cake. He then made it a point to feed each one of us a piece of cake before opening the presents. We had a fabulous breakfast in the room amidst laughter and jokes.\n\nAfter breakfast, we decided to do the theme parks. We gave him a choice of Ripley's Believe It Or Not! Museum, the Climbing Wall, Snow World and the fierce wind turbine tunnel for a simulated skydiving adventure. He chose to go to the Snow World, saying that his heart would not be able to take the others. We joined him, stepping into a winter wonderland and taking in the sights of a snow-white landscape of Snow World, including the Cresta Run snow slide. After this, we went outdoors, where I went for some fun rides, while the older generation watched or ambled around. It was there that Dad met Mr Lim, his former boss. They spoke for a long time before they went their separate ways. We then went for lunch before checking out.\n\nDad declared that it was the best birthday he had celebrated because the next day, Mr Lim called him and offered him a contract job at another branch of the company. He accepted it with joy, happy that he was going to be useful once again."

        "title": "Most accidents are caused by rash driving. What is your opinion ?",
        "content": "Since the year 2003, the number of fatalities due to road accidents in Malaysia has consistently been above 6,000. Between 2004 and 2013, the death of 65,850 people in road accidents had resulted in as much as RM78 billion being lost in economic contributions with an average of RM1.2 million each. This trend is not only obvious in our nation but in other countries too. A WHO report claims that road accidents take the lives of nearly 1.3 million every year and injure 20 to 50 million more in the world, with India, along with China, listed among countries with the highest number of deaths. Even in the United States, road accidents are on the rise - someone is killed in a road accident every 10 seconds! What is tragic is that most of these accidents could have been easily avoided.\nOver 95% of road accidents involve some degree of driver behavior combined with other factors. Drivers always try to blame road conditions, equipment failure, poor road maintenance or other drivers for those accidents. When the facts are truthfully presented, however, the behavior of the driver is usually the primary cause. Most are caused by excessive speed or aggressive driver behavior. Therefore, while I agree that rash driving is the cause of most accidents, other factors should also be considered.\n\nWith more people in today's fast-developing world owning personal vehicles, the number of people driving recklessly, without heeding road conditions and pedestrians on the road, has increased. People, especially younger drivers, tend to speed with alarming frequency on highways and through residential areas, school zones and urban streets. What they do not realize is that the faster you drive, the harder it is to stop, making the potential for disaster greater. Combined with speed is recklessness. Some people blatantly disregard the traffic regulations that make our roads safer. They sneer at the rules of the road and exhibit a sense of power when driving. Many of them also show aggressive driving tactics, such as changing lanes without signaling.\n\nOn top of these two behaviors, driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs is also on the rise. Youth aged 17 to 29 are the most common culprits and victims of such accidents. A drunken driver cannot perform his task without risk and would endanger traffic safety as alcohol affects the central nervous system of the driver. Even at a level of 0.05 per cent alcohol in blood, the sense of judgment is impaired and the ability to control steering is affected. Similarly, drugs like marijuana can affect a driver's perception and his ability to drive. The driver drives rashly, usually ending in disaster.\n\nNevertheless, accidents on the road can also be due to road conditions and poor road maintenance. Highway maintenance is very important. When many roads exhibit unsafe conditions like potholes, uneven pavement and various other types of defects, serious road accidents can take place. The best to do is to be wary and keep a lookout for such defects.\n\nDrivers who pay little attention to the condition of their vehicles too, can be blamed for causing accidents. Brake failure, poor tyre condition and blown light bulbs, especially when traveling at night, can also result in vehicles going out of control.\n\nAnother cause of accidents that is of increasing concern now is the use of mobile phones. Even a hands-free mobile phone or the use of Bluetooth technology does not guarantee that an accident would not occur when chatting on a mobile phone and driving. These drivers are four times more likely to cause an accident. Besides this, children, animals and construction sites often distract individuals as much as any mobile phone use. We are only human and it can be near impossible to keep our attention on the road when a child in the car is pulling his sister's hair. If the issue requires discipline, it is best to stop at a rest area.\n\nDespite numerous safety measures and tighter laws, accidents continue rising. What is sad is that the brunt of rash driving and drunk driving is faced by pedestrians, cyclists or people traveling in lighter vehicles. The road crashes, which cause grief and suffering for the family members of the deceased and the injured, also result in economic losses to victims, their families and nations as a whole. The only way to reduce this is through education. As most accidents are caused by rash driving, drivers, especially youth, should be made aware of their responsibility when on the road. Thus, we should always be aware of other motorists and pedestrians around us when driving."

        "title": "How can we help to reduce food waste ?",
        "content": "At a time when the world is apprehensive about food security and the looming dark days when humanity will run out of food, millions of tons of food are wasted because of our poor habits of consumerism. In industrialized nations especially, retailers and consumers discard around 300 million tons that is fit for consumption. Ironically, one in every seven people in the world go to bed hungry and more than 20,000 children under the age of 5 die daily from hunger.\nWhen food is wasted, two other vital commodities are also wasted - the energy used to produce food and water necessary for producing and cooking food. Indeed, Malaysians waste up to 8,000 tons or 8 million kilograms of food a day - and this amount can easily feed 6 million people.\n\nEnvironmentally, food waste also means that chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, and fuel used for transportation of these foods are also wasted. It also leads to more rotting food, which creates more methane, one of the most harmful greenhouse gases contributing to climate change. Methane is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. Thus, the vast amount of food going to landfills makes a significant contribution to global warming.\n\nThe best way to help reduce waste is to adopt and practice the theme 'Think. Eat. Save', as a way of saving the environment. If we observe what is happening around us in school, we will see many students eating only half of the food they have ordered and throwing away the rest. At home, we only eat what we like and discard the rest of the food that has been served on our plates because we dislike it. Some of us heap food on our plates without any intention of finishing it. In restaurants, for example, many families order unnecessary amounts of food and waste a lot of it.\n\nIn fact, Malaysians have for too long lived in affluence and have a compulsive affinity for food. It is said that if Malaysians are not doing anything else, they are eating. It is a fact that while the British may be obsessed with the day's weather, the first thing two Malaysians ask each other when they meet is \"sudah makan?\" or \"have you eaten?\" Malaysia could possibly be the only country in the world where food is available in street corners throughout the night, while the rest of the world is sleeping. Given this kind of lifestyle and the resultant devastating effects on the environment, the theme 'Think. Eat. Save' will encourage us to become more aware of the environmental impact of the food choices and informed decisions we make.\n\nTo put this theme into practice, we should start from the home and then witness the power of collective decisions we have made to reduce food waste, save money, minimize the environmental impact of food production and force food production processes to become more efficient. If food is wasted, it means that all the resources and inputs used in the production of all the foods are also lost. For example, it takes about 1 000 liters of water to produce 1 liter of milk and about 16,000 liters goes into a cow's food to produce a hamburger. The resulting greenhouse gas emissions from the cows themselves, and throughout the food supply chain, all end up in vain when we waste food.\n\nTherefore, we should eat only what we are able to eat. Do not heap your plate with food you know you will not be able to finish eating. In restaurants, make sure you or your friends or parents do not over order food, or even for that matter, order dishes that many do not like. It is more prudent to order less food than too much - if insufficient, you can ask for more.\n\nParents too, need to change their attitude towards food consumption and educate the young about the downside of food wastage. Even in the school system, some effective kind of awareness on food wastage must be impressed upon the younger generation as they may not be aware of another world where food is scarce or the looming food security issue which is threatening the world.\n\nAs for making informed decisions, it simply means that we purposefully select foods that have less environmental impact. One example is buying organic foods that do not use chemicals in the production process. No doubt organic food is more expensive, but if more people buy organic produce, their production will be increased and subsequently, production costs will fall. Foods that are produced using fertilizers and pesticides only harm the environment and our health.\n\nAt the same time, we should also support our local market. Choosing to buy locally produced vegetables, fruit and farm products can also mean that foods are not flown halfway across the world. It not only saves our money but also limits carbon emissions from planes.\n\nMany countries are taking the problem of food wastage seriously and trying to curtail it by imposing fines on people who wantonly waste food. Restaurants in some countries fine diners who leave behind large amounts of food on their plates. Food wasted for these restaurants means more rubbish, which will only add on to the millions of tons of household and commercial trash thrown out daily, leaving a greater impact on the environment. By imposing fines, people will be more conscious of wasting food.\n\nLastly, we should all join hands to create a safe and green world. So think before you eat and help save our environment."

        "content": "I felt the heat of the morning sun on my still-closed eyelids. Annoyed, I rolled to the other side to get out of the way of the strong rays. I yawned and stretched, wondering why it was so bright. It is normally quite dark when I get up for school. I forced open my eyes to look at the little, round alarm clock on my bedside table ... and screeched in alarm!\nBounding out of my bed, I swung open the wardrobe door to take out my school uniform, which I threw on the bed. Then, I dashed to the bathroom. But halfway, I stopped, deciding not to brush my teeth. I grabbed my school bag and ran downstairs. Soon, I had shoved my feet into my shoes and pounced onto my bicycle. My parents stood motionless, staring at me as I whizzed past. As I had had no time to comb my hair, I ran my fingers through it, making it look as tidy as possible.\n\nAs my bicycle raced down the road to school, I noticed a group of schoolgirls looking at me with great interest. Oh boy! I must still be looking attractive even with uncombed hair. My heart pounding furiously in my chest, I shot past a few cars on the road. In all the confusion and haste, I managed to notice the drivers staring in disbelief at me. They were probably incredulous that one could pedal so swiftly. Soon, I reached the school gate, which the security guard was about to close.\n\nWithout bothering to explain myself to the two priggish prefects on gate duty, I hopped off my bike. Locking my precious iron steed at the bicycle parking lot, I sprinted to the school hall. As I burst into the hall, I slowed down to turn left to go to the back of my class, where I took my place behind my classmates. I released my breath - the assembly had not started yet. But just as I was congratulating myself, I realized that I was the centre of attraction. It did not matter much to me at the moment for I was used to being looked at. However, to say the least, I was a little surprised when everyone stopped staring blankly at me and started to giggle. Suddenly, the whole hall was reverberating with loud laughter. Everyone was laughing, pointing or looking at me. Some teachers were smiling while others were trying to control the situation. Smiling at my audience, I took a bow, though at the back of my mind, I was wondering what was so amusing.\n\nAs I took my bow, I noticed -that the bottom half of my trousers were not olive-green but had blue and white stripes. My line of vision moved upwards, revealing that the rest of my trousers were also the wrong color - and so was my shirt. In profound shock, it took me some time to figure it out. \"Sammy! Why on earth are you in pyjamas?\" my friend, who was standing beside me, blurted out amidst the bellows of laughter. Tears were streaming down his cheeks, not from sadness, but from hilarity, I realized in chagrin.\n\nA feeling of sheer horror swept through my entire body. My mouth opened in a silent `0' for a few long seconds. I stood there in shock and embarrassment. No wonder Dad and Mum had looked nonplussed as I was streaking past them. No wonder everyone in the hall was laughing. I had stupidly thought that it was my riding skills that had fascinated people on the street and my handsome face that had made the girls stare at me. I felt darkness slowly starting to engulf me.\n\nI awoke with lights playing on my eyelids. A group of people, including some boys in the Red Crescent uniform, were peering down at me, grinning quite lunatically at me. My teacher was also there. He patted me on my back, saying with a wicked wink, \"You must have been in a real hurry, eh? Never mind, your parents will be here soon with your school uniform.\"\n\nI must have looked like a beetroot. But one thing was clear - it was the most embarrassing moment in my life."

        "content": "Reuben -- The Leader\nLast month, a group of us from 5 Cemerlang attended a leadership camp in Kuantan. The camp was organized by our school. At the camp, we were divided into a few groups, and each group had its own group leader. Unknown to us until the end of the camp, an award for the Best Group Leader would be given. When the winner of the award was announced, none of the members of my group were surprised. We knew the winner would surely be Reuben, our group leader.\n\nWe were so sure that Reuben would win the award because he is born a leader. Reuben's full name is Reuben Raj and he is the eldest of five children. He turns 17 this year. During his primary school years, he studied in SMK Sungai Teguh. He comes from a humble background where his mother sells nasi lemak for a living. His father has passed on when he was still a baby.\n\nAs a child, Reuben grew up helping his mother care for his other four siblings while his mother works hard to earn a living for five of them. Through his difficult childhood, Reuben acquired a great sense of responsibility that has shaped him to be who he is today. He is well known among his friends to be a man of caliber and very responsible in all the tasks he is given. Through the years, the care that he has shown to his siblings also overflows to others. People often mention his name with a smile on their faces, remembering his genuine care and concern for the people around him. He always remembers to greet people and makes sure no one feels left out around him. During the camp, I remembered how Reuben cared for those who were sick although he was busy with his own tasks. His people skills proved handy during this time.\n\nMore than his outstanding character, he also possesses great debating skills. He is a natural and charismatic orator, so it was no surprise that he received the Best Speaker award during the camp debate competition. Besides that, he was also voted as the most cooperative camper at the camp. Every teacher and student just loved him as he would never say no to people who need a helping hand.\n\nMost of all, Reuben is an exceptional leader that inspires others. This was perhaps the main reason he was given the award. The best kind of leader is a humble one. He leads by example. During the camp, whenever we go through an activity together, he often does it first and makes sure he tests the activity before we do it ourselves. If there is any trouble to go through, he goes through it first. Even during the obstacle course, he had a slight injury on his leg because he was the first to go and the obstacle course was faulty. He affirmed that he would not have wanted it any other way. He proved that he is a sacrificial leader. By this example alone, I believe that Reuben truly deserves the honor of being the Best Group Leader.\n\nThe award entitles Reuben a Certificate of Achievement and a cash prize of RM500. Reuben, we are so happy with your achievement and hope that you continue to inspire others in every way that you can."

After an hour, we decided to go for a drink at Pak Kia's stall. On seeing us, Pak Kia greeted us warmly.\nAfter our drink, we started to walk home. We had to cross a busy road near Pak Kia's stall. I asked Luke, \"My father is coming to fetch me. How about you?'\n\nLuke replied, \"I'll take the bus home.\"\n\nWe were standing at the roadside and were about to cross the busy road when we saw a girl come running down the road. As she did not see me standing there, she knocked into me. She said, \"I'm so sorry.\"\n\nI looked curiously at the girl. Oh dear! She was crying. I wondered why she was crying.\n\nThe girl said quickly, \"It's my father. He is at home. He had a heart attack!\"\n\nAnd she continued, \"I'm looking for a taxi. The taxis will not stop.\"\n\nI knew that it was difficult to get a taxi on this busy road. However, I also knew the girl's father had to go to hospital. The girl looked very worried. Her father might die at home.\n\nWithout hesitation, I offered to help. \"I am waiting for my father. I will phone him to come now.\"\n\nThe girl replied, \"You will? Oh, thank you so much!\"\n\nSo I quickly phoned my father to ask him to come at once. In a very urgent tone, I told him about the man's heart attack. \"Please come now, Dad. Someone may die of a heart attack!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Luke and I ran to the girl's house. the old man was lying on the floor looking very pale. The girl ran to her father. I helped her to get the old man up to his feet. It was not an easy task as the old man was a big man. Moreover, he was very weak. He could not stand up at all. Fortunately, Luke and I were strong boys. We managed to drag the old man all the way to the grout gate.\n\nBy then, my father was outside waiting for us. He got out of the car and rushed over to help us. We reached the hospital in ten minutes. The hospital attendants were waiting with a stretcher. They carried the old man inside the hospital and put him in Ward 5.\n\nThe doctor checked him and told the girl who was looking very concerned, \"Luckily, you all brought him to the hospital on time. And now, we have to perform surgery on him. He should survive the surgery.\"\n\nThe girl turned to Luke, my father and me. She extended her hand and thanked us for helping her.\n\nShe then introduced herself to us. She said, \"I am Janet. I don't know how to thank you all for saving my father's life.\" Her voice started to break with emotion. Tears were flowing down her cheeks.\n\nMy father replied, \"The fact that your father is going to be all right is enough thanks for us.\" Luke and I agreed. We shared this mutual feeling that saving someone in need and seeing that person coming out of it well was the best reward we could ever have."

        "content": "Kumar was walking home from school. Nothing pleased him more than to walk along the busy street and look at the glass doors of the shops. When doing so, he never failed to stop to look at the latest laptops in the computer shop.\nHe was thinking, \"I would love so much to own that laptop. But nobody will buy it for me.\"\n\nSo Kumar thought hard of what to do. The school holiday was coming up next week. An idea struck him. He would do odd jobs to earn some money. Yes! That was what he would do.\n\nHe designed a plan of working in his neighbors' gardens. First, he would approach them and ask them to let him clean up their gardens. Each owner would probably pay him RM50 or RM60. Working in more than ten gardens would enable him to accumulate enough cash to buy his beloved laptop.\n\nThe next day, he went around his neighborhood and asked the residents if he could clean their gardens. He asked them politely, \"Excuse me. Can I work in your garden during the school holiday?\"\n\nMany of the owners replied `Yes.' They liked the courteous boy.\n\nSo Kumar started work in his first house. He woke up early that morning. He took three hours to clear the rubbish and cut the grass. It was not easy work. He had to mow the grass. After that, he had to pull the weeds. Then, he had to arrange the flowerpots. This arduous work went on for a week. Consequently, he had no time for games or even watch television.\n\nBakri told him, \"Heh, forget about your laptop. Come and join our football game.\"\n\nHis mother feeling concerned for her son's well-being told her husband, \"Just give him the money for the laptop.\"\n\nHis father said, \"No. It is better for him if he works hard for it. He would appreciate his laptop more.\"\n\nAfter two weeks, he managed to save RM700. All this money was kept safely inside a drawer. He was thinking, \"Not too bad.\" After this, he needed another RM300. That would mean another week of clearing gardens.\n\nAt the end of November, he had saved up enough money. He now had RM1,000. Early in the morning, he went to the computer shop. The owner of the shop smiled upon seeing Kumar. As usual, he asked, \"Come to look at the laptop again?\"\n\nThis time, Kumar said, \"Oh no, not just take a look. This time I came to buy it.\" Then he walked inside the shop knowing that he deserved his reward."

That person was a young lady in her twenties. After eating, she went to the restroom. Without realizing, she had left her handphone on the table. Five minutes later, she came out and walked out of the cafe without looking back.\nMary saw the handphone on the table. She quickly told Keith, \"Keith, the girl left behind her handphone.\"\n\nKeith looked at the handphone. It took his breadth away. It was one of the latest models on the market. Looking very sleek, it was red in colour with a black cover. The handphone must have cost about RM2000.\n\nKeith had always wanted a handphone. But his parents had told him, \"You don't need one. You can always use the house phone.\"\n\nHe stared at it for some minutes. Then he said slowly, pausing on very word, \"I want to take the handphone.\"\n\nMary could not believe her ears. She merely stared at her brother. \"You can't! What if the owner comes to look for it?\"\n\nHaving made the decision, Keith quickly grabbed the handphone and put it in his schoolbag. Then, he took Mary's hand and led her out of the cafe quickly. Outside the cafe, he ran to his bicycle. Mary had to run after him.\n\nOnce back home, Keith locked his house door with trembling hands. Inside his room, he took out the piece of beauty. Oh, he liked it so much. Now he had his own handphone. Soon, he was polishing it happily.\n\nBut Mary told him, \"Keith, you cannot keep the handphone. What will you tell father about this? He will ask you how you got the handphone.\"\n\nKeith said quickly, \"I will say a friend lent it to me.\"\n\nMary said, \"Now you are lying too.\" Oh dear! When had Keith turned so dishonest?\n\nThen Mary saw a house phone number on the plastic cover of the handphone. \"This phone number is the girl's phone number. Why don't we just call this number? We will talk to her and ask her to come and take back her handphone.\" She was trying her utmost to talk some sense into him.\n\nThat night, Keith was tossing and turning in bed. He had difficulty sleeping. Of course, he liked the new handphone. However, he was feeling sorry for the owner. The lady looked young. She would be very sad at the loss of her handphone.\n\nIn the morning, he decided to return the handphone to the owner. After school, he old Mary, \"I am going to phone the owner.\"\n\nMary was elated to hear that. Back home, they phoned the owners' house phone. A girl answered the phone.\n\nKevin asked, \"Are you the owner of the handphone ? I m Keith. I have your handphone. Can you come and get it ?\"\n\nThe girl replied excitedly, \"Yes, yes ! I am the owner. Thank you ! Thank you ! I will come now.\" Ten minutes later, she was at the same cafe to meet Keith. Handing back the handphone to her and seeing her smile happily, Keith realized that honesty was indeed the best policy."

Last weekend they went to Pulau Pangkor.\nAfter checking into the chalet, Meena said eagerly, \"Let's go swimming.\"\n\nShe and her brother put on their swimsuits. They walked to the shoreline. They could see that the tide was quite high. Happily, they walked out into the water and swam. Their parents shouted at them to be careful and not to swim too far out.\n\nAfter a good swim, the whole family had a picnic under the coconut tree. `Their mother had made many types of sandwiches. There were chicken, egg, tuna and sardine sandwiches. The sandwiches were spread out on a mat on the sand. Next to the sandwiches were bottles of mineral water. Their mother had also brought a flask of hot tea. She knew their father liked a cup of hot tea after eating sandwiches. The whole family enjoyed the sandwich meal. Somehow, they were thinking that those were the best sandwiches they had ever tasted.\n\nAfter eating, Gopal's mother cleared the cups and bottles on the mat. Suddenly, they heard someone shout, \"Help! Help! Someone is drowning!\" Gopal looked far out into the sea and saw a child struggling in the water. The strong wave was sweeping the child away. The child was drifting in the water. It was obvious that she could not swim. And there were no lifeguards around.\n\nGopal could hear more shouts. A girl was saying between sobs, \"My little sister is going to drown. Please someone save her!\"\n\nThe girls standing around her also started crying. They were helpless for they could not do anything to save the little girl. Gopal knew he must act fast. He ran to the sea. He swam as fast as he could to the child. In a few minutes, he reached the little girl. With his strong arms, he grabbed the child and pulled her to him.\n\nMeena and her parents were standing on the shore. They were worried for Gopal. No doubt he was a good swimmer but the waves were very strong. But they felt relief when they saw him swimming back to the shore with the child holding onto him.\n\nThere was a big crowd of people by then. They saw Gopal carrying the little girl towards a deckchair. She was still alive! The girl's sister ran to her. She thanked Gopal for saving her little sister's life.\n\nShe kept on saying, \"Thank you, thank you! You are so brave.\" The crowd of people heard this. They too admired Gopal's bravery and quick action. Soon all of them were clapping and cheering him on. They even sang 'For he is a jolly brave fellow, for he is a jolly brave fellow.'"

Her classmates found her snobbish and arrogant. They did not want to be friends with her. Helen had no friends at school.\nOne afternoon, Helen was waiting for her driver after school. She was standing outside the school gate alone. The other girls were playing and laughing while waiting for their parents to fetch them. But none of them spoke to her.\n\nShe was pretending not to mind their ignoring her. \"So what if they do not talk to me. I don't need them to talk to me.\" However, she did mind being left out. A strong feeling of loneliness overwhelmed her. This made her feel very unhappy.\n\nWhile standing there, a thief came up from behind her. Helen was unaware of this. Very quickly, the thief snatched her gold chain which she wore under her white blouse. She felt a sharp pain and cried out loudly. But nobody went to help her. In fact, nobody was even looking at her.\n\nHer neck was red and hurt. It was bleeding. She was so frightened and started crying. But still nobody looked at her. She tried to approach a prefect to tell him what had happened. However, when the prefect saw her coming, he walked away. All the prefects knew her as being arrogant and rude. Even the school guard would not talk to her.\n\nAs her driver was late, she ran to the toilet and cried inside. She sobbed her heart out. Oh, why was she so lonely? Others were always with friends joking and laughing. Someone heard her crying in the toilet. Her class teacher, Miss Lim was passing by. She was surprised to hear a girl crying inside the toilet. She pushed open the door and saw Helen standing at the sink with red eyes.\n\nMiss Lim was shocked. \"Helen, what are you doing here? Why are you crying?\"\n\nHelen told her sadly, \"I must be the most unhappy girl in school. Nobody likes me.\"\n\nThen, she told Miss Lim how a thief had snatched her necklace.\n\nStill sobbing, she said, \"Nobody was looking at me. None of the girls wants to talk or play with me.\" There and then, Miss Lim told her, \"You want the girls to like you. Very simple! You must not be arrogant. Talk to your classmates. Be nice to them. Show them you want to be their friend.\" Helen listened to every word Miss Lim said.\n\nThe next day, she went to class smiling at her classmates. They could not believe their eyes. Proud Helen smiling at them! She even called out the names of some of her classmates and addressed them politely. That day, she offered to collect books and clean the blackboard. She then offered to bring the exercise books to the teachers' room.\n\nSoon, everyone said she had changed. Her classmates knew she wanted to be their friend. So, they included her in the things they did. In the school canteen, she shared her food with her classmates. They did homework together in the library. She was no longer the proud lonely girl in school."

Laila sat on the doorsteps and waited till midnight. Her mother did not come home. Her father, Mr Siva, came back late. He pretended that nothing had happened.\nSoon a year passed. There was not a single day Laila hoped her mother would come back. Every night, she went to bed hoping the next day, her mother would be there to wake her up for school. Every day, after school she hoped to see her mother in the kitchen when she came home. Her school grades were dropping badly. Her teachers complained about her homework and tests marks. They often caught her daydreaming in class.\n\nHer classmates and friends were finding her difficult. They thought she was strange. There was one day, her friend, Jill, saw her in the toilet talking to herself. She was talking to her reflection in the mirror! Jill felt frightened and ran out. After this, everyone avoided her like the plague.\n\nIt was then she decided to run away from home. She did wonder, \"To where?\" She did not have the answer. But she had come to a point where she did not care anymore. All she knew was that she just had to leave home.\n\nThat morning, she got up early. Somehow, her decision to leave home had made her stronger. She quickly packed her bags. For the first few days, she had nowhere to go. She had little money. So she had to be careful about what she spent on. At night, she slept on the staircase of a block of apartments. She would walk along the streets the whole day till she was exhausted. And she went back to the staircase late at night. This was after the residents were asleep.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Siva was very worried about his daughter. He checked with her teachers, classmates, friends and relatives. Nobody knew where she was.\n\nThey advised him, \"Go and make a police report. The police will look for her.\"\n\nOn the sixth day of her running away, Mr Siva heard a heavy knock on his door. He opened the door and saw his neighbour, Ah Seng. He was saying, \"Someone saw your daughter.\"\n\nMr Siva's hands were trembling. Ah Seng was holding a newspaper. He turned to the second page of the newspaper. \"Look! This is your daughter's picture.\"\n\nMr Siva looked at the picture. Oh yes, it was her picture all right. The picture was with an article. The headlines read: `Missing girl had an accident'. It continued to say that she saved a little boy who was running across the road.\n\nWithout changing his clothes, he rushed all the way to the hospital where his daughter was. He saw her lying on the bed. Daughter and father held each other and cried in happiness. They were so glad they had found each other again. Mr Siva vowed to his daughter that he would be a good father to her."

Oh no! I gasped in dismay. It was a quarter to eight. I was going to be late for school.\nAs I did not have time for breakfast, I could hear my stomach groaning. All I could do was just grab a cup of coffee. Unfortunately, my hand moved too fast. It knocked down the cup and the coffee flowed all over the floor.\n\nI did not have time to wipe up the mess. So I ran out of the house with my mother shouting at me. Boy, she sounded really angry. As I was late, I decided to take a short cut. This meant I had to walk through a muddy lane.\n\nAs I was rushing, I did not see the wooden plank in the mud. Before I knew it, I tripped and landed in the mud. You can imagine my school uniform and hair covered with mud. Groaning and cursing, I washed myself at a nearby tap. Then, I hurried to school. As I was so late, a prefect at the gate wrote down my name. That was really bad luck! When I entered the classroom, the science lesson had started. Miss Ong was writing on the blackboard. She looked at my dirty uniform and face.\n\nShe asked loudly, \"What happened to you? Why are you so late for class?\" before I could say anything, she shouted at me in front of the class. \"You get out and tidy up!\"\n\nWhen I got back to class later, everyone was looking at me. I wish there was a big hole where I could crawl into. Soon, the bell rang for recess. As I was so hungry, I quickly ran to the canteen. Not seeing a girl walking in my direction, I accidentally knocked into her. Her drink flowed all over her uniform.\n\nShe shouted, \"Watch out where you are going! What's the matter with you?\" As I was so hungry, I did not even bother to apologise. The bell rang again for us to go back to class. As I was late again, I had to run all the way to the classroom. Ibis time, I missed the bottom step on the staircase. So, I fell flat on the cement floor. Wow! It hurt my knee. The other pupils standing there watched me make a fool of myself. I felt like crying. My class teacher, who was walking past, asked impatiently, \"What happened to you? Why are you so clumsy?\"\n\nAfter school, I just wanted to get home without any more hitches. However, when I reached my house gate, it was locked. I put my hand inside my pocket and realised that I had forgotten to bring the house keys! I had to wait till my mother got back from work. That would be six o'clock.\n\nPoor me ! I was tired, hot, thirsty and hungry. It was only three o'clock. The sun was hot. To make matters worse, the owner of the house two doors away did not close his front gate. His dog came running out. Seeing me standing there, it charged at me ! I had to take to my heels and run for my life.\n\nThat night, I told my mother everything that happened. \"Today was really my unlucky day.\""

It was inside her pencil box. She pretended to open the box to take a pencil. Then, she tried to peep at the answers.\n\nIt was at that moment our teacher, Puan Salmah, happened to look in her direction. She saw Mei copying answers from the paper. Oh dear! Mei was so engrossed on writing that she did not know our teacher was looking at her. I happened to look up from my test paper and saw Puan Salmah looking at Mei. There was nothing I could do to alert her except wait to see what happened. By then, the class had seen Puan Salmah looking very angry and walking towards Mei.\n\n\"Mei! You are cheating! Shame on you!\" she shouted. Mei quickly threw the paper on the floor but it was too late. Puan Salmah picked it up. The paper had all the answers for the test. This time very softly she told Mei, \"I am giving you a zero for the test. Never cheat during a test again.\"\n\nMei was so ashamed and embarrassed. All her classmates were looking at her. She felt like crying. Puan Salmah asked her to take her bag and wait outside. The principal, Mr Chong, called her to the office.\n\nThere, he told her, \"What you have done is serious. We have phoned your father. He will be coming soon.\"\n\nMei's father came ten minutes later. He looked furious. But Mr Chong explained to him. \"It is more important to guide our children rather than force them to get good grades. Show them love and care instead of pressuring.\" As for Mei, she could not stop sobbing in the office. She also made a promise not to cheat during tests again.\n\nAfter that incident, Mci took her studies seriously. She did constant revision before any test. I must say that she does quite well in class tests. She is getting 55% or 60% for her tests. There is no need for her to cheat during tests again."

During the journey, by boat or over-land, the bridegroom's party beats the gong and drum. The purpose is to avoid hearing the cry of bad omens. When they reach the vicinity of the village, the party will take a rest. This is the time for them to dress themselves in traditional costumes.\n\nAfter changing their clothes, they continue their journey to the village. As soon as the people in the bride's longhouse see their guests coming, they fire guns to welcome the guests. The groom's party then return the gun salutes with equal number of gunshots and proceeds to the longhouse.\n\nUpon entering the longhouse, the guests are invited to sit down, the men at the upper part of the gallery and the women in the hall. The ceremony begins with the initiation session. The session can be a lengthy affair as speakers from both sides give their speeches. In their speeches, they talk about how well they know the bride and groom. Later, both the bride's and the bridegroom's families introduce their relatives to each other.\n\nThe wedding ceremony takes place at the bridegroom's longhouse in the evening. The couple, dressed in traditional costumes, are seated side by side on brass gongs. By their sides are the bestman and bridesmaid who are also dressed in traditional costumes. Both of them have to stand in attendance. The village headman then performs the ceremony by holding and waving a cockerel over their heads, reciting his prayer of blessing. The significance of this is to bless and to wish the couple a happy married life.\n\nThe ceremony is then followed by the sprinkling of beads over the married couple. While doing this, the headman invokes a short prayer asking the spirits to bless, guide and guard them in their daily lives. As soon as this ceremony is over, food and the rice wine are served.\n\nIt is customary for an endless list of speakers to stand up to give words of advice to the newly married couple. The first to speak are the parents of both the bridegroom and the bride. This is followed by their uncles, aunts, grandparents, brothers, sisters and other relatives. The final speaker is the headman. After this is over, entertainment follows.\n\nThe merry-making commences with a lot of food, drinks and entertainment such as performances of traditional dances.

Security and policemen got into position to welcome the delegates and representatives of various countries.\nThe two-hour parade kicked off at 8 a.m. with thousands of people flocking to the square to see the parade. The place was packed with locals and also tourists sitting on both sides of the path waiting to cheer their leaders. The King and Queen arrived with their entourage. People began to applaud and scream `Merdeka!' as helicopters billowed out the colors of the flag.\n\nDignitaries including the Prime Ministers of Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia graced the occasion. There was representation from US, UK, Australia, Sri Lanka, Japan and other countries. 'Malaysiaku Gemilang' (My Glorious Malaysia) was the theme of the event. The national anthem started and everybody sang with lot of passion and sentiment. Parade participants held up their right hands as they recited the National Oath.\n\nAlong with other students, I had assembled on the field of the state stadium. Some of my friends who were in the school band took part in the march past. I was in the cultural troupe, performing cultural dances in front of thousands of spectators from all walks of life. It was a proud moment for all taking part.\n\nAfter the performances, the Merdeka Day parade commenced. This was not only confined to Kuala Lumpur only. Simultaneously the national flag raising campaign began throughout the country. It had become a tradition for Malaysians, including those in rural areas, to display the-nation's flag at their houses, office premises, shopping complexes, and even stalls by the roadside. Mini flagpoles were also attached to automobile roofs.\n\nPeople turned out in droves, waving miniature Malaysian flags and singing as bands played songs at the Merdeka parade. The parade was made up of delegations representing hundreds of organizations, including government agencies, enforcement authorities and companies. The Guest of Honour inspected the parade and took the salute from the grandstand. Present were Chief Ministers, state cabinet ministers, members of the parliament and state legislative assembly, senior government servants and community leaders.\n\nIt was indeed an event to rejoice, celebrate and be part of a historic moment. These words aptly sum up a nation solemnizing its 51 years of independence."

No doubt, I see and hear the same things going on every day but the scene is familiar and comforting.\nAs I leave my front door and stroll down the street, I look up at the deep blue sky with occasional patches of white clouds spreading across. Sometimes, I take hold of my little sister's hand as we walk. We turn our heads as our eyes check for traffic on both sides, then we hurry across the street. The street is empty and serene on a Sunday morning and it shows no signs of cars or people. Many cars still are parked in the driveway.\n\nWe pass by many front yards with well-maintained gardens, with thick green lawns and colorful flower beds. Some sections of the sidewalk are still wet from the morning lawn watering. Our hands swing back and forth in leisure, in rhythm with our footsteps like two solders marching down the street.\n\nSometimes, our heads tilt back and our eyes look up to follow the sound of birds chirping overhead. However, we see no sign of birds but a ceiling of dense oak leaves. The leaves of the trees grown along the roadside rustle in the gentle breeze. Some leaves dance side to side as they fly down from high above.\n\nThe air carries the scent of citrus to our noses, as we approach the small lemon tree at the end of the sidewalk. Many ripe bright yellow lemons hang low from the branches. As we turn the corner, a long row of tall oleander trees greets us. The trees are planted along the sidewalk in a bed of earth raised about two and half feet high above the ground.\n\nA half a block ahead, we catch a glimpse of a monkey swinging from the branch of a tree. We try not to make any noise by tiptoeing forward to take a closer look at it. The friendly baker from the only bakery on the street comes out and greets us. He is covered with flour from his hair to his hands. At the same time, I inhale the aroma of freshly baked buns. It stirs up hunger pangs in my stomach and is a reminder that it is time for an early lunch.\n\nAfter a minute of looking around the bakery shop, we resume our walk. This time, we walk down the path in silence. I realize we are doing more than just having a walk on this Sunday morning for we are actually building a bond. This is an experience I hope, we will continue to have in our many more Sundays together."

Kota Tinggi Waterfalls, as it is called, is 36 meters high and is located at the base of the 634-metre high Gunung Muntahak mountain. The cool river water drains through a series of shallow pools ideal for swimming. However, the natural beauty of some parts of the location has somewhat been spoilt by resort development with artificial landscaping.\n\nThe waterfall area is a great place to have family picnics, but the place can get crowded during the weekends. The scenery is perfect as you watch the water cascading down with the view of the 600 m high Gunung Muntahak in a distance.\n\nThe Kota Tinggi park was made famous by the river and the waterfall. It is the focal point of the day's outing. Over the years and following growing demands, the park area has been continuously upgraded. The area of the park itself is relatively small. It has a gigantic car park, almost half the area of the park. There is a straight, direct path from the car park to the main waterfall area, along the bank of the river. This walking distance is approximately a kilometer.\n\nAll the way on the left are the food outlets and stalls. Then on the right, is the river itself. There are railings along the banks and the river itself is kept free of rubbish. Picnickers would be on a lookout for any empty spaces in the river.\n\nThere are also many beaches along the coastal part of Kota Tinggi. The most popular beaches are Tanjung Balau, Desaru and Batu Layar, which are 58 km, 55 km, and 62 km from Kota Tinggi town respectively. Chalets and hotels offering reasonable rates can easily be found along the beach.\n\nFor accommodation, one can always go to the Swiss style chalets built near the falls and stay overnight, equipped with cooking facilities. There are public changing rooms and camping grounds at the base of the waterfall. There is also a restaurant nearby that provides both Chinese and Western food. Food stalls are set up here as well. A camping ground has also been opened for those who wish to camp out. There are parking spaces available for cars, buses and motorcycles as well.\n\nMany visitors who have been to Kota Tinggi often leave the place after having a good time. Many go back for repeat visits."

        "content": "A trip to the Bako National Park in Sarawak is a trip my friends and I will always remember. To go there, we took a local bus from central Kuching to the town of Bako. We stopped a few times along the way. One stop is a colorful village on stilts, the wooden houses painted bright colors from which children stream in and out, goats huddle around and mothers do their cooking in.\nWe arrived in Bako and changed our mode of transportation to a longboat. The boatmen took us, crashing through the waves for about fifteen minutes until we were in sight of a beach with huge, multi-colored, limestone cliffs. They told us to take off our shoes because it was low tide. So they could not take the boat up to the jetty. We had to jump out of the boat and walked onto the beach with our heavy backpacks.\n\nAfter walking for half a kilometer, we checked into the Bako National Park headquarters. It was then we decided to take a quick walk into the jungle before it gets dark. We followed a plankwalk while the sun was setting, the best time to spot Proboscis monkeys. We rounded a corner and a black, thin snake slid through the water of a little pond. About fifteen minutes later, we heard something crashing through the trees. This made us stop to see what was happening. There were four of them overhead. At the moment before dark, it started to pour, tropical rainstorm-style, and we had to head back.\n\nThe next day we woke up early to start a hike while the sun was still low. To our right, in the trees, was an entire community of Long Tailed Macquaques. These monkeys were much bolder than the previous night's monkeys. They ventured really close to us, especially when we were taking our cameras out of our bags.\n\nFurther on down the trail was much more serene. We passed loads of pitcher plants: carnivorous, deep pockets with a liquid inside containing enzymes which digest their prey. They were eye-height, and we saw that many of them had dried up. We got to a plateau and the last part of the trail took us down through the rocks and down to the sea. Around the beach are huge, red lakes. The rocks here have deposits of iron throughout them. We ran down, all alone, and jumped into the salty water. This place is fantastic. We were bodysurfing in the South China Sea! While we were drying off, we watched mudskippers, small, fishy things that looked like salamanders, run right across the top of the rusty water.\n\nAfter a rest, we decided to go on another trail in the afternoon, this time through the dense forest. After two absolutely sweaty hours, we reached our destination, Tajor Waterfall. The waterfall itself is quite small and the rocks around the pool are covered in slippery moss. There, we played in the water enjoying the cool water running over our feet. On taking a closer look at the water, we realised that although it was red, it was crystal clear.\n\nThe trip is certainly one I would recommend to those who want to get away from the hectic city for a few days. The Bako National Park is truly a place of natural beauty."

        "content": "Cyber security is an important issue. A computer or cyber crime can be broadly defined as criminal activity involving an information technology infrastructure, including unauthorized access, illegal interception by technical means of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within a computer system, data interference, systems interference and electronic fraud.\nIn very clear terms, when a computer is manipulated to deal with data or a software program in a way that creates loss or damage, a computer crime takes place. This means that a theft or breach of trust has taken place by electronic means. There are several types of computer crimes. Hacking is one of them. It is unauthorized access by any person using a computer and any other communications device to break computer security or circumvent it to enter a computer system. It is air infringement that is at par with `breaking and entering'.\n\nThe gravity of hacking is to be weighed against what is actually done upon illegally entering the computer system. Data may be stolen or integrity of the information may be affected which is akin to sabotage and in both cases, there is damage. Some hackers may do nothing but browse. If the intention of a hacker is to destroy files, this can be classified a crime by electronic means.\n\nPirated software is often made available on unauthorized sites on the Internet and is fairly common. Some people download or purchase pirated software from these sites. Providing pirated software for others to use is a copyright infringement. When you buy software, you do not own it but only acquire the right to use it. Copying a program in its entirety is a contribution to software piracy whereas fair use only allows the reproduction of a part of the copyrighted work.\n\nComputer fraud is dishonest misrepresentation of fact intended to induce another to do or refrain from doing something which causes loss. the act of fraud will result in obtaining a benefit by altering computer input in an unauthorized way. An example is employees altering the data before entry or entering false data or by entering unauthorized instructions or using unauthorized processes. Another example is manipulating banking systems to make unauthorized identity theft with reference to ATM fraud.\n\nAs cyber crimes are skyrocketing, with one recent study finding that ninety percent of corporations surveyed have suffered a computer break-in in the last year, new laws have been passed to impose stricter penalties on those guilty. However, the crimes are best prevented not with new criminal penalties but with common sense and the use of simple digital architecture that enhances security. Since computer criminals are so difficult to prosecute, digital architecture plays an even more important role in fighting crime."

        "content": "Staying fit is a universal need. Yet, not everybody is able to hold on to an exercise regime that promises physical fitness. Sadly, physical fitness has become an option for many. More often than not, people start to exercise or do other physical exertions when they are faced with some ailment or the other.\n\nThere are many options open to the person who has decided to pursue an exercise regimen. But there are some facts to be considered before setting out on a regular exercise schedule. The first and most important step is self-evaluation. Self-evaluation is important because it will save us from hurting ourselves by following regimens that friends follow. It involves taking a good look at our abilities and our disabilities. Not everybody needs the same exercise regimen. Consulting a qualified person to evaluate oneself is important. Equally important is that we choose a program that we can comfortably stick to. This involves a serious look at our resources of free time and convenience as well as the affordability.\n\nAnother important factor is to see that the exercise regimen does not become a chore that we hate doing. There must be some element of entertainment in the exercise that we accept. This would ensure a longer period of adherence. Giving up an exercise can sometimes leave us in a worse state than how we were before the commencement of it.\n\nThis takes us to the next important consideration. The regimen must be one that can be maintained over an extended period of time so that our body adapts to the rigors of it.\n\nAnother important consideration is to evaluate our physical disabilities. If we are on medication of any sort, it is best to consult the doctor in deciding on an exercise regimen. All exercise regimens must be complemented with a responsible eating habit. This also includes the avoidance of alcoholic drinks and the use of tobacco.\n\nConvenient location of gyms, dance halls, yoga centres or tai chi centres is of utmost importance. In the competitive world that we live in, time is of essence. We must ensure that no time is wasted. In fact, the waste of time is one of the causes for the abandonment of exercise regimens."

        "content": "Puan Maria bte Ahmad, respected teachers and my fellow students of Form 1, a very good morning to all of you.\n\nIt is a pleasure to address you this morning. I am here to speak to you about Electronic commerce which is also known as e-commerce. Being a student myself, I do not have much personal experience in e-commerce. I have done some airline bookings, cinema reservations and railway bookings over the net.\n\nMuch of what I tell you is the result of research over the internet. E-commerce has gone from being a novel idea to a reflect billions of dollars in transactions every single day. For many people, it has become a way of life.\n\nLet me give you an example of e-commerce. The largest movement of people in the world is when the Chinese leave the cities of China and travel to the rural areas to celebrate Chinese New Year with their families in the villages and outlying towns. About a billion people move during these celebrations. Do you know that more than 70% of them booked their bus, train and other tickets online? One of the biggest benefits of that is that 700 million people did not leave their homes to go out and buy a ticket to travel. 700 million people did not queue up to buy tickets anywhere. This single story of travel tickets sold during the Chinese New Year is enough to wake us all up to the convenience, necessity and relevance of e-commerce.\n\nWhen we go out shopping for gifts for the holidays we are mostly on leave. Being on leave means zero productivity. With the convenience of online shopping, we can save the hours that we would otherwise spend driving, hunting for parking space, buying and physically carrying the purchases to our car. A single working day is called a man day. Coming back to the example, when the 700 million people did not take leave to go out and buy gifts but continued working because they could buy the gifts online, they saved 700 million man days. Can you imagine the economic benefits of that?\n\nIn any business, there are two factors. They are the buyer and the seller. If you open an online shop, you become a seller. The buyer logs in to your website, views the things you sell, studies your prices, then goes off to some other website and compares your prices and guaranteed quality. Then, he makes the purchase. Now, you as the seller have to make arrangements to send the purchased goods to the buyer. Offhand it may sound like a very unsafe way to spend money. But believe me, there are checks and balances in place. It is quite difficult to cheat in online transactions, simply because all your actions are in the public domain. There is no place to hide. And there is no running away. In a cashless society, the minute you buy something with your credit card, you are automatically declaring where you are.\nThe internet is full of companies offering all kinds of services and goods. Besides buying and selling, the internet is also the ideal place for hotel reservations, airline bookings and even checking in for your flight. The methodology involved is quite simple. Most of the websites give simple step by step instructions on how to execute a purchase of a service or goods. Payment, of course, is by credit card.\n\nBefore I conclude, let me give you one more example. Stephen King is a novelist famous for his horror stories. His works are so sought after that his fans wait impatiently for each Stephen King novel to be published. His works become best sellers and usually sell more than a million in the space of six months. More than ten years ago, he decided to publish his latest novel online. Friends, it was a best seller and crossed the million mark in just one week! This, my dear friends, is the past of e-commerce. Can you imagine what the future will be like? I leave you with that thought.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "It is an honour to address you on this lovely morning when people all over the world are celebrating Nature Day. I stand before you to talk to you on how natural resources may be saved for the future generations.\n\nOver the years, we have been taught the importance of reusing and recycling. Through all the different lessons that we had, I do not remember the mention of natural resources. Friends, conservation of natural resources is one of the major reasons that we have been encouraged to reuse and recycle.\n\nLet me focus on just the paper industry. When we say recycling, it is the recycling that immediately comes to mind because as students, this is the one product we use in large quantities. When paper is recycled, it reduces the need to cut down forests. We all know that softwood trees are a big industry. It is from the soft wood that we make paper pulp. Plantations of softwood trees provide a necessary support for the industry. There are many environment impacts in the planting of these trees, their maintenance over the years, the use of fertilisers and herbicides that build up to their harvesting. Each of these activities has its own impact on the environment. Every plantation is also a forest. When the forest is cut down in the name of harvesting the trees, there is a direct impact on the plants and animals that have established themselves in that forest.\n\nWhen we recycle paper, there is no impact on flora and fauna due to deforestation. There is no threat to species due to loss of habitat. Thus, there is no disturbance to the natural environment. No workers are exposed to herbicides or the release of any dioxins. Consequently, there is hardly any acidification of oceans.\n\nThe forests that were not cut down to be replaced by plantations and the flora and fauna that live in that habitat remained undisturbed simply because we recycle paper. I have spoken to you only of the recycling of paper. Using paper as an example, can you imagine the beneficial impact that each one of us can have on the environment when we ensure that we recycle and reuse as much as possible? There are close to 7 billion of us on this planet. Can you imagine how much of the resources we could save by opting for reusing and recycling? I leave you with that thought.\n\nThank you.\nHappy Nature Day!"

        "content": "The Takahe is a flightless bird indigenous to New Zealand. It was thought to be extinct after the last four known specimens were taken in 1898. However, on the 20th of November, 1948, after a carefully planned search effort the bird was rediscovered by Geoffrey Orbell.\nThe New Zealand Department of Conservation started an intense management program with the intention of increasing the size and range of the Takahe population. An important feature of this involved habitat restoration. The red deer was an introduced species that proved destructive in the area where the Takahe naturally survived. The red deer were culled to increase the Takahe's chances of survival.\n\nCaptive rearing of wildlife species for release back into the wild is considered a useful management tool for endangered species. It potentially increases the rate of survival of the young by bypassing the dangers faced in the crucial years into adulthood. To assess the success rate of the program, it becomes necessary to monitor the survival rate of the released animals. This helps to assess the survival skills of captive reared animals. The survival rate of wild Takahe over the first year after being born was already known to be poor. The captive-reared specimens overcame this mortality rate because of captivity. In the wild, the survival rate was 30 - 40%, whereas in captivity it was 85%.\n\nRadio telemetry is the use of radio waves for transmitting information from a distant instrument to a device that records the measurements. Radio transmitters attached to the birds had batteries that lasted three years. It was used to track the movement and survival of the captive-reared Takahe that had been released.\n\nThe Takahe normally breed in pairs and both parents care for the eggs and chicks. Clutches normally consist of two eggs, but parents rarely raise two chicks. The Takahe management program involved the fostering of single eggs to the pair of parents. The second egg was systematically collected for artificial incubation and rearing.\n\nWhen the eggs hatched, the chicks were placed under a suspended model of an adult Takahe complete with a heated pad and hygienic cloth nest material. This was to simulate brooding by a real parent. A small speaker concealed in the nest played quiet calls recorded from brooding parents in the wild. Up to 5 chicks were thus reared with each model parent.\n\nAn important measure of the captive-rearing program was that chicks were unable to see their human keepers. The chicks were fed from a dish of food by a glove puppet simulating the head and neck of an adult Takahe. After about six weeks, the chicks are able to feed themselves from dishes. At that time, puppet feeding was discontinued.\n\nOne of the original long-term goals of the Takahe program was to establish a self-sustaining wild population of at least 500 Takahe. At the last count in 2013, the wild population of Takahe stood at 263."

        "content": "I am an avid bird watcher. I have been observing the city birds of Kuala Lumpur. Due to the natural deforestation that occurs in areas close to Kuala Lumpur, many birds now find places within the city to reside. The most common is the triangular enclosed area behind the large advertisements boards on unipoles. It is a natural choice for the birds because the unipoles are similar to trees, tall and far from ground based threats.\n\nSir, there are several species that live in these places. The surprising thing is that out of necessity, there are easily more than five or six species that roost together. The number of residents at each place goes into the thousands.\n\nAll my efforts to learn more about these birds have led me to the conclusion that there have not been any consistent studies or the monitoring of these city dwellers. The innovative habitats, eating habits, adaptation to life in a city, diseases, mortality rate and such other information are not available.\n\nI humbly wish to submit that it is important to fill this gap. I would like to propose that a program be initiated to study about the birds that reside within the city. We would not know if they were facing extinction. The importance of the continued existence of all species cannot be stressed enough. It could be convenient to employ or at least commission bird watchers to do the initial studies by providing them with basic necessities for such study and the necessary guidelines.\n\nSir, who knows? Future city buildings may have to have facilities for urban bird species to build their nests. It is common knowledge that many wildlife species have adapted to city dwelling. Let me point out that no birds may be seen drinking from the many fountains in the city. It is as if they knew that we use chemically treated water to avoid the breeding of mosquitoes.\n\nI hope this appeal meets with your kind approval and we can create a historical chapter on the birds of Kuala Lumpur. I strongly believe that it will become a permanent part of the history of Kuala Lumpur. I am sure that it will spur cities all over the world to maintain up-to-date records of city-birds."

        "content": "Lately the environment in most housing areas have seen an increase in randomly strewn rubbish in the form of discarded plastic bottles, plastic bags and food wrappers of shapes and sizes. Unkempt hedges and clogged drains add to the general gloomy effect that is brought up by such neglect.\n\nMore often than not, rubbish bins get damaged due to the rough handling by the rubbish removal contractors. It is easy to imagine that this behavior of the workers is the same in all the other areas where they go. This is an irresponsible way to handle public property. Such matters must immediately be brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.\n\nMaintaining the cleanliness of the environment is everybody's responsibility. More often than not, it is irresponsible behavior that leads to the accumulation of rubbish everywhere. If people were to be diligent about discarding bottles and plastic bags in the rubbish bins provided, this problem would not arise. So, it may be suggested that a re-education program be instituted by the Residents' Association. This may take the form of letters to all the residents as well as posters placed in strategic places like the office of the RA as well as near the entrance to lifts.\nSuch efforts should coincide with a communal effort at clearing up all the accumulated debris. Organizing a gotong royong for the purpose not only clears away the rubbish, it is also a useful method for the residents of a locality to become more familiar with each other and build up the communal spirit.\n\nThere must be a conscious awareness of the pest population in the locality. Rats and cockroaches are the most rampant when given the chance. The presence of cats in a neighborhood can work wonders to reduce the rat population. Pest control is a serious matter that has to be reported to the correct authorities so that they may send professionals who are trained to handle the poisons usually used to control pests.\n\nAn important factor in controlling mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue is preventive action. It must be ensured that there is no stagnation of water where mosquitoes can breed. If the mosquito population is excessively high, we can always call the authorities to conduct fogging activities.\n\nA clean environment can only be achieved when we understand our civic responsibility and do not behave in a manner detrimental to the upkeep of a clean environment. It is not just the responsibility of the government to ensure that the environment is always amenably clean. It is up to the citizens to take up the responsibility to address issues when they are small than to wait for the government to recognize when a problem has become large and then address it top down."

        "content": "Ensuring one's personal health is the responsibility of each citizen. It involves being disciplined in physical and mental matters. The former is relevant to maintaining physical health. Mental matters relate to having the right attitude and values. Both physical and mental discipline is important on more than just on the personal level. We are lucky to have a responsible government. The government has made medical expenses accessible at minimal rates. This is because the expenses are subsidised by the government. Many diseases that we see may be proven to be a result of a lack of physical and mental discipline.\n\nPhysical discipline involves maintaining the health of the body. There are many factors to consider in the matter. Many people feel proud at building up massive muscles. But they fail to remember that there is an age limit after which it would be impossible to do such exercises. In maintaining physical health, the better objective is to follow a regimen that ensures good toning of the muscles.\n\nA physical trainer's advice will be useful in creating a set of simple exercises that will benefit all the parts of the body. There is both and right and wrong way to do even simple exercises. The trainer's advice will be invaluable in getting to know how to avoid injuries. A nutritionist may be able to advice on an ideal diet that will be helpful for good physical health. Besides, we can also get a good understanding of what types of food should be avoided. Family diseases are a reality. Having knowledge of diseases that a family is prone to suffer will be helpful. The advice of a doctor may be sought to find out what may be done to delay or totally avoid the onset of family diseases.\n\nOn the mental level, it is important to have commitment to one's physical discipline. The danger is that one can be negatively influenced by friends. It is best to avoid such people. It must be remembered that the best friends are people who share common interests with you. So, it will always be better to have friends who have similar physical and mental discipline as you.\n\nWhen we start working, depending on the nature of the work, it may become difficult to follow the regimen of exercises. We must learn how to adapt so that one's physical health is not sacrificed for the sake of professional commitments. Adjustments must be made so that the physical discipline is maintained.\nAnother important area in mental training is developing good relationships with one's friends and relatives. The joy of living is in having good friends and relatives. All forms of physical and mental discipline will become meaningless if one is unhappy. The greatest wealth in life is good physical and mental health. Physical health can be achieved with the right personal habits. Mental health is achieved only with healthy relationship with one's peers.\n\nAs a footnote, it should never be forgotten that physical and mental discipline are just the path to healthy living. One should never allow physical and mental discipline to supersede the importance of having a happy and healthy life with ones' friends and relatives."

        "content": "I recently attended a workshop by Ukub books on how to manage time spent on the use of the internet. I am here to share my experience with all of you. Much of what I heard at the workshop really altered my impression of the internet. I hope that you will agree with me by the time I finish my talk. First of all, let me draw your attention to a basic fact. Nearly all of us have a mobile phone. Gone are the days when you needed a computer to log onto the internet. Today, all mobile phones are internet enabled. When a computer was needed to get on the internet, there was the safety of parental supervision. The story is different with mobile phones. Nobody observes us when we use the mobile phone. Hence it is up to us to ensure that we do not create hazards for others when we use our mobile phones. At the same time we must also be alert to our own safety, too. If you check youtube, you will be shocked to find that so many people have been knocked down by all sorts of vehicles when they walked into the path of traffic while busy looking at their mobiles.\n\nAnother big drawback of constantly communicating via whatsapp, twitter and other such social media is that we meet face to face less and less. In the long run, we lose all sense of decent social behaviour. The importance of meeting each people is a totally different subject, so I shall leave it at just this mention.\n\nHardly any of us switch off our mobile phones at night. Many of us receive whatsapp messages and tweets even in the middle of the night. Disturbed sleep has been proven to have a direct impact on worsening grades in school. Worsening grades directly means worsening prospects for the future. Nobody dreams of becoming a menial worker. But without proper education, that could be the only option in the future.\n\nAfter drugs and alcohol, the internet has been discovered to the third most addictive thing on earth. If you don't believe me, just leave your mobile phones away for 2 days. Even the thought of it is traumatic. That is how closely we have become to the mobile phone which in other words means the internet.\n\nThe most important lesson that I got from the workshop was that with mobile phones, we have to regulate ourselves. As I said earlier, we are not supervised when we use a mobile phone. So, it is up to us to make rules for ourselves. We should vow never to look at the phone or its messages when we are walking anywhere. We must always sit down somewhere before we read our messages. We must turn off our devices before we go to sleep. If possible, we must communicate via social media on at pre-determined intervals. Once a day is okay, but the time must be limited.\n\nWhat I have mentioned is all in passing. I truly hope you will check out the facts that I mentioned, the next time you surf the net. Then, you will agree that mobile phones and the internet can be hazards in more ways than we know. The best thing is to treat them with respect and use them in moderation."

Our body is under our own personal care. Nobody else is going to look after it for you, unless you are sick all the time and will need nursing.\n\nDo you remember going through our grandfather's photo album? What stroke me was how healthy and robust our grandfather's parents were in the pictures. They belonged to the agrarian generation and used to work the fields for long hours. Besides, they had the freshest of vegetables, fish and meat because everything was sourced locally.\n\nJohan, I want you to get involved in some form of physical exercise on a regular basis. I already have my own regimen. Besides, you have to read up about nutrition and what types of food are bad for you. Believe me when I tell you from what I have observed, you need to make some serious changes.\n\nRemember that I beat Harris swimming across the river? How do you think I managed that when he was the school's athletics star? The answer is simple. I got into regular exercises and a controlled diet. He did not. See how fast things can change with exercise and watching one's nutrition? Johan, you can be the next one to defeat Harris. Don't forget, you have the genes for it. After all, we are descendants of some really healthy and sturdy Malay folks from the countryside.\n\nBest wishes\n\nJalal"
