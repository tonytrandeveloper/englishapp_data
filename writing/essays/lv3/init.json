        "content": "Far up in the mountains of Canada, there is an old abandoned log cabin. Once it was occupied by a young couple who wanted to distance themselves from the chaos of this modern world. Here they were miles away from the nearest town. Bob, the husband, made the occasional trip into town to buy supplies whereas Jan, his wife, spent her free time by the fire, sewing. Their life was simply idyllic.\nThen, one midwinter's day, Jan woke up from bed with a strange ache in her bones. Putting it down to overwork, Bob shooed her to bed and made sure she rested. Though Jan was impatient to get to her chores, Bob soothed her, \"Relax, Sugar. You're overdoing things. All these chores will be here when you recover.\"\n\nHowever, Jan seemed to be getting worse instead of recovering. By evening, she was running a high fever and in greater pain. In spite of his best efforts, Bob could not manage to ease her suffering. And then suddenly, she started to lapse into unconsciousness.\n\nIt was then obvious that she was seriously ill. What could Bob do? He had no experience in treating the sick and Jan was getting worse by the minute. He knew that there was an old doctor in town but he lived three miles away, downhill. Pot-bellied and obese, there was no way the doctor could make it up to their cabin.\n\nSomething had to be done quickly! Bob racked his brains but to no avail. The only thing left to do was to go to the doctor. In Jan's condition, she could never walk that far in the waist-deep snow. Bob would have to carry her!\n\nBob searched his mind for a way to move poor, sick Jan. Then, he remembered. He had once made a sledge so that they could ride together over the mountain. They never got around to using it though, because the whole mountain was thickly covered with rocks and trees. He had never found a safe way down, not even once.\n\n\"Well,\" he thought, \"looks like I'm going to have to try it anyhow,\" as he dug out the sledge from the storeroom. \"Jan may die unless I get her to the doctor, and life means nothing to me without her.\" With this thought in mind, Bob gently tucked Jan into the sledge, got in the front, and with a short prayer for safety, pushed off.\n\nHow they got through that ride alive, Bob has never figured out. As trees loomed up in front of him and just as quickly whizzed by his side, close enough to touch, he felt relieved that Jan was not awake to experience the ride. It was all he could do not to scream as collision seemed imminent, time and again, with only inches to spare.\n\nAt last, bursting from the mountainside, the town came into view. Barely slowing down, they sped through the icy streets, only losing speed as they neared the doctor's house. The sledge, battered through the journey, collapsed in the left ski as it came to a halt, spilling out its occupants. Bob picked up his Jan and made his way into the doctor's house.\n\nAfter what seemed to be a long winter, Jan recovered fully from her illness but Bob never recovered from his fright. They moved into the little town so as to be near help in times of crisis, and have lived there ever since."

        "content": "It seemed like it was going to be another one of those days when nothing much happens. Ken and his friends were playing their regular football game along the banks of the river near their small village. In the midst of the game, Ken's attention was drawn to a tourist boat passing by.\nActually, tourist boats were quite common in their area. It was also common for some of the tourists to take potshots at the birds and squirrels along the way. This is why Ken's friends were not really surprised to hear a few small explosions from the boat. They ignored the sounds and went on with their game.\n\nHowever, they were startled when they suddenly heard loud cries for help coming from the boat. They could see that the crew were running about, panic-stricken. Some people were shouting to them.\n\n\"Their engine must have blown up! Look, there's smoke and the boat's out of control. It's going towards the rapids,\" Ken pointed out to his friends.\n\nKen's village was located at the point at which the tourist boats turned around and headed back upstream. Three kilometers downstream were the rapids, which spelt trouble for the boats.\n\n\"It's heading straight for the rapids! They're in trouble! The boat will be smashed against the rocks!\" Ken exclaimed. \"Let's get help!\"\n\nThe boys sprinted back to the village for help. Along the way, they met the village headman. Stumbling over his words in his haste, Ken explained the emergency to the headman.\n\nThe headman was a man of quick action. Without wasting any time, he yelled out to some men to help him carry his powerful outboard motor to the jetty. With the motor tied firmly onto bamboo poles, they rushed hurriedly down to the jetty.\n\nTheir haste was indeed necessary for, by the time the men had reached the jetty, they saw that the boat was dangerously close to the rapids. There was not a moment to lose! With quick hands, the headman attached the outboard motor to his sampan and then sped off to the rescue.\nUpon reaching the tourist boat with bare minutes to spare, the headman realized his mistake. How could so many tourists be packed into this small sampan? The headman was filled with despair. Then he saw the rope that had been used to tie down the outboard motor to the bamboo poles. It had been flung into the sampan in his haste. Quickly, he grabbed the rope and flung it to the boatmen on the tourist boat.\n\n \"I'll tow you back!\" he shouted.\n\nAfter the boatmen had tied the rope firmly to their boat, the headman made a swift U-turn and then, putting the engine on full power, he steered his sampan upstream. The rope gave a jerk and then, to everyone's relief and joy, the tourist boat moved forward, obediently following the small sampan.\n\nLoud cheers burst out from the tourist boat and the observers on the shore. Thanks to the headman's courage, the cooperation from the villagers, and the quick action of the boys, the tourists were saved from certain death in the rapids."

        "content": "The morning sun shone persistently on my still-shut eyelids. Annoyed, I rolled on to the right side of my mattress. Wondering about the time, I stretched out my arm to grasp the little, round alarm clock on my bedside table. I forced open my eyes, focused them on the numbers ... and screeched!\nLeaping out of my bed, I swung open the wardrobe door. Throwing my school uniform on the bed, I dashed to the bathroom. Halfway, I spun around and grabbed my school bag, deciding not to brush my teeth. Soon, I had shoved my feet into my shoes and pounced onto my bicycle. My parents stood motionless, staring at me as I whizzed past.\n\nAs my bicycle raced on, I noticed a group of schoolgirls looking my way with great interest. Well, well! Obviously, I was still attractive even with uncombed hair. My heart was pounding furiously in my chest as I whirred past a few cars on the road. The drivers seemed to stare with disbelief that one could pedal so swiftly. In no time, I reached the school gate, which was just about to be closed.\n\nWithout bothering to explain myself to the priggish duo on guard duty, I hopped off my bike and dashed off. After locking my precious iron steed at the shed, I sprinted to the school hall. As I burst into the hall, I braked to change direction and made a beeline for the back of my class. Screeching to a halt, I took my place behind my classmates.\n\nIn the whole gathering of students, I seemed to be the centre of attraction. It did not matter much to me at the moment for I was used to being looked at. However, to say the least, I was a little surprised when everyone stopped staring blankly at me and started to giggle.\n\nSuddenly, the whole hall was filled with roars and bellows of laughter. Smiling at my audience, I decided to take a bow.\nThen, I noticed that the bottom half of my trousers were the wrong color. My line of vision moved upwards, revealing that the rest of my pants were also the wrong color, and so was my shirt. At first, even my powerful brain could not figure it out.\n\n\"Daniel! Why on earth are you in pajamas?\" my friend blurted out amidst the hollers of laughter.\n\nThe feeling of sheer horror swept through my entire frame. My mouth was stuck open in an \"0\" shape for a few long seconds. My mind was filled only with shock as darkness mercifully started to engulf me.\n\nOnce again. I awoke with lights playing on my eyelids. At first I had little memory of what had happened, but one look at the group of people peering down at me brought the whole incident back to mind. The young boys were all clad in white uniforms and grinning quite lunatically at me. In. the high corner of the room, I saw a red crescent. Then the horrible little squirts started to call out for their seniors. Outside, I heard fresh gales of laughter. The brats were chortling. I was still clad in pajamas. Not knowing what else to do, I feigned unconsciousness again ..."

        "content": "It's my birthday today. I have lost count of how many birthdays have passed, but I still keep my tradition. I climb to the top of the nearby hill, bringing a handful of dirt with me. I press it into the ground. Then, I sit down to prepare my mind for my next annual rite: reminding myself of who I am and why I am living.\nI made this hill, actually, and I'm still building it up. I started on my tenth birthday. Now, the hill is large enough for me to ski down each winter. In a world where people stay young forever, persistence pays.\n\nPersistence was what led Dr Syue Cano to discover the secret of eternal youth. At the age of eighty-four, he identified the gene that causes humans to age and the specific radiation that destroys it. No one will know whether he detonated his \"Youth\" bomb for the sake of his own immortality or for the sake of the other human beings in the world. However, his defective heart could not withstand the impact of the blast. He died the instant the bomb exploded.\n\nMankind will always be grateful for the discovery to which Dr Cano dedicated his life. However, he left the world with one problem: the earth's limited natural resources. Even with plant growth accelerated by scientific wizardry, food and oxygen were becoming inadequate for the world population, which only kept booming.\n\nSome subtractions were necessary for the survival of the human species. The only solution was to remove some of the people by unnatural means, that is, to execute them. Thus, this was why all crimes were made punishable by execution: murder, theft, adultery, slander, hoarding of food... the list is very long. This was the only way to maintain the valance of nature.\n\nThat's where I come in. I am an Executioner. I work alone, never considering the risk. People say I have a death wish. Perhaps I do. Certainly, yesterday's job was no waltz in the park.\nRob Tao was suspected of stealing and hoarding food. My job was to check this out. As always, I was to be detective, judge, jury and executioner.\n\nI had enough stealth technology to break into Tao's compound undetected. To get into the house was also a cinch. My vibra-blade cut through the wall like it was butter. In the house, my Arometer detected food, lots of it. I went down corridor after corridor, following the bleeps of light on my Arometer.\n\nThe signals went wild outside one closed door. There was a lot of human activity inside, judging by my HUO sensors. I primed a grenade and opened the door just a crack -- enough to see whom I would be executing.\n\nThen I deprimed the grenade. Sitting there were thousands of children. Rob Tao stood amongst them, holding a huge pot of steaming mush. He smiled at me, seemingly unperturbed.\n\n\"You're feeding all these children?\" I asked, flabbergasted.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied quietly.\n\n\"How do you get so much food? I'm sure you steal it,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, I do. Going to execute me?\" Still that gentle smile. Sitting here now, on my hill, I don't understand why I just walked out. I had no excuse for letting him get away with his crime. It was not my decision to make. Yet... I can't remember what I'm killing for; can't remember what I'm living for."

        "content": "Every evening, as I am doing my schoolwork in my room, the familiar sound of my father's car reaches my ears. I imagine his Fort Cortina coming up the driveway, the engine purring to a stop. I know that in a few moments, my father will be pausing outside my door, looking in quietly, so as not to stir me from my concentration. I know he will feel pleased as he watches me studying.\nMy father, at 53 years, has thinning hair swept back from his forehead. He has a slim and athletic body. His broad shoulders and rather serious demeanor give him an air of authority. Yet, behind his steel-rimmed glasses are soft, kind eyes.\n\nMy father has always been my source of encouragement. When I was very young, he would take a book from our small home library and read aloud to me every night. Secure and loved, on his lap, I was introduced to the fascinating realm of books. He would read stories and parables from the Bible. Thus, he instilled in me a sense of God's presence in this world.\n\nI remember how, as he was reading, my father would point out the spelling of words. Then one day, he instructed me to read the words for myself. To our shared delight, I found that I was able to do so. From that day onwards, I was the one who would read aloud, with his gentle correction every now and then. Soon after that, I was picking up the hooks and reading them on my own. I became quite a bookworm.\n\nAs I grew into boyhood, my bookish ways and disinterest in outdoor games made me overweight, clumsy and rather unfit. One day, my father stood observing me as I was running to a field, just 50 yards away. I arrived there, huffing and puffing. Worriedly, he told me that he would not like to see his son grow up into an unhealthy man.\n\nFrom that day onwards, he started to take me on jogs. At first, I was a most reluctant jogger. However, these days, as I stand perched on the peak of Mount Kina, breathing deeply after a good run, I remember his words, \"A healthy body breeds a healthy mind.\"\n\nMy father has a store of wise sayings which may seem common to some but always strike the correct note with me. Once, when I was really depressed, he put an arm around my shoulders and gently asked me what was troubling me. Lifting my bowed head, I poured out my heart's discontent. After listening, he consoled me. Then he said, \"Smile, and the world around you will smile.\" Somehow, I was able to smile in spite of my problems.\n\nAt another time, when I was about to give up on a task, he advised me, \"If a job deserves to be done, it deserves to be done well.\" Somehow, his words gave me the strength to try again, and I was able to succeed. Since then, whenever I feel daunted by a task, his advice always comes to mind and this spurs me on to persevere.\n\nLooking back, I realize that every step of the way, through my childhood and adolescence, my father has been there for me whenever I needed him. When I was sick, he would rush me to the doctor. When I was sick at heart, he would know just the right things to say. In any kind of trouble, I would just have to give him a call. He would surely be there.\n\nI am only a few years away from adulthood and know that many more challenges lie ahead of me. However, I can be sure that my father will be there, looking out for me all the way. Why? Because he loves me."

Not all of them have changed my life, but they have certainly made me more aware of my limitations. Yet, sometimes, remembering those times, I think, \"I can't believe I actually did that!\"\nThere was this incident about five years back. I was at a piano recital. Actually, it was my debut, and I was shaking with nerves. Finally, the dreaded moment arrived. I sat at the piano and started playing. Halfway through the first movement, I felt a tickle in my nose. My fingers were needed on the piano keys so I could not reach tip to rub my nose. I tried holding my breath... to no avail. I exploded in a huge, sloppy sneeze that blasted my music sheets right off the piano. Absolutely humiliated, I dashed off the stage. Nothing could get me out there to face the amused audience.\n\nThen, there was this skating incident which occurred only a year ago. My father had bought me my first pair of in-line skates. Actually, they were my first pair of skates. I had never skated before. Well, I confidently put them on and fastened them, not knowing what was ahead. Standing up, I shoved off. Then, for the first time in years, I lost all control of my bodily movements. I was waving my arms around, like a drowning chicken trying to fly out of the water. My legs had no sense of direction, with my left leg heading north and my right heading south-east. Finally managing to get upright, I found myself staring the gate right in its metal grille. There was a loud Crash! Boom! and Bang! Fortunately, all that was injured was my self-confidence, thanks to my protective pads.\n\nAnother accident occurred right in the safety of my home, in the kitchen, actually. My mother had just bought a microwave oven. On that fateful day, my mother had left me a plate of fried rice to be reheated for my lunch. On the plate were the usual accompaniments to the coconut-flavored rice: vegetables, groundnuts, chillied prawns and a whole hard-boiled egg. I was, of course, still considered a user with \"L\" (Learner) plates as far as this oven was concerned. However, warming up food was not complicated ... or so I thought. Carefully, I placed the plate of food in the microwave oven, turned the dial to \"high\" and pressed the lever to start the oven. It started smoothly. Gleefully, I watched my dish of food turn graceful circles in the oven. After a few rounds, I opened the oven to take out my warmed-up food. At that very second, the egg exploded. Boom! It was \"Egg yolk keeps falling on my head\". My clothes, my hair, the whole kitchen was covered with egg-yolk and rice that the force of the explosion threw. There was no lunch for me that day either.\n\nWell, there you have them, some of the grimace-inspiring details of my life. So, am I clumsy or just low in luck? A little of both, I think."

        "content": "\"Argh!\" screamed my friend as the water balloon hit her full in the face. She stood in shock for a moment before charging after me, laughing and yelling out threats.\nWe were at our annual class party and having the time of our lives. This year, we had decided on the picnic at the beach. After eating, we had all sorts of games and competitions. I could not remember when I had last enjoyed myself so much.\n\nHowever, all good things must come to an end, and as it neared evening, we started preparing to leave. I was supposed to walk the short distance to my aunt's house after the party. About halfway there, I remembered that I had left a T-shirt on the beach. I debated whether or not to return for it as I could see dark clouds heading my way. However, the shirt was an old favorite of mine and I was so wet from the water balloons that a little more water would not make a difference.\n\nThe beach was now deserted. I looked around for my T-shirt but it was nowhere to be found. Finally, after minutes of fruitless search, I gave up. The sky was dark, with thick thunderclouds and it had begun to drizzle. I started heading back.\n\nThen, suddenly, with a loud crash of thunder, the heavens burst and torrents of rain came pouring down. Holding my backpack over my head in an effort to ward off the relentless blows of the rain, I scanned the area for a place of refuge.\n\nFinally spotting a tiny shack at a distance, I dashed for it. I reached it at last and darted in, drenched to the bone and shivering from head to toe. As I shook out my hair, I mentally kicked myself for getting into this situation.\n\nWondering when the rain would stop, I stared out at it, dejectedly. As I gazed, however, my feelings of dejection turned into awe. The black clouds hung low. The sea was turbulent, with powerful waves crashing onto the shore. On the left, where jagged boulders stood in the sea, the waves threw themselves on them, sending up sprays of sea water high into the air. Gust after gust of howling wind blew through the trees. Lightning streaked across the sky, time and again, lighting up the whole scene for a split second each time.\n\nI stood transfixed, captivated by the power and violence of the storm. It was beautiful, scary and magnificent at the same time. I felt I had to be part of it, to be at one with nature.\n\nI ran out and stood in the middle of the storm, reveling in the stinging rain and chilling wind, thrilling to the sounds of the thunder and the crashing waves, and relishing the magnificence of nature."

Cuckoo!...\" the cuckoo clock on the wall of my office called five times.\n\"Yes!\" I shouted in my head. \"Time to pack up!\".\n\nI straightened my stiff back and neck, the result of hours of hunching over documents and surveyed the whole noise-polluted room. Andrew was yelling at Mac for throwing a paper plane at him; Mandy and Lily were chatting animatedly, undoubtedly about clothes or make-up; Jay and Rayne were chatting up Sarah, the new clerk, probably trying to get her to go for a drink; and Cynthia was doing the waltz in her three-inch heels, heading out the door.\n\nWith a grunt, I pushed my chair back, heaved myself up, started stuffing things into my briefcase and my huge handbag. I couldn't wait to get home.\n\nAs I stepped out through the glass doors of the air-conditioned building, a blast of hot, humid air slammed me full in the face, stunning me for a few seconds. Then I continued towards the bus stop. I groaned\naloud when I saw the hordes of people gathered there and regretted leaving my car at home. Sigh! I had no choice but to join the crowd.\n\nBuses came and left. Every time it was the same anxious craning to read the bus number above the heads of the crowd. Then, there was the rushing and jostling as I tried to force my puny frame through the\nmasses of burly men and women. I was ready to perish amidst the petrol fumes and the stink of stale sweat when I finally managed to squeeze my right foot onto a bus step. Then, up I went, forced by the\npushing crowd into the packed bus.\n\nFeeling woozy and yet hyped up, I searched for a seat. No way! They were all definitely occupied. I grabbed hold of a strap and tried to stand firmly Every time the bus lurched forward, we would all sway\nbackwards. The bus hurtled on, careening madly round corners, only to stop with a sudden jolt. I was crushed on all sides, and had my toes trod on several times.\n\nThen, we got caught in a massive traffic jam. Cars, buses and motorcycles around us kept up a constant honking. The burning rays of the sun stoked up the oven which our bus had now become. I became nauseous and thought many times about getting off. Yet, I was too tired to walk home. Inch by inch we moved and one and a half hours later, I finally arrived at my stop, which, thankfully, was just in front of\nmy flat. I shoved my way out, my strict upbringing forcing me to mutter a few insincere \"Excuse-me's\".\n\nI dragged my body up the flights of stairs to my second-floor flat. I did not even bother to try the elevator as I knew I would be competing with a crowd of thirty or more residents. Finally, I reached my door\nand, after a little fumbling for my keys, I entered my apartment. With a sigh of utmost relief, I dropped my briefcase and handbag on the floor, turned on the television and collapsed on the couch. \"All in\na day's work, my girl!\" I told myself, and gazed with unseeing eyes at the television."

        "content": "Thousands and thousands of acres of lush rain forests are cleared each year to make way for development. The once beautiful and spectacular forests are reduced to barren landscapes. This is for the sake of development, for the advancement of man.\nYet, what happens when trees are felled? Firstly, the earth is left vulnerable to soil erosion. The heavy tropical rains will carry away the rich topsoil, and the land without its topsoil will no longer be fertile. Slowly but steadily, the lush vegetation will give way to wasteland.\n\nSecondly, the flowing water will not only wash away the topsoil but will deposit it in the rivers. As a result, the rivers will become shallower. Consequently, floods will become frequent in the area. Thousands of people will suffer in these floods.\n\nAnother point to note is that forests are home to hundreds of species of flora and fauna. Animals and plants live in symbiotic relationships in the balance of nature. Man destroys this balance when he flattens the forests to the ground. Where do they go then, the great and tiny inhabitants of these forests? Nowhere. They die. If this goes on, the food chain will be disrupted. As creatures dependent on the food chain, man is ultimately destroying his own sources of food through the destruction of rain forests.\n\nWhen forests are a distant memory, a shocking fact will hit us full force. Mankind will be thrown into a state of unimaginable suffering and agony. What I am talking about is the lack of oxygen. While cutting down a tree to add yet another piece of luxurious furniture to Man's already opulent lifestyle, people forget that they are also cutting down our supply of oxygen.\n\nTrees absorb the carbon dioxide breathed out by living creatures, reprocess it and, in the end, produce the life-sustaining oxygen. Without trees, where will this oxygen come from? Will we process it in factories? Will a time come when man will be fighting for the very air he breathes?\n\nFurthermore, the excessive carbon dioxide will also effect a change in the micro-climate and raise the region's temperature. There will be a greenhouse effect on earth; warm air and radiation will be trapped under the earth's atmosphere. Then, as the earth's temperature rises, the ice in the polar caps will melt, raising the sea level. Great floods will hit the lower-lying areas.\n\nAs you can see, it is a vicious cycle. A change in our environment will trigger off another change which will trigger off yet another. This is why we. should keep the balance of nature. This is why we ought to preserve our forests. This is why environmentalist groups are pressurizing governments to reduce the felling of trees and the clearing of forests and to be serious about replanting forests.\n\nWith the support of ordinary citizens like you and me, they will get the attention of the people in power. We can also help by planting trees. Members of this beautiful planet must be united. By preserving our forests, we are preserving ourselves."

        "content": "If you were to see the number of suggestion slips stuffed into my school's Suggestion Box, you would be shocked. Granted, some of the suggestions are rubbish but I do agree with many of them. There are many ways in which my school could be improved, many weaknesses that need seeing to.\nFirstly, and most importantly, teachers in all schools should realize that they are responsible for their students' future. This is especially true for children from less affluent homes who cannot afford to supplement the school's teaching with extra tuition. Teachers should not shirk their responsibilities towards their students.\n\nI am emphasizing this point because some teachers do not seem to feel the slightest obligation to do their job well nor the slightest feeling of guilt when their students fail in the examinations. In fact, in my school, teachers are sometimes found sipping coffee or even having a snack in the school canteen when they are supposed to be in class teaching.\n\nOf course, there are teachers who are truly committed to their job and do deliver the goods. They stay up late into the night to finish correcting their students' work and to prepare effective lessons for their students. Some teachers will even devote Saturday mornings to conducting extra-curricular activities, such as the Scouts movement. Now, if only all teachers were like this!\n\nFurthermore, wouldn't the school be a much better place to spend our adolescence if we did not have to cope with teachers who vent their foul moods on us? We should not have to walk on eggshells because our teacher has had a bad day.\n\nAnother aspect of the school that needs changing is the set of school rules. Some are so irrational or petty! Take, for example, the rule on short hair for boys. What is the rationale behind this? Do the people in authority believe that everyone with long hair will turn out to be a thug or a villain? Well, look at Hitler: he had very short hair and he almost caused the extinction of the entire Jewish race!\n\nOn the other hand, punishments for serious acts of indiscipline should be made more effective, even if they have to be harsher. These days, students may get away with only a warning or a \"booking\" for offences such as breaking the school's tables, chairs and even doors. I strongly feel that these vandals should be made to pay for what they have destroyed.\n\nFurthermore, I feel that criminal action should be taken against students who beat people up, or threaten to do so, to extort money from them. If you behave like a criminal, you should be treated like one.\n\nAnother area that needs reform is the school curriculum. One major problem is the subject called \"Moral Education\". You just cannot learn good morals the way you learn any other academic subject, memorizing facts for examinations. Good morals have to be internalized. So, \"Moral Education\" should either be taken off the school curriculum after primary school or changed to emphasize practical application rather than \"head knowledge\".\n\nOur school hours take up a large portion of our day. Let us spend these hours usefully, in a secure, caring, fun-filled atmosphere. Our school years take up a large proportion of our lives. This is the time that we are molded, intellectually and morally. Help us to grow into worthy citizens of our nation."

        "content": "I climb into the cockpit and sit myself down on the metal seat of the F-16 \"Falcon\", one of the best supersonic planes ever invented. I run a routine check on all the aircraft's dials and gauges as well as the weapon systems through the heads-up display.\nThe sergeant gives me the thumbs-up sign from the far run way, indicating that all the external parts of the plane are in order and functioning well. I return the gesture to indicate that all internal systems are working well and that I will be taking off.\n\nI flick the start button and feel the soft vibration begin. I hear the hum of pure power. Pushing the throttle to three quarters, I feel the acceleration of the plane taxiing off the runway and into the air ... .\n\nI have always aspired to be a fighter pilot. My dream began when I was about seven years old. One day, my uncle took me for a ride in his private plane. It was a momentous experience for me! Soaring freely in the sky, high above the rest of civilization, I knew that I would never want to do anything as much as I wanted to fly.\n\nAs I grew older, I began to read books on aviation and air adventures. I was especially fascinated with accounts of air battles. Biggles was my hero above all other heroes. Thus, my ambition narrowed from just wanting to fly a plane to becoming a fighter pilot. The thought of scudding through the sky with the ability to defy gravity with a multi-million dollar piece of machinery and patriotic fervor excited my soul.\n\nThe requirements for fighter pilot candidates are many and difficult to fulfill. Among them are academic excellence, perfect eyesight, a fit body, quick reflexes and the ability to stay cool under pressure. Well, I have never been the kind of person to leave things to chance: I am constantly aware of the need to work towards my goals.\n\nThus, throughout my childhood years, into adolescence and up till now, I have always made time for exercise. I play games regularly, run ten kilometers a day and work out in the gym at least three times a week. It is crucial for a fighter pilot to be fighting fit. He must be able to withstand the high and low g's when piloting a jet at high speed.\n\nI have always been conscious of the need to preserve the perfect eyesight that God has blessed me with. So, I have always curtailed my hours of television-viewing. When I do watch television, I make sure I sit a good four meters away from the screen. I have always been careful to read only in well-lit areas. In addition, I watch my diet, eating food rich in vitamin A, which is essential for healthy eyes.\n\nIn school, I never stint on my study times. I made sure I qualified for the science stream in High School, as a pilot must have a good understanding of physics and mathematics. My hard work has paid off and I have been topping the class in these subjects. I have just sat for the O levels. The results will not be out for months but I feel confident that I have done well. Next year, I plan to do my A levels. And after that, I shall enlist in the US Air Force.\n\nThere is not much longer to wait. My dream is almost within my grasp. I pray with all my heart that it will become a reality and not remain just another of my boyish fantasies."

        "content": "\"Mr. Chairman, honorable judges, misguided members of the opposition, and members of the floor: Good day to all.\n\"Standing here today on this breezy morning as the third speaker for the proposition, I wish to continue where my team-mates left off to correct the misleading information presented by the opposition.\n\n\"For instance, the second member of the opposition claimed that the youngest child will be treated more leniently than the others. Now, is this an advantage? By being treated too leniently, the child might think that his misbehavior is perfectly acceptable. Ever heard of the expression \"Spare the rod and spoil the child\"? It is true. Without strict and loving discipline, a beloved child might end up being the black sheep of the family. Now, the opposition contends that it is an advantage to be spoilt in this way. How can this be?\n\n\"The opposition has also pointed out that the youngest child is usually more pampered. I agree. But, again, is this good? It is indeed enjoyable to be fussed over, pampered and mollycoddled but what will this pampered child grow into? It is a maxim that too much or too little is no good: Once a pampered child grows up, he will be overly dependent on others, in other words, spineless. Would you like to be this spineless adult? I leave you to decide.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, having straightened out a few delusions of the opposition, I shall present my own points. One of the advantages of being an eldest child is that he is used to being respected and obeyed by his siblings. This is because they know he is wiser and more experienced. This is a good feeling and it creates high self-esteem. This self-esteem will motivate him to succeed in every aspect of life.\n\n\"Undeniably, the eldest child will shoulder more responsibilities. He will often be left in charge of the younger ones. The eldest child is also cast as a role model for the younger ones. Thus, he has to try harder to maintain discipline and a high standard of behavior.\n\n\"The eldest child, having to cope with his siblings' antics, will also develop patience. He may have to give in to his siblings because `they are too young to understand'. Thus, he develops tolerance and understanding of other people's weaknesses.\n\n\"All these points were described as 'disadvantages' by the opposition. They are only disadvantageous if you are unable to see the long-term benefits. You see, these momentarily trying circumstances will shape the child and prepare him for the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Home Ministry, an average of 3 out of 5 successful people -- corporate leaders, lawyers, politicians -- were the eldest children in their families.\n\"On to my next point, which centers on the word 'privileges'. In most cases, the eldest child will inherit the greater share of the wealth. According to Chinese custom, the eldest son carries on the family name, therefore he deserves a larger share of the property. In monarchies, the eldest child is the heir to the throne, as in the case of Prince Charles. If you think that the eldest child is only privileged if he belongs to a wealthy family, you are wrong. The distinction is even sharper in poor families where the eldest child may be the only one whom the family can afford to educate or feed properly.\n\n\"So, there you have it. Clear arguments to demolish the opposition to this motion. And now I hand over to my opponents, to give the sensible ones amongst them a chance to start defecting over to our side. Thank you.\""

        "title": "Should our school examination system be abolished ? Give reasons for your stand.",
        "content": "From primary school to the end of their tertiary education, students face the daunting task of preparing for examinations every single year. So much time and emotion is poured into preparing for examinations.\nAdvocates of the system contend that annual examinations are a good way of training children for the stress of life after school - where deadlines and sales quotas need to be met, and work completed methodically and with minimum fuss.\n\nGovernment examinations are also said to be the necessary yardstick for measuring the capability of each person for further education or employment.\n\nYet, are examinations an accurate yardstick? A person's true abilities may not be shown by written examinations. Take Winston Churchill, for example. He was a school dropout and yet he became one of England's greatest statesmen, a national savior in World War II. Clearly, some talents and forms of ingenuity go undetected in examinations.\n\nAnother problem related to our system of examinations is that teachers become too \"exam-orientated\". They race through the syllabus so that they can cover everything in it in time for the examinations regardless of whether their students have understood the material. The weaker students often end up the victims in this race -- they are left far behind the rest of the class. They become more and more discouraged as they understand less and less of the lessons, to the point that they hardly care if they pass or fail. Sadly, this attitude will be carried with them into adult life.\n\nWhat about the \"swots\"? Well, speaking as one, I confess that I often wonder whether it is worth it. We rush from one tuition class to another and we spend most of our time studying for tests and examinations, or doing our homework. All through the school semester, we only have one thought in mind: to excel in the examinations. Is this really living?\n\nA related point is that some students are so occupied with their studies that they do not develop their potential in other fields. It is true that there are many clubs and societies in the school. However, many students just do not have the time to make full use of these extracurricular activities. They have to study, study, study. So, our emphasis on examinations is indirectly producing people who are only trained to study and reproduce facts rather than well-rounded individuals.\nIn conclusion, while I realize that it will be impossible to do away with all examinations, I feel that they should be given less importance within the school system. For example, instead of basing entry qualifications on one examination, students should also be evaluated through the cumulative marks of tests and assignments. Furthermore educationists, employers, parents and the students themselves should always be reminded that the results of examinations are not equal to the sum of the net worth of the individual."

        "content": "About two months ago, our Education Minister brought up the subject of school toilets. He suggested that cleaning these toilets should be part of the school curriculum. The public reaction to this issue was so strong that people have been flooding the mass media with opinions for and against his suggestion.\nOne of the reasons the Education Minister gave for his proposal was that cleaning toilets will teach students humility and respect for others. Firstly, the students will be able to understand the humility of the school workers when they have to clear up other people's messes in the toilets. This job is looked down upon and considered one of the lowest. \"They will also be able to respect the cleaners because he is able to do the necessary job, regardless of the low status it accords him. Another advantage of this proposal is that the students will try to keep the toilets cleaner as their friends will be the ones forced to clean up any mess they create.\n\nOn the other hand, there are countless reasons for me to be apprehensive about this proposal for making toilet cleaning part of the school curriculum. Firstly, which student in his right mind would be happy about having to clean a toilet? Most school toilets are dark, dirty and smelly. Cleaning them will be most unpleasant.\n\nFurthermore, a spell of cleaning toilets will certainly be a blow to their ego. Of course, in a wholly girls' or boys' school it would not be so humiliating. However, if it were a co-ed school, the male ego would certainly suffer a lot of pain. Imagine girls laughing and teasing a guy who is forced to clean toilets. Some egoistic guy will create havoc in retaliation!\n\nThen, there is the consideration that most students are playful, anyway. Imagine them expressing their playful nature in the toilets. Other than the fact that excessive water is sure to be splashed all over the place, the students may slip and fall in their merriment. More ill-behaved ones may even purposely push each other into the toilet bowls.\n\nOne other possibility that cannot be excluded is that students may be so turned off at the thought of toilet cleaning that they may decide to skip school on the days that it is their turn to learn this skill. Thus, the teachers of other subjects may find it hard to complete the syllabus, due to the rise in absenteeism.\nIn conclusion, I feel that the Ministry of Education should really ponder on this issue carefully. Frankly, I do not agree at all that cleaning toilets should be part of the school curriculum. Actually, jobs like toilet cleaning make one think of prison camps, where the inmates are forced to do humiliating chores. School is supposed to be a place where young people can imbibe knowledge and good values in a pleasant, enjoyable atmosphere. It is important that young people actually like to come to school."

        "content": "\"Mr. Chairman, honorable judges, my most worthy opponents and everyone else present here today. Good afternoon. Before I begin on my main points, I would like to express my disagreement with one of the points expressed by the proposition team.\n\"The second speaker for the proposition said that advertisements cause people to keep buying low-quality goods. Now, I feel that people generally are not so naive. Even the members of the proposition team have been able to note the various tricks and so-called brain washing maneuver. So, the tricks haven't worked, have they? Actually, few of the usual purchases that we buy are heavily advertised on television or anywhere else for that matter. For example, do you choose the most highly advertised tissue paper or toilet paper? At most, we would try a much advertised product only because it was something new. Take the Cherry Coke advertisements. Its advertising mode probably fits all the descriptions made by the proposition team member. However, how many of us were so influenced by these advertisements that he or she has started to drink the beverage weekly, or even monthly?\n\n\"Now for my first point, I would like to state the benefits of advertisements from the economic side. Advertisements can help companies to introduce their latest products to the market. If the companies are not able to inform the public about their new products, they will not have the confidence to try to produce it. It is undeniable that advertisements play a crucial role in increasing a company's sales. This may sound capitalistic, but we must remember the importance of these factories to the nation. With the increase in sales, the company can afford to give better pay to the workers and offer more jobs.\n\n\"Now, another point is that it is only with proper circulation of the products made possible by advertising that the companies are able to mass-produce their products. Mass production is more economical and allows the producers to lower the price of these goods! As a result, consumers can purchase these goods at reasonable prices. As you can see, millions of consumers benefit because of advertisements.\n\n\"Thirdly, industries can also greatly contribute to the expansion of a company from regional to international status. Let me give a real example. One man started a small and humble cottage industry of jeans-making. Because of its increasing popularity through advertising, this industry gradually weaved its way into the market until it started to prosper. From a cottage industry, this industry grew into an international company known by both the young and old. The name of this brand of jeans is none other than Levi's. This company was able to grow due to advertisements, creating job opportunities for millions of people, not only in America but also in Levi's factories in Indonesia, the Philippines and other third world countries.\n\n\"Fourthly, advertisements of the latest technology and inventions are also beneficial for the consumers, for it means they can find the right kind of product for themselves easily and quickly. Here is another real-life case. My grandmother used to have too many lizards crawling around her house and she is paranoid about them. Then, one day, she saw the advertisement for a lizard spray that can paralyze lizards temporarily. End of lizard problem. How could my dear grandma have found out about such a strange but useful product without advertisements? Jokes aside, through reading the advertisements in newspapers or magazines, many people find just the product required to take care of their particular problem. Estate managers can find out about the right fertilizer or pesticide; computer owners can find the best software; doctors can find out about the latest medications. Imagine all the bother one must go through to find out the product one needs amongst the rapidly expanding array of products and inventions available, without advertisements. Why, one would have to phone just about every shop in town! Nowadays, we can just flip open a newspaper or even the Yellow Pages. See how advertisements have been such a blessing!\n\n\"I rest my case. Thank you.\""

        "content": "\"I would like to share my thoughts with you on a subject that has always been close to my heart, that is, whether men should be house-husbands. You see, as a member of the male sex I feel guilty. I feel that man has always dominated, or should I say, bullied, the fairer sex. Women have long been downtrodden and forced to mind the house.\n\"There was a very good reason for this in ancient times. Eking out a living then consisted mainly of running around with a club or spear, hunting deer, moose, or dinosaurs. However, now that we're approaching the year 2000, there has been a vast change. Bringing home the bacon in modern times needs intelligence and sensible thinking. And, as we all know, women can and do think as sensibly and intelligently as men.\n\n\"Thus, more and more women now qualify as doctors, lawyers and scientists. So, then, who will stay at home to take care of the children? Usually in cases where the mother works, the children are left in daycare centers. This is not healthy. Children need parental care. So, what often happens is that the wife has to quit her job. Is this fair? Not really. The men should be given the duty to mind the house occasionally, especially when the wife has better qualifications.\n\n\"Some people doubt that a man can manage a household. You see, the women have been doing it for centuries. People have thus come to the conclusion that it is the woman's duty to mind the home and it shall be her role forever.\n\n\"Actually, men are perfectly capable of performing domestic chores and minding children. And, as fathers, men can give the affection and care that the children need. And that's what really counts.\n\n\"Personally, if my wife insists on being the breadwinner, I will be relieved of the stress of running in the rat race. I could even play golf every morning while the kids are at school. What's so bad about that? So, let's give the women the chance to work at those jobs that they've always wanted, while we men opt for more 'relaxed' lifestyles. And, who knows, perhaps the country would be run better. After all, looking at the current state of the world, what with wars, famines and nuclear weapons, perhaps we men should just stay at home to mind the house and let the women run the world!\""

        "content": "No man is an island. Everyone depends on his friends to a certain extent. Ever since man formed a system of verbal communication, all people have been in constant chatter with one another. Relationships are important to man, so much that people may shape their entire lifestyles simply to find favor with their clique or circle of friends. Therefore, much caution must be applied when dealing with our friends, especially in our speech. So then, must we always tell our friends the whole truth and nothing but the truth or is it sometimes simply none of their business?\nOne thing is clear: finding out that your friend has lied to you always hurts. In cases where lies have been told to hurt you or other parties on purpose, the friendship will never be the same. If the lie caused you great damage, the friendship will not be salvageable. Who would want a treacherous person for a friend? Yet, even when the matter is not of great importance, little lies can lead to the spoiling of relationships. I have a friend who often tells little untruths. Sometimes, he exaggerates circumstances a little, just to impress others, sometimes he tells half-truths to get out of trouble, sometimes, he makes up stories just to entertain his friends. Personally, I just do not feel comfortable with him. You see, I just never know whether he is telling the truth or one more of his little lies.\n\nApart from the question of maintaining credibility, sharing one's problems and joys with a friend can also be helpful as we deal with the problems of daily living. As the saying goes, shared joy is double the joy and shared sorrow is half the sorrow. Sharing the good times can brighten up a friend's day if he feels down. Sharing one's problems and despairs with a friend will bring forth the encouragement and advice we need to hear. Sometimes simply having an ear to hear our heart's cries and knowing that someone understands us will make us feel better. People have been saved from suicide just by having a friend to listen to their troubles.\n\nIt is clear, then, that some things need to be said to our friends without any twisting of the truth. However, there are times when telling a friend too much can also lead to problems. An all-too-common example of such a time is when one hears rumors. Gossip can start simply because someone thought a rumor was true and shared all her thoughts on the rumor with a friend. The friend, who actually had no real knowledge of the matter, passed all her thoughts and ideas to another friend and so on and so forth. The final result can be a mangled product which could really hurt the parties involved. The thing to do about rumors is not to spread them, even if you have strong opinions, about them.\n\nAnother noteworthy fact is that sometimes, telling the truth may be worse than saying nothing. If an ugly girl with an inferiority complex were to ask you if she was unattractive, it would be a very bad idea to tell her just how unattractive she was. One must use his discretion in such situations, stressing on her good qualities, of course. Telling the whole truth in this case would destroy her remaining shreds of confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel that friends, even the closest of friends, need not tell each other everything they know or feel. Some matters, of course, should be discussed with friends, while some others should be hidden. We have to balance our love for truth with the practicalities of the situation. Not being perfect, we are bound to make mistakes, of course. So, one must then be prepared to make up with our friends, apologizing for our verbal blunders and forgiving them for theirs. Well, that's what friendship is really about -- accepting people for what they are, imperfections and all."

        "title": "\"The Golden Age of Youth\". How true is this description of your life as a youth ?",
        "content": "\"The Golden Age of Youth\"? Who coined up that expression? I am certainly not experiencing \"golden\" days in my life as a youth. Furthermore, many of my friends' complaints seem to attest that their experiences of youth roughly match up with mine, that is, life as a youth is tough!\nFirstly, being young automatically means that I have limited knowledge and no job skills, which means that no one will employ me for any worthwhile job. This means, clearly and simply, \"No Independent Income\". Now, it is undeniable that without money, you become severely limited in your options. You cannot buy anything, go anywhere or do anything. Obviously, this is a problem for me.\n\nUnable to function without cash, I have to rely on my parents financially. Unable to buy a car, I have to rely on them for transport. Unable to buy a house, I have to rely on them for accommodation. This means, theoretically, that my parents are my Supreme Commanders. When they tell me to jump, I have to jump. In such a situation, I am deprived of the vital human right that caused the American Civil War - Freedom.\n\nSecondly, as long as you are not too old or too ill to walk, people will always be measuring you by your achievements. This is especially true for people in their youth. Parents, teachers, society and the government love to gauge us scholastically, physically, socially, morally and in whatever means they can think of. Thus, school examinations become so important that many of us will study hours on end to perform well in them.\n\nActually the pressure on us to perform well at all times is great. The pressure from our family gets stronger the older we grow. Since we started schooling, our parents have been comparing our test results with those of the children of their friends', who happen to be equally goal-orientated parents. In fact, since we were born, our parents have been comparing the ages at which we first started talking or walking, our kiddy IQ test results and such other traps for vainglory. If I were a piece of chicken, I'd consider myself \"Kentucky Fried\", not because I was \"spicy\" or \"original\" but because I have been chopped into pieces, tenderized, pressure-cooked and well-fried.\n\nThen, there is the question of romance. Practically speaking, youth is the worst time to get romantically attached, because, as was earlier explained, we lack the time and money to maintain a special boy-girl relationship.\n\nYet, during our youth, we are at our peak; physically, we are at our most attractive. Furthermore, our hormones are swinging about wildly as we mature sexually. Unfortunately, this causes us to be more prone to getting involved in romantic relationships, which leads to heartache and causes us to perform badly in our examinations. I think that the government should have chosen a better time to set all the major examinations than at this time, don't you?\n\nSo, youth is a traumatic time. It is definitely not \"golden\". In my opinion, the idea of \"The Golden Age of Youth\" must have been an illusion dreamt up by fools. Perhaps we should call it the \"Iron Pyrite (Fool's Gold) Age of Youth\"."

        "content": "Along the road from cradle to grave many of us get married. This in itself can cause more emotional disturbance than all the other events of our lives combined. Many factors make the difference between marital bliss and having \"an old ball-and-chain\" but the most important factor is probably whom we choose to marry. That is why I often meditate on the qualities I would seek in my future wife.\nTo be honest, the first thing I notice when I meet a girl is whether she is pretty or not. Long lashes and sparkling eyes do not cause someone to \"fall in love at first sight\", of course, but few people go round seeking ugly mates. I am no different.\n\nOf course, I would also prefer to have a wife who is intelligent. Some men have the stereotyped \"dumb blonde\" image of a perfect woman. However, I know my life will be enriched by having an intellectually stimulating partner to share my thoughts with, and to offer fresh insights to old situations. More importantly, a husband and wife should be intellectually matched so that they can understand each other.\n\nSports and games and other recreational activities are fun and foster closer ties. Who better to enjoy sports with than my wife? This will draw us even closer together. A wife should, after all, be a true friend whom I can have fun with and want to spend my leisure activities with. So, my ideal mate will be someone who participates in the games and sports I like or at least, be willing to learn them.\n\nOften, quarrels between husband and wife concern other family members. Your wife may be perfect but her parents may be irritating beyond comprehension. There was, for example, an incident in City Center where one man's mother-in-law came to stay. One day, she cooked and ate his pet dog for dinner! So, I always say that one's future in-laws should always be checked carefully before one makes decisions about marriage.\n\nIf you are dead tired after a long, frustrating day at work, a loving wife who comforts you and listens to your problems can really make a difference. So I would say, a sympathetic, caring kind of woman is the only one with whom I would make any commitments for marriage.\n\nCommitment is very important on her part, too. If a girl isn't prepared to be faithful to you but she marries you anyway, chances are she's going to run away and leave you one day, for your best friend, perhaps.\n\nI realize that I have listed a whole string of qualifications for my future wife. Well, if I can find all these qualities in one woman, I will really consider her The Ideal Wife. However, chances are, with a girl like that, everyone else will be trying to win her hand, too. So, I'll be in for a tough time! Furthermore, as the proverb goes, \"The best laid plans of mice and men can fail\". More than likely, I will meet a girl one day, fall in love and get married. And even though she might not be perfect, I'll love her, and, through the years, that might just be enough."

I fretted a lot and constantly demanded my mother's attention.

At odd hours of the night, I would ask for a hot drink or a cookie, or just some company.\n\n\"Mummy, stay with me!\" was my constant whine.\n\nNot once was that demand refused. Not once did my mother groan or grumble. She answered every unreasonable demand of mine with unfailing patience. My mother would put everything aside to comfort me.\n\nMy world was very small then. There was just me and Mummy. My world consisted of the feel of her cool palms soothing my brow and her floral scent as she leaned over me to tuck in my blanket. I remember her low voice, hushing me as I fretted about the pains in my joints. Most of all, I remember the look in her eyes, of deep concern for her sick child. That was how I knew my mother loved me then.\n\nMiraculously, I have outgrown my childhood ailments. Now that I am on the threshold of adulthood, my world has grown to include many exciting friends. Set free from the prison of the sickbed, I revel in the fun that the world has to offer.\n\nMy relationship with my mother has suffered from my wild pursuit of fun. She criticizes my choice of friends and tries to enforce rules and regulations to curb my activities.\n\nTwo nights ago, I stayed out way, way past my \"curfew\" hour, which is eleven o'clock. It was almost 1 a.m. when I reached my house. To make matters worse, I had been unable to call home to inform my mother that I would be delayed. There were no phones where we were \"hanging out\". I knew that I was in for it!\n\nMy mother flung open the door the minute she heard my friend's car pull in. Her face was red, sweat was pouring down her temples. My friends made a quick exit as she ranted at me, her arms waving wildly. I didn't say a word, in case one of those hands should find its mark on my face. I was ordered straight to bed.\n\nAs I got into bed, she stood in my room, still ranting at me for my disobedience and \"wild behavior\". I was tired. I just wanted to sleep. I looked up at her face to try to gauge if her scolding would be continuing much longer.\n\nThen I saw something familiar about the look in her eyes. It was the same look of concern that she had always had when I was so sick. I saw in her eyes all the fears that she had suffered that night as she waited for her daughter to return safely.\n\nThis is how I know my mother loves me now."

        "title": "How do you measure success in life?",
        "content": "Reaching the top of the tree in one's chosen occupation or profession is the usual standard by which success in life is measured, at least in the Western world. However many Asians would reject this criterion. The contemplative religions assert that success is only measurable in terms of religious advancement and of the acquisition of the virtues. Thus, success would be in inverse ratio to material advancement.\nMost of the world accepts the definition of material advancement, its objectives being affluence and perhaps power over others, both being the most important means of self-expression.\n\nSome are born into positions which already confer affluence and power, so success to them might lie merely in the preservation of the family business or estate and perhaps its enhancement for the benefit of the next generation. Most people have to work hard to to achieve success.\n\nThe western concept of success is not always satisfying and some people, at the height of their affluence and power, reject it in favor of the simple life. This happens for a variety of reasons.\n\nBeyond a certain point the acquisition of money proves unsatisfactory. The difference between the lifestyle available to a millionaire and that available to a billionaire is marginal. Unhappily money making can become an obsession, and some very wealthy people become very mean. Money also creates anxiety since it usually has to be put at risk if more is to be made. Other anxieties may be created when a large number of people become dependent on a financial empire. Money confers power which may corrupt. It is often made at the disadvantage of others, and it may damage a business man's relationships both with his peers and with his subordinates. These pressures and anxieties often have a detrimental effect on health and on family life. One's wife and children are inevitably neglected and unhappy. The children of successful capitalists or career workaholics sometimes reject everything the father or parents stand for. Success thus means failure.\n\nIt is of course possible, though unlikely, that worldly success can be combined with a sensitive and therefore successful approach to the problems outlined above. If a man or woman can achieve this then he or she truly has the right to be called successful.\n\nHowever success is not strictly related to the externals of power, prominence and affluence, though these are often its attributes. It is more to do with happiness and fulfillment. What then are its features?\n\nFirst, mental and spiritual peace. A satisfying yet balanced way of life makes for the former and a religion or at least a philosophy for the latter. The body should not be neglected; physical well-being is usually the result of good food and exercise; absence of strain is at least as important. A successful life depends crucially on good personal relationships both within and outside the family. To ensure the well-being and happiness of others forms a large part of success. Perhaps the fundamental way to achieve success is first to be sure of what you want to do with life and then to be sure that you are capable of doing it. Some people are strongly motivated to a profession or to politics or to social campaigning from early days; others have to find their own role in life by trial and error. Many of these careers will not confer much success in the worldly sense but they will lead to the success of happiness and fulfillment."

        "title": "In what circumstances is the invasion of one country by another justified?",
        "content": "Invasion is never justified if there is a possibility of resolving disputes by diplomatic means. The U.N., drawn up by the San Francisco Conference in 1945, in succession to the League of Nations exists to maintain international peace and security. Its Security Council can urge members to take economic or military sanctions, or can provide a peace-keeping force drawn from member - nations. Its powers however amount to little more than those of the old League, since the two world-power centers remain NATO and the Warsaw Pact association.\nThis having been said, invasions do occur. Recent examples include the invasion of Iraq by Iran, the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, and that of the Falkland Islands by Argentina. Motives for invasion vary; how cynical they are is a matter of opinion. There is national pride; the desire to annex territory which rightly belongs to a country but which has either become independent or has become the dependency of another. There is the instinct to expand, or not to become encircled, or to gain strategic territory, or to gain access to minerals such as oil, or to food. The naked aggression of Hitler in Europe was totally unjustified, so the Second Front invasion of Europe by the allies in 1944 can be amply justified. Sometimes, as in the case of Afghanistan, the ostensible reason was to establish a stable government in a country which, bordering on the USSR was claimed to constitute a threat through instability. That invasion was not justified.\n\nThe ground for military invasion is usually prepared by other means. If there is instability and national discontent, or even two extremist parties each claiming the government, infiltration is much easier. An actual invasion becomes a mere formality when a government accepts perhaps thousands of military advisers, massive war equipment, and no doubt extensive economic aid from one of the great powers. A physical take-over can sometimes be achieved without shedding a drop of blood. What is certain is that after such a takeover a large section of the population will remain discontented. Future troubles, as in Afghanistan, are inevitable, and lead only to further repressive measures.\n\nThe guiding principle governing the justice of invasion is surely this; do the majority of the people want such a take-over? A case in point is the invasion of the Falklands by Argentina, which country was at the time suffering internal troubles and needed a famous victory abroad. The Falklands, close at hand and regarded as an easy number, were an obvious choice, particularly since Argentina regarded the 'Malvenas' as their historic property. However, the islanders wanted to remain British, so the British armed forces had to throw the Argentines out. That particular invasion by the British was justified, particularly since, in fact, the Argentines were refusing to negotiate. However, realistically it becomes another matter to retaliate when the major powers become involved. Nobody wants to risk a full scale war for the sake of a principle. Nobody forgets Vietnam. So to invade or not to invade involves a crucial balancing of factors."

        "title": "Describe the system for maintaining law and order in your country. Can you suggest any improvements?",
        "content": "One hundred and fifty years ago a Conservative British Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, founded the modern police force. This replaced the old system of town and village constables in their local peace-keeping role under the beadle. Very quickly the new force obtained a national respect which it had never previously enjoyed, and despite a vocal left-wing and liberal minority, it retains that general respect today.\nIn case of serious trouble, behind the police force stands that section of the British Army which is home-based. It has, with reluctance, been called on in various roles during domestic emergencies. To man essential services during a general strike, or a strike of one or more of the essential services, including railways, buses, power-stations, water works, ambulance drivers and fire brigades. A less frequent role has been to quell riots and this is unpopular with the army since soldiers do not like inflicting injury or even death on fellow citizens. Examples are riots in pre-war London stirred up by the National Socialist movement, and more recently the riots in Liverpool. Birmingham and London attributed to a mixture of ethnic discrimination and unemployment. British people accept the need on occasion for this military back-up, but prefer it not to be used.\n\nToday the police are controlled by the Home Secretary, who is also responsible for that other troubled part of Britain, Northern Ireland, through the Secretary of State for Ireland. Ireland has always caused more headaches than the rest of Britain put together, and in that country the Royal Ulster Constabulary, an armed force, needs the presence of armed and equipped British troops, who are constantly called into para-military action. Opinions vary from those who advocate a 'troops out' policy, leaving Ireland to get on with a civil war, to those who would like to bring the whole of Ireland, forcibly, back into British hands. Since the Irish Free State came into existence in 1922, and before then, during the First World War Southern Ireland has tended to side with the enemies of Britain.\n\nThe county police forces of the rest of Britain are controlled by chief constables responsible to the Home Secretary, and the Metropolitan Police Force by a commissioner, also responsible to the Home Secretary. Because of crime increase, and the modern mobility of criminals there is more co-operation between these separate forces than before, and often, when the ramifications of crime cover a large area, joint operational headquarters are set up, their work being aided by data banks in a nationwide computer system.\n\nApart from straightforward crime, the situation is further complicated today by crime in a new guise i.e.. political violence, mostly in London. This often consists of a group of extremists from one foreign country attacking the embassy of another, and trying to buy publicity or political advantage with threats and the taking of hostages. To deal with these we now use a quiet little section of the armed forces known as the SAS just as we use a new section of the police force to quell street rioting, looting and arson, known as the SPG. So far these have not often been needed.\n\nThe traditional police force has only been armed with a whistle and a short truncheon, maintaining law and keeping order on the streets by presence rather than violence. Some of us deplore the tendency to issue firearms, but recognize that the police are at a disadvantage otherwise. Do we have to accept that the world must become more violent, meeting violence with violence, or work for a diminishing crime rate and a more peaceful and law-abiding community?\n\nIf the latter, there will need to be fundamental as well as cosmetic changes in our national life. The cosmetic changes include less policing by vehicles, and more on foot; more community policemen back on 'the beat' and knowing their area and people, and being known by them. Another will be to restore confidence in the policeman's fairness and integrity in areas where interested parties have sought to erode this confidence. Local authority police committees to monitor police activities are in the hands of anti-law and order elements, and do no good. They merely erode police morale. The fundamental changes needed go deeper. Since the motion to restore the death penalty was defeated in Parliament, a life-sentence must mean what it says. Firearm availability must be more strictly controlled. Above all children and young people should be less exposed to television and film violence, kept off drugs and alcohol, and taught, in the home, a new respect for law and order."

        "title": "Discuss the benefits of and the problems caused by the artificial damming of rivers.",
        "content": "The damming of rivers to form reservoirs was common practice in Roman times, and probably much earlier. Over the intervening centuries the practice has evolved for three main purposes; human consumption, irrigation, and industrial use. Since rainfall is never sufficiently uniform to provide a reliable water-source from normal river flow, the reservoir has always been a great boon, spanning as it does lengthy periods of drought. There are, of course, other reasons for damming a river. Following heavy storms in mountainous areas more water than a river can carry will flow down to the plain, inundating large areas often destroying crops, homes and animal and human life. Mountain passes, if dammed, give the opportunity not only to control the flow of flood water at its peak but also to retain large quantities for controlled use in dry weather. This control of water works from sea to river as well as from river to sea. An example is the recently constructed Thames barrier below Woolwich on the River Thames in England. This consists of solid pillars across the river with massive steel plates between each pillar which can be raised or lowered mechanically. The object is to protect the low-lying parts of London when a certain combination of wind and tide raises the water level by as much as thirty feet.\nA further use of the dam is to produce hydroelectric power, the power station, of course, being built below the level of the dam. Water is channeled through conduits and used as mechanical power for the turbines. It is then returned to the river. Reservoir water is also used today in vast quantities in nuclear power stations for cooling and other purposes and is similarly returned to the river or to the sea.\n\nSome rivers in their natural state arc not navigable by large vessels, or run dry in sea- sons of drought. Where such rivers can be dammed they can be given a constant depth for purposes of navigation, and this benefits a country's communication system.\n\nMore often than not a dam may be central in a multi-purpose scheme including most of the functions outlined above. This is particularly true in countries lying in temporate zones, where water shortage can be a nuisance but is rarely a disaster.\n\nMatters are different in underdeveloped countries which are hot, dry and barren. In these areas populations are often nomadic, driving flocks and herds from waterhole to waterhole, or scratching a mere subsistence from the soil. Drought means disease, hunger, dehydration and death to animals and humans alike. The damming of major rivers such as the Nile is crucial to life itself, and the control of their floodwater for irrigation purposes essential, but even this is not preventing large tracts of North East Africa from reverting to desert.\n\nPerhaps of least importance is the social value of a reservoir. Some stocked with trout, provide good fishing, and most are used by sailing clubs, and for other aquatic sports. A reservoir is also a great attraction to water-loving birds and often becomes an interesting staging-post for migrations.\n\nDamming a river can also cause problems. A great area of land, with its trees, flora and fauna, farms and houses, has to be inundated. Neither the residents, who have to resettle elsewhere, nor the environmentalists, appreciate this. The problem is more acute when the countryside about to be spoilt is environmentally unique, as in a recent case in Australia, where attempts were made to involve Prince Charles and Princess Diana in the dispute. Creating an artificial lake inevitably changes the character of a large area. Farmland is destroyed, natural scenery, in the opinion of some, despoiled. People have to move, inconveniently.\n\nA second drawback may be political. Many rivers flow through more than one country, that lying higher up the river having the whip-hand. A dam built for one country's benefit may be much to the detriment of another. The USSR has been in dispute with Turkey over this matter as has Egypt with the Sudan.\n\nDams are vulnerable to air attack in wartime. The destruction of the Mohne See dam in the Second World War brought the industry of the Ruhr to a virtual standstill, as well as causing loss of life. There have also been cases of the collapse of dams due to inadequate strength and imperfect design."

        "content": "In its mineral form sodium chloride, NaCl, is known as common salt. It is important because it is essential to the health of human beings and of animals. For domestic use it is fined down to what is known as table-salt, and small quantities of other chemicals are added to it to keep it free-flowing when in contact with the atmosphere.\nSalt and potassium are combined to produce iodised salt, used when iodine is lacking in diet. Its absence causes goitre, the swelling of the thyroid gland.\n\nLivestock as well as humans need salt, and this provided in the form of solid blocks, known as 'salt-licks'. Salt is also crucial to the food industry. It is used in meat-packing sausage-making and fish-curing both for seasoning and as a preservative. It is also used in the curing and preserving of hides and in the form of brine for refrigeration purposes.\n\nSalt is extensively used in the chemical industry; in the manufacture of baking soda, sodium bicorbonate; of caustic soda, sodium hydroxide; of hydrochloric acid, of chlorine etc. It is also used in soap-making, and in the manufacture of glaze and porcelain enamel. It also enters metallurgic processes as flux, a compound used to assist the fusing of metals.\n\nSalt lowers the melting point of water, so in combination with grit, it is used for clearing roads of snow and ice. It is also used for water-softening by means of removing calcium and magnesium compounds from tap water."

        "content": "It is difficult to grade the senses in relative importance to mankind. Opinions vary particularly between sight and hearing. A person blind from birth has no concept of vision, so presumably does not `miss' sight. It is different for a person who goes blind because suddenly, or gradually, so much is lost; personal independence to a large degree, driving a car, reading and watching television, enjoyment of all forms of visual beauty. Some of these deprivations can be partially overcome. The loss of sight tends to train a more acute hearing. People will always help the blind in practical ways, and there are many modern aids for the visually handicapped, ranging from braille and books on tape to all kinds of domestic appliances designed for the sightless. Musical appreciation and music making are also open to the blind. Many blind people would grade vision as less important than hearing, since, given help and their own determination, they can live a relatively full life. The obvious drawback to deafness lies in loss of communication, though today there are some marvelous machines which allow the sufferer to learn speech through varied frequencies of vibration. The traditional method of lip-reading supplements this, so that conversation and teaching can be carried out. The social disadvantage of deafness is that of the impatience of others.\nDeafness is not at once obvious and so may be mistaken for stupidity. In the modern world deafness can also be dangerous; traffic-sense, particularly in children, depends largely on hearing. Touch, taste and smell are all sources of pleasure, the two latter being important in the enjoyment of food, but they are all relatively dispensable. Their absence can, however be dangerous; the loss of nerve endings can lead to severe domestic burns and abrasions, while taste and smell can detect lethal gases and poisonous substances.\n\nFrom the human point of view most people would grade the importance of the senses in the order given in the question. This is not necessarily so in the animal world. Smell or scent is of crucial importance to many animals, who rely on it to detect enemies and to find quarry. Thus it becomes far more highly developed than in humans, since survival may depend on it. For the same reason hearing is of nearly the same importance. The hearing range of animals is much wider than that of humans. Dogs can hear supersonic sounds and react to them at great distances. Many animals have very limited vision, simply because vision is relatively unimportant. Touch and taste are also of less importance to animals than to humans, though, as with humans, these two senses, combined with smell, have a protective role in warning them off obnoxious and poisonous organic and inorganic substances.\n\nNobody can ask an animal to grade the importance of the senses, but it seems to be, smell, hearing, sight, touch and taste in that order."

        "content": "Pure science is the investigation of natural phenomena for the purpose of understanding. Observation leads to the formation of theories, which are tested experimentally. If the theory seems to explain to all the phenomena it is classified as a principle and added to the store of existing scientific knowledge. Applied science is known today as technology, which is concerned with techniques. As pure scientific knowledge advances, so does technology or method. Since method depends on knowledge, no improvements in method can increase knowledge, though they can facilitate the increase of knowledge.\nThe historian of pure science can trace its advance from the records of the earliest recorded cultures to the 20th century, during which pure science has made greater advances than ever before.\n\n6th to 7th Centuries B.C. Thales and his school. Pythaggoeras and his successors provided the first systematic method of understanding the natural world, especially in the field of Mathematics and geometry. Figures were constructed to provide proofs. The Egyptians, though less interested in strict accuracy, made their contribution, as did the Arabians and Indians in the field of arithmetical notation.\n\n17th Century. The second upsurge of pure science began with Galileo and his predecessor, Copernicus, who gave the world its first true understanding of the universe. Astronomy and Mathematics were brought together for the purposes of navigation. Francis Bacon sought to produce a system to replace that of Aristotle. The logical approach of Renee Descartes was of great importance, though the greatest advances were made by Sir Isaac Newton, who synthesized many theories into an intelligible whole.\n\nLater advances took place in the field of biology, bacteriology, surgery, anthropology. The names of Pasteur, Lister, Darwin and Harvey come to mind.\n\nIn the present century, atomic theory with all its consequences, was developed (Dalton), and the new theories of light, relativity and quantum mathematics. (Einstein).\n\nAlthough applied science will always remain the handmaid of pure science, it is also true that the advanced machines made possible by higher technology, enable the advance of pure science. Thus, although theory produced the telescope and the microscope as optical research instruments, electronics transformed both. The fact that we can now see into the far universe and into the construction of matter has had a profound effect on the theories concerning both.\n\nAnother example of many is the modern computer. While this remains the servant of the brain which invented it, one of its uses is to make a multitude of instantaneous calculations. This in turn eliminates the laborious mechanical aspects of investigation and gives the researcher the tools for making rapid new discoveries."

        "content": "Answers to this question will vary widely according to the country concerned. For example romantic feature films seem to receive great popular support in India, and their stars are almost national heroes. This may be due to the lack of good, or indeed any television, combined with the instinct to escape from a deprived environment.\nIn the West the film has not been the major entertainment medium for over twenty years. Almost every home contains a television set and much of what is left of the British film industry is concerned with film-making for this medium. Film stars in the old sense no longer exist. The great days of Hollywood ended with the last war. No longer do families make a weekly outing to the cinema. Today there are less than twenty films showing in the West End of London. In the 30s any provincial town could offer more than this. Today most cinemas have long since become Bingo halls.\n\nHowever the film industry, though small, is alive on both sides of the Atlantic, and when a good film is made there is still a following, and an excellent film can still make a lot of money. Another point in its favor is that the quality of television is deteriorating and seems likely to become atrocious when cable television is introduced. There will be even more space for rubbish and repeats.\n\nDuring the past twenty or so years much has changed in the taste of film goers. For one thing the cinema of today is the virtual monopoly of young people, unless a film such as 'Gandhi' with wide general appeal is put on. Deliberate attempts to entertain the teenager have produced many films with the accent on explicit sex and violence, though more recently such productions have moved into the 'video nasty' area. However the government is trying to prevent the sale of such cassettes for use in home television sets.\n\nOne 'clean' though juvenile taste which is fairly new is for space fiction films. 'Star Wars' and 'E.T.' are recent examples of overwhelmingly successful productions. 'The Return of the Jedi' is currently showing in London's West End.\n\nThere is no doubt that current popular taste rejects films which set out to be amusing. The days of 'Doctor in the House', of situation comedies, of films built round 'stand-up' comics such as Arthur Askey, have gone forever. They now form part of the television menu as repeats."

        "content": "Pop music began in 1960, suddenly replacing dance music, jazz and the tuneful lyricists such as Crosby, Sinatra and their imitators.\nPrior to 1960 young people were either adolescents or young adults, but then the 13-19 year group became a new class, the teenagers. They were the fashionable group, and at that time of full employment in the USA and the UK, the group with the spare money, since they had high wages and few outgoings. Thus they became the market for the pop industry.\n\nParental discipline, school rules and wartime restrictions had hitherto kept this age group in place. Now, in 1960 their instinct was to break loose, become totally independent, discard the society which produced them and ignore its social sanctions. They succeeded, aided by two groups of cynical adults; the money-makers and the drug pushers. Left-wing activists provided a third group.\n\nThe music began with 'skiffle'; the drummer, the electric guitar, the vocalist, but this quickly changed to rock n roll, with Elvis Presley as its afficionado, and his titles such as 'Rock around the clock' reaching international heights of popularity among teenagers. The focus became the star rather than the group. In Liverpool a group of four fresh-faced tidy young men with neat hair, began to produce original themes which reflected the innermost feelings of teenagers; calf-love, loneliness, insecurity, 'doing one' own thing', the misunderstanding of the adult world and a few curiously alien themes. 'Beatlemania' swept Britain and many other countries. But the sinister initial letters of 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' suggested the drug scene. The Beatles made millions, but millions more for their promoters. The world knows about the end of Presley, who has now become a cult figure.\n\nThe pop cult grew in the late 60's and early 70's into a major industry. This was the heyday of the top twenty; getting into this ensured rich rewards. Successful single makers cut LPs. Those selling over a million records entered the golden disc bracket; large country houses, Rolls-Royce motor cars, yachts, world-wide travel spread before the eyes of young hopefuls. And because a few made it, everybody tried, whether they really had talent or not. The money, the fame, the adulation proved irresistable.\n\nThe real money was made in the industry associated with the stars. For many years Carnaby Street set teenage clothing fashions, and, although Carnaby Street is no longer the centre, the denim jeans, and T shirt uniform has persisted. Perhaps the biggest money was made by pop concert and festival promoters. From time to time these festivals have caused trouble because of noise, litter, insanitary camp conditions and drug abuse. The problem has abated because of careful police monitoring.\n\nHowever the deepest effect of the pop scene on affluent young society was upon teenage attitudes to life. The establishment, by which is meant regular hours, hard work, morality, a worthwhile job and, in general, a sense of responsibility, was condemned as square. There is no doubt that the pop scene was orchestrated and manipulated by cynical adults, some of whom were villains. It has taken massive youth unemployment in England to destroy the pop market, and while there is still money in it for the few it is no longer possible today to buy an electric guitar and make your fortune in a month.\n\nMusically, pop stars never had the slightest influence in the real world, though in the old days they made more money than the virtuosi.\n\nToday the euphoria has largely gone, and with it the acclaim and the overnight fortunes. Perhaps the twenty years or so of pop fever provided a safely valve for the young who were none the worse for it providing they kept out of drugs and crime, unless one counts the partial deafness which results from long hours in a discotheque."

        "title": "What, if anything, have the great empires of the world achieved?",
        "content": "Self-interest, in some shape or form, has always been the motivation behind empire-building. Its occasion has been the development of military and naval power and in recent times air power, as in the case of Germany under Adolf Hitler, who sought to create an Aryan empire by the invasion of surrounding sovereign states. Its effects are interpreted variously, for obvious reasons. The course of history itself has always had something to say about aggression. Hitler's failure, for example, brought the democratic institutions of Western Europe into focus and laid the foundations of the European Community. The war also broke down social barriers, heightened the social consciences of the Western states, and accelerated the decolonization process of the European empires, especially that of Great Britain. Yet it also began the polarization of East and West, headed by the USSR and the USA respectively, and with the build-up of nuclear arsenals this poses in 1984 an even greater threat than that of Adolf Hitler in 1939.\nSelf-interest needs definition. To consider the great empires of the world we need to look back 4000 years. The earliest empires were necessarily limited geographically. The Phoenecian Empire provides a good example. The seaboard of Libya, centered in the Lebanon, produced a hardy race of seafarers, the Canaanites, who established colonies in Cyprus, Carthage in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Spain. They visited the Scillies and Cornwall and circumnavigated Africa. Yet their real interest was in trade, and they exported cedar to Egypt, furniture, purple cloth and jewelry all over the Middle East, thus enriching much of the known world. Moreover they invented an alphabet which gave rise to both the Greek and Roman alphabets, and through those later empires to the alphabets of most of the European states. Their inscriptions, such as the Moabite Stone and the Siloan Tunnel inscriptions, provided invaluable points of reference in Jewish Biblical history.\n\nThe aggressive instinct, the desire for enrichment by trade, and of course the need for territorial expansion; all are natural, if self-interested motives. An agricultural community with a growing population needs more land; hence, colonization. Following the Phoenicians, The Greeks acquired most of the Mediterranean world, and, following them, the Romans, at the height of Empire, had acquired the whole of the known world including territories as far apart as Britain and the West African coast line. We are used to thinking of the Romans as cruel, oppressive and rapacious, interested mainly in exacting taxes, 'asset stripping' wherever they went.\n\nAll this is true, yet our modern dislike of the empire-concept must not blind us to the immense enrichment conferred, if only as a by-product, on their vassal states.\n\nThe city states of Greece, in the period 750 to 600 B.C., were governed by tyrants, a name meaning 'kings', but whose powers were limited by the essentially Greek concept of democracy, which was the original forerunner of the modern democratic process of the free world today. The Greeks were adventurers, traders and law-givers, and their political contribution to the Mediterranean sea-board and even to France and Egypt, is incalculable. Their trade in wine, oil and scent, wood, metal work and pottery enriched other countries. Their sculpture, and architecture has never since been equaled. Their poetry and drama have remained supreme.\n\nThe extent and duration of the Roman Empire were of course much greater. Their positive contribution to the lives of vassal states covered the whole political, legal and cultural spectrum. Roman law provided the foundation of much modern law. They also enriched the known world in the spheres of art, architecture, law, town-planning, wall painting, and civic building.\n\nNo empire lasts forever. The dissolution of even the British Empire is now virtually complete. In a world where, because of modern travel, instant communication, and the heightened concept of sovereignty of states both large and small, it is right that this should be so.\n\nMany people see the only hope for the future in a one-world concept, in which aggression is outlawed and mutual respect and co-operation fostered for the common good. The West is concerned to trade rather than to exploit, to lend money rather than exact it.\n\nThe French and Portuguese concepts of empire were, of course, doomed to failure in the modern world, basically because those countries tried to keep the concept of colonization as an extension of the home country, ultimately ruled by the central government. The post-war wind of change brought about an irony in the case of the British Empire. Government had long since devolved to the great dominions, and even the very least of the overseas possessions were encouraged to develop their own governments. Yet the worldwide process overtook the gradual process of emancipation and, as post war history has shown, with disastrous results in many cases."

        "content": "Many capital cities were founded centuries, if not millennia ago, so it is often not possible to do more than deduce the reasons for the choice of their locations. Most, though not all of these, reasons are geographical. Before the arrival of modern communications and transport, any large settlement required a location which satisfied certain requirements.\nFirstly, an area of fertile land capable of supporting a growing population. The growth of Cairo at the base of the Nile delta provides an example.\n\nSecondly the area must lend itself to the spread of housing, and the erection of public buildings. Thirdly it must be near a good water supply such as a large river, though built above flood level. Fourthly it must be well away from the earthquake belts and volcanoes. Fifthly it must be defensible against enemies. Most large cities and capitals were originally walled, though possible attack from long range artillery, from the air, and nowadays perhaps from nuclear weapons, has rendered all capitals equally vulnerable.\n\nCapitals must have been located with these basic requirements in mind, though the origins of older ones are lost in tradition and folklore. London consisted of British settlements in pre-Roman times in a very defensible position which is now the city, the inner square mile. The Thames, England's largest river, not only communicates with the centre of the country but also provides deep water moorings for seagoing vessels.\n\nMore often than not, capital city locations were chosen at or near river-mouths for these reasons, with facilities for trade, both inland and overseas, very much in mind. South America contains a host of examples; Caracus, Venezuela, George Town, Guyana, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Santiago, Chile which is inland but has easy access to Valparaiso, which is on the coast; Lima near the Peruvian coast; Bogota, Colombia. To these could be added Johore Bahru, whence inland products were exported; rubber, tin, copra and pineapples. In a country covered by impenetrable rain forests and mountain ranges, rivers provide the only means of communication, both for trade and for political purposes.\n\nAnother factor rendering the seaboard popular was that of convenience to those countries which sought to colonize overseas. Conversely, some capitals became established because of foreign colonization. The U.S.A. is a case in point. Washington, the federal capital since 1800 was laid out by Pierre L'Enfant, a French engineer officer, who designed the city specifically as the center of government in 1790. He located it on the Potomac River, inland from Chesapeake Bay on the East Coast, as might be expected.\n\nThere are at least three examples of changes of capital city, made for political reasons. Peking was the capital of China from the 10th Century, the time of the Liao Dynasty. Later the seat of government moved to Nanking, but from 1421 it again became Peking. From 1928 to 1949 the capital was again Nanking and again reverted. Both Peking and Nanking which lies south of it, have easy access to the Eastern seaboard. The same thing happened in Soviet Russia. From the 14th century to the present day Moscow was the centre, excluding the period 1709 to 1918, when St. Petersburg, later Leningrad, then Stalingrad held that destination. The reason for the original choice of Moscow was that it was the gateway to the West; it was sheltered by a range of hills; it was built defensively; it satisfied all geographical conditions; it was the center of intersecting trade routes. The choice of St Petersburg was more political because although it is strategic for the Gulf of Finland and for Lake Ladoga, it nevertheless has a terrible climate and is icebound for much of the year. The fact however was that St Petersburg was the center for all revolutionary activity between 1815 and 1914. Also it is very defensible. The Germans never succeeded in entering it in the Second World War during four years of siege.\n\nIn 1960, Brazil dropped Rio de Janiero as its capital and moved inland to the newly-planned city of Brasilia, because it was felt that this would bring life to the interior. One hears that Nigeria is even now considering dropping Lagos as the capital in favor of a new town inland, though the reasons for this change are unclear.\n\nApart from geographical considerations, trade certainly affected the growth of Cairo from its early beginnings in 641 A.D. as the capital, not only of Egypt, but today of the Arab world. It has become the trading and distributive center for North Africa and the Near East.\n\nMany of the foregoing factors also apply to the building up of Bombay. Originally an island off the mid-west coast of India it is now joined to the mainland by means of reclaimed land. Its great harbor and westward facing position made it the obvious choice by the Moguls in the 13th century, who were followed by the Portuguese and in 1662 by the British."

        "title": "Consider how the transport system in your country might he improved.",
        "content": "All services are capable of improvement, even the transport services of Western Europe and other western countries, where rail, road and air transport have long been established, and where there are few, if any, obstacles to the establishment of physical communications. It is a more basic problem for the emergent countries, where often mountain ranges and dense afforestation have to be overcome. In this essay the problems of England are considered.\n\nRailways began to spread over England from about 1800, and until 1945 there existed a network which gave easy access from even the smallest village to all the main centers. Since then the system has deteriorated out of all recognition, for a variety of reasons but basically because England's constantly growing road network has shifted both passenger and goods transport away from the railways. In consequence almost all small lines have been closed down, and basically what is left is the inter-city network and London's commuter service from the home counties. Speed has improved with the adoption of the diesel motor but the experimental high-speed trains have proved a fiasco. As in most other western countries after the war the system became nationalized. High wage demands, lack of money for capital expenditure, and the general indifference of nationally unreliable, and generally unpopular, although we are constantly told that this is the age of the train, by Jimmy Savile. He is wrong. The 'age of the train' ended in 1954. Moreover British Rail makes massive annual losses, as indeed do most other European countries. Only a reversion to private ownership, as in the days of the rail system comfortable, economic and cared-for, and this is unlikely to happen. The present government is merely selling off minor assets, such as railway hotels and in some cases catering on railway platforms and in dining cars.\nThe Socialist doctrine affirms that as a national service British Rail should not expect to make a profit or break even and should be subsidized by the tax payer. The Thatcher Government sees this as bad housekeeping despite the fact that most European rail systems are already heavily subsidized. About half the population probably accepts that competitiveness is the only real way forward.\n\nGoods transport has largely moved over to the heavy, container-type lorry. In turn this involves the provision of suitable roads, and the road building program is severely limited by finance. The environmental lobby rightly complains about the damage done by these vehicles, especially in small villages, about the danger of pollution, about traffic jams, and about the loss of agricultural land where M roads are built. These drawbacks can and must be overcome by the provision of by-pass and further M roads. The London outer circle M 25, when completed, will remove heavy through traffic from the streets of London. Small vehicles and private cars, owned nowadays by over half of the population will also be able to move about more freely, and parking problems which at present bedevil all large towns and cities will be alleviated.\n\nIn a small country like England, internal air travel is of importance primarily to business people and nowadays all major cities have their own airports. London will eventually have five. Since there is ample private competition for British Airways, that organization, which of course operates a world-wide network, is efficient. The inefficiency is on the ground. It can take longer to reach Heath Row and pass through customs and baggage formalities than it takes to fly to Paris of Dusseldorf.\n\nRivers and canals must not be overlooked. There is a valuable move, backed by the environmentalists, to restore the waterways, not only as a means of commercial transport but also for tourism. This involves both bank-clearing and the enforcement of anti-pollution laws. The River Thames now contains a wide variety of fish whereas for over a century it contained none. Unfortunately it is little used for commercial purposes, though progress is being made on all fronts.\n\nMany of the transport problems in England, though not all, have stemmed from bad government theory and bad industrial relations in the past. Part of the problem has been a steady shift of population originally from country to town, and now the reverse. The task of promoting comfort, safety, economic cost, speed and reliability is not easy, but is being tackled."

        "title": "Scientists are the explorers of today.' Discuss.",
        "content": "Exploration in the commonly accepted sense began with people like the sea-faring Columbus when, in the middle ages it was realized that the earth is a globe, not flat. It held a crucial role for centuries in colonization and trade expansion. In the 19th century startling results were achieved by wealthy and gifted amateurs. However quite early in this century virtually the whole of the earth's surface had been mapped in outline, and most of it surveyed by explorers on foot. The process has more recently been completed by the use of the aircraft and the helicopter. Attention is now concentrated on underground and undersea exploration and in recent years on space exploration.\nBefore the First World War the international attitude towards exploration was competitive, as in the case of space exploration today, the USA. and USSR constantly trying to surpass each others achievements. After the first war the attitude was more co-operative. An international council of scientific unions was set up, its role being assumed by UNESCO after the Second World War. This organization co-ordinates results end supplies a limited amount of cash. This work culminated in the International Geophysical Year, 1957, in which 70 nations participated, producing a systematic study of the earth end the environment. A stop was put on territorial claims in Antarctica. The solid earth was examined scientifically by means of a series of deep probes, but since deep drilling is increasingly expensive, a stop was eventually put on this method.\n\nSince only 30% of the earth's surface is above sea level end only 10% habitable, attention has naturally been diverted to underground end undersea exploration for human reasons. It is necessary to drill for minerals, for fuel end for water in order to plan new facilities. Although modern exploration is largely pragmatic, the scientific aspect provides most interest, e.g. the work of the Upper Manke Committee. All observations are naturally indirect. They are based on drilling into the earth's crust where it is known to be most shallow in order to find out its physical properties. In the process of drilling more is discovered about an area's liability to earthquakes, its underground radioactive end magnetic values etc. The USA. pioneered this venture, end a drill of 35,000 feet was aimed at. Since it proved so expensive US Project Mohole was abandoned in 1967. Seismic methods are used for the discovery of oil end gas deposits and today there are airborne devices for detecting minerals such as oil end gas. These operate by detecting slight changes in the earth's magnetic field. There is also a scanning infra-red sensor of greet use in geo-chemical exploration.\n\nUndersea exploration is of equal, if not greater importance since its results have led to immense discoveries. Offshore oil end gas rigs now proliferate. However, much underwater work is a matter of scientific surveying. Sound echoing devices now enable scientists to map the ocean bed accurately end to discover far more about the seabed under the polar icecaps. Deep-see drilling produces core samples which provide useful information. Today the work is co-ordinated by a consortium of oceanographic institutes.\n\nIf space exploration is to be included then obviously science plays the dominate role in all ventures. The earth is now surrounded by hundreds of orbited satellites which provide various kinds of information, from weather reports to international communications. Many are in orbit for purely scientific reasons. They measure natural phenomena in space, solar end cosmic radiation, magnetic fields. They assist in technical observation of stars and lead to an understanding of the evolution of the solar system. There are also lunar end inter-planetary programs which further extend human knowledge. The manned projects must partly depend on the scientific know-how of the space explorer himself.\n\nHas modern exploration lost glamour and the old dependence on self-reliance? Partly; but human nature being what it is, outward-bound ventures in relatively unknown areas of the earth's surface will always persist."

        "title": "What Scientific knowledge should an educated person have?",
        "content": "The answer depends on one's definition of education, end there is no single definition. In the widest sense even the most primitive societies begin to prepare children for living from birth as a necessity for survival So do animals and birds. Formal education is based on literacy, in both East and West, that of China dating back to 165 B.C. when civil service examinations were instituted. Today one school of thought would define education as the means of living a civilized life, which in turn depends on the acquisition of culture. Culture implies a knowledge of the graceful and artistic things of life, and in Europe at any rate depends on no more than a knowledge of Greek and Latin, modern European languages being merely an optional extra. Many well-known schools in the West still lay a powerful emphasis on the classical languages as the best means of teaching the young to think properly.\nThe problem with the first paragraph is that society does not consist of wealthy dilettantes. Some knowledge of science is essential to us all because the march of scientific discovery largely dictates modern living both personal and social. There are, of course, still pockets of privilege everywhere in which the rich can take advantage of the knowledge, skill and hard work of others, but today most countries are essentially meritocracies. If the purpose of education is to succeed in life as well as to enjoy it, some knowledge of science, however superficial, is essential. Nowadays in the free world, the opportunity to gain specialized education in order to succeed is regarded as a basic human right.\n\n'Ars pro arte' is no longer a valid concept. We live in a scientific world. We cannot be safe in a modern home without a basic understanding of electricity. Children must be shielded from dangerous drugs. We need to know basic arithmetic if we are to deal with money, banking, even family economics. We need to know a little chemistry and biology if we are to remain healthy and fit.\n\nHowever the topic question implies much more than this, especially for the young person today. In a world which daily grows less remote and more interdependent due to satellite communications, jet travel and the ubiquitous computer, boys and girls should receive instruction in them all and be encouraged to specialize in one of these subjects, because job opportunities are increasingly dependent on subjects such as electronics and computer science. In Europe the emphasis has already shifted away from the heavy engineering and artisan industries. Coalminers, steel-workers and ship-builders are the dinosaurs of 1984. The growth industries of today depend completely on scientific specialization.\n\nEarly Chinese education included the martial arts, necessary accomplishments for those above peasant status. Modern martial arts certainly have not destroyed the need for personal bravery in the soldier but effective military action today depends more on the technology which a country can buy, and on the specialized knowledge required for the use of the modern weapons of sea, land and air. The basis of any increase in a country's gross national product is trade. Today the marketing of sophisticated goods abroad is a main growth industry. You cannot begin to work in this field without at least a reasonable knowledge of the goods you are promoting. Neither, if you are a politician can you even understand many of the issues dealt with in government without a degree of specialized knowledge in those fields.\n\nToday the emphasis has shifted from pure to applied science. It might be argued that men like Archimedes, Isaac Newton and Einstein were among the most educated people who ever lived. The frontiers which they established are still being pushed back. Yet modern interest lies less in discovering new laws than in the development of the old ones; modern education, for the majority, implies specialization in an established field.\n\nWill science finally eliminate the divisive elements in human nature by encouraging understanding and co-operation, for this is surely one of the aims of educations ? So far there are few signs that it will. The truth seems to be that science has its own momentum, and the most that can be said is that the educated person should at least know what is going on in the world.\n\nA knowledge of science is necessary if humanity is to be in a position to resist some of its worse results. Among these may be included nuclear and chemical warfare, and some of the frightening developments in genetic engineering. Science is neutral. Everything depends on its use or misuse. It neither explains nor contradicts religion. It is man's servant, not its master."

        "title": "What do you understand by 'fashion' and why does fashion change?",
        "content": "The word 'fashion' is generally used to mean style in clothing, 'style' meaning what is popularly accepted, admired or regarded as exclusive i.e. not available to the majority either because they lack the taste or the money to follow it.\nHowever fashion applies to many other things than dress and hair-styles e.g. house, building and the general design of most consumer-goods ranging from cars to kitchen appliances. The word also applies to customs, personal manners and standards of moral behavior. It certainly covers forms of speech, use of words and accents within a language.\n\nAll these things change from time to time, sometimes abruptly. Sometimes a form of dress, a phrase, or a custom may drop out of fashion but then come back for no obvious reason. However, the reason for change is usually apparent.\n\nIn the West post-war clothing fashions have been the subject of change because of the higher standard of living enjoyed in most European countries. Take England as an example. In pre-war days high fashion was the monopoly of the wealthy or well-to-do woman. If a woman works to a tight budget she will have to buy clothes and shoes for warmth and durability rather than appearance. During the war clothes for both sexes were rationed anyway, on a coupon system. This austerity, followed by post-war full employment, for women as well as men, started the fashion ball rolling.\n\nMen's fashions have always remained relatively static, variations in suits and shoes remaining fairly minor. However the freedoms of the 1960's moved young men into a much more informal style of dress, which reflected their casual attitudes, behavior and morality. The tee-shirt and denim jeans became almost statutory for the young of both sexes. Recently there has been slight return to formal dress, although the hat has, for no apparent reason, become the symbol of the elderly men, and, for most occasions, women too.\n\nReturning to women's fashions. A third reason for the constant changes lies in 'haute couture' as big business. At one time a new and exclusively styled garment from a couturier in Paris was sold only to the rich. The same garment today is only exclusive in its label, though a few models are sold to the rich as one-offs. The real business lies in the sale of the model to the mass-producing firms which bring new styles to the big stores in the High Street. Thus the shop-girl can wear the same style in clothes and shoes as Princess Diana. A fourth reason for change is that women like change for its own sake. They prefer two or three different outfits to one, in the course of a year. Mass-produced fashion clothes and shoes are therefore not made to last. They become 'disposables.'\n\nAnother reason for changes in customs, manners and morals, lies in subtle changes in ideas and outlooks. The Butch appearance of some western women reflects feminism, as does the look-alike garb affected by some couples. For men or women to live together in a homosexual relationship, so far from causing ostracism, is now accepted as fashionable in some quarters. Some men no longer open doors for women, stand when they enter a room or give up their seats in a railway carriage. Many women regard this once accepted behavior as male chauvinism.\n\nOther changes in fashion occur because of the power of propaganda, advertising and political pressure groups. The anti-smoking lobby has largely succeeded in keeping all public places smoke-free. The lobby has considerable backing from the medical profession.\n\nThe term 'fashion' applies also to the written and the spoken word; B.B.C. English, spoken in an 'Oxbridge' accent was used exclusively by newsreaders and public speakers until the 60s. In that decade local accents became more fashionable, due partly to the prominence given to pop-groups, especially if they came from Liverpool, such as the 'Beatles' or from the Midlands or the North. Changes in accent and expression have greatly affected both the theatre and the television play; subject matter is also very different today. The term 'kitchen-sink drama' sums up the process. Novels have also undergone fundamental changes in fashion, partly because of travel and partly because of a shift in political interest. Today best-selling novels are usually spy-thrillers or books which deal with contemporary subjects such as aircraft, banking, electronics or industrial espionage; others result from a new and sometimes sentimental review of England's past glories, her old wartime achievements, her social and industrial progress in Victorian and Edwardian days and her colonial power up to 1939."

        "title": "Discuss the various methods of advertising and their effectiveness.",
        "content": "It pays to advertise. The old adage remains true in principle because advertising not only sells goods but also creates the demand for new lines. The home computer is a modern example. The half a dozen big producers go in for highly competitive advertising, some of it aimed at children. They can play games, educate themselves, prepare themselves for modern living. All this can be done with books and paper, but parents are pressurized into buying computers, never-the-less, the sop to their consciences being that they can use the computer for family accounts. Of course they can. Equally they could do their family accounts once a month on the back of an old envelope.\nAdvertising sells goods and services, otherwise it would not exist, and the development of advertising in the West dates back at least three centuries, coinciding roughly with the publication of early journals such as The London Gazette, Tatler and Spectator in England, the circulation of which was largely limited to London and one or two large provincial cities. So advertising began on a local basis, because wherever you create a demand you must be able to meet it. So various factors combined to create national and international advertising; mass-production, based in the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, rail communication and transport, the development of printing, especially color printing, and the freighter for overseas markets. For as long as most people can remember advertising has been seen wherever the public go; on walls, shop fronts and hoardings, in railway stations and the underground, on streamers trailing behind light aircraft, from static balloons, on trains, buses and business vehicles, taxis and container lorries. With the advent of color-television, the commercial break has assumed primary importance. Some commercial radio channels still carry advertising. Handbills, advertising local firms, flood through the letter-boxes. Junk mail, addressed to computerized lists of likely buyers, fills the waste paper baskets.\n\nFrom this will be seen that overkill is one drawback to the effectiveness of modern advertising. People get fed-up if they are over-pressurized, especially intelligent people. The hard sell becomes counter-productive. Yet the fact that it continues argues that this kind of advertising is financially justified.\n\nAdvertising is therefore big business, and the world's capitals, outside the Eastern bloc, offer scope to advertising firms with their highly specially areas of expertise. Such firms employ some of the best ideas people, graphic artists, promotional experts, and film producers and technicians.\n\nThe effectiveness of advertising depends on the assessment of the consumer's motivation in buying, and a direct or indirect appeal to that motivation; sometimes the creation of that motivation, by an appeal to a range of human instincts. Where there is poverty in a potential market the only effective appeal is based on cheapness, reliability and effectiveness in a product. In a mixed or affluent community the field is wide open. Most Western advertising works in a competitive market where the variety of brands is matched by the consumer's power of choice.\n\nThe soft sell works best when appealing to the very rich, and usually price is not mentioned. A country house with a hundred acres of land is offered as a 'modest gentleman's residence, the Rolls Royce is merely described as the best car in the world. Everybody knows that a small group of products are the best in their fields, so advertising merely keeps them in the public eye. 'Apeing the celebrity' is another line of attack; if a famous heavy-weight uses a particular deodorant, or a great actress a particular shampoo, good sales result. Another successful line with a shampoo is that it works, implying that the others don't. In contrast sexy lingerie ads are self-defeating. They bore women and men don't usually buy lingerie. Yet sex can sell chocolates. If a stunt-man goes through the hoops to bring his beautiful girl-friend the brand of her choice he will take the easier way of buying them in the supermarket and she may begin to fantasize about the bringer. The appeal to snobbery still works. Because those bright, successful, affluent Jones next door buy certain brand names, the failed, boring economical neighbors must do likewise. Comic ads amuse some, repel others, but in either case people keep the brand name in mind, if only never to buy it.\n\nMost countries today have a statutory body which seeks to deep advertising up to a certain basic standards; ads must be morally decent, truthful and legal. However there are countless ways of disobeying the spirit if not the letter of the law. Subliminal advertising has rightly been banned. The advertising of foodstuffs has been improved by 'sold by' and statements of contents."

        "title": "What priorities would you set for government expenditure and why?",
        "content": "These priorities will vary enormously according to the circumstances and the state of development of the country concerned. Assuming that the country is politically independent, but that a reasonable level of defense has to be kept for the sake of parity with potentially hostile neighbors, a large slice of the national cake is already accounted for in terms of defense salaries and equipment. Could that slice be reduced in size. In terms both of nuclear and conventional arms, the current unfreezing of relations between East and West is partly based on internal pressures for economies in favor of more positive priorities.\nSimilarly, all countries have labor-intensive annual commitments where the main services are nationally funded or subsidized; the civil service, the police and customs forces, the health service, education, roads, railways and airlines. All have the potential for rationalization, perhaps privatization, with consequent economies.\n\nBasic policy must therefore be considered. If a country follows the socialist line, then all these, and many others, including housing and a comprehensive social security system, are the government's responsibility. If not, as many as possible of these services will be hived off to the private sector. For the purposes of this essay, let us assume that the country concerned is democratic, and that it encourages free enterprise, self-help and a business-like efficiency, and that it means to hold its own in the modern world.\n\nTo do so, it will need to achieve the following; economic development and the full exploitation of natural resources; a favorable balance of trade with, consequently, a strong currency; high interest rates if overseas money is to be attracted but if possible without prejudice to exports; the reduction or abolition of inflation implying some kind of wages policy in both public and private sectors, together with legislative control over the power of the trades unions. Given such an ideal and promising situation, we can now look at the national cake.\n\nAny government's financial leeway consists of revenue less unavoidable expenditure, and both can he regulated within certain limits. Income normally comes from direct and indirect taxation, such as value added tax or purchase tax. Taxation covers personal income, business, profits made on resource exploitation, and of course levies on consumer durables and perishables among other areas. The total net income can be raised or lowered at the will of government, although such changes are usually marginal. In a democracy, wild changes may lead to the overthrow of government. Also, such changes have to be made with a strict eye to inflation, which cancels out improvements. Thirdly, any great increase in borrowing erodes stability.\n\nAny chancellor will regard his expendable surplus as a cake to be divided into slices, after setting aside funds to service and reduce national debts. It will then be for the cabinet to press claims for the various departments represented, until agreement or compromise has been reached. So a budget is reached.\n\nThe press and the public may well have set their own priorities. Pressure groups will have drawn attention to social defects, and the opposition will certainly have done so.\n\nLet us take an imaginary country which fulfils all the above conditions. The chancellor has a usable surplus of $2 billion. It has been decided that the country's outstanding short-term needs lie in the categories of housing, roads and railways, health, education, sport and the arts. The long-term needs include the modernization of the Armed Forces equipment, the exploitation of natural resources, and the establishment of centers for research and development, science and technology. At the risk of becoming unpopular the chancellor will have to balance these conflicting claims.\n\nHe selects the following short-term priorities; housing, health and education, and out of the long-term needs, the exploitation of natural resources. Roads, railways, sports and the arts will simply be maintained at the old levels, allowing for inflation. The sooner natural resources are developed the better, because this will guarantee greatly increased revenue.\n\nA labor-intensive re-housing program will help to bring down unemployment. He allocates $330 million. Equal sums are allocated to the establishment of a subsidized health service, which he hopes will ultimately become non-contributory, and to the improvement of the national education service, to be shared from primary to university level. And since his hopes for a larger national cake in the future depend on resource exploitation, $1 billion must be allocated to that purpose."

        "title": "All history books are biased. Do you support this view?",
        "content": "This sounds a very sweeping statement. Nevertheless, there is much truth in it. The bias is not always deliberate. Every writer owes much to his or her background and to the national climate of opinion.\nThe important thing about the writing of history is that it should not only be factual but that it should include all the facts. For example, it would be wrong to write about the French Revolution without dealing with what led up to it, the glaring differences in living standards between aristocrat and peasant, the inequity of the law, the callousness of the rich and the rational philosophy of human equality and human rights spelled out by Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Otherwise the account would read simply as a record of brutal and indiscriminate violence on the part of the Paris mob.\n\nThe best of historical writing therefore includes all the facts, objectively presented, leaving the reader to draw personal conclusions. The problem of this kind of writing is dullness, where personal opinion or interpretation is rigorously excluded.\n\nNobody, either writer or reader, is totally without a political stance. One writer dealing with a popular revolution will castigate a mob for violence, greed and looting, condemning the murders which lead to the overthrow of a stable government. Another, dealing with the same revolution, will put all the blame on the government for its autocratic and heartless attitude to the people, and argue that the ugly features of revolution are necessary if full democratic control of government is to pass into the hands of the people.\n\nIf some historians tend to write, however objectively, from the national point of view, others tend to adopt the one-world stance, which is basically left-wing. This stance favors aggression by the oppressed and is invariably censorious about colonialism. It is also pacifist insofar as the established powers are concerned, although vague about the consequences of total non-aggression in all circumstances. The one-world view also tends to be selective in the presentation of facts, eliminating those which conflict with it's overall moral outlook. For example there is no mention of social and material progress or of the Pax Britannica in certain modern accounts of British colonialism.\n\nMuch the same applies to domestic history. While it is true that the old-fashioned historian concentrated on power bases, monarchs and political leaders, perhaps excessively, some modern historians see history simply in terms of the upward struggle of the poor, writing only about violence against the class struggle and against the trades union movement.\n\nMore recently, the writing of history in some countries has been debased out of all recognition. This happens when an oppressive government decides to brainwash its people into continued subservience. The technique is to suppress all the truth of the past and rewrite only the material which fits in with government policy. Such travesties are forcibly imposed on schools, while objectively-written history books are withdrawn from schools and libraries."

        "title": "Should one aim of education be the development of talent in such fields as music, art, drama?",
        "content": "It is only a tiny minority who are born without a talent in one direction or another. Even these people are usually employable. It seems logical, in general, that one aim of education should be to develop latent ability, whatever that ability may be.\nHowever, the pressure from educational theorists today is to concentrate teaching on preparation for employment. Parents, also, feel that the priority for their children is to become equipped to earn a good living. Governments urge concentration on certain subjects, so that a pool of labor can be formed which can move easily into specialized training. These essential subjects include English, or another international language, since these languages possess technical vocabularies and also equip young people to travel overseas in the course of their work. The other favored subjects arc mathematics, the sciences, the use of computers and other office machinery, engineering, and general handwork. Given proficiency in some or all of there, it is a short step to useful employment. Modern job opportunities lie in the fields of the service industries, i.e. banking, insurance and stockbroking, technology and the manufacture of sophisticated products, research and development and computers. Governments see these occupations as essential to national wealth creation, and therefore crucial to the general improvement of the national standard of living.\n\nThere will always he young people more interested in the arts than in the sciences. The arts are usually bracketed under the general heading 'liberal studies'; they include history, languages and literature, philosophy, politics and economics, social and environmental studies. Some require exact knowledge and serious study, while others are 'soft options'. In any real sense they are totally unproductive, and modern education has spawned a brood of these non-subjects. It is small wonder that both governments and parents discourage some of them nowadays. We live in a real world. Yet the reverse of this coin is the necessary enrichment of the culture of all countries in successive generations. What is material success if there is nothing to engage the artistic side of our nature in our spare time?\n\nPerhaps the greatest concept of education originates in the European cultural renaissance in Italy, and dates back to the late Middle Ages. It is the development of the whole person. Perhaps the modern version of 'mens sana in corpore sano', a 'healthy body in a healthy mind', still has its place. So even attention to sports training is justifiable.\n\nSo music, art and drama must all have their place in the curriculum, even if this is not a prime place. Every country has its own artistic heritage, and it would be tragic if that heritage were lost through neglect. Yet this is not merely a matter of conservation. Artistic pursuits have now become international and offer brilliant careers to gifted young people of every country. It is clear that those with this kind of talent should be encouraged."

        "title": "What types of fiction do you enjoy reading and why?",
        "content": "The reading of fiction is escapism, but not in any bad sense. To read is more positive than to watch television, because the visual nature of TV limits the imagination. Reading also excels radio listening, partly because the listener has no choice in the programs, and partly because the quality of radio programs is so uneven. There is a world of fiction available to occupy the reader's spare time, so much so that he or she can be ultra-selective in following personal taste. It is perhaps true to say that a good library is one of the finest assets a community can possess. Failing a library, paperbacks are usually available.\nReading opens windows on the world, whether past or present, and most people enjoy looking through these windows. Robert Graves' novels I, Claudius and Claudius the god reveal the Imperial Roman Empire, just as his Goodbye to all that reveals the horrors of the First World War. It may be this quality which distinguishes great from mediocre fiction. Tolstoy's War and Peace reveal the Napoleonic struggle, whereas Jane Austen's Persuasion being a study of the mannered relationships of early 18th century English country gentry merely gives the Napoleonic Wars a mention. So are we looking for people's reactions to a great sweep of national events, the sort we find in Pasternak's Dr Zhivago, with it's comments on the Russian system, or are we looking for an encapsulated set of personal relationships? Perhaps, from time to time, we enjoy both.\n\nOur choice of fiction also depends on mood. Perhaps, after a hard day in the office, we need to read something out of this world. What about Mr. Clarke's space fiction? Or perhaps it is something light and amusing. There is a whole world of this kind of fiction. Again, tastes vary. For this writer, the Atlantic Ocean is a great divide as far as humor is concerned, just as the Australian reader would see nothing funny in an English novel which I think hilarious. This argues that humor has to be related to a known background. The Englishman laughs at the James Herriott stories, because the adventures of this veterinary surgeon relate exclusively to provincial English characters. The American would be puzzled. However, a gifted raconteur like David Niven sells equally well on both sides of the pond. In The moon's a balloon and Go slowly, come back quickly, he pins down the foibles of both nations, to the delight of both, because he has spent much of his working life in Hollywood, and has absorbed both backgrounds.\n\nMost people enjoy a good thriller, and some, horror stories. Edgar Allan Poe's short stories set the horror trend. He was followed by a host of others, notably Dennis Wheatley, and more latterly by people like Blatty, who wrote the terrifying novel The Exorcist. The real trend, however, is for the good whodunnit, because the acts of violence are no more than pegs on which to hang intellectual solutions. Violence is never dwelt on for its own sake. This is the popular Agatha Christie genre, followed by dozens of other writers, some highly gifted, such as Georges Simenon.\n\nThere are, among many others, three genres which in the 20th century have had a great following. The outward-bound adventure thriller, represented by Alistair MacLean and Hammond Innes; the spectrum of spy mysteries, based on the machinations of MI6, the KGB and the CIA, John LeCarre being a very able exponent, and a whole group of modern novels based on carefully-researched subjects such as airports, hotels and banks.\n\nThis short essay does not mention the Classics, perhaps because the student may associate them too closely with examinations. However, they are still read for pleasure, and one should not forget that they were the popular literature of their day, and were often denied the literary status conferred on them by subsequent generations."

        "title": "Which is the more important, to cure disease or to prevent it ?",
        "content": "The answer depends on the standpoint of the individual. Should he or she contract a disease, then prevention is too late. The only thing left is, hopefully, a cure. However, a minister of health may take a different view. In any country he will need to decide on the allocation of his budget, and this in turn will depend on the priorities obtaining in that country. The main priority may be prevention. This will require expenditure in fields other than medicine; these are public works, nutrition and health education. Other ministries will therefore be involved. In the long run there is little doubt that the prevention of disease is of higher priority than finding cures.\nThis is particularly true in countries where people become the victims of epidemics, or where certain diseases are endemic. In certain tropical countries, malaria is endemic. The effects of it can be suppressed by drugs and its source, the anopheles mosquito, has long been known. However without strict public health regulations, e.g. avoiding standing water, and using mosquito nets in the wet season, malaria will persist, although the mosquito can be destroyed by spraying. Meanwhile a course of drugs will build up the body's resistance. Suppression and prevention will ultimately lead to a natural cure.\n\nDiscovery of the cause of any disease is crucial. Up to the 17th century England was ravaged by a series of bubonic plagues which killed off people by the thousand, especially in London. The old theory was that the plague was caused by the stench of rotting refuse. In fact, it came from rat fleas, which infected humans. The prevention procedures was to destroy the rats, which in turn meant providing London with proper drainage, and also to educate people in public hygiene. The plague was eradicated by preventive methods, in a period when finding an actual cure was medically impossible.\n\nThe most important preventive measure against disease is inoculation. The means is to vaccinate with enough of the virus concerned to achieve immunity to the actual disease. Certain diseases, some fatal, have now disappeared from the Western world as a result; immunity from poliomyelitis, yellow fever, tetanus, typhoid fever and some forms of influenza can now be achieved by injection. In the case of childish and non-fatal complaints, it is sometimes thought best to accept them, because where a child's bodily health is generally good a natural immunity results. In adults, jaundice and hepatitis are far more dangerous, although nowadays haematology saves many lives.\n\nOther preventative measures include eliminating the cause of disease from the environment; e.g. measures to prevent the inhalation of coal dust in the mining industry, and the rejection of asbestos from the building trade. Where the quality of water is suspect, boiling achieves a general level of safety. The strengthening of bodily defenses against disease is of strategic importance. This necessitates a balanced diet, reasonable exercise, warmth in cold climates, good sleep, and favorable housing and working conditions. When a disease has been caught, measures to control it include the use of modern drugs, X-ray therapy in the case of cancer, and at times, surgery.\n\nWhat is disease? It is the invasion of the body by outside agents, bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins or radiation. It can also result from changes in the body and from physical malfunctioning, or from failure to adapt to environmental change. Changes in diet and the invasion of microorganisms can also contribute. In general, people have a built-in immunity to these invasions, though not always.\n\nUnfortunately it seems that as fast as one disease is eliminated another seems to take its place. This applies less to infectious and contagious disease than to contraction by individuals, though not always. A greatly feared recent illness is AIDS, of which the origin is at present unknown, though its means of spread has become clear. So far, this scourge, which is becoming endemic in certain parts of Africa, is incurable. It can be contained by prophylaxis and avoided altogether by avoiding sexual promiscuity. The prevention of' its spread is essential. Its cure remains uncertain.\n\nMeanwhile there is no means of preventing or curing either the common cold or the various kinds of rheumatic and arthritic complaints. All of them can be lived with if drug suppressants are used, but the facts illustrate the patchy nature of medical advances. The same may be said about cancer. There are treatments, but so far no cure. There are preventive measures, such as not smoking, to avoid lung cancer, although the stated connection between smoking tobacco and lung cancer is opinion and propaganda rather than demonstrable fact.\nCertain addictions, including drug addiction, may be classified as disease. In no case is there a cure for the condition. Prevention by abstention is all-important.\n\nDramatic advances in bodily organ replacement. e.g. heart, lung and kidney surgery, now give new hope to many sufferers. Cure by skilled surgery may be the only option, since there are no medical treatments. Neither are there any preventative measures.\n\nThese examples and others can be cited to prove the topic-statement either way, but if one has to generalize for the long term, the balance may he on the side of prevention. However much of the latter remains empirical while the actual causes of serious diseases remain unknown."

        "title": "Do you agree that the primary purpose of the Arts, whether music, painting, drama or literature, is to entertain?",
        "content": "As Professor Joad used to say, it all depends what you mean by entertain. If the word means make one laugh, then there is obviously more to the Arts than that. Of course, we do laugh at comic songs, as in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, at wit and topical comment in newspaper cartoons, at farce on the stage, and at the likes of P G Wodehouse and Mark Twain in novels, and why not? The dictionary gives a wide definition of entertain -- to amuse, to occupy pleasurably. People obtain pleasure from many things, and so yes is the logical answer to the question.\nThe intelligentsia would answer no, in any country. Many seem to think that the theatre exists to make political points, or to make us think about some social problem, or to express the prejudices of the author. Of course serious writing, of whatever kind, should be free to deal with serious subjects; music and painting are seen as vehicles of getting across some message or other. Yet it is a strange co-incidence that without heavy subsidies from the state or some business source, intellectual Art in general could not exist. Where there is an attempt to give pleasure rather than to instruct, the public is far more likely to be prepared to pay to support the Arts.\n\nIn its early days, the British Broadcasting Corporation defined the object of sound, and later, television broadcasting as being to entertain, inform and educate, in that order, and there has been no reason to change that order of priorities. Other countries may have different objectives. Some regard the media as a tool of government. Others relinquish all control and place the media in the hands of advertising sponsors, allowing standards to find their own level on the basis of public popularity. Britain may have the best answer. Although funded from the license fee, the Corporation remains independent of Government. At the same time it has to compete with the Independent Television Authority for support. This saves the BBC from becoming too stuffy, and the ITV from dropping its standards to suit the lowest tastes. Cable television will bring wider choice, and the result of that remains to be seen.\n\nWhile they keep their independence, the media are free to respond democratically to public demand. In Britain, this demand is for entertainment which makes few if any intellectual demands. So we suffer a spate of situation comedies, soap operas and panel games monopolizing the prime viewing times. More intellectual programs are relegated to the early or late time slots; they comprise political and social comment, opera, ballet, serious music, documentaries, and programs concerning the Arts in general, religion included. In all fairness, it has to be said that Channel 2 is almost entirely given over to serious viewing.\n\nShould preference be given to popularity ? Should people be given what they want, or what somebody else thinks is good for them ? We return to the purpose of the Arts. Their purpose is to occupy leisure time pleasurably.\n\nThe problem with many exponents of the Arts is that their work has a minority appeal. Musical appreciation depends on personal taste, but most people like a recognizable and memorable tune. Most people prefer representational painting. Most people enjoy drama which has a beginning, a middle and an end. Most people buy a book because it is a good read.\n\nThe popularity test has been in question for a long time. Subject matter has broadened, and themes now cover the whole spectrum of life. Traditional and conventional themes have been abandoned. So much music has become tuneless, and dissonant. The theatre preaches sociology and politics. Painting and sculpture take some abstract form, personal to the artist. Literature, at least among highbrows, must be literary. No doubt all this has made people think, perhaps discuss, more than they once did. Yet, the fact that in Britain the Arts have to be supported by government handouts via the Arts Council speaks for itself.\nWhatever the intellectuals may think is good for us, the paying public will always vote with its feet. Entertainment in the widest sense remains the primary objective of the Arts, if the Arts are to survive."

        "title": "How far should the teaching of history aim to foster pride in one's country and its past?",
        "content": "In the 1930s a British schoolboy would turn his geographical globe and find that a third of the land surface was colored pink. This indicated the Empire, dominions, colonies end protectorates. The schoolboy felt a sense of pride, he might have thought one day we shall rule the world .\n\nSchoolchildren grow up, learn history in more depth, and bring a more sophisticated outlook to their study. The teaching of history has changed in recent years; indeed in some countries it has been merged with the story of progress in ideology, sociology and industrial development. Providing the new methods do not lead to the inculcation of political stances, and to the loss of the factual framework which has to be learnt the hard way, the new approach may be superior to the old. The old approach was to concentrate on power centers; the stories of rulers, armies, political figures, and military relationships with neighboring countries. This of course is legitimate history, and may or may not be a true source of pride, but it is far from being the complete picture.\n\nAnother factor running counter to old-fashioned pride in country is based in the post Second World War international agreement about basic human rights. These at once cut across national insularity. In the case of Britain, the wind of change led to the independence of ex-colonies and the distancing of the dominions from the influence of Whitehall. Gradually the one-world concept grew up. Its extreme adherents visualize total disarmament, total freedom to emigrate and settle at will, and eventually the international standardization of privilege and opportunity. Whereas the concept of my country, right or wrong is seriously suspect, the discarding of legitimate national pride unilaterally is impractical and unrealistic. The right kind of national pride is at least a partial guarantee of freedom and a counter-measure against aggression, whether military or subversive, on the part of both East end West.\n\nThere are some things which the teaching of history used to obscure, and in which e country can take no legitimate pride. They apply, in part or whole, to all countries. Militarism and unprovoked aggression towards neighbors comes first. Arising out of this, especially in Europe, came a history of colonization by conquest, followed by commercial exploitation. Although tempered by religious mission and the establishment of peace end stability, even social improvement, and the rule of just law, this part of history is no longer condoned. Most empire-building countries were cynical in their dealings with vassal states. Rule was despotic. Sometimes apartheid was built into the system. In some instances local people were deported as slaves to be used for commercial gain. Poverty and lack of opportunity were ignored. In more recent times there have been cases of empire-building by subversion rather than by military conquest. Some countries still behave aggressively through their secret services and their arms dealers. However patriotic, the history teacher should not be ashamed to impart this information, and it can he done without prejudice to the fostering of love of country for the right reasons. What are these reasons ?\n\nThe history of all countries traces the emergence of their peoples from the despotism of kings, barons and petty chiefs, alongside the progress to both national and personal independence. Students can also take pride in the development of the rule of law and the strengthening of personal freedoms within the law. Most countries have a history of industrial and nowadays technological development, and this has given rise to trades unionism which at its best seeks fairness and protection for the worker. Pride may also be taken in the development of the democratic process, the abolition of class barriers and the enhancement of personal opportunity. Neither should history teaching neglect improvements in living standards, reductions in working hours and the provision of health, cultural and leisure services.\n\nFinally, countries take legitimate pride in their own special characteristics; these include individuality in dress, music, the theatre, sports and games, and environmental development and improvement. Neither should the student be ashamed of the personal protection afforded by the society into which he or she was born, or of the good qualities of that society. These may well include kindness, flexibility, give and take, humor, respect for neighbor, family solidarity, care for the elderly, love of children, kindness to animals, generosity, community consciousness and hospitality to strangers."

        "title": "Are you for or against zoos?",
        "content": "Until recently the case for zoos was never questioned. They are accepted as useful and entertaining amenities which were also educational. Children love seeing animals, and a visit to the zoo has always been a treat.\nGradually however unrest has grown about the morality of keeping animals, reptiles and birds in captivity, though not on grounds of ill-treatment, lack of hygiene or incorrect feeding.\n\nThe concept of confining them in cages became suspect. More than fifty years ago a wildlife park was established at Whipsnade in Bedfordshire, UK, and since the Second World War in the grounds of large houses such as Longleat. The major-attraction types of animals such as lions, tigers and elephants thus have room to move freely and to set up their own social structures. They are fenced off from the public except in safari parks where people can see them at close quarters from rover type vehicles.\n\nThere are four points in favor of zoos, and arguments against them all. The first is conservation. Due to over shooting and deforestation in Africa, India and elsewhere, many species are endangered or becoming extinct. The koala bear, some types of deer and the Arabian oryx are examples. Attempts to mate these in captivity have been successful, with the result that their natural habitats have been re-stocked. This process is expensive and time-consuming, however.\n\nSometimes it is unsuccessful. Sometimes animals bred in captivity cannot adapt to the wild, and either die or fall prey to predators. The fact is that only 5% of endangered species are to be found in zoos, so the whole concept may be wrong. These arguments do not of course apply to bird sanctuaries, where the birds are encouraged to frequent natural but protected habitats, and are never confined.\n\nThe main argument against is that available money should be put into the saving of natural habitats. Realistically, this is totally impracticable overseas, and difficult enough in the country concerned.\n\nPoint two is that zoos are educational. Seeing and touching animals means much more to a child than any number of good books or pictures. Children have a chance to touch, groom and ride on animals in a modern zoo. Some zoos specialize in activity centers which generate love of animals, understanding and enjoyment. The counter to this argument is that animals dislike being domesticated for any reason, and that in the strict sense the zoo does not further education. Zoology is best learnt in the classroom, in the laboratory, and from the text-book. Another counter-argument is that for close contact, visual or actual, cages must be small. This inhibits exercise, and worse, prevents the putting together of enough animals to allow for natural social behavior, i.e. the setting up of families and clans. However it is conceded that given large enough cages or confined areas with sufficient animals these defects can be largely overcome. It has to be said that zoos are constantly improving their facilities and bringing them into line with the animal's natural surroundings as far as possible. The polar bear house in London Zoo is currently being remodeled in this way.\n\nIf the wishes of the public are to be considered, zoos as recreational amenities have a large following, and should be kept. Children have been mentioned, but the informative booklets, scripts and tapes available in a modern zoo attract the adult also. Entrance takings are high, and money becomes available for research as well as improvement. Some agree; others ask why animals should be made a peepshow.\n\nThe fourth argument for zoos is that they not only allow for research but also finance it. This again is not considered a valid argument by the opponents. What kind of research ? people ask. In the case of the London Zoo the answer is that they have an Institute of Zoology. This produces comparative surveys, statistics for analysis, and data bases. The veterinary branch learns how best to keep animals and treat them when sick. Animal nutrition is studied. Problems of re-introduction into the wild are studied. Animal behavior is studied. Nothing was known about the social habits of the rhinoceros until specimens were brought into captivity and observed in suitable surroundings.\n\nWhat of the future ? Despite all arguments to the contrary, the continued development of zoos seems to be a valid policy. The old defects will be overcome. Surroundings will be made larger and more natural. There is also a strong case for the specialized zoo or sanctuary, such as the woolly monkey sanctuary at Looe, in Cornwall, UK. This provides conservation, education about their kinship and social life in natural colonies, plus personal contact, with opportunities to touch and groom; also lectures. The future may lie in this direction."

        "title": "Write a critical account of the newspapers and popular magazines produced in your country.",
        "content": "In a democratic country, every aspect of the popular press is constantly under review by parliament and the general public; ownership, management, political shade, production method and freedom under the law are factors perpetually in dispute.\n\nThis essay attempts to comment on the press in Britain. It excludes the multiplicity of learned and technical journals which cover every imaginable private interest ranging from theology to karate, from motor cars to bee-keeping. These are not controversial.\n\nIn Britain newspapers are privately owned by wealthy individuals or consortia. Foreigners are free to buy in. Australians such as Rupert Murdoch own several nationals; however, any attempt by one person or group to buy an excessive number of titles would be denounced in the House of Commons and probably be brought before the Monopolies Commission. The government neither owns nor controls the press. Hence the freedom of the press remains a jealously guarded privilege. How therefore is the situation saved from the irresponsible individual?\n\nLanguage. English, French, Russian, German and Italian are international languages. They have the capability of dealing with modern technology. English has been taught for decades in schools all over the world as the second and sometimes the first language. Politics may dictate that English is given less prominence. However, trade, industry and technology nowadays demand two-way travel, and a lingua franca is essential. So to preserve the national language it is necessary for schools to give both it and the international language about equal prominence.\n\nDress. Clothes which are native to a country have evolved in relation both to climate and to artistic tradition. It is tempting for both men and women to adopt foreign styles imported by those who visit or settle for commercial and industrial reasons. International fashion affects choice of dress, particularly among young people. In a free country it may be wrong to dictate what people shall wear. However styles can be heavily influenced by the personal choice of prominent men and women. It would be a great loss if all countries assimilated to the styles traditionally worn either in the West or the Eastern bloc.\n\nSocial customs. These are most easily lost. Traditions in respect of births, marriages, deaths, agricultural festivals, attainment of manhood and womanhood and all other indigenous customs must be maintained if a country's culture is to be preserved. Again, this requires the help of government by way of positive encouragement in the shape of leadership and the granting of paid holidays or time off work without loss of income.\n\nArts and crafts. In developing countries there is often a strong input of foreign consumer goods. Every country has its own indigenous products, ranging from household utensils to clothing, sandals and shoes, leather goods, pottery, pictures etc. Despite balance of trade requirements there must be some control over imports of consumer goods and encouragement to continue buying goods of local manufacture. This may mean government subsidies to keep cottage industry financially viable. The continued production of all these items is crucial to the preservation of a country's culture.\n\nWay of life. The traditional roles of men and women are always threatened by the working hours demanded by imported industry and commerce. The agriculture-based work-cycle is easily lost in the five-day nine-to-five working week required when labor is transferred from the land to the factory or office. So also is traditional village housing when new housing is built near the major work places. Inevitably a new Westernized pattern involving shared household duties is imposed and when traditional male and female domestic roles are modified by the new job requirements. Little can be done about this. The upgraded status of women has come to stay.\n\nReligious observance. Enlightened governments always ensure religious freedom and declare national holidays so that the major festivals of all religions may be observed. Taken in aggregate, this free time may be excessive and compromises may have to be reached. Whatever one's personal faith there is little doubt that strong religious conviction continues to exert a beneficial social effect. The bad features of Western culture, the break-up of family life, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity, resulting in AIDS, and crime and anti-social behavior can be blamed, at least partially, on the breakdown of religious faith.\n\nLiterature, music and drama. It goes without saying that governments should encourage the support of all three, if necessary by financial subsidies. They all contribute to the richness of indigenous culture.\n\nIn peacetime, basically by a body called the Press Council. The government or the individual can complain about unfair reporting, the disturbance of personal privacy by journalists, sacrilege, immorality and other abuses. Editors usually take note of this body. The laws of libel of course apply. Material sensitive to national security can be stopped by legal injunctions, sometimes at the order of the Speaker of the House of Commons. In wartime, sensitive material is banned by a 'D Notice'. Otherwise editors can print material which they know will result in libel suits, and sometimes do so. Circulation benefits offset court damages.\n\nThe powerful unions, SOGAT and the NUJ, have hitherto controlled not only printing methods, but also to some extent editorial attitudes, but recently their power has been broken. Fleet Street in London had been hidebound by overmanning and antique printing methods. Rupert Murdoch set up a modern establishment in Wapping, north of the River Thames, and manned his printing works behind barbed wire by non-union labor. Thus he remained viable financially and was free in his editorial comment. Violent picketing continued for a year, but Murdoch set a trend which is being followed by other nationals. His methods were unpopular, but they were direct and effective.\n\nNewspapers in Britain are subdivided among major national dailies and local papers. Evening papers are on sale actually from l0 a.m. and are aimed at commuters. Many provincial papers are weeklies, and sell on local news combined with some national comment.\n\nThe national dailies and Sunday papers, with their color magazines, all have a political bias, based in the paper's history and tradition. These range from Communist papers such as the Star, to right-wing dailies such as the Express and the Sun, so that every shade of opinion is catered for. Such a wide spectrum gives the public a wide choice. In most cases their reporting is fair and factual, though naturally their political interpretations of both home and foreign affairs vary widely. All, including the establishment dailies, the Times and the Telegraphs compete for circulation in various ways. Many run competitions and games of chance. Some seek exclusives to increase sales. The gutter press prints soft-sex photographs and goes in for lurid reporting. All contain news, sport, politics, leaders, features, letters and advertising. At about 25p they are mostly good value for money.\n\nApart from technical journals, magazines in general have lost their hold on the British public because they were largely pictorial. The television has overtaken them. However, women's magazines are as popular as ever. They range from the intellectual -- feminist to the establishment social scene to the traditionally bland and non-controversial women's interest types of periodical."

        "title": "How important is foreign trade to your country?",
        "content": "Discounting the most primitive countries, foreign trade is important to all countries. Even primitive countries need it to some degree. Where peoples have been content with the produce of the land, the herd and the flock, there have always been itinerant traders, e.g. the Arabs who skirted the Sahara from Egypt to the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, Nigeria etc. They brought brass, ivory and woven goods to be exchanged for local artifacts. Modern communications have introduced more sophisticated needs even to primitive tribes. Chiefs and leaders have traveled and sometimes been educated in Western and Westernized countries.\nEvery country has a currency, a gross national product, and a sum of capital raised out of taxation. The currency has a strength related to other currencies with which it is grouped. That strength depends on keeping a fair balance between imports and exports. Where exports outweigh imports the currency becomes relatively strong, with two good results and one bad one.\n\nThe individual has good purchasing power. Foreign investment is encouraged by high interest rates which in turn control imports. However, exported goods become too expensive, and export trade becomes depressed. A careful government will seek a balance. Without high interest rates a trade balance will fall apart. Imports will grossly exceed exports and there may be a run on the currency, leading to inflation and increased unemployment.\n\nThe gross national product is derived from taxation and from the exploitation of natural resources. Minerals, oil and gas are often licensed for development to foreign companies, thus providing the government with a substantial extra income. A wise government will again find a balance between liquidating debt, improving social amenity in all its forms, and dropping the rate of taxation. The latter encourages the creation of new wealth by the individual and by the firm, at any rate in capitalistic countries. Socialist countries eschew the free market which all of the above implies as the means of raising the general standard of living. Instead imports, exports, the currency, wages and the distribution of the gross national product are strictly regulated by a bureaucracy. In the case of a despotism, the GNP is cynically used only for the benefit of the leader and the party in power.\n\nIn answer to the question, and in the light of the above, everything depends on the country in question.\n\nFor example, your country has an economy based in rubber tapping, agriculture and fishing. Subsistence is no problem. Villages are traditionally self-supporting. However, there is political unrest, because a neighboring country enjoys a much greater variety of consumer goods. The democratic government plans to raise your standard of living in all departments Where is the money to come from?\n\nMuch of it may come from the exploitation of the off-shore oil and gas already located by foreign mineralogists. This is a long-term project and the income derived from concessions to foreign oil companies will not be received for, say, five to ten years. The enhancement of foreign trade is more short-term and realistic. Yet, there are few factories and no products capable of competing abroad. To import what the people desire without exporting correspondingly would damage the economy.\n\nAs a government you decide to enter the overseas electronics market. New factories will be built in industrial areas adjacent to the big cities. Initial funding will come from the world bank. Foreign experts will supervise the installation of machinery, institute training schemes for the new labor force, advise on quality control and competitiveness overseas. A range of electronic products will be available for export with a limited quantity for the home market, in two years' time. A range of consumer perishables and durables can then be admitted.\n\nTaxation can then be graded from a low standard rate upwards. Only then, and after debts are repaid or serviced, can thought be given to the country's more general standard of living."

        "title": "Discuss the causes and consequences of erosion.",
        "content": "Erosion is the eating or wearing away of land features. It is caused by a variety of factors, some natural, others man-made. The consequences can he serious both for the natural world and for man himself.\n\nThe natural causes are weathering, water, ice, wind and change of temperature. The changes may be very gradual, sometimes taking millions of years and dating back to the major upheavals of the planet when the earth was very young. Wind and rain driving incessantly against sandstone, formed originally by immense pressures on early sea-beds and then lifted above sea-level by volcanic eruption or the clash of land-plates, wears the stone back into sand, thus creating beaches along the seashore. In the case of harder rock such as granite, surfaces are worn smooth.\n\nWeathering also erodes exposed coastlines in temperate zones. Often cliffs and dunes simply disappear over perhaps a short period of two or three hundred years. The sea encroaches, and sometimes coastal villages are lost. There is written evidence of English villages having been lost under the waves.\n\nThe sea also plays its part in the erosion process. The Netherlands, facing the turbulent North Sea, have for centuries fought the battle against salt water encroachment due to erosion. Great dikes have been built to exclude the sea, and gradually the low-lying salt flats have been sweetened and fertilized for agriculture and bulb-growing. In another way, the sea also erodes rock fragments by friction due to the tides. The smooth pebbles on northern beaches are the result of their having rubbed together over millions of years.\n\nThe great ice-floes attached to the poles play a conspicuous part in regulating sea levels. In general, sea levels are thought to be rising, though opinions vary as to the rate. At present, many fear what is called the greenhouse effect , i.e. the punching of holes in the ozone layer due to industrial gases and the use of CFCs. Nations are beginning to agree to eliminate these hazards. The result might be the melting of the ice-caps causing a devastating rise in sea levels. This would put much of the land in temperature climates under sea-water.\n\nSlow-moving glaciers also have an effect. Their immense power pulverizes any rocks in their path. The piles of shale at the foot of many mountains resulted from the pressure of glaciers millions of years ago.\n\nWind is probably the greatest single cause of erosion. Where there is no protection given to the soil, and after a period of drought or intense heat, the soil crumbles to dust and literally blows away. Man himself can either let this happen or take steps to prevent it. Rain, of course, has a dual effect. In some circumstances, it can wash away the soil into river beds, where it is carried down to estuaries, often silting them so that they require dredging. Inland, and on flat territory, rain holds the soil together. Yet, rain depends on trees and foliage which cause clouds to precipitate. The central plains of North America from time to time become dust bowls, simply because all vegetarian has been cleared in favor of large-scale, economic cereal growing. The same clearance of rain forests goes on currently in South America in favor of cash crops. Conservationists throughout the world are resisting these clearances, but are fighting vested interests.\n\nThe rain forests support a wide variety of animals, birds, insects and plants, many of which can only exist in their present habitat. This is an added reason for resisting deforestation. Sooner or later when the forests have gone the climate will change from hot and humid to dry. The soil will crumble and erode.\n\nTribes dependent on land for grazing and agriculture lose their herds, flocks and food. They become nomads or refugees and are exposed to epidemic and starvation. Erosion can cause much human suffering.\n\nEven in temperature countries large-scale farming is now being discouraged, for the foregoing reasons. In England such farming has meant the destruction of hedges, ditches and trees, again spoiling traditional landscapes and the habitats of bird, animal and insect species.\n\nSome erosion is natural and inevitable. Much however is caused by man. Long term conservation is essential if man is to pass on a beautiful planet to future generation."

        "title": "How important is ceremony in your country?",
        "content": "The importance varies, but few would argue that ceremony is totally irrelevant. Some ceremonies are of course mere tradition, and as such may be irritants.\n\nFor example, in Britain there is almost universal respect for the monarch. Yet, she and her court are hemmed in by ceremonies which is this day and age would be laughable if they were not pernicious. In fact the court consists of aristocrats whose function is both to preserve the mystique surrounding the monarch and the rigid class structure which they head. A typical example is that one has to leave a room in which the monarch is seated by walking backwards, no easy exercise. The same applies to an official leaving the Commons chamber when the Speaker is seated.\n\nThis is not an argument for the abolition of ceremonial, merely for rational updating. Many ceremonies have a laudable basis. They are often spectacular, and hence enjoyable. They provide relief from the humdrum greyness of daily life. They bring to mind the country's best traditions. In animistic societies ceremony implies the satisfying of the gods which rule human destiny. Ceremonies dignify human relationships. They sometimes provide a good excuse for enjoyable public holidays. Latin countries would never give up their fiestas. Ceremonial may reflect the structure of government.\n\nSome of this applies to Britain. Reverting to the monarch, I quote three examples. First, the state opening of parliament. The queen ratifies legislation, though she has political influence rather than power. Yet, she reads a speech in which my government will pass this act and that. Seated with her lords, she excludes the commons until black rod has knocked three times on the chamber door. This underlines the titular, though not actual superiority of the unelected lords over the commons. Secondly, the Trooping the Colour, which supplies even more pageantry. As head of the armed forces, the queen takes the salute of her guards, whose colors, in rotation, are paraded before her. This, and the daily changing of the guard, provide a great tourist attraction. Thirdly, the queen's visits to the City of London. Traditionally, the 'square mile' is independent territory, outside the queen's jurisdiction. She has to lay aside the sword of state and receive the Lord Mayor's permission to enter ceremonially. The Lord Mayor has an annual show, the floats in the parade reflecting all aspects of national life. However, at all ceremonial functions, whether the queen is present or not, the national anthem is played, underlining the loyalty of all her subjects to their titular head. Great ceremony marks the visits of foreign heads of state; banquets, parades, gun salutes. When such heads of state are respectable individuals, well and good. Often, they are insignificant, sometimes trumped-up gangsters. Then such ceremonies are hollow irritants, and the population resents both the hypocrisy and the traffic chaos caused in the Westminster area.\n\nFor some, though perhaps a minority of Britons, ceremonial affects courtship, engagement and marriage. Reflecting the old subservience of the girl to her father, the prospective husband will court the girl for some time, and then ask her father's permission to become engaged. His financial prospects will be considered. Marriage will be in church, where the ceremony will have as much tradition as religious content. Ideally, all this is meant to underline the permanency of marriage. Burial or cremation also demands ceremony, formal dress and tributes to the deceased.\n\nCeremonial dress may reflect history. There are special uniforms, all designed to impress, for the diplomatic corps, for courtiers, for service chiefs, for lords lieutenant, for mayors and lord mayors. Non- official civilians are desired to wear tail coats and silk hats for state functions. Dinner-jackets are required for formal dinners. Elaborate gowns and hoods are de riguer for university functions. All this originated in the desire to preserve certain standards of behavior, or to instill respect. Judges and barristers are be-wigged in court. When Britain was a colonial power, all expatriates changed into evening dress for dinner, even in the most primitive outstations.\n\nIt goes without saying that religious services are based on ceremonials, all of which have a devotional significance. Attempts are often made to simplify or exclude ceremonial, but there is little doubt that the soul of man responds to color, movement and beauty.\n\nIn Britain, ceremonial remains important, but many think that it is high time the more meaningless examples were abolished."

        "content": "Obviously the practical means of doing so lies in the hands of the police force, para-military anti-riot forces, and, in the last resort, the armed forces themselves. In democratic countries, these are firmly under the control of civilian governments, the members of which are freely elected.\nGovernments legislate and judiciaries administer the law. However, the degree of control over the individual and the nature of the sanctions to be applied depend partly on the traditions of the country concerned and partly on the seriousness of the law and order problems which the country faces.\n\nWhat are today's problems? Political protest, leading to strikes, street demonstrations, physical violence, use of arms and weapons, mob violence and vandalism, looting, and in extreme cases, civil war. Football violence, such as has recently excluded England from matches in Europe. Crime against the person and against property e.g. murder, rape, theft, burglary and vandalism. These evils spread from country to country by imitation through international media publicity. Paradoxically, they also spread when law and order sanctions are either tightened or relaxed. This dilemma faces Mr. Gorbachev precisely because of glasnost and perestroika, particularly insofar as political unrest spreads through the Soviets and Russia's satellite neighbors.\n\nSo the distinction between personal and political motivation behind lawlessness must be made. Where the motivation is personal, i.e. based in natural violence, social resentment due perhaps to deprivation, greed, sexual amorality, hatred or drug-induced mental states, then sanctions must be toughened as required. There are arguments for and against the death penalty, but there is little doubt that it provides an effective deterrent. There are arguments against physical punishments, but they also deter. English law provides severer penalties for offences against property than against the person. In view of the muggings, street and public transport violence experienced today, this must be reversed.\n\nThe modish, liberal explanation of the increase of such crime is that society rejects the poor and underprivileged. Rebuild slum areas and offer more government handouts and crime would disappear . This is nonsense. What is society but a collection of individuals? Every individual is endowed with personal choice. The individual must be made to choose the law and order path. Religion and morality must be instilled into children in the home, in the school and in the workplace. Some form of compulsory national service of a non-military nature would benefit young adults of all racial origins and of both sexes.\n\nThe more difficult question is that of offence against law and order when the motivation is truly political. Do citizens owe a duty to support and preserve the established order in return for the benefits they receive from it? If not, at what point does the freedom fighter become the terrorist? At what point in a democracy does the legitimate lobby become the violent, chanting, vociferous and sometimes blackmailing pressure group? The answers must of course depend on the political stance of the individual. Again however the distinction between political and personal motivation must be clearly made. In Ireland, religion and politics are used as a cover for common criminality. In South Africa, the motivation behind violence is often tribal rivalry or the instinct to loot, pillage and murder.\n\nThe justification for using the sanctions already mentioned in order to maintain law and order when offences are political lies in the quality of any country's government. Where there is democracy, where there is a multi-party system, where the legal system is fair, where human rights including that of free speech within the law are preserved, there lies the justification. When these things are denied then there can be a case for resistance, even revolution.\n\nYet, underlying the spread of common criminality is the flight from religion and morality and the weakening of the family system. Much youth delinquency could be pre-empted by discipline in the home, school and work-place, always provided the motivation behind such discipline is affection and the true well-being of the young person."

        "title": "How can we as individuals become more healthy?",
        "content": "The three basics are food, sleep and exercise, though the balance depends on age. As we get older, we tend to need less of all three. Metabolism slows with age, so we feel less hungry; with age we become less active and therefore need less sleep. However, all three basics are required at any age if we are to remain relatively young and healthy throughout our allotted span.\nFor the purpose of this essay, let us assume that you are a young man or woman of about eighteen years. You have an interest in sport as well as in academic work, preparatory to employment. You look forward to a long, active trouble-free, healthy life. No doubt you have been inoculated against the common killers such as typhoid, tetanus, diphtheria etc. Let us also assume that you have been born with healthy genes and have both a normal resistance to disease and a good recovery rate. You were not born with any physical defects or handicaps which require special medical treatment. You have an average to good health record. You wish to keep your health, even improve it.\n\nTake food. The temptation is to overeat. Stop when you stop feeling hungry. When this is socially difficult go without the next meal. What to eat? Try to avoid convenience foods; keep the intake of carbohydrates, fats and sugar low. Protein builds the body without thickening the waistline. All this of course assumes that a balanced and varied diet is available. Nobody could lecture the Ethiopian or the refugee or the very poor on this subject. When to eat? Three meals a day should be enough for a young man; one too many for an old man. Eating sweets, chocolates, ice creams, cakes etc between meals can undo all your good intentions. Fresh vegetables, not over-cooked, are excellent. If you can obtain fresh food in variety, good. Eat according to the rules, and forget food! And don't forget, ladies, that you also need food. Too much slimming can destroy appetite and lead to the downward spiral of starvation; anorexia.\n\nSleep is even more crucial than food. Eight hours per night for the young person, six to seven for the elderly. A medium to hard bed and circulating fresh air make for the deepest sleep. Most experts advise going to bed seasonably early, say not much after 11 p.m. The late-night film or disco should be the exception.\n\nA seasonable amount of exercise is essential to everybody. Most young people play sport, often team games, football, basketball etc and this, plus walking, sunning and cycling keeps the body in tune and sets up the kind of strength and stamina which pays dividends in later life in health. It is a mistake to give up activity when we exchange studentship for employment. All too quickly the body runs to fat. Some sedentary workers are out of breath after climbing one flight of stairs. Strenuous exercise in youth, phased down to walking, golf and swimming in later years, goes a long way to prevent heart and respiratory problems.\n\nAny normally healthy person, sticking to the above regime, will get healthier and stay that way. Yet, these are three final points. The first is to try to learn to kill needless anxiety, and to adopt a positive approach to life. Nobody can predict the future, so day by day living, albeit with an overall plan, is required. Worry and depression, i.e. psychological weakness, can be very detrimental to health.\n\nThe second is to practice normal hygiene. Cleanliness, especially in food preparation, is essential. Yet, nobody can create a totally sterile environment. Most of us have more built-in resistance to disease, however, than we imagine. Thirdly, smoking and alcohol. If you have never started, don't. However, and despite the pressure lobbies, moderation in both has never been finally proved harmful. Field Marshal Montgomery once boasted to Sir Winston Churchill, 'I neither smoke nor drink, and I am 100% fit'.\n\nChurchill replied, 'I do bath, and I am 200% fit.' Churchill outlived Monty by many years."

        "content": "Breathes there a man with soul so dead\n\nWho never to himself hath said,\n\nThis is my own, my native land!\n\nWhose heart hath ne'er within him burned,\n\nAs home his footsteps he hath turned\n\nFrom wandering on a foreign strand?'\n\nThus Sir Walter Scott felt about the mist, the heather, the mountains, lakes and snows of Scotland, his own native land. So do most of us, and this stems from affection and familiarity rather than from political and nationalistic considerations. So also must be Singaporean, away on business overseas, or the Vietnamese boat-person who cannot master a foreign language.\n\nIn my own case, at least fourteen years of my life has been spent in a series of permanent Army postings abroad. Two were spent on the beautiful island of Singapore, six in Germany during the second world war and again later, three in West Africa, three in Palestine. Each time I flew into the UK my heart leapt at the green familiarity of the little fields and villages, the woods and streams, the undulating landscape, as the plane came in to land.\n\nYet, there is much more to it than love of one's own countryside. I have lived permanently in my own country for the past eighteen years and have learnt all over again to appreciate the many factors which are most important to me, and which, as a young man, I thought I could do without.\n\nFirst and foremost, and this is perhaps selfish, I would miss family and friends if, for some reasons, I had to emigrate. In my latter years, it is an enormous pleasure to live near my sons and their families. Both sons, as it happens, are happy and successful. One is a member of Parliament and the other is a flourishing barrister. It would be sad indeed to miss their progress. It would also be a great loss if I could not watch the week-by-week development of my five grandchildren.\n\nAn then -- friends. What is life without them? Old friends especially. Those with whom we have shared experience, the ups and downs of life. Of course, we make friends abroad too but it is not always easy to identify with people from a totally different background. Again, one can practice one's religion anywhere. Yet is the overseas church, or mosque or temple quite the same as one's own?\n\nThere is always the language barrier, especially for the English. The fact that English is today's international language is no paradox. It is simply that our ancestors overseas, in the days when England was a great colonial power and had a trading empire, expected foreigners to learn English, though there were exceptions to this autocratic outlook. The fact remains that to speak one's own language in one's own country guarantees immediate contact and understanding. Perhaps Chinese, Malays, and some other far Eastern nationals do not see this as a problem. Unlike the lazy Englishman who will not learn, they can and do.\n\nWhat else did I miss when overseas? Perhaps the British political and legal system and the freedoms we take for granted. Life abroad can be minefield for those who do not study the laws and customs of their country of adoption. At home, one is brought up to know about these things and to avoid mistakes. One English tradition is that of freedom of speech, that is, within the law. This also applies to the written word. The principle is 'I disagree with all you say, but I would defend your right to say it to the death'. This means that the English can criticize the monarchy, the government, religion and law with impunity, a freedom not universally conferred. One would miss that in a country where to transgress might mean prison, or even a death sentence.\n\nThe center of this freedom is the English pub , or public house. Every village has one or two, every town has several. People talk, gossip, let off steam, and put the world to rights over a drink, in comfort, and in congenial company. The pub is perhaps the reason why there has been no revolution in England since 1688. There is no equivalent institution abroad.\n\nGood hospitals, good libraries, good clothes, good food and drink, good concerts and theatres, and good quality consumer goods are some of the other things.\n\nEngland has many faults but I can say with Scott 'this is my own, my native land!'"

        "title": "What can be done to alleviate suffering in the world ?",
        "content": "We live in a world in which we are perpetually exposed to what William Shakespeare described as the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. It is true that much suffering is caused by accident and natural disaster and is therefore almost unavoidable. A drunken car driver may kill or maim. Hurricanes and earthquakes leave a trail of death, injury and havoc. Some steps may be taken to lessen the likelihood of this kind of suffering by imposing severe penalties for drunken driving, or living, if possible, outside hurricane and earthquake centers, but the innocent still suffer, and are likely to go on suffering.\nUnmerited suffering has always perplexed philosophers, who can rarely say more than that we live in an imperfect world. Religions supply explanations; God, or the gods, punish mankind for breaking the divine law, and to some extent this is true. Abuse of alcohol, tobacco, drugs and sex carries with it automatic retribution. Whether catastrophe is a direct form of retribution for sin, imposed by a divine being or beings is very doubtful. What is quite evident is that we are required to live in a world which is dangerous, and whatever protection from either natural or man-made disaster we can find has to be made by ourselves. Some religions teach that there will be an after-life in which all wrongs will be set right, and where the injustices of this life will be redressed. This enables the faithful to put up with whatever misfortune comes their way in the hope of better things to come. Suffering has to be faced by everybody, sooner or later, and it is no use philosophing about divine impartiality. \"God's rain falls on the just and the unjust\", says the Old Testament. Nearer the mark is this rather flippant rhyme;\n\nThe rain it raineth every day\n\nUpon the just and unjust fella,\n\nBut mostly on the just, because\n\nThe unjust hath the just's umbrella\".\n\nThe lessons of history are against the probability of abolishing suffering, yet that is the ideal, the objective towards which all civilized human beings should work.\n\nIf selfishness and hatred could be replaced by unselfishness and love, this would go a long way towards the alleviation of suffering. Ever since pre-history there have been wars, usually caused either by pure aggression or by greed for fertile land or natural resources. Since 1945 war has taken on a new and horrific dimension. Though nuclear bombs have been used only against Japan, there is a proliferation of nuclear weapons, and recently there have been terrible examples of the use of napalm, nerve gases, and chemical armaments. There is no need to enlarge on the resultant suffering. And since all these armaments are universally available, and since the arms trade virtually knows no boundaries, any real progress must lie in the direction of multi-lateral disarmament and severe restriction on the arms trade. This can only be achieved by a move towards the one-world concept and a heightened respect for the dignity and basic rights of the individual.\n\nThe latter point raises the matter of political systems. Most civilized countries today are governed democratically rather than autocratically. The democratization of much of Eastern Europe is a real step forward. Gone are the secret police and the barbarous acts perpetrated against the individual by the previous regimes. However, political oppression and brutality to dissenters still exists in many parts of the world. It is to be hoped that the major powers will exert such pressure that autocracies will finally be overthrown. With that overthrow could come an end to torture and the physical and mental degradation which continues to scar the face of humanity.\n\nThere are three final points. First, religious fanaticism, an age-old problem. Does God want Holy Wars and the self-sacrifice of teenagers on the battlefield? Does God approve of hostage-taking, of the bombing of town centers or aircraft? There is one theme common to all true religious belief; \"Do unto others as you would they do unto you\".\n\nSecond, the poverty of the third world . The wars waged by, and the cynicism shown by many third-world leaders should be brought to an end, if necessary by force. International and voluntary aid is often diverted to the purchase of arms and the feeding of troops.\n\nFinally, the frailty of the human body itself. It is is true that God allows physical suffering but has given man the intellect to alleviate or prevent it, then medical research must not be hampered. Science is on the way to finding the cause, and therefore the elimination of cancer and other inherited diseases. Genetic in vitro probes can also prevent the birth of handicapped children. Research must be given the green light."

        "title": "Is air travel as safe as it should be ?",
        "content": "Statistically, air travel is reasonably safe when compared with road, rail and sea. Many countries have a high death and injury rate on the roads; train, ferry and ocean-going ship disasters are regular enough to be commonplace, taking a global view. Yet, air disasters are usually fatal to all or most concerned and are therefore more widely reported. Consequently, there is international pressure to make air travel as safe as possible, and rightly so. Yet, no form of travel can be made totally safe. The causes of disaster, whether natural or man-made, can never be completely eliminated.\nLooking first at natural causes, at least three can be identified. Bad weather is one. This includes storm, icing and air-pockets in the case of light aircraft; less so in the case of large jets with sophisticated instrumentation. One cause in the case of jets can be large flocks of birds or swarms of insects being sucked into the jet nacelles and thereby stopping the engines. This may happen at low altitudes. Little can be done to prevent this. A third is the alleged danger in what is known as the \"Bermuda Triangle\", in which both ships and aircraft have been lost without trace. In the case of aircraft the reason may be the loss of horizon due to electrical disturbance.\n\nMost dangers to aircraft however are man-made. The first and obvious danger is collision. In the busiest airports, especially in the tourist season, aircraft may take off as often as every twenty seconds. Much strain is imposed on aircraft dispatchers and traffic control generally. Clearance for dispatch is by radar and computer. Personal fatigue or mechanical failure in a radar center can be very dangerous. Aircraft often have to circle before being given landing permission, and collision or perhaps a near miss can result from mistakes in assigning heights. Most, though not all, countries have strict regulations governing air traffic control. Any strike by operatives will cause grounding -- bad enough, but preferable to taking risks.\n\nAnother cause of trouble may be the age of the aircraft. Metal fatigue eventually sets in; cracks appear, bits of the aircraft may fall off, even whole engines, or the passenger cabin may lose compression. This means almost certain death to all passengers and crew, and there have been cases where an aircraft has been lost because one of the doors was not properly secured. The important of safety checks before take-off is obvious. So also is the importance of regular and completely efficient servicing. Operatives' licenses can be withdrawn if government inspectors find inefficiency in this area. Most modern aircraft can shut down engines which catch fire, deal automatically with the fire, and proceed on three, or even two engines.\n\nCabin fires are equally dangerous. They may occur for any reason, but in many cases they result from a crash landing causing the fuel to ignite. Two things are important here. First, cabin exit must be unimpeded. Some modern aircraft have built-in chutes for swift escape. Much of course depends on cabin staff and their ability to prevent panic. Second, the seat upholstery must be non-flammable. Many people have died from the noxious smoke emanating from flammable upholstery.\n\nThere is argument today about emergency drills. Normally a steward will explain life-jackets for use should there be a sea landing, and just mention oxygen masks which are lowered to each seat. Should all these by physically tried out by all passengers prior to take-off ? Such drills are boring and time-consuming, but the time may come when they are mandatory.\n\nSome disasters are caused by pilot error. Recently, a Shackleton in fog crashed into a hillside in Britain, killing twenty-five young men. The plane has a good safety record. Again recently the pilot of a plane with a faulty engine shut down the good engine due to the failure of his instrumentation. The plane crashed, killing most occupants, and virtually destroying a small village. Sometimes instrumentation can be affected by electronic interference due to unauthorized equipment carried in the hold or hand luggage. This hazard can be eliminated.\n\nNot much can be done about terrorism except through airfield security and electronic vetting of all passengers and luggage. Unhappily not all airports are really efficient in this regard. Efficiency would arrest the terrorist and the hijacker on the airport.\n\nFinally, attempts by carriers to economize on pilot coverage and seating space must be prevented by law. The two essentials are fresh and fully-trained pilots, and reasonable space for movement in emergency.\n\nThe answer to the question is no. Much could still be done to avert future disasters."

        "content": "Music has always occupied a firm place in the life of every community. Travel, conquest and trade have led to the mutual enrichment of musical traditions, though on a very limited scale as compared with today. Distance is no longer an object. So the worldwide musical situation has become fluid. Roughly speaking, music has developed tonally in the West and atonally in the East; that is to say in the West an octave has eight tones with corresponding semitones; in the East the same span of sound has no such specific divisions. Yet, in recent times each system has affected the other. East and West have become more familiar with each other's music, and each other's music has become mutually popular. China, Japan and other Far Eastern countries now produce virtuoso in Western modes of performance, particularly the piano and violin. Many Eastern professionals take their place in Western orchestras.\nIndigenous music has always been connected with life experience rather than with purely aesthetic appreciation. Communities have music to reflect the moods of birth, marriage, death, war, celebration, commiseration, dance and religious ceremonial. The five basic instruments have developed in parallel; percussion, pipes, trumpets, horns and strings. Most countries are reverting to the sophisticated versions of these instruments. The danger is that thereby the traditional forms of these instruments may be lost. Many arts councils are alive to this problem.\n\nThere is a place for music to reflect our feelings about all the main events of life. Yet, there is an equal place for purely aesthetic appreciation. Most countries offer ample opportunities; radio and television, records, tapes, CDs as well as live concerts. More and more good music is being heard by all age-groups, and, with some reservations, this can only have a good effect. Music can be both the \"food of love\" and a means of \"soothing the savage brow\".\n\nNowadays schools and especially caring families seek to give children a grounding in music both as listeners and performers because this will enrich their leisure time in the future. This tuition should begin early, and before the child's life becomes over-complicated by sport and academic study. Children who are truly interested show promise by the age of six or seven.\n\nInevitably, almost all young people throughout the world are confronted by the pop scene . This may have no appeal at all to their seniors but must not be condemned out of hand, because its freedom, novelty and variety reflect the instincts of independence, protest, calf-love and sympathy with the underprivileged which characterize the teenager. The pop scene began in the USA and Britain in the early 60s but unfortunately was associated with some bad things; drug-taking, sexual dancing, alcohol and sexual promiscuity. The lyrics often overtly promoted these things -- an original Beatles song \"Lucy in the sky with diamonds\" threw up the initials LSD. For these reasons pop music was banned by the USSR for thirty years. This was extreme, if understandable. However, pop music will always have its place with the young in the modern world.\n\nThe main things young people should be helped to realize is that pop music is transient, of poor quality, and swiftly out of fashion. Secondly, it may be promoted by cynical individuals anxious to exploit drugs, sex and violence. \"Acid house\" parties are now banned in the UK. Thirdly, such music, e.g. \"heavy metal\", when played too loudly can injure hearing and be a nuisance to neighbors. The \"ghetto-blaster\" should be banned. On the positive side, pop concerts in the West have raised enormous sums for charity to benefit third-world countries.\n\nIncreasingly, music impinges on many aspects of modern life. We are now accustomed to the nuisance of \"muzak\" tapes in bars, lifts (elevators), restaurants, railway stations, car radios, long distance buses, aircraft, and even the home. Some of us could well do without this intrusive noise. On the other hand some people can do work which does not require too much concentration better with a musical background. Many British wartime factory workers were helped by \"Music while you work\".\n\nMuch of this music today is synthetic and computerized, but not all of it is bad. In fact, it can help to create atmosphere for say a cinema thriller or a TV feature. Music is an essential ingredient in many films, and has been ever since the piano accompanied the silent Charlie Chaplin epic.\n\nWe still need good military music, good church music, even good background tunes for TV serials and adverts. A good tune is a useful trademark.\n\nLike many other features of modem life, music has its place, but it must be kept in its place."

        "title": "How far are our lives today affected by the past ?",
        "content": "\"History is bunk\". This saying was attributed to the late Henry Ford, of the motor company. Though untrue, the statement makes the true point that no approach to the past is ever complete. Therefore the influence of the past on our lives is not easy to assess. Neither should we ignore the fact that in many contexts people deliberately reject the past for a variety of reasons. Yet, it remains true that genetic inheritance is a far more powerful influence on our lives than either upbringing or social environment, and that our genetic make-up has been conditioned by the past.\nYet, we are not entirely the victims of our physical inheritance. We learn a great deal from the attitudes of our parents and grandparents. Some we adopt, others we may reject as old-fashioned or irrelevant. The same applies to our hopes for the future. Just because father and grandfather were manual workers, does this prevent us from obtaining a good education and qualifying for a professional or business career ? Thankfully, in the modern world, and in most countries, it does not. More societies are ceasing to be autocracies, and are becoming meritocracies. The restrictions of the past make us even more aware of the opportunities of the present.\n\nThe same applies to outmoded class systems. Most countries have had class systems based on rank and wealth, supported by almost unbreakable barriers. Thankfully, this is generally less true today. Society is more flexible. If our grandparents kowtowed to the local dignitaries, we are no longer compelled to do the same. Except in countries which preserve autocratic and caste systems, education and opportunity have abolished these old shibboleths.\n\nYet, in many other ways we are still influenced by the past. The families and the societies in which we live are without question given their character by history. In many societies, family tradition is still all-important. Codes of morals, good manners and general behavior are instilled into us as children, and this has been the case for generations. The society into which we were born has its own standards of what is acceptable and what isn't. Most people conform to both, or are identified as drop-outs .\n\nThese pressures to conform stem from the different histories of different countries. A primitive and warlike tribe may put their young men through horrific initiation ceremonies in order to inure them to pain and to test valor, because they must become hunters and warriors, and the young men do not question the ordeal. Families in a country which has a caste system may withhold the freedom of women to choose their own husbands, or at least veto a marriage which is not approved. Women in other countries play a subordinate role because such is the diktat of their national religion. The young people of one African tribe will instinctively hate the people of an adjacent tribe because there has been a long history of warfare between the two.\n\nIn more advanced countries, military and naval traditions, which are deeply rooted in history, play a major role, especially in wartime. So does geography. The citizens of a small country surrounded by powerful neighbors, and frequently the victim of invasion, live in a perpetual perhaps subconscious fear of a repetition, and are often slow to develop independence and a sense of national pride. On the other hand, an island such as Britain, never successfully invaded since 1066 A.D., maintains a fierce pride in its freedoms and independence -- hence Britain's reluctance to become a European state. And from this stemmed the seafaring tradition which in the past enabled Britain to build an empire.\n\nAgain, some countries have developed by evolution, others through revolution. Both kinds may now be democracies, but in countries such as France the \"will of the people\" plays a much greater part than in countries where anomalies and injustices have been eliminated by parliamentary and legal reform.\n\nPerhaps the chief factor which affects our lives is education, and the style of education which any country offers is deeply rooted in its history. The teaching of history itself always has a national emphasis, which always colors the student's outlook.\n\nIn spite of modern communication, in spite of the modern, modish concept of a world community , in spite of the rebellious atmosphere of the 1960s in the USA and the UK, in spite even of glasnov and perestroika, the main influences on our lives stem from the history of the country in which we happen to live. This is mediated through the society to which we belong, and the families which gave us birth."

        "content": "A slightly eccentric professor of archaeology in West Africa would neither answer the telephone nor reply to letters. As for letters, he would say, leave them long enough and they answer themselves. As for the telephone, I consider it an unwarranted intrusion. If people want to talk to me they can come and see me. Of course, the world could not carry on in its modern way without the telephone, which has become an essential part of living. Yet, in some respects it can be a curse.\nToday, telephonic communication is worldwide and instantaneous. It is possible to dial people at the other end of the world without even going through an operator. This is fine, providing the time-differences are remembered. More seriously, in conjunction with satellite television, world news is instantly on our screens, sometimes even as it happens. Such exposure of, usually, unhappy events, wars, accidents, acts of terrorism etc can actually have a bad influence on the course of a war, a hostage-taking, or a tribal massacre. When it took a British ship four months to deliver a letter to or from, say, India, the crisis had often been settled locally, with much less anxiety all round.\n\nThe telephone has greatly decreased the volume of mail worldwide. Some letters have to be written, of course, but the art of private letter writing has become a dying art. Writing a good letter means first collecting then sorting out one's thoughts, and the finished article can be something to be proud of, a small masterpiece. And because letters today are considered of secondary importance, mail services in many countries have greatly deteriorated.\n\nOne of the most annoying experiences in life is to be seated in somebody's office and to begin to talk business when suddenly the telephone rings. \"Oh, excuse me\", says the official, \"I must answer this\". Why should the telephone be given priority over the individual who has taken the trouble to attend in person ?\n\nThe telephone can become a curse in the home, when it is abused either by the caller or by a family member. Most countries have customary hours for mealtimes, and a caller who is determined to speak to you at all costs will often make use of this knowledge, interrupt your meal, and perhaps or perhaps not apologize for doing so. Small wonder that many people take the phone off the hook when they sit down to eat.\n\nThere are the callers you can well do without. Some commercial concerns employ salespeople to use the hard sell on the telephone, and this is becoming such a nuisance that in many cases the problem is being brought under legal control. The worst kind of unwanted calls are abusive calls or obscene calls, made usually to single women and often late at night. Modern telephone systems can be made to identify the source of these calls, and this should go some way to helping the police solve the problem.\n\nFamily members have been mentioned, and here one thinks of the commercial exploitation of teenagers who are pressed to use chat-lines to pour out their troubles, or to talk to teenager pals overseas. Neither occupation offers any benefit, and the parents' phone bill may become astronomical.\n\nDoes all this mean that the telephone is really a curse? Of course not. Like any other advance in science the telephone is neutral. If it is abused, it becomes a curse. If properly used it is a great blessing in many ways.\n\nTo the lonely person, telephone chats are a blessing. To the disabled person, the telephone may be the only means of keeping in touch with family and friends. To the business, the stock exchange, and countless other features of modern life, the telephone is essential. In the police response to crime, in fire or medical emergencies, the telephone is indispensable. In all matters which require urgent communication and quick response, such as the locating of suitable bodily organs for transplant surgery, the telephone is a boon. For air to ground and ship to shore communication, the telephone is vital. Properly and responsibly used, it is a blessing."

        "title": "What are the qualities of a good teacher ?",
        "content": "Every student has his or her favorite teacher, but that teacher may not be the best qualified person on the teaching staff. In other words, although the mastery of the subject or subjects taught, plus an enthusiastic approach, is an essential prerequisite in a teacher, it is far from being the only qualification. There are some who know their subjects but totally fail to put them across to the students.\nLet us first examine the negative side. Unless the teacher has a voice which carries, without shouting, there will always be inattention at the back of the class. There are teachers who cannot stop talking, and who will lecture a class for forty minutes. Most students will be asleep after the first fifteen minutes. There are teachers whose manners and dress are eccentric; they may be popular, but few students take them seriously. There are teachers who either shout at or speak sarcastically to backward students. They are disliked by the whole class. There are teachers who prefer to talk about the football team or a certain television program rather than the subject they are paid to teach. While this again may achieve popularity, it certainly evokes no respect. There are teachers whose lives are marred by drink, drugs, or sexual deviation. These cannot begin to be effective teachers. So what are the positive qualities the student looks for ?\n\nA good teacher must be able to exercise discipline. Teaching cannot begin in an unruly class. In the past, class discipline has usually been strict and inflexible. The more modern approach is to allow more freedom of speech and movement, though no individual can be allowed to dominate proceedings by rough and noisy behavior. All teachers know the difference between a lively and a disruptive student. To be able to exert the right kind of discipline can be learnt, but this is often by bitter experience. There are a few fortunate men and women who have only to walk into a classroom to create order. Unfortunately there are more whose entry is a signal for chaos.\n\nStudents are always ready to work to the best of their ability for someone whom they respect, for two reasons. The first is the desire to please that person. The second, more important reason, is the knowledge that the teacher has the student's best interests at heart.\n\nStudy has two objectives, and a careful balance between the two must be kept by the teacher. The first is the ability to instill a love of the subject taught, which will be maintained in adult life. The second is to prepare the students as well as possible for the next examination, be it O or A level or university entrance in some cases. On the other hand, if, say, English is taught exclusively to cover the examination syllabus by means of learning context passages and model answers by heart, the subject will become boring. If there hadn't too much attention paid to generalizations about literature and its place in social evolution, then the lessons may well be interesting but the student will go unprepared into the examination room.\n\nThere should also be a balance between how much work the teacher does and how much the student does. Some modern educational theorists disapprove of any talking by the teacher beyond the bare minimum. Unfortunately, if students' work is not carefully guided, and if they are given free expression in their approach to any subject, most of them will learn nothing of value. Avoiding the lecture habit, the good teacher, who has already done his or her lesson preparation, will help the student to achieve certain objectives in each lesson by, a mixture of verbal instruction and class work. Television, radio and other visual aids are only marginally helpful, and should be kept to a minimum.\n\nIn schools which are not streamed, there will always be class members who are sometimes incapable of doing the work which others find easy. A good teacher will help them individually, sometimes after school hours, and if they are non-achievers, set them simpler work.\n\nTo a certain extent, a good teacher needs to be a psychologist, able to detect and advise on mental blockages, which are sometimes due to outside emotional disturbances. A good teacher should be someone you can trust and talk to, and whose sane advice on your personal problems is worth listening to."

        "title": "Do you think that there is any need for change in the education system in your country?",
        "content": "This essay examines the current situation in England and will, if at all, apply only in part to other countries. Educational tradition and emphasis vary widely, but the fact remains that whereas Eastern and some Western countries are producing young people well-trained for key employment and well-suited to modern life, England is, in 1990, signally failing to do either. How can this decline be reversed?\nFirst, it should be understood that there is a dual system in England. The private, or fee-paying sector stands alongside the state, or free sector, but between the two there is a great gulf fixed. Standards in the private sector remain very high, and produce the best results both academically and behaviorally. A few independent grammar schools likewise succeed, and even fewer comprehensive schools. The state sector is an almost unqualified failure. Many pupils leave school illiterate and innumerate and are fitted only for the lowest-grade jobs. The situation is so bad that both the Labor and the Conservative parties have education at the top of their respective agendas.\n\nThe decline dates from the 1960s, the era of drugs, protest, pop music and the hippy outlook. All this was a reaction against wartime restraints and disciplines, but with the coming of the new freedoms the best of the old tradition was lost. Suddenly the 'teenager' was invented. Neither home nor school could any longer exert discipline. In any case the old sanctions, including corporal punishment, were made illegal. At the same time the economy was booming and there was plenty of work, and therefore money, for young people. So parents, even if they had ambitions for their children, were mostly powerless to instill incentive. At the same time the teaching profession lost heart in the face of classroom chaos and often personal intimidation. To complete the cause for decline, the educational theorists had been at work. Education became child-centered, which means that if little Willy doesn't want to do his match, let him do what he wants. Competitiveness, both in the classroom and on the games field, was frowned on, because to lose, they said, made children feel inferior.\n\nThe consequence of all this was that teaching no longer attracted the best brains, and the profession plummeted in reputation. Both political parties now vie with each other in bringing forward plans to remedy a situation which, if not universally bad, is appalling in the densely-populated city areas.\n\nIdeally, education should offer the pupil three main objectives. These are: to fit well into society, to cope with modern types of employment, and to continue with self-education after school days. Commercially and industrially, England is becoming increasingly integrated into Europe. That, plus national pride and pride in oneself should provide incentive enough. The latent talent is there, but how can these incentives be imparted? And how can teacher quality and morale be improved? Not merely by throwing money at the problem.\n\nThere should be free and subsidized creche places, since most women have to work at least part-time. England has far too many single-parent families. Ideally there would be a return to the traditional family. Parents should help children at home and try to fire their enthusiasm for work. Parental partnership with teachers should be much closer.\n\nState education should drop peripheral subjects and concentrate on the traditional teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic in the early years. Only when they are proficient in these should children branch out into other subjects. There should be state-run examinations at three-yearly intervals. These would not only check the child's progress but also the teacher's proficiency. A system of awards to both teachers and pupils could be introduced. All this implies a national curriculum geared to the objectives outlined above.\n\nAt about age thirteen it will become obvious whether a child is suited to a science or an arts course, or to neither. Separate provision should then be made for all three categories. Youth Training Schemes for the third category should be greatly extended and made compulsory. There should be more technical colleges. Craftsmen should be encouraged to take on apprentices and the income of both should be subsidized.\n\nThe A level and university entrance systems in England are good, and should be preserved, and steps are being taken to improve the O level examinations which are now being replaced by the GCSE.\n\nThe present Conservative government plans to implement many of these ideas. The real problem lies in the middle i.e. in primary and secondary education. Correct this, discard faddy theories, and the new ideas will rapidly bear fruit. Staff will improve, and will therefore be entitled to increased pay and better standing in the community."

        "title": "Is it right that a pop singer should earn more money than a nurse?",
        "content": "Certainly not, if you believe that payment should be related to a person's value to society. The skilled nurse probably saves more lives than either the doctor or the surgeon who, in most countries, are paid infinitely more. In the UK the State Registered Nurse is paid more than the State Enrolled Nurse, because he or she has higher qualifications. Yet, even the highest qualified nurse today cannot afford to service a mortgage on a house. Their union deplores industrial action by the profession, but nevertheless it has meant strikes in the UK to force a reluctant government into financing better incomes in the National Health Service, and in the view of many these incomes remain inadequate.\nThe reason is that in a capitalist society incomes depend on the market economy i.e. supply and demand. If you supply a need and are in a minority you can command a high income. In a socialist state, the government evaluates the contributions of all workers and fixes wages accordingly. This seems a fair system. Yet, the reality of the situation is that any government's ability to pay depends on the size of the gross national product. If this is inadequate, everybody's pay will be low, with the exception of the favored few, and standards of living will also be low. It is therefore an irony that many governments are abandoning socialism in favor of the freedom of the market economy to create wealth. In doing so, they abandon what is perhaps a more moral job evaluation. Because on the whole there are enough nurses, they needn't be paid very high salaries.\n\nAmong young people the demand for pop music is insatiable. The supply is relatively small. The reasons for the demand are complex. Most young people go through a phase from, say, age thirteen to seventeen during which they long for certain things; freedom from parental control and from the accepted behavioral norms of society; freedom from dress conventions; freedom to protest against war, poverty, injustice, the police, sexual conventions, the establishment in general. With the utmost cynicism, the promoters of pop foster all these instincts. The other factor is that nowadays teenagers can earn or be given far more money than the same age-group ever had in earlier days. Thus there is a ready market for records, discs, tapes, T-shirts with the appropriate logos, concerts, TV and radio broadcasts. Unscrupulous promoters are often connected with the drug racket. Cynical promoters cash in on the charitable instincts of the young by organizing band-aid concerts. So whoever loses, the promoter wins. So do a very small proportion of the bands and singers. The vast majority eke out a poor living by playing and singing in public houses (bars) and local halls.\n\nSo the question really refers to the small minority who are successful. For every Madonna, there are a thousand would-bes. The women sometimes descend to pornographic videos and the men become builders' laborers. Few pop performers stand the test of time. Even fewer, who have bought large houses, powerful cars and yachts can save their money or preserve the life-style which belonged to their days of glory.\n\nWe live in a real world, which is fast becoming a shrine of materialism. It is no more moral for a pop singer to earn a fortune that it is for a property dealer or a business tycoon. Yet, that is life in the western and westernized world. What is immoral is that a nurse has to fight for a living wage. Nursing is after all a vocation, like that of the doctor, the priest or the social worker. The people served are more important than the money. Yet, many governments take advantage of the nursing vocation. In some respects they are as cynical as the pop promoters."

        "content": "Genetic research has made rapid strides over the past few years. The analysis of genes has had a practical effect on human medicine as well as on animal and plant life. Tendencies to physical and mental handicap can be detected at the pre-embryo stage, i.e. during the first fourteen days after conception. Manipulation and very early abortion are therefore possible. Opinion is divided as to the morality of this interference. The UK government has achieved approval for genetic research subject to stringent safeguards in its application. The breeding of animals, especially for export, is also affected, as is the development of plants and seeds with an immunity to diseases which previously could only be prevented by dangerous spraying.\nGreat strides have been made in the use of laser beams. These are extreme concentrations of light which have great cutting and penetrative power. They are used medically, for ophthalmic repairs to the retina, for the penetration of opacity in various contexts, e.g. astronomy and military tactics, for public display purposes, and for cutting purposes in industrial work.\n\nElectronics have increasingly wide uses in today's world. This development of ordinary electricity allows its conduction in a gas, a vacuum or a semiconductor. Compact printed circuits are now used in a wide variety of devices ranging from spacecraft to radio and TV sets, computers to screen games and automatic chess boards. Television program changes are now effected by small remote panels which convey recognizable signals which instruct the set itself. Garage doors can be opened automatically by the same means. Security outside lighting around houses comes on automatically when a person approaches within a certain distance. Electronics have permitted a host of new devices such as the cellular telephone. These are cordless, and though limited in range are just as efficient as the old cable version which of course is still in more general use. The police can make reports to base or ask for immediate help in emergencies. Business can be carried on to and from the motor car. The telephone can be used anywhere in the house or garden.\n\nAgain, the use of radio waves has become very widespread. In biology, they are used to study the effect of radiation on living tissue. Radiocarbon, an isotope, is used to date geological strata, old manuscripts, archaeological artifacts, paintings etc. It is also used in genetic research, for sonar and aircraft altimeters, for space astronomy and for the reception of signals from outer space. Radio is crucial to today's investigation of the universe.\n\nFor many years it has been possible to convey the printed word instantaneously over long distances by using the telephone system, i.e. the teleprinter. The use of fax or facsimile machines using the same system to convey images very accurately to a print-out machine has its obvious uses both for internal and international trade, and these are now very widespread. All businesses of any size use them.\n\nSatellites can be used for a variety of terrestrial as well as space research purposes. Using a dish which points to the satellite, modern TV sets can receive a much wider range of channels. These can also be received across adjacent countries' boundaries, sometimes with political consequences. Satellites are also used for radio and telephonic communications, and have certain military functions.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change came about when computers became small enough to be manageable. Today, they are used for an enormous number of purposes. On a national scale they store and produce on demand information for all government departments. They are used in business, in shops, in schools, in industrial production, in spacecraft, in military contexts and in private homes. Yet, they present problems. Their memory may be lost. They are susceptible to the new crime of computer hacking for purposes of industrial espionage or simply mischief. They contain and sometimes disclose confidential personal information, and this may seriously damage the individual. Yet, they have come to stay. Many schools teach their use from the primary stage onwards. This is essential to all pupils who expect a career in any sphere above manual work. They are integral to much modern medical work, especially in the diagnostic and monitoring spheres.\n\nAll of these advances affect modern life, perhaps predominantly the computer. Ironically, the concept is at least one hundred and fifty years old, but prototypes were mechanical and far too large to be feasible in use. The first serviceable example was used for code-breaking in the Second World War, and since those days the computer has never looked back."

        "title": "Can money buy happiness?",
        "content": "The title of the old American movie 'Poor little rich girl' answers the question. It is true that at weddings we often hear the newly-weds toasted in the words Health, Wealth and Happiness, but the epithet itself distinguishes between the three objectives. The fact is that you can be both happy and healthy and poor, by normal standards, at the same time. Yet, if you are unhappy, money can only cure your misery in some circumstances. And if you have an incurable illness no amount of money can buy the treatment to reverse that condition.\nMost people would accept that the human being is a composite of body, mind and spirit. Each of those parts has separate needs which must be fulfilled if happiness is to result. This fulfillment is most often, though not always, achieved through the love and companionship found in a good marriage. The newly-weds referred to above may start out together with few possessions and little money and still be blissfully happy. Body, mind and spirit are fulfilled. Yet, marital happiness is not a static thing. As the couple grow older they change, and happiness has to be constantly worked for if it is to mature into lifelong love and friendship. Sadly enough the divorce rate in the west shows that many couples lack that incentive, and are not prepared to show the unselfishness and willingness to put the needs of each other first, necessary if happiness is to last. Very often, this process of alienation goes on at the very time when the couple are getting past their money problems, when the pennies no longer have to be counted.\n\nThis situation is highlighted when money never has been a problem, as in the case of some of the British royal family. Differences in outlook, i.e. in mind and spirit, sever relationships most effectively. Whereas one royal, for instance, was interested only in farming and country pursuits, the wife, some years ago, decided to devote her life to 'Save the Children'. Money never entered the equation. They are permanently separated. Mind and spirit had grown apart.\n\nIf old money can be irrelevant, new money can be a positive menace. Every week in England somebody becomes a sterling millionaire having entered a winning football pool forecast. More often than not, the winner's cry is 'spend, spend, spend!' , and the money soon goes. In the process, homes shatter, bad relationships are formed, drugs and alcohol are abused, and often the winner ends up with nothing.\n\nSo at least this can be said. Money itself is neutral. The ideal is wise stewardship, i.e. its proper use, which generally means making one's existing lifestyle more comfortable, but using excess income for charitable purposes. Money should not be seen as the key to luxury and self-indulgence. Money is not the root of all evil, but the correct version is true enough; the love of money is the root of all evil . The love of money is a cold, alienating obsession. Was Howard Hughes a happy man?\n\nWhat can also be said is that whereas money cannot buy happiness, the lack of it can bring misery. Few things are worse than debt, as the family of Charles Dickens' Mr Micawber knew full well. It is the duty of men, and in many cases today of women, to provide enough money for the family to live in reasonable comfort. It is not their duty to provide that comfort by going into debt. The modern way of doing so is through the credit card which, if abused, is the sure road to unhappiness. As Dickens said, annual income £1 annual expenditure 19s 6d, the result, happiness. Annual income £1 annual expenditure £1 6d, the result, misery.\n\nThere is, perhaps, one sense in which money can buy happiness, and that is among the poorest of the poor in the third world. Happiness for them would be a safe home, enough food, medical care, and a school for their children. One day, the conscience of the world will ensure that they are given these things."

        "title": "Do you think that rituals, customs and ceremonies still have a part to play in modern society?",
        "content": "There are several factors which appear to militate against the continuation of rituals, customs and ceremonies in modern society. The first is the life-style norm in industrialized and westernized countries. An agricultural existence may be hard, but it is steady and unhurried. Modern living is fast living. Men and women work perhaps sixty hours a week in the factory, office or shop. Food imports mean that they are less dependent on the land, so the old customs connected with fertility and the propitiation of hostile spirits, all based in animistic beliefs, have become irrelevant. The climate of outlook has also changed. The religious and political hold of the old time chiefs has largely been replaced by democracy, in some cases one of the enlightened religions, and in others a kind of hybrid of materialism and humanism. So it might seem that the new will inevitably replace the old, inexorably if not quickly.\nIn some respects, ritual, custom and ceremony may have a reactionary, indeed at times positively malevolent influence. The modern world has set certain standards of human rights, in religion, in sexual and racial parity, in speech, in education, in political freedom, in freedom of travel. The objective is humane behavior within countries, and international peace and co-operation. Yet, in certain countries barbaric customs remain, especially where women are denied equality. Suttee. The harem. Slavery. Female circumcision. The cutting off of hands for theft. Floggings. Automatic torture, isolation and deprivation for prisoners, whether political or criminal. There is no place for these customs in the modern world.\n\nYet, some customs remain good, and should not be abandoned. The custom of hospitality to strangers, and of ensuring their safety while they stay with the host. The custom of giving to the poor. The custom of helping one's neighbor in distress. Many customs connected with the dead, for example the wake. This ensures solidarity with the bereaved, and has a strong therapeutic effect. Customs connected with courtesy; behavior in public and as a guest; good manners at table, the wearing of the correct dress for a particular occasion. Modern society would be poorer without these things.\n\nMuch the same applies to rituals and ceremonies. Where any of these retain a helpful meaning they are worth preserving. Of course, some have lost their original significance with the passage of time, and should be discarded. Yet very many, particularly those connected with religion, remain powerful for good. Religious services are more meaningful if they include music, colour and movement, and where each action brings an article of the faith concerned vividly to life. Much the same applies to the coronation of a monarch, where religion meets power and authority in ceremonial. The fact that judges wear special robes, and enter court in procession, reflects the dignity of the law. The same applies to the Speaker's procession in the UK House of Commons. The same applies to the military ceremonies of Changing the Guard and Trooping the color. The service for the launching of a ship recognizes the mariner's dependence on God. There are also worthwhile ceremonies connected with receiving a degree, or being called to the bar. Wedding and funeral ceremonies reflect happiness or sorrow and solemnity. Even the All Blacks carry out a Maori war dance before a match, and they remain very hard to beat !\n\nHowever modern, practical and enlightened modern society may be, people remain the products of their ancestry. History has passed on a profusion of rituals, customs and ceremonies. Some have become meaningless, or are positively inhumane, and society can do without them. However, probably far more enrich the lives of those whose existence could easily become barren and humdrum if the past were to be discarded."

        "title": "Patriotism has no place in an international society. Do you agree ?",
        "content": "Traditionally, patriotism has usually been regarded as a virtue. Horace said dulce et decorum est pro patria mori -- it is sweet and honorable to die for one's country. Sir Walter Scott wrote :\n \n\n'Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,\n\nWho never to himself hath said,\n\n'This is my own, my native land !'\n\nUsually, yes. Most of us have a built-in affection for the land which reared us, and to which we owe much. Wars down the centuries prove that men and woman spring to its defense in times of crisis.\n\nYet patriotism, love of country, has not always been approved when it amounts to 'my country, right or wrong'. O'Flaherty VC, a George Bernard Shaw character, said 'you'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race'. Of course that was Shaw in 1915, when men were dying by the tens of thousands. Yet much earlier Samuel Johnson had said 'Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel'.\n\nSo thinkers, whether classical or relatively modern, are divided in their opinions.\n\nWe are of course dealing with today, a time in which travel and communications have advanced with giant strides. In fact, there is a fashionable one-world concept. This outlook postulates that humanity is one. There should be no racial, cultural or political barriers. The identities of individual countries should disappear. Loyalty should be to the human race, not to one's country of origin. Humanity should become a worldwide melting-pot.\n\nYet, since we are dealing with today, we should concentrate on realism rather than idealism. The flaw in the one-world argument is that human nature does not change. Greed, aggression and the inability to forget old disputes create a perpetual, unchanging barrier. Changes in outlook rarely occur until they are enforced by catastrophe. Despite the holocaust, neo-Nazism has re-appeared in Germany. Despite all peace-keeping efforts, Jew and Arab will never live side by side in amity. Territorial disputes, as in Ireland, as in Yugoslavia, as affecting the Maories, the North American Indians, the whites and blacks in South Africa, are unlikely ever to be resolved.\n\nIf communications, modern travel and the spread of democracy in erstwhile Communist countries make the one-world concept a realistic possibility, other detrimental modern advances counteract the new challenge.\n\nIrresponsible governments are acquiring nuclear potential. The international arms trade flourishes as liberal governments pay lip-service to control but cynically fail to take action. Freed from the shackles of Communism, the eastern part of the Old Soviet Union is fast becoming a series of independent states, struggling to achieve western forms of democracy, ambitious to create market economies, careful to retain the Soviet nuclear armaments located in their territories. The whole political thrust is towards nationalism. Not only states, but also races, as in Yugoslavia and Iraq, wish to become autonomous. They are fiercely determined to preserve their identities, because apart from political and economic there are also social and ethnic factors to consider. Peoples are not readily going to sacrifice their customs and traditions.\n\nThat is why patriotism will continue to hold a strong position in the modern world for the foreseeable future. A strong United Nations can and does prevent, or at least try to prevent national and racial excesses of the worst kind. And if nations and races could achieve their legitimate political and economic aims by peaceful means, if the strong would help, rather than dominate the weak, then the time might come when wars became a thing of the past. In that imaginary situation, the best kind of patriotism, love of country, would evoke the best from all people in the realms of material progress, education, sport, international co-operation.\n\nThe unhappy fact, however, is that the world is bedeviled by the worst kind of patriotism - the use of 'love of country' as a cover for excess and atrocity. Men and women are imprisoned, beaten and tortured. A regime will try to exterminate Jews, gypsies and the handicapped. An old man will show no remorse at having murdered ten thousand Buddhist monks. Innocent hostages will be taken to be used as political bargaining counters. Essential foods and medical supplies will be denied to the starving.\n\nAnd all in the name of patriotism."

        "content": "Much to his housekeeper's disgust, the great fictional detective Sherlock Holmes carried out scientific experiments in his Baker Street rooms in the cause of solving crimes. Since his day, science has played an increasingly important part in both the detection and the proof of crime. Technology, the derivative of science, is used by most countries' police forces today and is responsible for bringing many criminals to justice. Dr Crippen escaped by liner to the United States, but an early ship to shore radio telephone enabled the police to arrest him when the liner docked.\nFootprint casts and fingerprints are traditional methods of detection. Fingerprinting was invented in Great Britain by Francis Galton and has been of fundamental importance in detection for decades. Some countries fingerprint their whole populations, though others, Britain included, regard this as an infringement of personal freedom, and restrict fingerprinting to those accused of a criminal offence, or to those who are screened for certain security categories. Science has greatly enhanced the efficiency of this system. Fingerprints are now held on computer, and much time and cost is saved by the fact that information can be exchanged instantaneously throughout the country. Co-operation with the National Crime Information Center in the US and with Interpol in the continent of Europe greatly enhances this facility.\n\nRecords of convicted criminals are now held on microfilm in conjunction with fingerprints, photographs and personal profiles and stored as computer data. These, again, are capable of instant retrieval countrywide and can also be made available overseas. In the UK, this data cannot be disclosed to a jury during a criminal trial, but should the verdict be guilty a previous criminal record becomes available in the matter of sentencing. The polygraph, or lie detector, is not university sanctioned. Its supporters claim that its ability to record nervous tensions is infallible. Others disagree.\n\nVery recently, DNA printing has revolutionized the process of bringing the criminal to justice, and in civil actions establishing paternity. The minutest quantities of blood, skin, hair or nail-parings can positively identify or eliminate the individual concerned. No two individuals have identical sets of genes. This scientific advance is particularly important in the examination of cars and rooms where crimes have been committed.\n\nInterrogation has always been an important part of criminal investigation. In uncivilized countries, drugs, psychological pressure and often physical torture have been, and still are used. These methods are banned in civilized countries. However, even in the latter, the police occasionally enforce signatures to false statements or to statements which are subsequently mutilated. Taped interviews today now go some way to overcome this abuse, though even tapes can be falsified.\n\nA good deal of crime detection and prevention has been privatized in recent years. Some countries allow firearms to security guards, others, such as the UK, do not. Various pieces of technology are in common use. Closed-circuit TV cameras allow centralized observation of customers in large stores. Flood-lighting around buildings can be triggered electronically when anybody approaches in the dark. Foot patrols are issued with light intensifiers, a military development, enabling them to see without being seen. Electric eye burglar alarms have been in use both in public buildings and in private homes for many years.\n\nObservation by police 'on the beat' who know their own areas intimately has always been a recognized and valuable means of crime detection and prevention, bolstering the citizen's sense of security. Unfortunately, this is being replaced by police car patrols. And although the latter are in radio communication with officers on foot and with police headquarters, the general public see this development as retrograde.\n\nDespite all the above, crime is on the increase in many countries. Its detection is no doubt becoming more efficient, due to scientific advance. This is related to an entirely different factor; the decline in religious faith and observance, which instills moral standards into children."

        "title": "If you were editing a monthly magazine for your age group, what main features would you include, and why?",
        "content": "In this essay, the 16 to 18 years age group is envisaged, and it is assumed that you, whether boy or girl, are 17 years old. You have left school with a good academic record but have decided to go straight into the publishing business. The principal of your firm has seen copies of the school magazine, which you edited, and believes you may have a flair for editorial work. She thinks there is a gap in the market for a monthly magazine aimed at your age group. Since you know the interests of your peers, you are given a free hand in selecting the main features of your magazine, but you will of course receive professional help. So your principal has asked you to list these features, giving your reasons, and you produce the following.\nA title must be found which is attractive, 'with it', and non-sexist. Since the magazine is aimed at both sexes, there must be a balance between male and female interests. By far the majority of the features will be of common interest. Young men today are as interested in fashion as young women. Both need advice on sex and romance. Girls often enjoy sports news as much as boys.\n\nMost young people are interested in pop groups and stars. Features on those of worldwide fame, such as (in 1992) Madonna, Jason Donovan and lead actors in highly successful films such as 'Robin Hood' and 'Crocodile Dundee' have an immediate appeal. Care will be taken to edit out dirt and scandal. This feature can also provide critiques of national, even local groups. This can be mutually beneficial.\n\nConnected with the above is the release of CDs, tapes, single and LP discs. Many young people are interested in classical music, so this area must not be overlooked.\n\nThe cinema is far more important in India and the Far East than it is in the West, where it has largely been displaced by TV. Television 'soaps', several emanating from Australia, are aimed at this age-group, with which they have become very popular, so some lively notes on what has been seen over the past month should be included.\n\nSex and romance are of absorbing interest to young people. Many are worldly-wise, some are naive, all need advice. This must be on the practical level, with a view to protection against disease, unwanted pregnancies and the modern scourge of AIDS. Religion and parental training should take care of the moral side. An opportunity should be given for young people to write in to the magazine for advice on personal problems.\n\nA health column for both sexes would be popular. A qualified practitioner would provide advice on problems important to the teenager but perhaps too trivial for the surgery. These include skin problems such as acne, weight-watching, balanced diet, exercise and so on. Again, letters to the column would be welcomed.\n\nSports provides an important feature. This would include news of and comment on all major sporting events, both national and international. Personal profiles and interviews with stars are always popular.\n\nToday, boys are just as interested in fashion as girls. Teenage clothing and footwear would feature prominently. In many countries today, teenagers have a higher percentage of disposable income than any other age group, and much of this is spent on fashion items. Hair-styling also comes into this category.\n\nA very important feature could be job advice for those leaving school but not proceeding to further education. This section would include information on training schemes, advice on interviewing, and for those interested, an indication of opportunities overseas.\n\nTeenagers are concerned with two topics, both of which could form important features: charity work and the environment. Many young people look for opportunities of helping others less fortunate, both at home and overseas. Preservation of our planet, and of threatened wildlife strike a chord. They are willing to set aside time for both activities.\n\nSome countries have a drugs problem affecting this age-group, and none are totally exempt from crime. The hazards of both could be regularly emphasized together with their effects both on perpetrator and victim.\n\nGeneral knowledge quizzes, crossword puzzles perhaps based on teenage interests, and notes on popular indoor activities such as video and board games would provide another attractive feature.\n\nSo also would letters to the editor and printed replies on selected topics. Suggestions for new features would be welcomed. This personal communication between magazine and reader is of the greatest importance.\n\nOccasional prizes and giveaway features such as posters of popular stars would all help circulation.\n\nSuch are the important features. Good illustration and professional writing are obviously necessary. Copy prices would be at the top end of the bracket. A well thought-out launch would be vital."

        "title": "Television will eventually be the death of sport'. Do you agree?",
        "content": "The word sport covers a multitude of activities, ranging from athletics to the field sports, hunting, shooting and fishing; from rowing to equestrian events, from boxing to hockey and soccer. To assert that TV will kill these off is obvious nonsense. With or without TV, the instinct to pursue these activities will remain. Sport enhances health, builds muscle, satisfies the competitive instinct, encourages fair play, and creates friendships and excellent social contacts among those who share sporting interests. Since Greek and Roman times, when the Olympics were founded, and took place, as today, at four-yearly intervals, sport in some shape or form has always been a leisure occupation, and it will certainly take more than the downside of television to kill it off. We will consider that downside in a moment.\nFirst, the benefits of television coverage should be appreciated. It is undeniable that televised sport offers first-class entertainment to those who are interested. The watcher watches in comfort, out of the rain and the cold. It is also undeniable that some sports, e.g. golf, come across far better on TV than they possibly can to the spectator on the spot. The cameras keep up with the ball in its full are, underlining the outstanding prowess of the top players. Team games can also be watched in comfort, and again with a comprehensive view of the whole pitch. The zoom-lens gives close-ups from many angles, and the immediate play-back facility shows the top-class players' abilities, the fouls, both accidental and professional , and the refereeing standards. All brilliantly exposed. Sponsorship provides crucial funds to sports teams at all levels, whether their matches are televised or not. Sponsors fund teams in proportion to television coverage and ground attendance. So improvements to grounds and spectator facilities are made possible, and money is provided for the purchase of star players. Finally, to be able to watch the top players perform with apparently effortless brilliance must encourage young people to go out and try to do likewise. Today, sponsorship provides money for the rich rewards available to stars, and this offers an added incentive to young hopefuls.\n\nOf course, televised sport has its drawbacks. Many people believe that ideally all sport should be amateur, the pursuit of physical excellence for its own sake, and with no financial reward. The film 'Chariots of Fire' highlighted a brilliant young miler. But as he moved towards Olympic status he too had a trainer!\n\nWas the trainer unpaid? It is certainly true that television encourages professionalism, even among amateurs. Rugby football in the UK, the amateur game, has been forced into a league system, which leads to star poaching. It also moves players towards demanding money, particularly when training occupies an increasing amount of unpaid time. Stars, who lose months every year on tours, must, realistically, be repaid. At present, amateurs are indirectly recompensed through giving their names to newspaper articles, by writing and signing books, by endorsements of sports goods and by appearances at functions. Television exposure is behind all this. This is why many people basically disapprove. The line between the pro and the amateur is becoming blurred.\n\nAnother criticism is more arguable. It is that many people are becoming sport watchers rather than sport players. There is also the argument that the television has reduced gates at unglamorous matches and events, and this has already led to the sale of many run-of-the-mill clubs, or their liquidation. Moreover, the excitement of the crowd atmosphere is lost in one's own home. As with the cinema, a visit is preferable to watching on the box .\n\nThirdly, there is the old Olympic ideal. This is, partly, to spread international goodwill. Today, through satellite television, the Olympics are watched worldwide by untold millions. Does this foster goodwill and fair play, or does it tend to nationalism, a win at all costs attitude? And it may be coincidence, but drug abuse among athletes has grown up alongside television.\n\nThe money motivation has been mentioned. It seems not unreasonable for players, whether amateur or professional, to be properly recompensed, but television creates stars , whether real or bogus, and these people can demand enormous sums, out of all proportion to their contributions and abilities. This hype is to be deplored. It does nothing for sport.\n\nSo television may be said to do as much harm as good. However, it will never be the death of sport ."

        "title": "Should the press be completely free?",
        "content": "Under a dictatorship the press is completely under the control of the government. The implications of this are that the authorities discard all stories unfavorable to their policies and supplement the favorable ones with propaganda and disinformation . All this involves control of TV and radio; in many countries, listening to broadcasts such as the BBC World Service, now available everywhere because of short-wave satellite output, is proscribed. People are not fools, however, and such dictatorship can lead to unrest and produce the opposite to the intended effect.\nIn most democracies, there is a varying degree of freedom. In Britain, for example, the government only steps in during wartime, apart from exerting control over stories which the Home Office regards as dangerous to the national interest, i.e. top security information. In these cases, a 'D Notice' forbids publication. Otherwise, and in peacetime, the press is entirely free to publish at will, subject to the following conditions: the material must be truthful, decent, and compatible with the laws of libel.\n\nLibelous material of course sells newspapers and magazines, and certain unscrupulous editors will publish for this reason alone, setting aside money to settle the damages in civil law which will inevitably follow.\n\nMuch of this is based on a section of the people's pleasure in seeing prominent people discredited. For example, Jeffrey Archer was awarded a half million pounds a few years ago because his personal morals were brought into question; Elton John received substantial damages because of a scurrilous and untrue account of the way he was said to treat his pet dogs. The courts now tend to award according to the seriousness of the alleged offence rather than on the prominence of the person concerned. The crux of the matter is whether the story is true. David Mellor, a prominent secretary of state, recently had some aspects of his personal life exposed. He did not challenge the stories, and chose to resign on the tacit admission that his lack of judgment precluded him from parliamentary office.\n\nA story may be defamatory, but if it is true there is nothing to stop its publication. This is the basic test on which most editors take their decisions, and logically there is no challenging this principle in a democracy. However, there are two classes of reporting in the British tabloid press which have incurred much public displeasure in recent years.\n\nThe first is the invasion of privacy. After some disaster, those closely concerned are often hounded by the press for human stories . This amounts to an unwarranted intrusion into private grief. The more distressed the interviewee the less he or she is spared.\n\nThe second is the gathering of newshounds, the paparazzi , with their long-distance telephoto lenses, their listening devices and their phone-tapping proclivities. These reporters dog the footsteps of very prominent people, such as the British royals. It so happens that two royal marriages have recently come on the rocks , with close friends of both parties involved in each case. For some weeks these stories sold millions of extra copies of the tabloids. There was much criticism in parliament, but nothing could be done; the stories were not denied. The editors claimed the right to publish on the ground that the stories were true, whatever methods were used to obtain them.\n\nPerhaps decency is the other issue. Some men like looking at nude women, and no doubt the regular 'Page 3 girl' sells many copies of the tabloids. The editors know exactly how far they can go without incurring the laws against pornography.\n\nIn Britain, complaints are heard by the Press Council, a self-governing but rather toothless body. Today there is a strong move to tighten controls by legislation, particularly in the case of infringement of privacy, and over the methods used to obtain information, particularly trespass. However, in any society there is always a demand for the sensational, and in a democracy repressive legislation is unwise. Part of the health of a good system lies in editorial freedom to criticize or applaud, and nobody should be exempted. After all, if there is nothing to bring into the open, there is no story. On the contrary, if there is real corruption, as in the cases of BCCI or Robert Maxwell, the press does the public a service by exposing the details.\nCompletely free is too sweeping a phrase. Yes, the press should be free, but subject to the controls mentioned above. Most democracies get it almost right."

        "title": "How far should architecture be both beautiful and practical? Discuss with reference to particular examples in your country.",
        "content": "Architecture may be defined as a combination of function and beauty in the art of building. Until the mid-19th century, all building was governed by three structural principles: the post and lintel, the wooden truss, and the masonry arch. From then, and especially since the 1930s, architecture has been revolutionized by the use of new materials, basically the steel skeleton and reinforced concrete. Thus, structures were freed from the weight limitations imposed by stone and brick at each floor level, so that greater flexibility in design was possible and virtually no limitation imposed on height. From very early times until the 19th century, building limitations had imposed certain styles on architecture, now known as classical styles. In the 20th century, certain innovative architects, such as Gropius, Le Corbusier and Mies van den Rohe broke away from these styles and produced fundamentally new buildings both for public and domestic use. Most modern architecture derives from these pioneers.\nSuch is a very general statement about what has happened in the Western world. All countries, however, have their indigenous architecture, differing widely in outward appearance but historically limited by the same weight considerations as have applied in the West. Alongside this, the new architecture has been adopted in the East. An observer could stand in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, London or New York, and not note any essential differences. However, many capital or large cities have placed these new buildings alongside traditional examples, with dire results. St Paul's Cathedral in London is overshadowed by a skyscraper bank complex, a tragedy to anyone with aesthetic values. Wren's magnificent structure once dominated the high ground on the north bank of the Thames and was visible from most parts of London. This is no longer so. The Prince of Wales has rightly castigated the modern architects who have been responsible for this visual vandalism.\n\nPartly as a result of his efforts, the problem of inappropriate architecture is now being taken seriously in Britain. Local planning authorities are made well aware of public feeling. Where, for example, there exists a high-street facade belonging to the 18th - 19th century in a small town, any new buildings are made to conform to this particular style. Not all countries take this line. There are, for example, no planning regulations in Spain. As a result, visual vandalism is unrestrained.\n\nThe above indicates the writer's prejudices! Yet it also raises various pertinent questions. For example, what is beauty? Is it an abstract constant, or does it lie in the eye of the beholder ? And what is practical? Is it, in domestic architecture, something which solves the problem of housing, insofar as roofs over heads are provided, or should it have a social dimension?\n\nIt is generally accepted nowadays that buildings should match up to the traditions of the cities, towns or villages where they are built. Thus, new buildings in Regent's Park or Regent Street in London, have to conform to Nash's neo-classical style. In other areas in Britain, Elizabethan half-timbering may predominate. This cannot be copied, but ways to conform can be, and are found. In many London areas, the hideous and inhuman tower-blocks of the 50s and 60s are being demolished in favor of old-style low level and terraced housing with gardens. Thus the social dimension is being re-introduced into domestic architecture, and this fosters a sense of collective and personal identity completely absent in the large complexes of flats and maisonettes, where conditions are depressing, and where vandalism and crime flourish.\n\nExcept where there are severe space limitations and little traditional architecture of much aesthetic importance, as in Hong Kong, many countries now realize that some kind of compromise is the right way forward. Obviously. the advantages of the new materials should be exploited. Height is a crucial factor. Traditional facades can be combined with modern interiors without doing violence to the advantages of either. Beauty and practicality are not mutually exclusive considerations. You can throw a bad picture away or destroy a bad sculpture. Not so a bad or inappropriate building. We owe it to future generations to be extremely careful."

        "content": "Just as he uses the French Revolution as the catalyst to resolve the relationships and destinies of his characters in 'A Tale of Two Cities', Charles Dickens uses the Gordon Riots to the same effect in Barnaby Rudge, his other historical novel.\nInspired by the eccentric peer, Lord Gordon, the London mob carried out a reign of terror in 1780 against Roman Catholics, involving murder, looting, arson, and acts of sedition including storming several prisons such as the Fleet and releasing the prisoners. Gordon escaped the consequences, due to lack of evidence, but other ringleaders were executed in public once the military had crushed the riots.\n\nThe riots occupy much of the story, and are brilliantly described. Hatred of the Papacy was the moral peg on which to hang the violence, and it presented the mob with specific targets, Roman Catholic churches, RC houses and their families. A mob out of control and guided by ringleaders will find the lowest common denominator of behavior. It is formed out of a depressed working class which has an inbuilt hatred of the 'Establishment' and, individually, old scores to settle against oppressive employers. Its real motivation is looting, revenge and the exercise of power. For a time the mob succeeded by instilling fear into the respectable population at large. Many house-holders put notices in their windows declaring their Protestantism. Dickens captures and conveys this sense of fear which dominated London and its suburbs for some weeks. This is the most successful aspect of the novel. The climax is the detailed account of the storming, burning and liberation of the Fleet prison.\n\nAll the same, there is a certain weakness in the plotting, and this is the weakness of many of Dickens' novels. Ever the sentimentalist, Dickens sees to it that all the characters, good and bad, get their just desserts. Life is not like that, and the plaintive Old Testament cry, Why do the ungodly prosper? is much nearer the mark. Yet Barnaby escapes the gallows on grounds of idiocy, even though he had joined the rioters for gain, albeit to help his mother. So he is a goodie; others are Geoffrey Haredale, a Roman Catholic whose house was burnt down, and Gabriel Varden, the locksmith who braved the mob in refusing to open the Fleet door lock. Anyway, his pretty daughter Dolly is needed for a happy marriage to Edward Chester. And the baddies ? We have Hugh, the savage ostler, Simon Tappertit and Dennis the hangman. All get hanged. And the smooth villain, Sir John Chester, a secret fomenter of the Gordon Riots; Haredale kills him in a duel. Stewart Rudge, Barnaby's father, had murdered Haredale's brother years previously, but nemesis catches up with him and he also gets hanged. Even Miggs, the smarmy but treacherous maid gets sacked. So everything turns out well! All this merely underlines the fact that Dickens, by far the most popular Victorian novelist, knew his readership. What did they want? Exaggerated sketches of low-life characters, who would make them laugh by their grotesque misuse of English. The good and bad characters already mentioned. A love interest, with a happy ending, after the young lady has been exposed to many perils. An exciting plot, with vivid descriptions. A well-executed denouement, in which justice is seen to be done all round. And perhaps an eccentric such as Barnaby Rudge, with his talking raven. Even the raven survives the ups and downs of the riots.\n\nThe novel has all this. It is a masterpiece of popular fiction, but it is still second-rate.\n\nMost Victorian novelists are too long and wordy for modern tastes. Trollope suffers from the same verbal diarrhoea, but his denouements grow convincingly out of his characters rather than being imposed on them. Dickens' few middle or upper class characters are thin and boring. We know that Haredale is bluff, rough but honest, whereas Chester is smooth, but treacherous. Nothing more. The characters representing the various layers of the working class are far more rounded, but their comic use of English is very suspect. Working class English cannot have changed so dramatically even in one and a half centuries. Then as now, they abused the language, but wordiness, long and involved sentences, and delay in coming to the point were never features of their conversation, especially in London. Shakespeare understood this. Dickens did not."

        "content": "Loneliness is not just a matter of being alone. The monk with his vow of silence may not feel lonely; the individual in an uncongenial group may feel very lonely indeed. So loneliness is a matter of the mind and spirit as well as the body. The richness of life lies in the companionship of a person with whom one has an emotional connection and perhaps a physical relationship, one who thinks in like terms and talks the same language. It is a person whose views on other people, the world in general, and God coincide. Unmarried people often find this in parents, so the loss of parents is perhaps unduly traumatic in their case.\nThe majority of people get married and find most of these outlets in the other person, if the marriage is happy. So bereavement, especially if untimely, is a prime cause of loneliness. Suddenly the house is empty, and there is nobody, even kind friends, children and relations, with whom one can quite communicate. The remedy? Time, and the determination to live the kind of life the other person would have hoped for. Remarriage? For some people, no doubt. Not for everybody. There is no real remedy for this kind of loneliness.\n\nThe fact is that widows and widowers, previously happily married, have a much increased lifespan nowadays. To have to live alone from say age sixty to ninety is no longer uncommon, and medical advance has to be counted as another prime cause of loneliness. It is not so long since people regarded survival beyond the age of fifty as a bonus. Today, the percentage of pensioners in Western communities is constantly rising. As an example, Greenwich in London (pop 11/2m) has 1/2m pensioners. So much social work, both municipal and private, has to be geared to the elderly, and much of it to the lonely elderly. This is why loneliness as a social problem is increasingly important. Very often the problem is exacerbated by extreme old age and sickness. To become housebound compounds the problem.\n\nAnother reason for the loneliness of the elderly is the mobility of younger people. In Britain, the old tradition was that children would house their parents, so that three generations might sit round the same fireside. Today, both job requirements and the cost of housing in or near the great conurbations mean that the young family moves away and can only pay a very occasional visit to the elderly parents. The late 20th century is seeing the collapse of the 'nuclear' family, and the old concept of mutual responsibility seems to be ebbing away. This means that a wide variety of social provisions, ranging from subsidized travel to 'meals on wheels' to home nursing has to be made today by local authorities and charitable organizations.\n\nThis problem is less acute in country areas and sometimes in certain areas of the conurbations, where the old concept of community and neighborliness is still extant. There is less need to be lonely in the village, where all residents are traditionally interested in each other. This mutual support is very noticeable in e.g. many villages in South Wales, where there is much unemployment and a degree of poverty. The flight of the young, however, also applies to villages, especially in agricultural areas, where farm work is no longer labor-intensive and where property prices have been pushed up by second-home owners.\n\nAnother cause of loneliness in urban areas is the unsuitability of post-war re-housing, much of it erected on old bomb sites. In the 60s, tower blocks and large areas of low-rise flats and maisonettes were 'in'; today it is realized that all this was a gigantic mistake, and many such complexes are being demolished to make way for old-style housing. The problems connected with steel and concrete are, first anonymity; also, depressing outlooks, vandalism and crime. Many elderly people live in fear. They install impregnable front doors, which impede the emergency services in the event of physical collapse or fire.\n\nWhat of the young? Many are, for different reasons, just as lonely as the elderly. In Britain, the suicide rate among them is increasing. Despair and loneliness of the spirit are the fundamental causes. Bullying, unpopularity at school, anxiety about examination results and job prospects all make for a feeling of isolation. Some of this may be self-inflicted; the young as well as the old have character defects. Yet there is a great need for counseling and reassurance, certainly affection. The feeling of being excluded from society leads to gang membership and crime, often drug-related.\n\nFinally, the decline of religion has had its effects. If a person of any age has a faith and a belief in God's love, a fundamental reason for living is imparted, and this does much to counteract loneliness.\n\nThere are no ready-made solutions."

        "title": "Money is the root of all evil'. Do You agree?",
        "content": "This is a misquotation from the Christian Bible. St Paul wrote to Timothy 'For the love of money is the root of all evil'. A very different statement.\nWhen a person makes a lot of money in, say, a successful business, there soon comes a point beyond which its possession is superfluous. At this point, there is a parting of the ways. The options are, first, cultivate expensive tastes, second, give liberally to charity, and third, let it accumulate.\n\nThe third option is perhaps the most dangerous. It leads to the love of money for its own sake; meanness to others, and a personal lifestyle which is unduly frugal. Silas Marner was the typical miser of the English novel. A wandering weaver, he settled in the rural West country, lived on virtually nothing, and converted his skills with the loom into gold coins. He hid the coins under a brick in the kitchen and his one pleasure was to count, recount and neatly pile up his treasure . When the hoard of gold was stolen, it seemed as though the end of the world had come. Finally he was weaned away from his obsession with gold by the humanizing influence of an orphan child.\n\nRobert Maxwell was a modern example. Already excessively wealthy, he loved money to such a degree that he stole the pension funds entrusted to his care. When the theft could no longer be concealed, he died by drowning, in circumstances which suggested suicide. He combined love of money - and power - with extravagance.\n\nThere is hardly any crime, major or minor, personal or political, which does not have an underlying money motive. No crime is excusable, but some crimes are less excusable than others, and the degree of guilt is somewhat in proportion to the perpetrator's love of money for its own sake. Serious, organized crime is conducted by gangs whose interest is two-fold; the instinct to amass enormous sums quite unrelated to the personal needs of the criminals, and the acquisition of power - another important motivator - in order to exert pressure on business people, ministers and even governments. Such people use blackmail, personal violence, kidnapping and murder to achieve their objectives. The immense power of the Mafia, the Tongs, and the drug barons is based on instilling fear. They have no pity, no social conscience about the personal and social consequences of drug addiction. Sometimes, as in the case of rival paramilitary gangs in Ireland, threats, violence, murder and routine extortions are cloaked by an ostensible justification; in this case, religion and nationalism.\n\nThe police rightly look for the financial motive when investigating personal crimes. In most of them, though not all, personal gain is found to be the motive. In others, hatred, jealousy, fear, sex and occasionally a pathological love of violence for its own sake generate such crime. A high proportion of crime committed in Britain is committed by young people. Mugging, personal violence, shop-lifting and burglary are carried out for money. Much of this is related to the kind of deprivation which is due to a bad family background. This leads to a general feeling that society, and the police especially, are natural antagonists. There is also an understandable envy of more fortunate young people.\n\nTraditionally, industrial bosses have tended to fall into the category of oppressors, and it has taken a century of trades union action to ensure a square deal for their work forces. Such oppression has always been seen as an evil. In ancient Jewry, the periodic Jubilee was used as the point at which all debts incurred by the poor were cancelled.\n\nSo the love of money accounts for much, perhaps most, though not all evil. Yet to take the topic-statement at its face value is a palpable nonsense. Throughout history, money, in the form of coinage, has facilitated the exchange of goods and trade in general. For a long period, bills of exchange, paper money, and the transfer of debits and credits have enabled governments to build up GNPs, and individuals to amass capital. The money itself is neutral. All depends on how it is used. Rightly used, money is the lifeblood of progress and makes possible a decent standard of living for all citizens. Wrongly used, it engenders the evils referred to above, and many more."

        "title": "Mathematics is the most perfect language of all'. Discuss.",
        "content": "Strictly speaking, a language is a verbalized means of communication, enabling the speaker to convey thought to another person. However, the more complex the thoughts or ideas, the harder or more cumbersome the language becomes. To explain verbally why 'the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides' would require a long and tedious paragraph. And this is the simplest possible example; anything more complicated would be unmanageable. So in this way mathematical symbols which nowadays are universally accepted, compress information in a way that no other language possibly could, and this fact supports the topic statement.\nHowever, this language is only available to most people in its simplest forms, i.e. arithmetic, algebra and geometry, and these are taught in schools because they have everyday usages. The shop assistant needs arithmetic, unless there is an automatic cash till, and technicians of all kinds need the other two; perhaps more, such as trigonometry, logarithms and the calculus, should he or she be dealing with quantities that vary in time and space. In this sense, of course, mathematics is a minority language, a language intelligible only to the specialists of all nations.\n\nThe time may come when knowledge of higher mathematics is far more widespread, however. The new mathematics is now being taught in many schools, sometimes alongside the traditional approach, and younger students find the new methods more intelligible. The principles of course have not changed; merely the setting out. However, there are great developments available to younger students enabling them to see the subject as a whole rather than as a series of separate compartments, and this should engender more interest in those whose natural bent is in the direction of the arts.\n\nMathematics has been described as 'the spearhead of natural philosophy', and this was certainly true up to about 1800. The subject grew up independently in China, India, the Arab world and Europe. For example, many of the Alexandrian and Greek schools of geometricians, represented by Thales of Miletus, Pythagoras, Euclid, Archimedes etc advanced propositions which were already known elsewhere. The West derived its number system from the Hindu-Arabic world, which reached Europe in about 1000 AD. The West learnt mathematics from the Arab world and, from the 15th century, great developments took place.\n\nDescartes revived algebraic geometry, Napier invented logarithms, Newton and Leibnitz the calculus. Lobachevsky developed non-Euclidian geometry, and was followed by Einstein, though the latter was more of a physicist than a mathematician. From Newton onwards, mechanics and astronomy began to use advanced mathematics and, later on, physics came in for the same treatment. Both pure and applied mathematics became the indispensable tools of progress. Pure maths reaches conclusions by means of the deductive process, and may be independent of need. Applied maths consists of developments to meet the requirements of science and technology.\n\nSo mathematics has become a beautiful language in several senses. Firstly, in its ability to compress ideas, just as a great poet achieves desired effects by great verbal economy. Second, because its tools, the symbols, are internationally accepted. Third, because it is entirely objective, and completely exact, allowing no room for prejudice or human emotion. Fourth, because it constantly provides the ground for new hypotheses. These in turn are checked by logic and observation. Often as with Pythagoras, mathematical conclusions can be checked by other means. So mathematics can lead man closer to absolute truth than any other means, that is in the categories of discovery in which it can operate.\n\nMathematics means facts , verified by experiment, and these facts are true within the four dimensions in which the human mind can operate. The other dimensions, perhaps six according to Stephen Hawking, must be compressed into infinitesimal space, so are likely to remain the prerogative of the Creator!"

        "title": "How far should scientists be held responsible for the effects of their discoveries?",
        "content": "As far as we know, man is unique in the created universe. One of the attributes separating mankind from the animal world is the urge to find things out, to add to the common store of knowledge. Historically, any attempt to thwart investigation, or to conceal or ban its results, has been doomed to failure. There is no case for restricting scientific investigation. However, the effects of scientific discovery are sometimes bad, so new technology based on such discovery should be, and usually is, scrutinized and carefully tested before it is let loose on the public.\nThe scientist is not the right person to carry out the scrutiny of the new technology. Indeed, though expert in the particular field, he or she is often woefully naive in other matters. The right people are government ministers who, in a democracy, are responsible to the people. The minister will seek reports from independent experts. This may mean lengthy scrutiny, as in the case of new drugs. The first reason for this is the humane consideration for human life and health. This means eliminating any possibility of harmful side effects. The second is more material; in the event of such harmful side effects, very considerable damages are being awarded by the courts to the sufferers nowadays. Many very large drug companies have their reports own research departments, and their findings, together with independent reports are passed to the Department of Health so that the minister can take the final decision. New technologies based on new discoveries are also controlled in this way.\n\nWhen scientists bypass the correct channels from whatever motives, and the effects of their discoveries prove harmful, then they must be held responsible.\n\nWhen they do, the motivation may be personal prestige, money or political bias. Isaac Newton's feuds with Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, and the German Leibniz resulted in unscrupulous behavior. While the promulgation of calculus can hardly be said to have public side effects, Newton's self-esteem, had it gone unchecked, would have had disastrous consequences in other fields, such as atomic research.\n\nScientists are relatively badly paid; judges on the other hand are well paid in order to place them above possible bribery. So the temptation to sell discoveries to the highest bidder must be great. This raises the point of national loyalty. As mentioned, scientists are often politically naive. Some fail to realize the industrial harm that the money motive can do to the country which both trained them and provided the crucial facilities for their research.\n\nOthers see patriotism as a deplorable nationalism. Many in this century have felt it their duty to support Communism. They are victims of the pathetic fallacy that we are, or should be moving towards a one-world society. So they have given or sold information to Russia. Thankfully, the end of the cold war has terminated this treachery, but the dangers of a nuclear confrontation, such as in the Bay of Pigs episode, is traceable directly to certain scientists for whom no punishment is sufficiently severe. They are just as guilty as the spies who peddle their discoveries.\n\nIn the case of the terrible side effects of exposure to nuclear energy, the scientist can hardly be held responsible, since in the early days nobody fully understood these effects. Madame Curie died of cancer or leukaemia. Many who were present at the early detonation of nuclear bombs at Bikini, New Mexico and the Monte Bello Islands, not to speak of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, have suffered disastrous long-term effects. Civilians who have been exposed to nuclear accidents or accidental leakages have suffered in the same way. Some people make the case that even to live near a nuclear power station has its dangers. Disastrous as all this is, the scientist can no more be blamed than the inventor of gun powder for the rifle and the cannon, or the first man to make a long-bow for causing death at a distance.\n\nThe same principle applies to all the harmful effects resulting from other scientific discoveries, whether actual or potential. The possible misuse of genetic discoveries is obvious, but it is hoped that all countries will exercise the kind of control outlined above. Again, scientists discovered the powerful insecticide DDT, but should not be blamed for the fact that it may destroy the ecology, or for the fact that some strains of mosquitoes have developed an immunity.\n\nHowever, there have been times in the past when the establishment has tried to suppress scientific discovery, deny its truth, or proscribe it altogether. Historically, the Christian Church has more than once been the culprit; in asserting that the earth is flat, in denying the Copernical view of the universe, the time-scale of the world's development, the physical ancestry of man as an offshoot of the world of apes. None of this succeeded in the long run, nor will any future attempts to suppress the results of scientific investigation.\n\nIt is only when the scientist personally and deliberately misuses his knowledge that he or she should be held responsible. Otherwise, the responsibility should, and actually does, lie with others."

        "title": "The sea is a bottomless rubbish pit'. Discuss.",
        "content": "First, we should be clear as to what is meant by 'the sea'. To get the concept into proportion, it is worth remembering that the area of the earth's surface covered by water is 140m square miles, i.e. 71%. Secondly, its mean depth is 12,450 feet, i.e. c.4000 meters. Obviously the depth varies. There are points in the Atlantic rift and in the Pacific Ocean where depths up to 8 miles have been recorded. Hence, there is no argument for saying that eventually the seas will be filled with human waste of various kinds, and there is no apparent reason why this waste should not be dumped in the sea. The all-important point is the control that must be exercised by international agreement over such dumping.\nThe fact is that the consumer countries will produce more and more rubbish as time goes on, and somewhere, somehow, this has to be disposed of. What are the options? They vary according to the source of the material, but there can only be three: sea, land and air. The disposal of rubbish as land-fill material is certainly not popular, at least in small countries. Nobody wants to live near land-fill sites. They disfigure the countryside and can prove positively dangerous. Poisonous material can leach out into rivers and adjacent farm land, damaging productivity, causing disease among animals and wildlife in general, and killing fish. People, and especially children living in such areas may also be exposed to disease.\n\nAir is a second option, in that incineration will convert rubbish into gases. Some domestic rubbish is already being used as fuel for the production of electricity, and this form of recycling will increase in the future. Yet, the sheer volume of all kinds of rubbish produced nowadays means that the first option, the sea, has to be used, undesirable as that may be in principle.\n\nPollution of land, sea, air, even the damage being done to the ozone layer, is one of today's great world problems. Any solution to the problem demands first analysis, then international agreement on the enforcement of acceptable standards, then target dates for their full implementation. Rubbish disposal should form part of that process.\n\nIf we consider the bottomless rubbish pit, i.e. sea pollution, it is obvious that dumping is only a small part of that problem. Two centuries of industry in the West have left rivers such as the Thames and Rhine so full of chemicals and sewage that no fish could live in them. That process is now being reversed. Agricultural chemicals have added their quota of filth. Add to this the occasional oil-spill and even a small amount of nuclear waste and one reaches the present seemingly hopeless situation. The Atlantic seaboard from the Russian arctic circle down to Africa is continuously, if patchily affected. There are similar inshore areas elsewhere. All these contributory factors must be tackled at source. The ideal situation to work for is that liquid waste should somehow be dealt with inland. That should become easier as new technologies replace old industrial processes. Solid waste, whether industrial or domestic, must be carefully graded. Much of it is bio-degradable; some of it is not. Material such as plastic and rubber should be used as landfill, if incineration is impossible. The action of sea water, wind and weather generally deals with the rest.\n\nThe big question is 'where should this happen?' and the answer probably is, in the case of Europe, beyond the continental shelf. It should be possible to devise containers capable of sinking non-degradable material to the bottom. Degradable material should be given some initial treatment. Toxic and nuclear waste are already being sunk in special containers.\n\nSewage, although generally treated, is normally piped into inshore areas, fouling beaches in many places. Recycling is the long term answer. It would obviously make cheap fuel and useful fertilizer.\n\nGiven such measures, the clean-up operation could be completed in a remarkably short time. It would involve governments and private firms in a great deal of expense, since present methods of disposal were chosen for simplicity and cheapness. Today, there is an altogether new interest in preserving and beautifying the environment. So one hopes that governments will be forced to move in the right direction.\n\nOtherwise the sea will remain a rubbish pit in exactly the wrong places."

        "title": "As technology advances, our leisure time is increasing. Do we need to be educated in how to use this time sensibly?",
        "content": "The topic statement makes a rather unreal assumption. This is that the only effect of technology is to reduce working hours. Certainly, the old sixty-hour working week has been reduced to forty hours in most countries, and the tendency is downwards. This of course was due in part to the replacement of manpower by machine power although until very recently in the West, the far more potent factor was the growing power of the trades unions. Within the past ten years, however, this power has been demolished by a creeping world trade recession. Instead of being forced to increase wages and reduce working hours by threat of strike action, many businesses have either closed down or laid off massive number of workers.\nIn Britain this applies to all the main industrial concerns as well as smaller private businesses. Almost all coal mines have, or will shortly close down due to the switch to nuclear power and gas as fuels for electricity production, and the almost total disappearance of coal as the fuel for domestic heating. In offices, computers have decimated numbers of white-collar workers. Machinery and large-scale farming have had the same effect on agriculture. Robotry has revolutionized car assembly, and standardized containers have eliminated the need for manpower in the docks. Added to all this is a worldwide drop in consumer confidence, due to a reluctance to spend in view of widespread job insecurity. The result of all this in Britain is that unemployment stands at just under 3m, and is increasing.\n\nSo to say that our leisure time is increasing is certainly true, even though the underlying assumption presupposes an ideal situation in which the advance of technology has had the single effect of shortening working hours. It may be that some countries are in this happy situation. The working week may have gone down to say twenty-five hours without prejudice to job security or loss of income. Inflation is low. The GNP is adequate and the balance of payments sound. Morale remains high. The population has a good basic education. All that is required is to find the right balance between work and play. Most people are not naturally lazy, so generally speaking the incentive to use leisure time constructively in built-in.\n\nThere are many ways in which this can be achieved, beginning at school. Most schools have a careers adviser as a member of staff, and many education authorities employ a peripatetic educational psychologist. Their work could be extended. There is no reason why their advice should be limited to school progress and future job opportunities. Also, the object is to find out the young person's true interests and capabilities. If academically inclined, the young person could be steered in that direction. A manually gifted child could be shown opportunities in that very wide field. Many countries could step up their coaching facilities for those who are good at sport.\n\nThere is an old saying that 'Satan hath some mischief yet for idle hands to do'. One of the aims of education should be to instill a liberal and humane attitude towards other people, especially those of other nationalities and alien cultures. A current problem in West Germany is xenophobia, caused by mass immigration from the East, and an uncertain economic future. National socialism among unemployed youth, with its hallmarks of intolerance and violence, is increasing. The fears of these young people are real, but their behavior shows up the basic deficiencies of their home and educational background. In Britain, extreme elements of Left and Right reflect their unrest by going in for petty crime and by showing hostility to the establishment and the police.\n\nThe solution is right thinking and a positive attitude to leisure, whether that leisure is enforced or not. This need is generally recognized, and some countries already provide a range of opportunities. Britain offers training and retraining schemes for young people based on what used to be called 'technical colleges'. Evening classes are available almost everywhere. The 'Open University' provides a spectrum of instruction via television. Libraries and specialized magazines have been generally available for decades.\n\nThe solution is a matter of personal incentive combined with professional direction. The key to both stems from parental direction and encouragement combined with enlightened schooling."

        "content": "Sir Winston Churchill, 1874 to 1965 (I think!). At any rate, I was stationed at Woolwich when the great man died, and the Royal Artillery had the task of organizing the funeral at St Paul's Cathedral. It was called 'Exercise Hope-Not' and it went into action at once, proving to be the greatest state funeral of the century, monarchs included. And not without good reason. Churchill inspired Britain to bring about the defeat of Adolf Hitler, at the time when all seemed to be lost.\nChurchill was a descendant of the great Duke of Marlborough, and was born at Blenheim Palace in 1874. He was sent to Harrow School where, for obvious reasons, he was very unhappy. His parents, Lord Randolph Churchill and Jenny Jerome took him away at a quite early age. The problem was the severe canings administered by one or two of the masters, ostensibly for academic shortcomings. In fact, it was likely that the masters concerned were sadists.\n\nIn 1895 he was commissioned in the 4th Hussars, and he saw active service in several minor wars. One was the Boer War, in which he was war correspondent for the Morning Post. He had already developed a fine command of the English language. Imprisoned in Pretoria, he made a dramatic escape. In 1900 he became Conservative MP for Oldham but, disagreeing with Neville Chamberlain about tariff reform, he joined the Liberals. In 1908 he became President of the Board of Trade under Asquith and brought in legislation which created labor exchanges.\n\nIn 1910 he became Home Secretary, and authorized the use of troops against armed gangsters in the Sydney Street riots. In 1911 he became First Lord of the Admiralty, and he put the fleet into a state of readiness for war. His participation in the Dardanelles campaign was a failure. From 1914 - 16 he served as a lieutenant-colonel in the trenches (First World War) and then became Minister of Munitions under Lloyd George in 1917, his main role being the development of the tank. From 1918 - 21 he was Secretary for War, and then he became Colonial Secretary, establishing the Irish Free State. He also supported the 'white generals' in Russia.\n\nOut of Parliament after the war, Churchill left the Liberals and in 1924 became a Constitutionalist. He was made Chancellor of the Exchequer, helped Britain return to the Gold Standard, and defeated the General Strike of 1926. Up to the Second World War he was out of office, disagreeing with Conservative policies.\n\nHis true talent for backs to the wall leadership was not realized until 1939 when Hitler marched on Czechoslovakia. He was soon made First Lord of the Admiralty again and then on 10th May 1940 became premier of an all-party administration. Undoubtedly, he inspired both the armed services and the civilian population to stand up to Germany. I well remember his broadcast speeches, especially the one in which he promised the British people blood and tears, toil and sweat. He announced the alliance with the Soviet Union, and he concluded a deal with President Roosevelt, the Atlantic Charter. He traveled to meet world leaders. He averted a civil war in Greece. He appointed General Montgomery to Africa, and the general achieved the turning point of the war at El Alamein. On 8th May 1945 he announced the unconditional surrender of Germany.\n\nAs so often happens, a great war leader is rejected in peace time, and Churchill did not return to power until 1951. He received the Order of Merit in 1946, became a KG in 1953, and in 1955 resigned office.\n\nNobody in this century can claim a higher role in the preservation of freedom.\n\nHis talents were considerable. He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1953, having written important war accounts and biographies. He was an accomplished artist and was elected to the Royal Academy in 1948. He also enjoyed brandy, Havana cigars and bricklaying!\n\nFew, down the ages, can match his record."

        "title": "What do you think have been the most important chances in your country during the last 100 years?",
        "content": "This essay concerns the main changes in England, many of which apply to the whole of Britain.\n\nIn the 1890s England was at the peak of her power, the strongest and most influential country in the world. Military conquest, followed by trade, had created the most far-flung empire the world had ever known. The development of the colonies under this influence fostered heavy industry and consumer manufacturing, enormously enriching the home country. Britain 'ruled the waves'. Yet the seeds of decline were already present. From 1890 to 1914 the power of Germany was increasing. Between the two world wars, Britain managed to retain her empire, but from 1945 onwards the constituent countries gradually achieved independence. British markets declined, and the emphasis shifted to the European Economic Community. By 1990 Britain had become an influential, though second rank political, financial and economic power. The country is now in constant financial trouble, and currently trade is in deep recession. In the past century, England has progressively moved into a situation of decline.\n\nSecondly, as in Germany, though to a lesser degree, saturation bombing in World War II destroyed large sections of the industrial infrastructure. Ironically, this facilitated the rebuilding of factories in the Ruhr after Marshall Aid had restored the German economy. In both countries the demand for steel and coal fell drastically, paving the way for the new electronic and high-tech industries. However, whereas the Germans retained and modernized their old infrastructure, England neglected hers. This, coupled with years of strike action, only terminated in the Thatcher regime, weakened the British economy, while the Germans strengthened theirs. The overall result is that, although still influential abroad, England has become a second-class power, living under the shadow of the USA, and currently unable to maintain her position in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Economic Community.\n\nHowever, all is not doom and gloom. Most though not all of the changes in England's social fabric have been improvements. In late Victorian and Edwardian days, class structures were rigid, and maintained both by the abject poverty of the working classes and by religious and moral pressures.\n\nThe terrible slaughter of the 1914 - 18 war largely removed the latter pressure, but inter war poverty, the slump of 1929 - 31, and the absence of any effective social security beyond a meagre dole served to keep the class system going. It was finally broken by the war of 1939 - 45. Class remains to this day, but the old barriers were eroded by the new entrepreneurial climate which climaxed in the 1980s. The post-war introduction of the Welfare State dramatically improved the lot of the poor, the concept being that the state would care for them from the cradle to the grave . This probably prevented a revolution in England. All manner of state benefits, from maternity grants and child allowances to funeral grants are now available to all whose income falls below a reasonable subsistence level. This modern care for the poor, the elderly and the handicapped is the most important social change of the century. Before 1939, the very poor ended up in the workhouse, the sick went on a doctor's panel - virtually a charity - and the unemployed received a dole which scarcely bought them food.\n\nA century ago, rail, which had displaced the stage coach, provided a countrywide network. However, in the 30s the car and the lorry were assuming greater importance. After the Second World War, Lord Beeching cut the rail network drastically and this process has continued, as roads have been improved and a nationwide M road grid built. Apart from the heaviest goods, such as coal, products are moved by container lorry, and the motor-car has become the common man's mode of transport. This has created a new set of problems; difficult parking and crowded city roads. Air travel, both internal and external, has facilitated movement both for business and pleasure, and has transformed the holiday industry.\n\nA century ago, education was almost the sole prerogative of those who could afford it, but gradually a compulsory state system has been established. This has its merits and demerits, and reforming measures are currently being taken. The same principle applies to the National Health Service. Medical advance has been such that the general health of the nation has improved beyond all recognition.\n\nA significant change for the worse has been the gradual erosion of the nuclear family. Today, there is little social disapproval of unmarried couples living together. Divorce is relatively easy. Related problems affecting children have consequently increased. Again, bad architectural thinking has done much to break down neighborliness and encourage crime.\n\nNot all the changes have been for good, but if I had to choose, I would infinitely prefer to live in 1992 than in 1892!"

        "content": "John Donne, the English metaphysical poet (d. 1631), wrote these famous words, stressing the interdependence of the human race. The death of any man, he continues, 'diminishes me', so 'never seek to know for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for thee'. The argument is that individually we owe everything, or almost everything, to human solidarity. The exceptions to that principle merely serve to prove the rule. Our own individual contributions add to the sum total of knowledge, experience and insight which in turn add to the pool available for others to draw on.\nThis dependence is most obvious in man's early days. To state that a child depends on its parents for everything goes without saying, and where a child is deprived of parental care, for whatever reason, immense harm results. Yet, wise parents avoid domination and seek to foster independence in the child while providing a secure background. This attitude in fact strengthens relationships within the ideal nuclear family, so that often three, sometimes four generations are able to make positive contributions to each other's lives.\n\nIn countries where there is sexual equality, the interdependence of the two married partners, both emotionally and practically, remains the norm, though there are minority groups which challenge the desirability of the married state. For some time, in the west, the creation of a home has required two incomes, generally for mortgage repayments. Widespread unemployment, due to the world recession, has often left the female partner as the bread-winner, and has therefore led to a role reversal. Though unnatural, this can be made to work. None of this matters where the married state, or even a strong partnership without marriage, is seen as a lifelong relationship. Mutual loyalty is the key to success and to the happiness of children.\n\nEmployment provides another example of the crucial nature of inter-dependence. Even where craftsmen in various trades personally carry out every process from raw material to finished product, the supply of raw materials and the final marketing situation are in the hands of others. In other jobs, joint action at every stage is crucial, as on the car assembly line. This is even more the case where jobs are hazardous. The miner, the crewman of a lifeboat, the trapeze artist, the policeman, the fireman, the soldier and many others all rely on their 'mates' to ensure safety and help in dangerous situations.\n\nWartime enhances the spirit of human solidarity both in the armed services and among civilians. The two World Wars brought civilians together in e.g. Britain, to such a degree that social and political barriers between classes and individuals were broken down. Thankfully, many of these barriers were not reinstated when peace came. Sadly enough, all wars produce refugees and displaced persons, and often a situation in which a return home is impossible. On humanitarian grounds, the collective consciences of enlightened countries allow at least a restricted degree of resettlement and hopefully a welcome for these unfortunate people.\n\nSport provides another example. In team events, interdependence goes without saying, but nobody can reach the highest levels in individual sports without the support of others, often family members, and the expertise of coaches.\n\nPeople tend to band together to produce solidarity in the sphere both of politics and of industrial reform. In a free society, the powers of a political party and of a trades union depend on organization and loyalty. Advances both in democracy and in workers' rights will always depend on these factors. Even religion is more than a personal relationship with God. The Second (Christian) Commandment is \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\"\n\nThe principle also applies in the realm of knowledge. Modern scientific research is a matter of team-work, and the outstanding intellects of our day work from the base of the discoveries of their predecessors, even when principles enunciated in the past are found to be inadequate, flawed, or actually false. Hawking would have been nowhere without Einstein, who would have been nowhere without Newton.\n\nThe human being is perhaps unique in that he or she can suffer emotionally and spiritually from sadness, disappointments, shame and bereavement. Some of these things can never be overcome, but at least the support of others helps us to live with them.\n\nFew of us would care to be marooned on a desert island, even given a comfortable existence. As the Christian bible reminds us in more places than one: \"You are members one of another.\""

        "content": "The impact of new transport and communication systems has had a more dramatic effect in the developing than in the old world. In the Far East, this impact will vary marginally from country to country. In the West, Britain provides some interesting changes, and it is with Britain that this essay is concerned.\nMany of the advances in Britain are due to post-Second World War developments in technology. Most have been beneficial. Some have been questionable in their effects on the life of the country. The old steam train poured smoke and grime into the atmosphere. Pollution and dirt disfigured towns and indeed whole areas close to the rail network. Diesel and electricity now eliminate this effect. However, the immense increase in road transport has brought even greater problems. Catalytic converters are so far optional. Gases dangerous both to humanity and to the protective ozone layer are freely emitted. Traffic jams proliferate, resulting in loss of money and tempers. Pollution also results from noise, as anyone living near the flight paths of London's six major airports will testify. At one time, Britain was covered by a valuable bus service network, but most of this has been eliminated or privatized, leaving many isolated villages virtually stranded, insofar as many people without private cars are concerned.\n\nThere is also a down side to the immense advances made in electronics over the past few decades. Personal privacy may be invaded by phone-tapping and the planting of bugs, which enable conversations to be picked up easily. These devices are easily obtainable. The privacy of computers can easily be picked up easily be broken by hackers, and a whole body of new legislation has had to be passed to counter these criminal offences.\n\nYet it would be unfair to deny the positive advantages of progress. The post-war period has witnessed the building of a country-wide network of motorways, the latest being the London orbital, the M25. Transport of goods has largely moved from rail to road. Container lorries convey goods both internally and to and from Europe. This has helped to enhance trade within the European Community but, like many another advance, has led to unemployment in the dock areas, since loading and off-loading containers is largely a mechanical process. Environmentalists criticize the proliferation of trunk and M roads, though nowadays their objections are largely taken into account. However, rail has not been discarded. Very heavy loads, such as coal for electricity generation, must still be moved by rail. Existing networks carry most commuters into London; inter-city services compete with short aircraft runs; England is shortly to be linked with the Continent by means of tunnels to France, now near completion; some lines are capable or taking high-speed trains.\n\nAir travel development has had a profound effect on both business and pleasure. Air-freighting has opened up new markets, greatly facilitating the import and export of all but the heaviest products. Production of course is governed by demand, and the tendency is towards increased sophistication if goods are to be competitive. So the result is a shift from mechanics to technology, from labor-intensive means of production to robotry, and from electricity to electronics. This has meant significant unemployment, the need to establish a state benefit system where this did not already exist, and the relocating of many work-forces. A consequence has been urban sprawl and the establishment of new centers of light industry. A further consequence has been environmental damage.\n\nAir travel for pleasure has opened up the world to holiday makers. The popular venue for the British worker is no longer the seaside town; it is the Mediterranean with its more or less guaranteed sunshine. This loss of sterling is somewhat offset by overseas tourism in Britain.\n\nAnd in the sphere of communications, speed and efficiency have been greatly enhanced. Satellite telephone communication enables instant world-wide dialing, together with faxing, on the same principle. Television and radio today permit instantaneous news coverage. The recent Barcelona Olympics were a wonderful example.\n\nAll these changes tend to move governments and peoples in the direction of a one-world concept, though without having any effect on the cause of peace and justice. The end result is merely a sharpening of our perception of man's inhumanity to man."

        "title": "Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of industrial development.",
        "content": "Over the past three decades, there has been an explosion of industrial development in many Far Eastern countries, ranging from those with no workforce expertise to the far more sophisticated states such as Japan and Singapore. Most countries have some natural resource to develop, be it oil, timber, rubber or minerals and gemstones. The general process has been to exploit these resources by importing foreign expertise and equipment. Ideally, the results have led to dramatic increases in countries' GNP, favorable balances of trade, and the establishment of hard currencies which attract foreign investment. All these should lead to the building of hospitals and health centers, schools and colleges, sporting facilities and other amenities. Good wages should permit radical improvements in living standards. Unfortunately, this only happens where a country enjoys a reasonably democratic political system. Otherwise, in a one-party state, the temptation is to divert new money into armaments, unnecessary extravagances and sometimes the pockets of those in power.\nSingapore and Japan are not typical of the Far East, since for decades they have been ahead of the rest in industrial development, although keen competition has reduced their lead in the past seven or eight years. Oil exploration in the Singapore region has dropped, and with it the demand for the re-export of oil-related machinery, drilling equipment and metal sheets and bars. Electronic components, diodes, photocells and integrated circuits; consumer goods such as radios, TVs, clothing, furniture and vegetable oils have also declined, due to competition from countries where much lower wage levels are acceptable. However, Singapore will always benefit from its free trade zones. There are six; five for seaborne cargo and one for airborne. With their time-limited but duty and document-free storage facilities, they will always remain an attractive proposition. So does INTRACO, an international and paid-up trading company which has many useful functions.\n\nThe above relates to trade as much as to industry, but the results of both are much the same. On the industrial side, apart from the products listed in paragraph 2, mention must be made of the great diversity of industrial products in modern Singapore; industrial chemicals, printing and publishing, shipyard re-structuring and upgrading, aircraft repair and overhaul capabilities, machine tools and related products, and office equipment. About 8% of the land area of Singapore is used for farming, the main products being pork, poultry, eggs, vegetables, fish and cut flowers.\n\nSo to summarize the advantages. Industrial proliferation generates jobs. Money can be spent on universities, colleges, schools and training centers. State housing, mostly blocks of flats, offers rented accommodation. Health, social and police services can be financed. Typical health hazards, such as the anopheles mosquito, can be eliminated, and both hygiene and family planning publicized. Above all, relatively late industrialization means that state-of-the-art factories can be built. There is no legacy of ancient factories to modernize or demolish.\n\nYet all is not sweetness and light. There is something to be said for a more leisurely pace of life. A sudden shift to urban dwelling and high-tech employment can and does, set up psychological problems, which lead to health problems. Moreover, there was something to be said for the semi-jungle nature of Singapore, and it would be pleasant to have a few wild tigers present. However, the main disadvantage is that industrialization sets up living standard expectations which depend absolutely on a healthy overseas trade. At present there is a world trade recession. Also, surrounding countries are becoming far more competitive. Inflation and widespread unemployment are the chief dangers."

        "title": "The place of color in everyday life.",
        "content": "What constitutes perception of color is not fully understood, though the quality of light coming from a colored object can be analyzed into electromagnetic radiations of various wavelengths. White light consists of a spectrum band of shades merging from red to blue. Objects will absorb certain parts of the band and reflect others, giving a perception of color to the eye. This perception is standard to the human race, though about two per cent of males and rather less females suffer from color blindness. Red and amber become indistinguishable, a dangerous situation at traffic lights!\nWhether realized or not, color exerts a great effect on humanity from the psychological as well as from the aesthetic point of view. For example, environmental coloring profoundly influences our working lives. It is not only for reasons of economy that until recent years, at least in Britain, governmental and armed services offices were uniformly painted in yellow ochre. So were hospitals, state schools, prisons and most other official institutions. The object was to create an undistracting environment. Latterly it has been realized that pastel shades are the most helpful. Sharp colors tend to lead to unrest and aggression. Drab colors cause depression and negative attitudes. Aesthetic considerations are more a matter of fashion. People are easily influenced by propaganda and fashion. A short time ago, many people were led to prefer sharp, primary colors in wall paint and soft furnishings, with no regard to match and mismatch. This was short-lived. The idea was soon superseded by light pastel shades which provide both a restful atmosphere and the ideal background for offsetting furniture, pictures and floor coverings.\n\nIn those days, the 60s, there was also a craze for psychedelic painting. Cars, generally bangers , were patterned with any kind of design. The thinking behind this was to reflect the kaleidoscopic colors experienced in the drug-induced states typical of that appalling decade. Fast colour switches were also a feature of the pop scene , and remain so to this day. Fashionable dress for children still reflects this objectionable colour freedom, which is known to be exciting to the younger generation, and to some degree enhances their urge to freedom. Perhaps my rather scathing comments are typical of my generation!\n\nArt in primary schools has undergone a profound change in recent years. Finger paints, poster colors, felt-tips and myriad-shaded drawing pencils, allied to the teaching attitude of free expression, enable youngsters to use colour more imaginatively than was permitted under older regimes. On balance, this may confer advantages which were not available to earlier generations.\n\nIn most Western and Westernized countries, the choice of style and colour in clothing for both sexes is a matter of individual choice, though tradition plays an important part. In Britain, for example, women's fashions were always dictated by class and income in the old days. Nowadays, mass production offers a much wider range of style and colour. Men tend to be much more drab -- quite the opposite in nature! -- and in Britain, this has its origin in Cromwell's Protestant ethic in the 17th Century. It led eventually to the standardized dark suit, collar and tie, which have now become almost a uniform, spreading to many countries where Britain once had an interest. Yet the male still has an instinct for colour and variety, which today is expressed in casual clothing. In Arab countries, dress design and coloring for both sexes is dictated by religion. Women wear full-length and loose-fitting black garments in public.\n\nThe importance of colour is seen in several other aspects of life. The best exponents of both representational and impressionistic painting use rich colour freely, using light to obtain depth and realism, to highlight, and to convey movement and emotion. The works of Turner and Van Gogh typify the two schools. The best of colored photography follows the same principles. Natural coloring may be subtly modified by the use of light filters.\n\nIn temperate and tropical zones, shades of green predominate in natural surroundings. This color is universally restful and relaxing, though it is notably absent in many inner city areas where the dull grey of concrete has a depressing effect. This is recognized in the surprising number of parks and gardens in London, for example. These make a significant contribution to social ease. In hot and dry equatorial areas, the above does not apply. People are conditioned to the browns, yellows and reds of their surroundings.\nWildlife uses colour very subtly, mostly for camouflage purposes. Certain fish and many insects use camouflage as a defense against predators, and some can even change colour in order to merge with their surroundings. The chameleon is the most obvious example. The same principle is used by armies. Khaki was chosen for the trenches, olive drab for bocage, and broken outlines for buildings.\n\nA final note concerns color of skin ! An important element in the one-world movement is the abolition of color prejudice and differentiation. Social taboos, particularly concerning inter-marriage, are of increasingly less importance."

        "title": "What is the value of mathematics?",
        "content": "The minimal objective in schools in most countries is to ensure that leavers, somewhere in their teens, are both literate and numerate. And while teaching methods have changed and in some ways advanced in recent decades, where the traditional approach has been totally abandoned, far too many pupils leave school innumerate. Numeracy may be defined as the ability to carry out elementary tasks under the three headings-arithmetic, geometry and algebra. Of these, arithmetic is the most valuable for ordinary purposes.\nIf that is true, it is something of an irony that electronics, which help mathematical processes in so many directions, have had an adverse effect on pupils' ability to do mental arithmetic. Pocket calculators give immediate solutions to virtually all mathematical problems. In no way do they exercise the brain. So, the use of logarithms and the slide-rule has disappeared. The ideal situation is the teaching of mathematics by the old methods and the use of calculators for checking purposes only. Given the basics, a pupil can then use the calculator to great effect in the outside world.\n\nSo, what are the uses of mathematics to the ordinary person? As a wage-earner, it is an obvious advantage to be able to check one's wage slip and bring any discrepancies in deductions for tax, insurance, union dues etc to notice. Secondly, it is essential to be able to work out a personal budget, and if possible to allow for savings to cover holiday expenses, other luxuries, and unforeseen calls on the pocket. As a professional, self-employed or business person, further advantages emerge. Assume you wish to start a small business and you approach your bank manager for a starting loan. He or she will expect a realistic breakdown of initial costs, wage bills, if any, expected returns, with provision made for taxation, VAT if applicable, rent, leasehold or mortgage repayments, and of course the preparation and auditing of accounts. None of this is possible without at least an elementary knowledge of mathematics, and your manager will show no sympathy if you expect to pay somebody else to do the work.\n\nAll of the scientific, engineering and technological professions demand the application of pure mathematics to physical problems, and this then becomes applied mathematics. A bridge-builder must work out all the stresses and strains to which the bridge will, or may be subjected, taking every factor into account; maximum load, wind pressure, storms and floods being obvious examples, in order to comply with safety standards. Mathematics provide the essential preliminary to this or any other major construction, such as a tower block, or an oil rig, and indeed to every minor building project.\n\nApart from mechanical engineering, applied mathematics are crucial to the generation and use of electricity, and to the sciences of astronomy, optics, thermodynamics, aeronautics, ship-building and virtually every other practical aspect of modern life. The manifold uses of electronics and computers are all mathematically-based. It is no exaggeration to say that life as we know it would be impossible were it not for this fundamental study.\n\nIn fact, every past generation since history began could say the same thing. It is true that there have been significant advances in the past few decades. However, counting and measuring date back to the early civilizations of the Chinese, the Hindus, the Babylonians and the Egyptians. Thales of Miletus and Pythagoras invented theoretical geometry, and in the 4th and 3rd Centuries BC, Euclid and Archimedes added to this knowledge. Western numerals are Hindu-Arabic in origin, reaching the West by about 1000 AD. However, significant developments came later, from the 15th Century onwards, and one needs only to mention Descartes, Napier, Leibniz, Lobachevski and Einstein, and what the application of their discoveries achieved, to underline the fact that mathematics has always been crucial to man's material progress."

        "title": "How important is discipline in your life?",
        "content": "The creation or development of self-esteem is the motivation behind discipline, whether self-imposed or not. Pride is the main factor impelling us to make the most of our lives and to fulfill our perceived actual or potential role in society. Thus, discipline makes for self-respect. Most of us are naturally lazy and selfish. Parents and dormitory prefects had to drag me out of bed. Schoolmasters begged me to try to use my brains a little more. My school peers ragged me unmercifully as I stuffed chocolates and sweets into my mouth and therefore put on fat. However, by my early teens, two factors-conscience and outside pressures, caused me to review my life-style. I was letting down parents and school. I decided to do some academic work, to lose some weight, and to build some muscle.\nA minority of people seem to be born with a single-minded motivation which leads them to achieve, irrespective of outside pressures. Most of us grudgingly accept discipline exerted from outside. This tends to sharpen our perception of what we could achieve and to appreciate its value. So, a decision is reached, or not, as the case may be. Imposed discipline becomes increasingly unnecessary as it is replaced by self-discipline. We begin to set ourselves standards well beyond the minimum expected by others.\n\nSo discipline becomes important in three contexts. First, young people are inclined to emulate a role model either in sport or academics, or even the pop scene. Second, there is a realization that we owe something to the aspirations of parents, whose expectations spring from love. Third, we are all the products of the society in which we live, and there is a case for saying that we should try to put something back. Unfortunately, in some western countries, many young people became the victims of drug and anarchic manipulators, and chose to opt out of responsibility. In the 60s these people formed an alternative culture, and are now the parents of some of the worst elements in the younger generation. In Britain, four out of five crimes today are committed by teenagers. There is also a large body of so-called new age travelers who cause nuisance all over Britain and refuse all dealings with normal society, except insofar as they expect to live on state handouts, funded of course by the taxpayer. Since 1960, part of the problem has been the steady erosion of the nuclear family. Another part has been the absence of moral training in the state school system. A third factor has been urban deprivation and unemployment. The old saying \"example speaks louder than words\" has much truth in it, and the exceptions prove the rule. Self-discipline involves taking decisions. Where there is innate weakness, however, the factors mentioned above will tip the scales in the wrong direction. Even when the background is unexceptionable, there are isolated cases where young people go the wrong way. This could be due to genetic weakness.\n\nMany activities are personal rather than communal. The artist, the writer, the solo musician, the athlete, must all set themselves targets. To achieve these means self-imposed discipline. However, this self-discipline becomes a pleasure the more it is practiced. The novelist Trollope earned his living in the postal service. However, his ambition was to become the most prolific writer of the 19th Century. He achieved this by getting up early and writing 2,000 words every day before he went off to work. He did this for most of his life.\n\nMost people have a religion, and discipline has its relevance here, not only in the context of regular prayer and scripture reading. Our faith is often tested by disappointment, failure, or loss of a loved person. So there are dark periods when only discipline can save us from apostasy. Mention must also be made of the armed services. Here, the same principle of an external discipline designed to lead to self- discipline also applies. An obligation to national service is usually resented by young people at the time. However, its value is nearly always appreciated in later life, for two reasons. It will carry a person through hard as well as good times. It will instill a sense of obligation to other people.\n\nModeration in all things, however. If discipline is important in your life, so be it. It is when discipline becomes obsessive that it has real dangers. A slimming campaign may be good. When it becomes obsessive, it may lead to anorexia. The psychological dangers of obsessive discipline are inflexibility, serious-mindedness, pomposity, lack of humor and the loss of a sense of fun and enjoyment. No workaholic can ever be a good family man or woman. And alienation from others may lead to severe nervous disorders."

        "title": "From your own experience, how would you define the pleasures of reading?",
        "content": "As a very small boy, the first pleasure I had from reading was being able to crow over some of my peers who couldn't. I became less of a little snob as I grew up. At every stage, of course, the reader finds different sources of pleasure. As a child, as far as I can remember, I looked for interest, fantasy and a good laugh. Up to the age of eight or nine, children seem to live in a world of half fantasy and half reality. Many enjoy situations in which adults are outwitted. Thus, popular comics were Dandy, Beano and Rainbow, and not the sobersides Children's Newspaper. The Richmal Crompton 'William' books were great favorites. So was Enid Blyton. Adventure was found in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and R L Stevenson. Crime detection meant Sherlock Homes. Mystery and horror were supplied by writers such as Bram Stoker and Wilkie Collins. In more modern times, there seems to be little significant change, except that Superman, E.T. and space travel yarns have been added.\nThe common factor in most of this is that the child and young person can pick up a book and escape from the humdrum into a new world of excitement, sometimes identifying with the hero or heroine. Girls tend to favor school stories and, later, magazine romances and romantic novels, taste for the latter often lasting well into adult life.\n\nThe attraction of escapism, modified of course by experience, lasts into later life. Most adults enjoy a detective story for relaxation. The murder or crime concerned is rarely dealt with psychologically. It is merely the peg on which to hang the clues leading to the final solution. The best of such stories also develop character to some extent and reflect the social back- ground of the years in which the novel is set. Thus, the pleasure of reading, say Agatha Christie, is partly nostalgia and partly mental exercise. Emotion plays a negligible part.\n\nAnother genre of books written for pleasure and relaxation is the humorous novel, represented by P G Wodehouse, Mark Twain and Stephen Leacock. Here, the amusement lies in comedy of situation, turn of phrase, and very clever plotting. Again, they are period pieces, in the case of Wodehouse evocative of the idle young rich of the 30s, and entirely without social comment. Humor draws the sting from inequality.\n\nI read the above categories for pleasure, relaxation, and a good laugh. However, most educated people have a balanced reading diet which develops over the years as a result of specialization in one subject or another. Most of us have developed a general interest in politics and current events, and in democratic countries these are well covered in the responsible press and in specialized magazines. In fact, all subjects are catered for by specialized magazines, ranging from agriculture to car maintenance. In these contexts, the pleasure of riding is derived from interest in the subject.\n\nInterest in politics and current events leads to the development of a historical perspective, and hence interest in the past. This is well catered for in an immense body of historical and biographical literature. Social history is necessary to the understanding of current trends. Historical romances often provide a good read, and the best of them are very informative about the events of past times.\n\nHowever, the classics provide the best all-round source of pleasure. It is one thing to have to study texts for one's A or O Levels. That can be hard work. It is quite another to rid them for pleasure in later life. They offer a more sophisticated source of interest than can be obtained from any other genre; development of character, social and political comment, action and reflection, humor, pathos, sometimes tragedy. The appeal of poetry should not be ignored. The best of it requires the ultimate in the command of language."

        "title": "Birds",
        "content": "Within the past few years, interest in all aspects of our environment has increased in proportion to the damage we are doing to it. Birds form not only an attractive but an essential part of the environment. Yet the protection afforded to them is patchy, at best. Taking Europe as an example and France in particular, there is a custom in that country to shoot as many as possible of the small song-birds as they return north from their migration to Africa. They are considered a delicacy.\nOf course the shooting of birds in Britain for sport as well as for food has been a tradition for centuries, but the shooting is restricted to game birds, grouse, pheasants, partridges and wild duck. Except for the wild duck, these species are hand-reared and fed by gamekeepers, the numbers shot are limited, and the shooting-season, which begins on 12th August, ends well before the breeding season begins. Thus, the game species are well preserved.\n\nFor many years steps have been taken to maintain, if not increase numbers of all types of birds. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds keeps a careful watch on preservation, and has instigated laws against the theft of eggs, which are rigorously implemented. Many sanctuaries for water-birds as well as songbirds have been established up and down the length of Britain. The public in general has been educated to place a high value on the bird-life of their country.\n\nYet for reasons other than shooting and theft, various species seem to dwindle away to the point of extinction, causing widespread concern. For many decades, habitats have been systematically destroyed by the clearance of woods and hedges to provide the large fields needed for modern agriculture. Secondly, certain chemicals used to keep crops free from pests also destroyed the food on which many birds survived. Today, the problem is realized, and attention is given both to habitat and food, with the result that many species have been saved. Some chemicals, which also poisoned the birds themselves, have been banned. Wide strips between fields are left in their natural state to provide cover and nesting facilities. Many woods and coppices have been replanted with the traditional varieties of trees instead of the cash-crop conifers. Sea and marsh birds have been encouraged to return by exerting some control over land reclamation. In many countries, the protection of birds is being given a high priority.\n\nBirds are appreciated for their beauty and their song. However, neither faculty exists merely to please the human race. The colored plumage of many male birds has the function of impressing females prior to the mating season. Birdsong may have the same purpose at that time, though some of it seems to be simply the expression of joie de vivre and perhaps a means of staking out territory. The writer visited Belsen concentration camp shortly after its liberation. There was an eerie silence about the place. During and for some time after the holocaust, no bird came near the camp. So there may indeed be an emotional as well as a practical aspect to birdsong. Another practical function is to warn against predators and if possible scare them off.\n\nBirds play an essential part in the cycle of nature. They may and do raid crops, but they also eat grubs and insects which do far more damage. They also have a role as scavengers; that work is completed by the insects, which in turn fall prey to the birds.\n\nA few species, the ratital, have become flightless through natural selection. These are the emu, the ostrich, the rhea, the kiwi and the cassowary. The vast majority, the carinatal, are wonderfully adapted to flight, some being capable of spending most of their two to three-year lifespan on the wing. The muscular power of their wings relative to body-weight, and the aerodynamic efficiency of their wingspans and feather distribution, developed over millions of years, is one of nature's marvels. That is why the loss of so many land-birds through insensitive agricultural development, and of sea-birds through oil-spills, is such a tragedy.\n\nAnother class of birds under threat and forming an essential part of the natural cycle is the predator; owls, hawks, eagles etc. These control small rodent pests and act as scavengers. Some also provide the sport of falconry, being to some extent amenable to human control.\n\nPerhaps the most wonderful feature of the bird is its ability to navigate so accurately in migrating. Its high body temperature and stamina can be built up to sustain amazingly long journeys, but the way in which the Arctic tern, for example, can fly direct from pole to pole, selecting just one small island stop en route, is not fully understood. Theories are manifold, but since fledglings with no experience perform this miracle, much still remains to be learnt."

        "title": "\"The Arts speak not only to us but about us\". Discuss.",
        "content": "The instinct to produce an art-form is just one of a series of factors which differentiate us from the animal world. It dates back at least as far as the cave-dwellers of pre-history who produced wall drawings which possess both artistic ability and emotional power. Hunting is the main theme of these, but the situations depicted between man and beast are those of stress and danger. Were these drawings meant to exert a cathartic effect on man's natural fear by giving him a constant reminder of the worst he would have to face?\n\nThroughout recorded history, painting has fulfilled this dual role. Subject-matter, depicted in tempera, fresco, oil and color wash, has reflected every facet of human life and activity and of the natural world. In most periods, there seems to have been cultural freedom, but not in all. Fashion, convention and religious pressures have dictated both subject-matter and treatment in certain periods. The various European schools of the Middle Ages, with the exception of the Dutch and Flemish, largely confined themselves to religious and mythological subjects. These paintings were gifted but stylized. Following the Reformation, these constraints disappeared, and subject-matter broadened, though favorable portraiture of the aristocracy, who patronized prominent painters, has continued until modern times. Turner was the catalyst in shifting from the constraints of objectivity to the freedom of subjectivity. His work inspired the Impressionists, who painted according to their own often subconscious reactions to the subject-matter. This freedom allowed as much to be read into the character and outlook of the painter as into what appeared on the canvas.\n\nMuch the same may be said about sculpture. All the ancient civilizations have left examples, mostly by unknown artists, in stone, wood and metal, usually bronze. Until fairly recent times, European sculpture followed the traditions of classical Greece and Rome and of renaissance Italy. Much of it concentrated on the beauty and grace of the human form, both male and female, on athletes, on prominent figures, and on political, mythological and military groupings. While representational sculpture has always reflected contemporary fashion and taste in choice of subject-matter, the same cannot be said of much modern sculpture. As in some schools of painting, much modern sculpture is abstract in concept. It may be titled, but the interpretation is left to the individual viewer. Epstein and Henry Moore were prominent exponents of this school. It says little to most of us, and virtually nothing about us. Today's more extreme exponents are equally inscrutable.\n\nModern architecture provides a variation on the same theme. This is due to the availability of new materials; reinforced concrete, plastics and other synthetics. Such materials allow the construction of tower blocks and offices, since the old limitations imposed by weight at each floor level no longer apply. So since Gropius and Le Corbusier, architects have given themselves a free hand. Opinion is sharply divided as to their success. Many examples are functional, but the architects' fallacy has been to ignore two things : human reaction against user-unfriendliness, and compatibility with surroundings. In both contexts, much modern architecture fails dismally. It succeeds only where it replaces nothing of value, or where space is severely restricted, as in Hong Kong. In many countries which have a civilization spanning the centuries, consistency in design and use of materials has provided buildings which go well together, and fit into their natural backgrounds.\n\nTheatre, music and dancing all provide excellent examples of the truth of the topic-statement. The classical theatre of the Far East offers the Westerner great interest, since it speaks of a totally unfamiliar world and gives fascinating character insights. Western theatre offers three genres, all of them expressive of their periods : the classical, typified by Shakespeare and a host of others down to Edwardian times, the 30s drama, concerned exclusively with the doings of the British upper and middle classes, and the modern theatre, which is largely working-class based. It goes without saying that music speaks most eloquently to our emotions. Yet it also reflects the mores and tastes of the periods in which it was composed. J. S. Bach reflects the love of form, shape and dignity of the pre-Romantic period; many others, notably the later Beethoven and composers such as Liszt and Chopin, the freedoms of Romanticism, echoed in the poets of the period -- Wordsworth, Shelley, Tennyson and Byron.\n\nMuch more could be written about prose and poetry -- even the dance -- on the same theme, but the case seems to be proved! The arts not only speak to our emotions, they also reflect our lives."

        "title": "Travel is said to broaden the mind. How far do You agree?",
        "content": "What is meant by broaden the mind ? Its opposite is to be narrow-minded, and this implies a rigid outlook conforming to preconceived ideas, and reluctance to change or modify those ideas. Several factors go to produce such an attitude. First, we tend to follow parental guidance in behavior, in religion, and in social and political beliefs. These are often reinforced by school and state. Such conditioning leads either to inflexibility or to reaction.\n\nIn the West, the 60s heralded such a reaction. In the UK and the USA, one effect of war had been to demolish many social and international values. Moreover, air travel was becoming more available. The 50s saw an attempt in both countries to maintain pre-war values, such as the work ethic, class structures and general conformity to old standards. So young people began to rebel. They opted out of society. They joined movements such as Flower Power and other brands of oriental mysticism. Society was rejected, responsibility to the state discarded, and accepted moral standards rejected. The pop scene, with its songs of protest, came into being. San Francisco became the centre of this alternative society and the Mecca of young dropouts worldwide.\n\nThis major movement among young people persists to this day. It illustrates the complete reversal of the statement that travel broadens the mind. Minds had been changed by the media, and this resulted in travel. Recently, a more acceptable result has been achieved by the influence of the media. We are now made instantly aware by the media of the sufferings of the poor and powerless due to war, violence, terrorism, oppression, injustice and natural disaster. So many worthwhile young people now spend a year or so before or after their further education courses in voluntary service overseas. Again, this shows that the topic-statement is true up to a point. Much is learnt by young people on these overseas ventures, but the motivation behind their departure is as much compassion as the desire to gain experience.\n\nThis desire to learn from overseas travel was the ostensible motive behind the grand tour of Europe undertaken by rich young men and women in the 18th and 19th Centuries in Britain. The true motivation however was just to have a good time. Nobody bothered to learn the local languages. The rich young people stuck together, barely mixing even with their foreign counterparts. They usually came home as ignorant as they were when they left. Foreigners were merely quaint. They really belonged to the servant class.\n\nColonialism, in the days of the British Empire, for example, had various subtle effects on British character. Members of the Raj and the army were dispatched to, say India, with a set of preconceived ideas about the essential superiority and rightness of the British character and system. The system did good in many ways, not least in maintaining the pax Britannica . And undoubtedly some of the values of the colonized peoples brushed off on to the colonialists. Overseas trade which followed colonization had the same effect. Yet this applied to a limited cross-section of the British people. Xenophobia remained the general attitude. In 1938, a black missionary wearing a turban was invited to preach in a Midlands country church. On his arrival in the village he was followed to the vicarage by a jeering crowd. The writer of this essay learned something of the Middle East by spending some three years in Palestine after the Second World War. The British Army's task was to defend the mandate which limited the number of immigrant Jews. I went to Palestine a confirmed Arabs, somewhat hostile to the gradual takeover of the country by the Jews. However, having seen the condition of some of the survivors of the holocaust and learnt something of their indomitable courage, enterprise and willingness to work, I gradually achieved a more balanced view.\n\nSince the 1950s, air travel for business and pleasure has familiarized the ordinary person of many countries with the outlook, lifestyle, and good and bad qualities of other nations. The degree of this mind-broadening however depends on the traveler's maturity in the first place, because it is quite possible to travel and learn nothing. Many British people emigrate to warmer countries such as France, Spain, Italy and Cyprus to spend their retired years. These expatriates form colonies which might just as well be English villages. They do not learn the language of their adopted country, they take no interest in social and political affairs, they mix only with each other. Travel does not broaden their minds.\n\nSo perhaps the general principle that travel broadens the mind is true, although it should be qualified. First, there must be a genuine interest in the country concerned, and where possible at least a little of the language learnt. Second, there must be some attempt to learn something of the history, social outlook, customs and religion of that country. Third, an open mind is essential if travel is to confer any benefit; prejudice and preconceptions must be discarded. Finally, much can be learnt from foreign nationals living in your own country. Given these pre-conditions, foreign travel will become an essential ingredient in mutual understanding and therefore, hopefully, the spread of peace."

        "title": "\"Disasters bring out the best and the worst in people\". Discuss.",
        "content": "The media keep disaster in the forefront of our minds. TV, radio and the front pages of the press seem to revel in disaster, whether natural or man-made, because the public have a morbid curiosity in it, providing it happens to other people. Disaster boosts TV ratings and sells newspapers.\n\nAs we absorb the results of a civil war, a famine, an earthquake, a hurricane, an air crash, we tend to put ourselves in the position of the victims and wonder how we would react. In such situations, most people act instinctively, and what they do is more spontaneous than calculated. That spontaneity is usually the subconscious reflection of character, and because life for most of us is lived on an even keel, how we behave in emergency is largely unpredictable, unless we have been previously conditioned to react in certain ways.\n\nSo what governs our reaction to an emergency? The answer is character. Character is governed by genetic structure, by upbringing and training, and by self-discipline, or its absence. If we react badly, we show cowardice, selfishness and indifference to the plight of others. If we react well, our conduct reflects the opposite of these failings. In the latter case, genetic history alone may govern our actions, but in most cases, people are poised between good and bad. It is then that external conditioning will tip the scales in one direction or the other. Even more important than training is love, the kind which puts others first and helps us to forget self. This is relatively easy where our nearest and dearest are concerned, more difficult and perhaps more admirable where the others concerned have no emotional claim on us. The old Latin tag \"amor vincit omnia\", love conquers all things, is most germane to our reaction to disaster.\n\nThe Second World War gave me a vivid example of two contrasting reactions to the same event. The house of a neighbor received a direct hit from a bomb which killed one of the daughters of the family. The father was a sincere Christian. Most people would have shaken their fist at the skies over Coventry which were still full of German dive-bombers. Instead, he fell on his knees and prayed for the souls of the German pilots. The following day, what remained of his possessions lying round the shattered house were looted. Two very different reactions to disaster. Looting often follows the breakdown of law and order. It is never justifiable, but it may be less reprehensible in some circumstances than others. Some would disagree, but they are those who have never seen a disaster such as a famine. If my children were crying for food and I had the chance to steal a bag of flour to make bread for them, I think I would steal the flour. Would this action reflect the best or the worst in me?\n\nThere is no worse disaster than war, and the trench warfare of 1914-18 saw perhaps the greatest slaughter of humanity of all time. Caught in machine-gun crossfire and by artillery barrages, hundreds of thousands of men were killed or maimed in a single battle. Yet there were countless examples of bravery and unselfishness on both sides when men would help the wounded or engage hopeless odds with total disregard for their own survival. Some or these actions were recognized by the award of medals and decorations. Most were not. The unknown soldier was in some ways the most admirable product of this century.\n\nAnd whether the disaster be a war, an earthquake or a hurricane, adversity tends to bring people together in a way that nothing else can. It goes without saying that the effectiveness of a service unit depends on the fact that every man knows he can depend on his colleague, whether he likes him or not. Whatever the disaster, the same spirit is seen in most of the civilian population. People open their homes to each other, offer help, comfort and encouragement in a way which is never seen when life is easy and normal.\n\nCowardice accounts for most of people's worst reactions to disaster. In fact few people, if any, are fearless. What, then, accounts for acts of bravery? The truth lies in the old Biblical saying -- Perfect love casteth out fear. Another classic example of the dual result of disaster is the sinking of the SS Titanic in 1912. More than 1,500 people were drowned, because there was insufficient lifeboat space. First-class passengers had lifeboat priority; some voluntarily relinquished their seats to women sailing in the second class. Since it was a matter of women and children first , some men dressed themselves up as women. Thus, disaster brings out character.\n\nNot all of us would react to disaster as we think. Self- preservation is the strongest natural impulse of all. Indifference to self has to be a very powerful counter-impulse if we are to be confident of behaving in the way we would hope."

        "title": "What childhood illusions have you had shattered as you were growing up?",
        "content": "For the student, this essay should prove easy enough, since childhood and growing up are recent experiences. For this writer, it is not so easy, the growing up period being rather a long time ago. However, it is said that as we get older, childhood memories become much sharper, so I hope that what will now be written is based in fact and not in fancy!\nI was lucky enough to have good parents, who gave me a secure background and who were ambitious for me to achieve success. in life. Some children then, and perhaps more now in Britain, lacked this basic advantage. Almost from birth, these children are neglected, often ill-treated, subjected to violence or abuse. Few are given incentives. They grow up believing that the world is against them, and quickly become street-wise , concerned with self-protection, and using violence to get something out of life. Childish illusions are knocked out of them almost from birth. Their view of life may be distorted, but it is realistic.\n\nAs a more fortunate boy, my first illusion was that life is essentially fair, that people who merit life's rewards always receive them, and that the tragedies of life are somehow deserved. It took the death of my best friend following a sudden terminal illness to shatter that illusion. That episode, and at a later stage, the deaths of so many of my contemporaries in the Second World War, finally convinced me that life is not a tight moral framework. It was not until many years had passed that I began to perceive the answers which a religious faith supplies. The obverse of that coin is that life often is fair when one hopes for a little unfairness. I remember having to take a History exam for which I had done little or no work. The night before the exam, I prayed hard for the few questions I could answer which would give me a pass. The right questions didn't come, and quite rightly I failed.\n\nChildren brought up with a religious background believe that prayers are always answered. One day, as a small boy, I had been stopped by my father from doing something I wanted to do, and I was angry. It came to bedtime, and prayers, finally to 'God bless ...' So I said, with my father present, 'God bless Mummy, and Grannie and Grandpa, and my dog, and that's all!' It took me some years to realize that God takes a rather more sophisticated view of our prayer life.\n\nAnother illusion is that the world is a safe place, that people are basically kind, and that they will never harm children. That was much more true in my youth than it is today, when, at least in Britain, children are taught never to speak to strangers. This is for obvious reasons in view of the great increase in child molestation and even abduction. As a child, I lived on the outskirts of a Midlands city but in easy reach of the country- side. My friends and I could roam freely through the lanes and over farm land, given a benevolent farmer. However, word went round that a small girl I knew had had something nasty done to her. The grown-ups wouldn't specify what that nasty thing was, but we were all warned not to talk to strange men. Another illusion shattered, but that was rather exceptional in those days.\n\nI cannot over-praise the kindness of my parents, but in their advice, however kindly meant, there was sometimes a false note. Mothers are naturally protective, sometimes over-protective. Mine was always averse to my playing rugby football, for which I had some talent. Of course some people get hurt. I was always rather in two minds until I realized the difference between natural concern and over-protectiveness. Another fact unrealized at the time is that great, sometimes life-long friendships are made through that most social of all games. To believe that parents are always wise is another illusion.\n\nHowever kind parents may be to their children, their conduct to each other is not always perfect. If we are fortunate as young children, we tend to idealize parental relationships. Differences soon become apparent, however, and another illusion is soon shattered. In the Britain of the 30s, marriage was sacrosanct. Divorce was career-threatening and socially unacceptable. Unhappiness therefore tended to fester within an ostensibly good marriage. Children were generally shielded from a soured relationship, but raised voices in another room, inexplicable absences by father, the visits of strange men to mother when she was alone, soon shattered the illusion that they married and lived happily ever after .\n\nPerhaps the final illusion to go the same way may be attributed to a strong body and a good constitution. Such physical assets build up the subconscious belief that one will live for ever. Accidents will always happen to other people. So will the aging process. These illusions are soon laid to rest."

        "title": "Reading novels is a waste of time. Discuss.",
        "content": "The designation novel covers a very wide spectrum of literature. It comprises the classic works of fiction of all countries. By definition, a novel is a prose piece of over 60,000 words. Many are much longer. Anything shorter is a novella ; if much shorter, a short story. The genre grew up independently in many countries, particularly those of Europe, though since this is an English General Paper it is the English (or British) tradition that will generally be referred to, with occasional references to countries which have produced fiction in some kind of English, such as the USA.\nFiction of course is not limited to the classics, which form a relatively small part of it. For at least three centuries the bookshops have always been full of the more ephemeral kinds of prose; the American block-buster , the J Arthur Clarke type of space fiction, the ghost story, the detective whodunnit ?, the romantic novel, the psychological thriller, the historical novel, the adventure story, the war story. The list is endless.\n\nIt is quite possible to become hooked on novel reading, and this has two dangers. To read novels when you should be doing something else, e.g. study, or practical chores, is indeed a waste of time. And it is never courteous to have one's nose in a novel when visitors arrive! Secondly, there are some people who find in a novel a means of escape from reality. This has other dangers. Too much relapse into fantasy may destroy one's ability to face facts.\n\nIf reading novels can be a waste of time, reading bad novels is always a waste of time and can be positively harmful. A really bad novel is not easy to define, but for anybody with intellect it has some, or even all of the following features: unreality in characterization and situation, poor construction, concentration on sex and violence for the sake of it, bad sentence construction, a boring approach, expletives and bad language generally, a biased attitude to people, situations and issues, and stereotyping of characters.\n\nThat said, to read anything is arguably better than read nothing, or sinking to the bottom line, mindless television watching. At least the capacity to read demonstrates that one is literate. In Britain today, there is an alarming number of school-leavers from the state system who can neither read nor write.\n\nThe case for reading the classics need hardly be made. Their characters live, and are of their time. Descriptions of town and country engross the reader. Stories, and therefore plots, seem to grow out of the characters. Often, great national events, wars and revolutions provide the background, but are integral at the same time. Characters and great events affect each other. The same process is seen in the good political, maritime or war story. The classical novel provides a window on another world; good contemporary novels offer new insights into our own world. The reader will inevitably gain in knowledge and understanding from this class of literature. Such reading supplies valuable background material for other studies; history, sociology, politics, psychology and economics.\n\nHowever, life is not all self-improvement, or shouldn't be. Reading for pure relaxation can do the reader nothing but good. The poor, ugly girl may find a therapeutic escape in a romantic novel. Just such a person as she is may be picked up by a dark, handsome, rich, even aristocratic stranger and transported into new worlds of delight. Why not? It will never happen, but there is no harm in dreaming. And there is the comfortable, stately world of the country house murder , where death is relatively bloodless, and the 'culprit turns out to be the colonel, the butler, or a rogue vicar. Pitting one's wits against the author's is a good form of relaxation. So, to the English reader, are the novels of P G Wodehouse, which open windows on the life of the idle rich in England in the 20s, contain absolutely no social comment on the rigid class system of the time, are brilliantly constructed, and contain laughs on every page.\n\nProvisos have been mentioned, and given those, no sane person could say that reading novels is a waste of time."

        "content": "The answer is that computers already allow some people to work from home, though clearly this cannot apply to more than a limited number of people and a limited number of occupations. As to whether this is desirable, the answer is philosophical as well as practical.\n\nComputers, both analog and digital, have developed out of all recognition since the Second World War, when they were large, mechanical, and limited in use. They were then used in conjunction with radar for missile guidance and also for code breaking and a small range of mathematical functions. Most of these functions are now available in a child's pocket calculator. The application of electronics in the 50s followed by the use of the silicon chip and pre-printed circuits widened the computer's function out of all recognition, permitting a myriad series of voltage controls. The computer today is powerful, compact and relatively small. It combines readily with word-processing, faxing, and the electronic creation of screen graphics, which can be modified either by keyboard control or by electronic pen. The analog computer rapidly solves\n\ndifferential equations for civil and mechanical engineering problems. The digital computer with its card-punching function permits access to data banks, and allows the processing of records and all the kinds of work connected with bills, orders, wages, VAT, etc. The computer today is integral in the world of business, commerce, design, word-processing and industry in general. Any organization from the small business upwards keeps a computer to which remote terminals may be linked, giving access at a distance to all its functions and information.\nThe need for all white-collar workers to do a nine-to-five job in the office has disappeared. Today, it is obviously possible for all workers down to lower- management level to work from home, and as computers continue to develop, it is likely that firms will find it convenient to let an increasing number do so. Whether this is a desirable change is a moot point.\n\nSome visionaries anticipate the day when computers, in combination with robotry, will totally eliminate the need for work as we know it. This may theoretically become possible, though in any event computers could never quite eliminate the need for maintenance groups. To most of us, however, such a prospect would be appalling. Leisure only has value by reason of its contrast with work, and the instinct to work is a built-in part of the human make-up. The past millennia have not adjusted our genes in this direction for nothing.\n\nA more likely scenario is that a much higher proportion of workers will eventually be able to operate from home. Of course, many people have always done so. The writer, the painter, the sculptor either work in the study or in an adjacent studio. Even the professional musician practices at home. Some of these are reclusive by nature, others not.\n\nThe majority of people are naturally gregarious. To produce their best, they need both the company of others, and the atmosphere of work. There is an instinct to go out to the job, and with all, save workaholics, to be able to draw a clear line between work and leisure. The benefits of doing so are obvious. Easy association with others is confidence building. Ideas improve and extend as they are exchanged. You cannot get the feel of a firm or institution at long range. If you have any responsibility at all you need to be in personal touch with managers and directors, not for ever using the telephone or the fax machine. And what about the social side, the friends made, the office party, the human element?\n\nTo work in public demands a certain standard of dress and personal care. It would need more self-discipline than many people have to keep up the same standards at home. Self-discipline and the observance of good routines may come easily to some, but not all.\n\nThe reality of today's work-pattern is that when children are of school-age, wives also take on paid employment. Perhaps the wife also would have a computer terminal and all the paraphernalia of a modern office? Would they share facilities or duplicate equipment? How many flats and small houses have even one room which could be turned into an office? Who would make the coffee, cook the meals, collect the children, do the shopping and the housework? One can foresee many sources of domestic discord!\n\nComputers may change. Human nature does not. As a tool, the computer is vulnerable to the enemy, industrial or personal. Hackers can wipe out records unless there is duplicated soft-ware backup kept under lock and key. Hackers can introduce a virus.\n\nThe more one considers the implications of working from home, the less desirable the project seems to be."

        "title": "Young people are slaves to fashion. Discuss.",
        "content": "Young people, or teenagers, are an invention of the American exploitation of the early 60s. The contemporary hype built them up into a separate class of society, and since jobs and money were plentiful in those days, the promotion of fashion in dress, music, politics and general outlook proved very profitable. Prior to 1960, people aged under eighteen were children; above eighteen, adults.\n\nThe cult swept the USA, then Britain and Europe, and finally many Eastern and Far Eastern countries, even where it was proscribed, as in China and pre-Gorbachev Russia. The promoters made full use of two factors common to the thirteen to eighteen age group; adolescent insecurity, and the concomitant desire to conform to peer pressures. Hence they became slaves to fashion.\n\nAs already indicated, fashion applied not only to clothes but to the whole of life. Some of it was harmless enough. Throughout history, the instinct to conform to current clothing styles was an unchanging phenomenon in the adult world. Up to the 60s, young people wore school uniform; in leisure hours, adult clothing. The radical change in the early 60s reflected the post-war instinct to defy conventions which were basically pre-war, and therefore associated with adult repression. So the tee-shirt and jeans culture was born, the tee-shirts carrying anti-establishment legends, references to hard left social policies, the lure of uncontrolled sex, the support of homosexuality, the attractions of the drop-out culture, and the wonders of the fast-growing hallucinatory drug scene.\n\nAs mentioned, some of this was inevitable and harmless. Some of it was pernicious. The pernicious element was centered in San Francisco, though it later infected London, Paris, and other major cities.\n\nAlongside this arose the pop music cult, and the successful stars and groups became the objects of hysterical teenage adulation. Presley, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles became the wealthy heroes. The subversive and corrupting views of some of them did immense harm. The fashions they set became irresistible.\n\nIn the later 60s and 70s, violence as well as drugs, alcohol and indiscriminate sex became fashionable. In Britain, for example, teenagers of both sexes joined one of two fashionable groups, the Mods and the Rockers. The Mods wore trendy, velveteen styles and rode mopeds. The Rockers dressed in leather and rode powerful motorbikes. Large groups of each faction would foregather in the main seaside resorts and engage in pitched, sometimes bloody battles. Later, the same cross-section turned to violent protest, vandalism and football hooliganism. The police have managed to stamp out most of this, and most teenage hysteria is currently connected with the pop scene and the occasional acid house party. For thirty years, the slavish following of fashion has led many young people astray.\n\nBut not all. Every coin has two sides, and despite all the foregoing, many, perhaps the majority of young people, are proving to be a very fine generation. Certainly they conform to teenage dress norms, enjoy pop music and modern dance, but in all essential respects they are first-class, certainly far more worthwhile than most of my contemporaries at the same age. We were conformist to adult ideas and attitudes, but in many ways we were lazy, self-interested, and entirely lacking in any real social conscience. We were quite oblivious to the overseas poor, the environment, the victims of disaster, whether natural or man-made, and to the animal world. In fact, we were selfish, and rather self-indulgent. No drugs, certainly, but plenty of cigarettes and alcohol.\n\nToday, many admirable features are seen in the young. They are individualistic rather than conformist. They eschew smoking, drugs and alcohol. They are fitter and generally more athletic than their predecessors. Many do social work in their spare time and some spend a year on voluntary service overseas. They have a conscience about people less fortunate and about the well-being of our world. They work hard and prepare for a market in which jobs are far from plentiful.\n\nAdmittedly, the media nowadays bring the world's suffering and problems to their attention with an immediacy unknown in earlier days. Yet the fact is that they respond. They are slaves, not so much to fashion, as to their consciences, and that is by no means a bad form of slavery."

        "content": "First, what is this effect? Ever since the Industrial Revolution began in the 18th century, smoke from fossil fuels, oil, natural gas and especially coal has deposited carbon dioxide in the lower part of the earth's upper atmosphere. The effect of this has been that part of the energy of the sun's rays reflected from the earth's surface has been absorbed by the CO2 and by water vapor and returned to the earth in the form of heat. Thus the atmosphere is behaving increasingly like a greenhouse. The glass allows the sunlight through but traps the heat. The consequence is what is called global warming.\nThere is a school of thought which says that the result will be a change in the earth's climate, plus an increase in nitrous oxide, methane gas and FREONS. It is predicted that by the mid-21st century, average temperatures will rise by 5 degrees C (9 degrees F). This will result in the melting of glaciers and the polar ice-caps. Coastal waters will rise and inundate many low-lying countries. Food production for an increasing world population will be put at risk.\n\nNot everyone, of course, accepts this scenario, though the quantity of CO2 in the lower upper-atmosphere is constantly monitored, and the fact that the level is increasing is not disputed. Whether or not the expected rise in average temperature will happen is another matter. There have been no significant climatic changes for centuries, indeed millennia and, the opponents of the doom-merchants argue, nature has its own methods of damage-limitation and self-adjustment. Moreover, there are no present signs of global warming. The weather patter in Britain, for example, is much the same as it was in Victorian days, or Roman days for that matter. Why should it suddenly change? Coal has always been burnt and before coal, wood and charcoal. Forest fires have always raged. Volcanoes, and explosions such as Krakatoa (1883) have always thrown tons of noxious gases into the atmosphere. After that particular explosion, a cloud of dust and gas drifted over Europe and darkened the sun for six months - before dispersing naturally. A tidal wave drowned 36,000 in the Java-Sumatra area. Nature's self-damage greatly exceeds any possible human contribution.\n\nThe fact is, however, that many people do take the greenhouse threat seriously, and there is a cross-section of people in most industrialized countries who lobby continuously against the continued use of fossil fuels. Whether they are right, or merely alarmist, only time will tell. However, the fact that CO2 is on the increase is undisputed. Further, it cannot be disputed that the greenhouse effect is a possibility, even if remote. Nuclear war is also a possibility, though remote, but every possible step is taken by democratic countries to ensure that it will not happen. So, therefore, should every possible step be taken to reduce, even eliminate CO2 emissions. There are already agreements in the USA and in Europe to cut down, or eliminate the use of fossil fuels by certain target dates.\n\nThe problem is that many countries are geared to fossil rather than nuclear power sources. Supplies of coal, and probably of oil and natural gas, are virtually unlimited. In Britain, most pits have closed down, causing wide-spread unemployment and much consequent human suffering. The coal lobby argues for emission cleansing and a compromise, both economic and environmental, may be possible. It would be cheaper, they argue, than to transfer entirely to nuclear power, whose installations may in any event cause health hazards and even the occasional disaster.\n\nOne optimistic sign is that proponents of all power sources agree that every generation has an obligation to preserve rather than exploit and pollute the planet. The worst culprits in the CO2 saga are the old-fashioned heavy industry plants, such as those in the Ruhr, East Germany, and what was the Soviet Union, and the fossil-fuel fired electricity-generating stations. Much of the old industrial plant has now been either modernized or superseded, and some countries such as France have moved over almost entirely to nuclear power. That, in my opinion, is the way forward.\n\nI do not believe that in any event, the greenhouse effect would have the dire consequences which have been predicted. Yet, it is a risk which we should not take. Modern technology has outgrown the use of fossil fuels, and apart from any possible dangers to future generations, the kind of world to which we commit them should be a clean, wholesome and beautiful world, as the Creator intended."

        "title": "If one could choose to be endowed with a great gift or talent, which one would you choose, and why?",
        "content": "I would certainly choose to be a concert-standard pianist, but please don't misunderstand. I have no desire to hear the thunderous applause, to be taken by the hand as the conductor and I acknowledge the standing ovation, to receive the bouquet, to come back on stage four times, to play a brilliant encore, to read the glowing press notices at the end of a late-night party.\n\nAll that is best left to the people who like that sort of thing. I merely want to match the professionals, to play as fluently, to memorize as completely, to express the composer's intentions as deeply.\n\nYou may have gathered that I am a competent pianist. I know that I shall never get much better. I need the music in front of me. I do not own a Steinway grand, but a gallant old Brinsmead upright, now in its eightieth year. One plays - and one dreams!\n\nSo what about the 'great gift or talent'? Is one born with it, or can it be developed? The answers are yes and no. Occasionally, in a televised piano competition, one sees a young boy or girl, say aged thirteen or fourteen, sit down and play a Chopin ballade or a devilishly difficult piece of Liszt with consummate, almost contemptuous ease. That has to be talent. I could never do it in a thousand years. I used to tell myself that I could if I practiced more. Now I merely recognize that gift in others. I would never deny that to flower into perfection, the gift must be complemented by hours of practice, daily. Yet without the gift, no amount of practice will achieve the result. The word 'practice' implies a chore, the kind of mental resolution which says 'I will do half an hour a day'. Well, yes, that will improve the muscles and therefore the performance. Yet, the talented youngster is content to live at the keyboard, with a short break every few hours for a sausage roll and a coca-cola. And in turn this implies a musical background - since I believe that such people are favored genetically - encouragement, a good piano, and above all opportunity. The development of a great gift has to be at the expense of a good general education. My late wife used to teach maths to Toots Lockwood, and grumble because Margaret's young daughter made little progress. Toots, a budding actress herself, once made the precocious remark 'Mummy didn't need maths to become a star, did she?'\n\nThere are various reasons why I would like to have been a gifted pianist. Firstly, for my own satisfaction, since I enjoy playing a wide variety of composers and would dearly love to extend my repertoire. Secondly, I would like to be able to hold each piece, however long, in my memory, and to be able to think exclusively of the interpretation as my fingers automatically translated the score into sound.\n\nAlso, I would like to be confident about entertaining my friends, and this demands not only memory but the ability to improvise. Fluent improvisation is a gift not possessed by all great pianists. The story goes that the jazz pianist Art Tatum once challenged the great Solomon to improvise on the tune 'Lady be good' for as long as he could. Solomon gave up after ten minutes. Tatum manipulated the tune for half an hour without repeating himself. So, my guilty secret is that I enjoy playing jazz music as much as classical. Certainly not the modern variety of the Dave Brubeck school, with its unrhythmic runs and depressingly awful harmonies. But give me Duke Ellington, Earl Hines, Teddy Wilson, Fats Waller - especially Waller - and I am happy. If I had Waller's rhythm and Tatum's ingenuity, life would be a rich thing!\n\nSo, personal satisfaction, giving pleasure to my family and a few friends, and helping my grandchildren, all of whom play the piano at varying levels consonant with their ages. None is likely to show a great gift or talent, but they will all become competent, like me. There is no greater satisfaction than giving them a hand with their scales, their theory, their pieces at Grades 3, 4 or 5.\n\nOne of them is likely to become a better pianist than me. She may even become very good, but like the rest of us, she will never be a virtuoso. I am rather thankful for this, because life is tough at the top, and there are many drawbacks to a concert pianist's life: jet-lag, bad hotels, the envy of one's peers, an unbalanced life, perhaps a marital breakdown.\n\nI prefer to have my cake and eat it. I would like the talent, but none of the pizzazz which always seems to go with it."

        "title": "It is a sweet and honorable thing to die for one's country. The poet Wilfred Owen described this saying as 'the old lie'. Do you agree?",
        "content": "This is a very old saying. Whether it is the old lie is arguable. In his odes, the Roman poet Horace wrote this no less than three times: 'dulce et decorum est pro patria mori'. He lived from 65 to 8 B.C., was also a soldier, fought at Philippi, afterwards lost his estate, and was reduced to poverty. He remained a patriot. The poet Wilfred Owen, a resident of France, returned to England to enlist in the First World War at the age of 22, fought in the trenches, and was killed at age 25, a week before the Armistice in 1918.\nThe most prominent war poet, Owen's verse expresses his hatred of war. How much of his virulence was due to the emotional instability caused by his homosexuality is a moot point. The fact remains that he fought. Why?\n\nThe intervening two thousand years have polarized the divide between the patriot and the pacifist. Any book of quotations offers scores of examples of quotations supporting both sides; Samuel Johnson described patriotism as the last refuge of a scoundrel ; Thomas Campbell wrote 'The patriot's blood's the seed of Freedom's tree'.\n\nFor various reasons, the modern pacifist's case is perhaps stronger than of his predecessors. Firstly, because the 20th century, in two major wars, made civilian enlistment compulsory on the part of the countries involved. In the UK in the First World War, extreme moral pressure was brought to bear. Any man not seen in uniform was in danger of being given a white feather by the women - for cowardice. The actual reasons for opting out varied; it could be cowardice, it could be a different form of national service, it could be a lifelong and previously stated total rejection of violence in any circumstances. In the latter case, such views were generally respected, providing some other contribution to the war effort was made. The Society of Friends (the 'Quakers') provides a good example in the Second World War. These men and women were prepared to risk their lives, and many lost their lives, in some form of national service; medical work, ambulance driving, merchant shipping crews, etc. One Christian school of thought rejects any kind of participation in war, arguing that aggressors should not be resisted, that tyranny, carrying as it does the seeds of its own eventual downfall, should be accepted. Their case has been greatly strengthened by the fundamental difference between earlier wars and those of this century. In the two wars 1914 - 18 and 1939 - 45, civilian populations were involved, like it or not, because of bombing raids, and ultimately the use of the atom bomb against Japan. Nothing, they argue, can justify what happened to London, Coventry, Dresden, Wuppertal, Cologne, Berlin, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nothing justifies mass slaughter. The future use of the hydrogen bomb would be even more horrific.\n\nAnd now the case for patriotism. Like it or not, the citizens of all civilized countries owe an incalculable debt to their homelands; protection from foreign aggression, from internal crime, from disease, from penury. They receive education, a minimum standard of living, an old-age pension; complete personal freedom, in keeping with law, freedom of religious worship, freedom of movement, every opportunity for self-advancement, at least in the democracies. In such countries, everybody is born under an obligation to the state, and if that obligation is rejected, so also should be the benefits mentioned. Perhaps even more fundamental is a built-in affection for the distinctive characteristics of one's own country, its history, traditions, folk-ethic, literature, music, human relationships. An aggressor such as Hitler would wipe out all these things, as he almost wiped out the Jewish population of Europe. He would replace freedom with tyranny, he would consign dissidents to concentration camps. So not only is force of arms justified in a defensive role, it is also justified in some categories of offence; e.g. intervention in foreign countries where populations are threatened with genocide, as currently in Yugoslavia and Ethiopia. This type of intervention is rightly carried out by professional armed service members at the instigation of the United Nations.\n\nWhat cannot be justified on patriotic grounds is expansionist aggression as is favored by certain leaders or, as in the past, by the empire-building countries of Europe, whether or not their rule imparted freedom, stability, enlightenment and prosperity.\n\nNone of us can accept what our own country has given us and still remain, morally, totally free agents. So given the provisos mentioned, and with every respect to the best kind of pacifist, I believe that the true patriot wins the argument."

        "title": "Those who have no knowledge of the past are condemned to repeat it. Is a knowledge of history important?",
        "content": "Historical knowledge is not only important. It is a crucial requirement in all who carry any kind of responsibility, whether in social, industrial, political or international affairs. In all these spheres, a knowledge of the past enables countries and individuals to sidestep old problem and to avoid the mistakes of the past.\n\nWhether peoples and countries actually do learn from past experience is a wholly different matter. During this century, Prussian aggression plunged Europe into two major wars. Basically, Germany never existed, any more than does Italy, or did the Soviet Union . The amalgamation of their constituent states is of quite recent origin. The break-up of the Soviet Union was due to the irrelevance of Communism in the modern world. This has done much for world peace, though there are still nuclear dangers. The case of Germany and Italy is quite different. National Socialism never sat easily on the Italians, so in 1945 there was no point in occupying Italy and regionalizing her government. She never had any real ambition to do more than unify her own states, and colonialism began to die a natural death in all European countries from 1946 onwards. In all this, the Allies showed wisdom based on the lessons of history. In their dealings with Germany, however, the story is different. The USA, with little personal history and less expertise in foreign affairs, put pressure on the Allies to re-unify Western Germany and to negotiate the existence of East\n\nGermany with Stalin. In the form of Marshall Aid, the USA poured money into West Germany, established a central government in Bonn, put industry back on a good footing, created a hard currency, reorganized their unions, and let them rebuild a massive army, albeit without nuclear armaments. For years Germany has kept quiet, awaiting her opportunity. The outcome is that in 1992, the whole of Germany had reunited, the power-base had shifted back to Berlin, and the country had achieved political, industrial and fiscal domination in Europe once again. The old enmity with France and England lies just beneath the surface. Zenophobia is again becoming rampant, and may develop into ethnic cleansing , that modern euphemism. The first danger in Europe will again be Germany. Their national anthem 'Deutschland uber Alles' sums up the national ideal, which is unlimited territorial expansion. The lesson of the past was there, and it was ignored.\nA knowledge of the past is also important socially, and governments, whether of Eastern or Western countries, ignore social history at their peril. One success in Britain post-Second World War was the establishment of the Welfare State. This was a humane and far-reaching concept designed to keep the whole population up to a basic living standard, to give free or subsidized medical care on demand, and to provide realistic state pensions for the elderly. It still exists in a modified form, and no government would dare to abolish it. The idea was to rid society of poverty, sickness and insecurity. The lessons of the past had been well learnt. Throughout English history, and especially in Victorian times, grinding poverty was the norm for the masses, both urban and rural. Laws against petty theft were brutal. Matters scarcely improved after the First World War. Unemployment in the 1920s was widespread. The dole was pitiful. So there was a general strike, street rioting, and near-revolution. This was in line with many minor revolutions which have occurred throughout English history. The Second World War provided not only a diversion from social failure but also an opportunity of uniting Britain to resist a serious threat from outside. From 1945 onwards, the old mistake of neglecting the working class was not repeated. Yet despite history, England perpetuates her ancient errors in respect of Ireland. Partition has never worked anywhere in the world. The Protestant north is in perpetual enmity with the Catholic south. So much dirty water has passed under the bridge form Cromwellian days onwards that peace can never be achieved. Neither can it be imposed, short of mounting a military campaign. In times of national crisis, Eire has proved ambivalent and treacherous. The harsh, but pragmatic answer is to pull our forces out, and allow the Irish problem to sort itself out. That means allowing civil war, but since both sides are permanently entrenched in mutual opposition and hatred, there may well be no realistic alternative.\n\nA second disastrous mistake in recent English governmental policy was the imposition of the poll tax, known euphemistically as the Community Charge. This was meant to be a replacement for the old property rating system, which was admittedly in need of revision. The poll tax led to financial injustices which exceeded the tolerance level of the British people. So Mrs. Thatcher had to go, and the government climbed down. English history records many attempts to impose a poll tax. None succeeded, and all ended in riot and bloodshed.\n\nYet perhaps England's most serious recent mistake is the headlong rush into membership of a federal Europe, dominated by Germany, controlled from Strassburg and administered in Brussels. France and Germany will vie for control of this monstrosity. British internal sovereignty is already severely eroded, and will finally disappear unless some future government comes to its senses. The Council of Europe has made participation in free trade dependent on membership. The sacrifice of principle to financial advantage has never worked in the past. Why should it in the future?\n\nThe past holds countless examples of the failure of most of the policies Britain currently follows. Their lessons are rarely learnt. A knowledge of history is important, of course, but such knowledge is of little use if the old mistakes are persistently repeated."

        "title": "What changes would you like to see in today's society?",
        "content": "The term society has no general application. Every country differs from every other, however subtly, so answers must relate to a particular country. This answer relates to England, not even the whole of Britain.\n\nPerhaps the first point to acknowledge is that in comparison with many other countries, England has an overwhelming number of good features. Yet there are several aspects of our society which I would like to see changed. Some of these changes could be effected immediately. Others would take longer. Society does not exist, said Mrs. Thatcher. She was wrong. Society consists of an aggregate of families. The first change I would like to see is the reversal of the current steady breakdown of family life. In Britain, the monarch stands at the head of the state and of the Established Church. In return for the privileges of their position, it has been generally expected of the Royal Family that they set an example to the country, and in the case of the Queen this example has undoubtedly been set. Not so, in the case of most of the other royals. In 1992 the so-called example set by this family has been appalling. This need not be spelled out. The world media have done this very effectively. The Queen herself described last year as an 'annus horribilis'. Many responsible people rightly wonder about the future of the monarchy, and their thinking tends to move in the direction of a republic. In the modern world, there is a strong case to be made for the abolition of hereditary privilege. However, the breakdown of family life cannot be attributed to the poor example of the minor royals. It actually stems from the permissiveness of the 1960s. The result is much suffering caused to children and young people, some of whom leave, or are virtually forced out of their homes, only to live in one of the cardboard cities , or to be put into care, or to join the drug scene and commit crime.\n\nUnemployment, currently standing at 3m plus, is another aggravating factor. The present government has no policy to deal with this, and gives every indication of being quite indifferent to the problem. Interim measures could be taken until the world trade recession eases. Much work is needed on local environmental projects and on the updating of the country's infrastructure, which has been grossly neglected for decades. This could be financed by a modest increase in income tax, a measure which I believe would be generally acceptable. We have an uncaring government, the result being that many once prosperous areas are now centers of poverty and despair. Throughout the country, small businesses are being forced to close at the rate of hundreds per day. This is because the government refuses to impose controls over rent and leasehold increases and to reduce the swinging industrial rate. The net result of all this is that people are reluctant to spend, because they live in fear of redundancy or unemployment and, even worse, house repossession, in cases where heavy mortgages were taken on in better times. The house market is a good indicator of confidence in the future. It has now been at a virtual standstill for five years.\nThirdly, crime, especially violence. Due to the decline in religious faith and the consequent lack of moral training in home and school, crime levels have become appallingly high over the past few decades. Bad social conditions in many areas exacerbate the problem. Prisons are overcrowded, so the judiciary is encouraged to minimize custodial sentences. The fundamental remedy is a return to Christian moral standards, or those of the other great religions, now represented among the large immigrant population. Many of them are setting the native English a good example. The latter offer young people little help, and certainly little discipline at home, and the reputation of teachers in the state sector has never been lower.\n\nMuch is being done to stamp out the evils of hallucinatory drugs in Britain. This country would do well to adopt some of the draconian measures which are proving successful in some Far Eastern countries.\n\nIn the case of child sexual abuse and violence occasioning actual bodily harm, custodial sentences are now mandatory. This is justified, since such offences have greatly increased in recent decades. At one time, children were safe to roam their own areas without fear of molestation. Today, this is impossible.\n\nNext, housing. Good neighborliness was the prime feature of pre-war terraced housing, now replaced in many cities by tower blocks and complexes of maisonettes. These concrete monstrosities eliminate family identity and encourage crime and vandalism. This is now realized. Much of this post-war building is now being demolished, and domestic architecture is reverting to old patterns. More low-cost or rentable accommodation would ease several social problems.\n\nEngland welcomes immigrants, and laws have been passed to outlaw discrimination. Most immigrants provide an enriching contribution. Their churches, mosques and temples are acceptable to most people. However, there is a down side. Numbers have to be controlled, and this leads to disputes. A bad mistake was to allow 'ghettoes' to be formed in the early post- war days. An even distribution of this influx should have been made mandatory in the early days. The basis of that is the immigrants, while preserving their social and religious identities, must also accept and respect British traditions. Agitators operate much more easily in areas of dense population, often inciting violence between groups in the wake of violence overseas.\n\nTo believe that all these defects in English society can be changed is to live in cloud cuckoo land. All the same, these are the objectives which we must all work for."

        "title": "Can telling lies ever be justified?",
        "content": "The old admonition to children, 'speak the truth and shame the devil', runs contrary to what is called the schoolboy's eleventh commandment; 'tell a lie, and stick to it'. The one adage advocates honesty at whatever personal cost. When charged with some illicit tree-felling, the young George Washington is said to have said 'I cannot tell a lie'. Those who advocate moral rectitude always argue that honesty is the best policy. Those who do not say 'get away with wrong-doing if you can'. Thus, as a child you avoid punishment. As an adult, you hope to avoid the consequences of your actions. The one is the result of a strong sense of morality. The other stems from self-interest and indifference to the fate of other people. Silence itself may amount to a lie, particularly when it is meant to shift blame from oneself. Cicero said it is the nature of a scoundrel to deceive by lying , and it may well be argued that truth is an integral factor in the health of society. Justice itself depends on witnesses pledging themselves to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth . The law has severe penalties for those who perjure themselves after taking this oath.\n\nSo logically there should be no circumstances in which lying can ever be justified. Yet, we can all think of occasions when to tell the truth would be a very mixed blessing.\n\nThis applies especially to those who have access to secrets of national importance, particularly in wartime, or when there is danger of war. In these circumstances another moral issue is raised, and that is where personal loyalty lies. Most would say to one's own country. For others, a strong political belief, based on conviction, is more cogent. So, during the 'Cold War' between NATO and the Communist bloc, people on both sides were prepared to betray their country's secrets. This was generally out of conviction rather than for money, though the spy was usually rewarded in some way, sometimes by asylum and the conferring of honors and position. Such men and women would argue, and some still do, that the ultimate end justifies the means, if the means included lying and deception, so be it.\n\nThe same principle applied particularly in the 1939 - 45 war. The allies relied heavily on agents, and the lies which were part of their stock-in-trade. Disinformation was born and played a prominent role on both sides. Some of the deception was very elaborate indeed. Hitler's forces in France were tricked into believing that the invasion would be at the Pas de Calais rather than along the Normandy coast. England created a wholly fictitious army in the wrong place by setting up a subtle system of signaling, designed to be picked up across the channel. German doubts were settled by the planting of spurious invasion plans by agents in France. As a result, the invasion was given a good start. Every patriotic Englishman would say that all the lies and deception were amply justified both by the motivation and in the event. In much the same way, the British Ministry of Information concealed some failures and exaggerated some successes for the sake of morale. It was morale which enabled Britain to counter what seemed to be inevitable defeat.\n\nSo, the good of others seems to go a long way towards justifying the lie, and this applies in some personal as well as national concerns. Nobody would applaud the man or woman who lied about extra-marital relations. The more honorable course is not to have any. Yet, it is not always kind to tell the brutal truth about a severe illness such as a cancer to a patient or to his or her relations just as soon as the illness is diagnosed. Treatment may be successful, so unnecessary sadness has been caused. Yet if not, there must come a time when the facts are disclosed. Not to do so prevents the patient from making testatory provisions. It also increases the shock to the family and friends when death actually occurs.\n\nKindness may be a good reason, if not to tell a lie, at least to be economical with the truth . Another is tact. These two virtues oil the wheels of all social relationships. A lady may have chosen a hat which she obviously loves dearly, but you think it is hideous. Never tell her, even if you cannot bring yourself to say 'Wonderful! Super!' There are ways of side-stepping the issue. Anyway, dress is a matter of opinion rather than of fact, and what does it matter? No good at all could be done by telling the truth , and absolutely no harm done by withholding it."

        "title": "Science can never provide a final answer or things, it is only a way of studying them. Do you agree?",
        "content": "It is somewhat rash to assume that the only role of science is to answer the question 'How?'. That was true in the days of Newton, when an educated person could have a grasp in outline of all human knowledge. Science then filled some of the gaps left by the deliberations of the philosopher and the theologian. Since then, it has far outstripped the contributions of both. Philosophy has degenerated into historical study, and has no modern contribution to make. Theology has made no advance since the Middle Ages. The mantle of seeking answers to man's most fundamental questions has fallen on science. Whether these questions will ever be answered is an entirely different matter, but there is no other way ahead. So the topic-statement is fundamentally wrong.\n\nBy science, of course, is meant physics, which is fundamental to all studies - chemistry, biology, astronomy, indeed all macro and micro investigation. Physics has identified the laws which keep the universe in a state of equilibrium, and today seeks a unified theory to account for the space-time continuum necessary to the existence of that equilibrium, and the various other dimensions beyond the four known which are postulated. So science moves towards the first philosophical question, Is there a unified theory, or are events ultimately random? The answer to this question, if ever found, leads to the far more fundamental question, To what extent, if any, is God (the Creator) limited by his own creation? The determinism of Laplace is now seen to be totally beside the point, and belongs to a mechanistic view of the universe which can no longer be sustained. Today, science is moving rapidly towards a chaos theory which takes into account God's freedom of action plus the predictable results of laws already known to us, and also unpredictable events.\n\nIt is interesting that whereas the old scientific determinism either limited to the Creator's function or precluded the necessity of a Creator, or saw the Creator as totally detached from his creation, science today is begin forced into a belief in God. It also moves towards an acceptance that the scientifically unknown area, the God - mankind personal relationship, is not only feasible, but likely. So science has become much more than a way of studying things. Whether science can get beyond this point is a matter of conjecture. At a shrewd guess, science may well establish the possibility of eternal life , without being able to advance any more proof than could the old-time theologian. World religions have always said that such a belief depends on revelation and personal faith, and it may well be the Creator's intention to keep it that way. Faith, at least, would be greatly devalued if it could ever become the subject of scientific proof, whatever that may be.\n\nAnother answer, again stemming from the chaos theory, is to the co-existence of good and evil. If there is a Creator, it follows that evil, at least as understood by humanity, must have been allowed to enter the world-scene at some point, but deliberately. Redemption from its consequences is another result, and history is the record of the struggle between the two forces. This, says science, although leading to apparently random results, such as the little child stepping under the bus, or a death from cancer, is not random at all. All the same, it may stem from 'chaos', if this is seen in conjunction with a belief in the indestructibility of the human personality. So, say the faithful, 'God not only creates, He cares', and science today is not disposed to reject this possibility, the two approaches may converge on the same point. The processes of the universe are incredibly diverse and complicated, so why should the possibility of life after death be ruled out?\n\nSuch a belief is an essential corollary to any concept of justice in the Creator's character. This is not justice merely in the sense of retribution. The early Jews believed the Creator got so fed up with humanity that He destroyed them in the Flood, but made a fresh start with Noah's family and the paired livestock! Divine Justice is part of the concept of Divine Love, which postulated creation, with mankind as it's highest sentient form, as an expression of that love.\n\nSo the great world religions have this at least in common with modern science; there is a benevolent Creator who offers post-earthly life in some other dimension in exchange for the human response of kindness and observance of a revealed moral law. Justice, therefore, moves into an eternal setting.\n\nA religious scientist will find no essential disharmony between his or her faith and the scientific outlook. The great questions of life have satisfying, if unprovable answers. Some of the inadequacies of religion, such as early church doctrines of the cosmos, and strictly Bible-based theories of the origin of species, have been corrected by scientific investigation without detriment to the central core of belief.\n\nWhere science, or more precisely the scientist, inevitably falls short is in the application of an essentially simple moral code to the complex issues raised by scientific advance. Genetic manipulation is a case in point. The whole question of in-vitro fertilization is highly controversial.\n\nAll that is on the local scale. On the grand scale the Creator may, or may not allow the discovery of a unified theory of the universe which will provide answers to supplement, rather than displace the answers already provided by the higher religions."

        "content": "In some respects the topic-statement is true. Modern transport, especially by air, allows people to circle the globe in a few days, or hours, if an aircraft such as Concorde is used. Thus we have learnt to look upon distance as nothing. I can get to Paris from south-east England quicker than I can get to central London. So, the world has become a village? If so, the comparison ends there. In no respect does the world resemble a village community. Those who support the one-world movement no doubt share a great ideal but are, in fact, flying in the face of history, of present facts, and of any likelihood in the near future. Modern travel merely underlines the differences between races and nations. Rather than broaden the mind, travel confirms national prejudices. It may well lead to a greater international understanding, but to understand does not mean to agree, or to forgive. Modern travel may allow great athletes to meet every four years in friendship to discover the medal winners, but it would be naive to suppose that the Olympic Spirit had anything to do with the reality of international affairs or could possibly have any effect on them.\n\nOf course modern transport cannot be blamed for the state of today's world. Like atomic energy, it is neutral, and the blessing or the curse results from the way in which it is used.\n\nFirst, the benefits. Before the invention of the electric telegraph, news of a natural disaster in, say, an eastern country could only reach the west by steamship, so that by the time help reached a stricken area, it was too late to be of much use. Today, information by satellite, both in reports and pictures, is instantaneous. Response time is correspondingly quick. Modern transport planes can carry food, water and medical supplies to where they are needed in a matter of hours.\n\nSo the modern jet aircraft can help enormously in relief work. It has also proved of great benefit both to the business world and to tourism. Within certain weight-limits, it can be used for overseas trade worldwide, and the vast extension of available markets is largely due to the modern aircraft. And where business has to be done in person there are no real delays.\n\nThe aircraft has extended foreign travel, once the prerogative of the rich, to those of average income levels in most countries, and tourism has become a major world industry. The aircraft and the helicopter both have important search and rescue roles. Ships in distress can be readily located and given help. The helicopter has several roles, apart from its use by the police for searches and traffic control. Many lives have been saved in mountainous areas and at sea by speedy removal to hospital, by immediate attention by paramedics; a jet plane can carry a suitable human organ half across the world when a transplant is urgently needed.\n\nModernized and high-speed rail systems are likely to prove of benefit to many countries from the travel and trade points of view. To take Europe as an example. Tariff barriers in the EEC have now come down, and Europe, including Britain, has become a free-market area. In 1994, England will be linked to Europe by a channel tunnel, and Paris or Brussels will be reached as quickly as by air. Already, goods to and from Europe, and indeed worldwide, are transported in standardized containers, which are picked up and moved rapidly in heavy lorries to their destinations along new networks of motorways. The motorways also greatly ease long-distance car travel. At sea, modern oil tankers carry their vast burdens worldwide.\n\nYet as with any other advance, all is not sweetness and light. In the case of the jet aircraft, one needs only to mention the spy-plane, the bomber, the fighter, the assault helicopter, all of them potent war weapons, and a curse to millions of helpless people worldwide. The potential for nuclear, nerve gas, chemical and HE bombing is a curse which hangs over all our heads. The need for ever larger airfields means the destruction of tracts of countryside. Noise and oil-pollution make life a burden to those living nearby. In some countries, over-concentration on high-speed and inter-city trains has led to the severe neglect of existing networks and ordinary passenger rolling stock. In smaller countries such as England, there are now far too many cars and traffic jams in the large urban areas, providing an almost unsolveable problem. Ease of travel allows football hooligans and other undesirables to cause trouble overseas. Every improvement in transport facilities helps the criminal as well as the bona-fide traveler, particularly where immigration controls are relaxed. Immigration itself becomes an increasing problem. And at sea? All is well with the oil-tanker until it runs aground in a storm and deposits thousands of tons of oil along the shore-line.\n\nSo there is a case to be made of the more leisurely times, to some, the good old days . Modern transport has reduced the world if not to a village, at least relatively to village size. Whether the village will ever become a happy community is another matter."
