        "content": "Far up in the mountains of Canada, there is an old abandoned log cabin. Once it was occupied by a young couple who wanted to distance themselves from the chaos of this modern world. Here they were miles away from the nearest town. Bob, the husband, made the occasional trip into town to buy supplies whereas Jan, his wife, spent her free time by the fire, sewing. Their life was simply idyllic.\nThen, one midwinter's day, Jan woke up from bed with a strange ache in her bones. Putting it down to overwork, Bob shooed her to bed and made sure she rested. Though Jan was impatient to get to her chores, Bob soothed her, \"Relax, Sugar. You're overdoing things. All these chores will be here when you recover.\"\n\nHowever, Jan seemed to be getting worse instead of recovering. By evening, she was running a high fever and in greater pain. In spite of his best efforts, Bob could not manage to ease her suffering. And then suddenly, she started to lapse into unconsciousness.\n\nIt was then obvious that she was seriously ill. What could Bob do? He had no experience in treating the sick and Jan was getting worse by the minute. He knew that there was an old doctor in town but he lived three miles away, downhill. Pot-bellied and obese, there was no way the doctor could make it up to their cabin.\n\nSomething had to be done quickly! Bob racked his brains but to no avail. The only thing left to do was to go to the doctor. In Jan's condition, she could never walk that far in the waist-deep snow. Bob would have to carry her!\n\nBob searched his mind for a way to move poor, sick Jan. Then, he remembered. He had once made a sledge so that they could ride together over the mountain. They never got around to using it though, because the whole mountain was thickly covered with rocks and trees. He had never found a safe way down, not even once.\n\n\"Well,\" he thought, \"looks like I'm going to have to try it anyhow,\" as he dug out the sledge from the storeroom. \"Jan may die unless I get her to the doctor, and life means nothing to me without her.\" With this thought in mind, Bob gently tucked Jan into the sledge, got in the front, and with a short prayer for safety, pushed off.\n\nHow they got through that ride alive, Bob has never figured out. As trees loomed up in front of him and just as quickly whizzed by his side, close enough to touch, he felt relieved that Jan was not awake to experience the ride. It was all he could do not to scream as collision seemed imminent, time and again, with only inches to spare.\n\nAt last, bursting from the mountainside, the town came into view. Barely slowing down, they sped through the icy streets, only losing speed as they neared the doctor's house. The sledge, battered through the journey, collapsed in the left ski as it came to a halt, spilling out its occupants. Bob picked up his Jan and made his way into the doctor's house.\n\nAfter what seemed to be a long winter, Jan recovered fully from her illness but Bob never recovered from his fright. They moved into the little town so as to be near help in times of crisis, and have lived there ever since."

        "content": "It seemed like it was going to be another one of those days when nothing much happens. Ken and his friends were playing their regular football game along the banks of the river near their small village. In the midst of the game, Ken's attention was drawn to a tourist boat passing by.\nActually, tourist boats were quite common in their area. It was also common for some of the tourists to take potshots at the birds and squirrels along the way. This is why Ken's friends were not really surprised to hear a few small explosions from the boat. They ignored the sounds and went on with their game.\n\nHowever, they were startled when they suddenly heard loud cries for help coming from the boat. They could see that the crew were running about, panic-stricken. Some people were shouting to them.\n\n\"Their engine must have blown up! Look, there's smoke and the boat's out of control. It's going towards the rapids,\" Ken pointed out to his friends.\n\nKen's village was located at the point at which the tourist boats turned around and headed back upstream. Three kilometers downstream were the rapids, which spelt trouble for the boats.\n\n\"It's heading straight for the rapids! They're in trouble! The boat will be smashed against the rocks!\" Ken exclaimed. \"Let's get help!\"\n\nThe boys sprinted back to the village for help. Along the way, they met the village headman. Stumbling over his words in his haste, Ken explained the emergency to the headman.\n\nThe headman was a man of quick action. Without wasting any time, he yelled out to some men to help him carry his powerful outboard motor to the jetty. With the motor tied firmly onto bamboo poles, they rushed hurriedly down to the jetty.\n\nTheir haste was indeed necessary for, by the time the men had reached the jetty, they saw that the boat was dangerously close to the rapids. There was not a moment to lose! With quick hands, the headman attached the outboard motor to his sampan and then sped off to the rescue.\nUpon reaching the tourist boat with bare minutes to spare, the headman realized his mistake. How could so many tourists be packed into this small sampan? The headman was filled with despair. Then he saw the rope that had been used to tie down the outboard motor to the bamboo poles. It had been flung into the sampan in his haste. Quickly, he grabbed the rope and flung it to the boatmen on the tourist boat.\n\n \"I'll tow you back!\" he shouted.\n\nAfter the boatmen had tied the rope firmly to their boat, the headman made a swift U-turn and then, putting the engine on full power, he steered his sampan upstream. The rope gave a jerk and then, to everyone's relief and joy, the tourist boat moved forward, obediently following the small sampan.\n\nLoud cheers burst out from the tourist boat and the observers on the shore. Thanks to the headman's courage, the cooperation from the villagers, and the quick action of the boys, the tourists were saved from certain death in the rapids."

        "content": "The morning sun shone persistently on my still-shut eyelids. Annoyed, I rolled on to the right side of my mattress. Wondering about the time, I stretched out my arm to grasp the little, round alarm clock on my bedside table. I forced open my eyes, focused them on the numbers ... and screeched!\nLeaping out of my bed, I swung open the wardrobe door. Throwing my school uniform on the bed, I dashed to the bathroom. Halfway, I spun around and grabbed my school bag, deciding not to brush my teeth. Soon, I had shoved my feet into my shoes and pounced onto my bicycle. My parents stood motionless, staring at me as I whizzed past.\n\nAs my bicycle raced on, I noticed a group of schoolgirls looking my way with great interest. Well, well! Obviously, I was still attractive even with uncombed hair. My heart was pounding furiously in my chest as I whirred past a few cars on the road. The drivers seemed to stare with disbelief that one could pedal so swiftly. In no time, I reached the school gate, which was just about to be closed.\n\nWithout bothering to explain myself to the priggish duo on guard duty, I hopped off my bike and dashed off. After locking my precious iron steed at the shed, I sprinted to the school hall. As I burst into the hall, I braked to change direction and made a beeline for the back of my class. Screeching to a halt, I took my place behind my classmates.\n\nIn the whole gathering of students, I seemed to be the centre of attraction. It did not matter much to me at the moment for I was used to being looked at. However, to say the least, I was a little surprised when everyone stopped staring blankly at me and started to giggle.\n\nSuddenly, the whole hall was filled with roars and bellows of laughter. Smiling at my audience, I decided to take a bow.\nThen, I noticed that the bottom half of my trousers were the wrong color. My line of vision moved upwards, revealing that the rest of my pants were also the wrong color, and so was my shirt. At first, even my powerful brain could not figure it out.\n\n\"Daniel! Why on earth are you in pajamas?\" my friend blurted out amidst the hollers of laughter.\n\nThe feeling of sheer horror swept through my entire frame. My mouth was stuck open in an \"0\" shape for a few long seconds. My mind was filled only with shock as darkness mercifully started to engulf me.\n\nOnce again. I awoke with lights playing on my eyelids. At first I had little memory of what had happened, but one look at the group of people peering down at me brought the whole incident back to mind. The young boys were all clad in white uniforms and grinning quite lunatically at me. In. the high corner of the room, I saw a red crescent. Then the horrible little squirts started to call out for their seniors. Outside, I heard fresh gales of laughter. The brats were chortling. I was still clad in pajamas. Not knowing what else to do, I feigned unconsciousness again ..."

        "content": "It's my birthday today. I have lost count of how many birthdays have passed, but I still keep my tradition. I climb to the top of the nearby hill, bringing a handful of dirt with me. I press it into the ground. Then, I sit down to prepare my mind for my next annual rite: reminding myself of who I am and why I am living.\nI made this hill, actually, and I'm still building it up. I started on my tenth birthday. Now, the hill is large enough for me to ski down each winter. In a world where people stay young forever, persistence pays.\n\nPersistence was what led Dr Syue Cano to discover the secret of eternal youth. At the age of eighty-four, he identified the gene that causes humans to age and the specific radiation that destroys it. No one will know whether he detonated his \"Youth\" bomb for the sake of his own immortality or for the sake of the other human beings in the world. However, his defective heart could not withstand the impact of the blast. He died the instant the bomb exploded.\n\nMankind will always be grateful for the discovery to which Dr Cano dedicated his life. However, he left the world with one problem: the earth's limited natural resources. Even with plant growth accelerated by scientific wizardry, food and oxygen were becoming inadequate for the world population, which only kept booming.\n\nSome subtractions were necessary for the survival of the human species. The only solution was to remove some of the people by unnatural means, that is, to execute them. Thus, this was why all crimes were made punishable by execution: murder, theft, adultery, slander, hoarding of food... the list is very long. This was the only way to maintain the valance of nature.\n\nThat's where I come in. I am an Executioner. I work alone, never considering the risk. People say I have a death wish. Perhaps I do. Certainly, yesterday's job was no waltz in the park.\nRob Tao was suspected of stealing and hoarding food. My job was to check this out. As always, I was to be detective, judge, jury and executioner.\n\nI had enough stealth technology to break into Tao's compound undetected. To get into the house was also a cinch. My vibra-blade cut through the wall like it was butter. In the house, my Arometer detected food, lots of it. I went down corridor after corridor, following the bleeps of light on my Arometer.\n\nThe signals went wild outside one closed door. There was a lot of human activity inside, judging by my HUO sensors. I primed a grenade and opened the door just a crack -- enough to see whom I would be executing.\n\nThen I deprimed the grenade. Sitting there were thousands of children. Rob Tao stood amongst them, holding a huge pot of steaming mush. He smiled at me, seemingly unperturbed.\n\n\"You're feeding all these children?\" I asked, flabbergasted.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied quietly.\n\n\"How do you get so much food? I'm sure you steal it,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, I do. Going to execute me?\" Still that gentle smile. Sitting here now, on my hill, I don't understand why I just walked out. I had no excuse for letting him get away with his crime. It was not my decision to make. Yet... I can't remember what I'm killing for; can't remember what I'm living for."

        "content": "Every evening, as I am doing my schoolwork in my room, the familiar sound of my father's car reaches my ears. I imagine his Fort Cortina coming up the driveway, the engine purring to a stop. I know that in a few moments, my father will be pausing outside my door, looking in quietly, so as not to stir me from my concentration. I know he will feel pleased as he watches me studying.\nMy father, at 53 years, has thinning hair swept back from his forehead. He has a slim and athletic body. His broad shoulders and rather serious demeanor give him an air of authority. Yet, behind his steel-rimmed glasses are soft, kind eyes.\n\nMy father has always been my source of encouragement. When I was very young, he would take a book from our small home library and read aloud to me every night. Secure and loved, on his lap, I was introduced to the fascinating realm of books. He would read stories and parables from the Bible. Thus, he instilled in me a sense of God's presence in this world.\n\nI remember how, as he was reading, my father would point out the spelling of words. Then one day, he instructed me to read the words for myself. To our shared delight, I found that I was able to do so. From that day onwards, I was the one who would read aloud, with his gentle correction every now and then. Soon after that, I was picking up the hooks and reading them on my own. I became quite a bookworm.\n\nAs I grew into boyhood, my bookish ways and disinterest in outdoor games made me overweight, clumsy and rather unfit. One day, my father stood observing me as I was running to a field, just 50 yards away. I arrived there, huffing and puffing. Worriedly, he told me that he would not like to see his son grow up into an unhealthy man.\n\nFrom that day onwards, he started to take me on jogs. At first, I was a most reluctant jogger. However, these days, as I stand perched on the peak of Mount Kina, breathing deeply after a good run, I remember his words, \"A healthy body breeds a healthy mind.\"\n\nMy father has a store of wise sayings which may seem common to some but always strike the correct note with me. Once, when I was really depressed, he put an arm around my shoulders and gently asked me what was troubling me. Lifting my bowed head, I poured out my heart's discontent. After listening, he consoled me. Then he said, \"Smile, and the world around you will smile.\" Somehow, I was able to smile in spite of my problems.\n\nAt another time, when I was about to give up on a task, he advised me, \"If a job deserves to be done, it deserves to be done well.\" Somehow, his words gave me the strength to try again, and I was able to succeed. Since then, whenever I feel daunted by a task, his advice always comes to mind and this spurs me on to persevere.\n\nLooking back, I realize that every step of the way, through my childhood and adolescence, my father has been there for me whenever I needed him. When I was sick, he would rush me to the doctor. When I was sick at heart, he would know just the right things to say. In any kind of trouble, I would just have to give him a call. He would surely be there.\n\nI am only a few years away from adulthood and know that many more challenges lie ahead of me. However, I can be sure that my father will be there, looking out for me all the way. Why? Because he loves me."

Not all of them have changed my life, but they have certainly made me more aware of my limitations. Yet, sometimes, remembering those times, I think, \"I can't believe I actually did that!\"\nThere was this incident about five years back. I was at a piano recital. Actually, it was my debut, and I was shaking with nerves. Finally, the dreaded moment arrived. I sat at the piano and started playing. Halfway through the first movement, I felt a tickle in my nose. My fingers were needed on the piano keys so I could not reach tip to rub my nose. I tried holding my breath... to no avail. I exploded in a huge, sloppy sneeze that blasted my music sheets right off the piano. Absolutely humiliated, I dashed off the stage. Nothing could get me out there to face the amused audience.\n\nThen, there was this skating incident which occurred only a year ago. My father had bought me my first pair of in-line skates. Actually, they were my first pair of skates. I had never skated before. Well, I confidently put them on and fastened them, not knowing what was ahead. Standing up, I shoved off. Then, for the first time in years, I lost all control of my bodily movements. I was waving my arms around, like a drowning chicken trying to fly out of the water. My legs had no sense of direction, with my left leg heading north and my right heading south-east. Finally managing to get upright, I found myself staring the gate right in its metal grille. There was a loud Crash! Boom! and Bang! Fortunately, all that was injured was my self-confidence, thanks to my protective pads.\n\nAnother accident occurred right in the safety of my home, in the kitchen, actually. My mother had just bought a microwave oven. On that fateful day, my mother had left me a plate of fried rice to be reheated for my lunch. On the plate were the usual accompaniments to the coconut-flavored rice: vegetables, groundnuts, chillied prawns and a whole hard-boiled egg. I was, of course, still considered a user with \"L\" (Learner) plates as far as this oven was concerned. However, warming up food was not complicated ... or so I thought. Carefully, I placed the plate of food in the microwave oven, turned the dial to \"high\" and pressed the lever to start the oven. It started smoothly. Gleefully, I watched my dish of food turn graceful circles in the oven. After a few rounds, I opened the oven to take out my warmed-up food. At that very second, the egg exploded. Boom! It was \"Egg yolk keeps falling on my head\". My clothes, my hair, the whole kitchen was covered with egg-yolk and rice that the force of the explosion threw. There was no lunch for me that day either.\n\nWell, there you have them, some of the grimace-inspiring details of my life. So, am I clumsy or just low in luck? A little of both, I think."

        "content": "\"Argh!\" screamed my friend as the water balloon hit her full in the face. She stood in shock for a moment before charging after me, laughing and yelling out threats.\nWe were at our annual class party and having the time of our lives. This year, we had decided on the picnic at the beach. After eating, we had all sorts of games and competitions. I could not remember when I had last enjoyed myself so much.\n\nHowever, all good things must come to an end, and as it neared evening, we started preparing to leave. I was supposed to walk the short distance to my aunt's house after the party. About halfway there, I remembered that I had left a T-shirt on the beach. I debated whether or not to return for it as I could see dark clouds heading my way. However, the shirt was an old favorite of mine and I was so wet from the water balloons that a little more water would not make a difference.\n\nThe beach was now deserted. I looked around for my T-shirt but it was nowhere to be found. Finally, after minutes of fruitless search, I gave up. The sky was dark, with thick thunderclouds and it had begun to drizzle. I started heading back.\n\nThen, suddenly, with a loud crash of thunder, the heavens burst and torrents of rain came pouring down. Holding my backpack over my head in an effort to ward off the relentless blows of the rain, I scanned the area for a place of refuge.\n\nFinally spotting a tiny shack at a distance, I dashed for it. I reached it at last and darted in, drenched to the bone and shivering from head to toe. As I shook out my hair, I mentally kicked myself for getting into this situation.\n\nWondering when the rain would stop, I stared out at it, dejectedly. As I gazed, however, my feelings of dejection turned into awe. The black clouds hung low. The sea was turbulent, with powerful waves crashing onto the shore. On the left, where jagged boulders stood in the sea, the waves threw themselves on them, sending up sprays of sea water high into the air. Gust after gust of howling wind blew through the trees. Lightning streaked across the sky, time and again, lighting up the whole scene for a split second each time.\n\nI stood transfixed, captivated by the power and violence of the storm. It was beautiful, scary and magnificent at the same time. I felt I had to be part of it, to be at one with nature.\n\nI ran out and stood in the middle of the storm, reveling in the stinging rain and chilling wind, thrilling to the sounds of the thunder and the crashing waves, and relishing the magnificence of nature."

Cuckoo!...\" the cuckoo clock on the wall of my office called five times.\n\"Yes!\" I shouted in my head. \"Time to pack up!\".\n\nI straightened my stiff back and neck, the result of hours of hunching over documents and surveyed the whole noise-polluted room. Andrew was yelling at Mac for throwing a paper plane at him; Mandy and Lily were chatting animatedly, undoubtedly about clothes or make-up; Jay and Rayne were chatting up Sarah, the new clerk, probably trying to get her to go for a drink; and Cynthia was doing the waltz in her three-inch heels, heading out the door.\n\nWith a grunt, I pushed my chair back, heaved myself up, started stuffing things into my briefcase and my huge handbag. I couldn't wait to get home.\n\nAs I stepped out through the glass doors of the air-conditioned building, a blast of hot, humid air slammed me full in the face, stunning me for a few seconds. Then I continued towards the bus stop. I groaned\naloud when I saw the hordes of people gathered there and regretted leaving my car at home. Sigh! I had no choice but to join the crowd.\n\nBuses came and left. Every time it was the same anxious craning to read the bus number above the heads of the crowd. Then, there was the rushing and jostling as I tried to force my puny frame through the\nmasses of burly men and women. I was ready to perish amidst the petrol fumes and the stink of stale sweat when I finally managed to squeeze my right foot onto a bus step. Then, up I went, forced by the\npushing crowd into the packed bus.\n\nFeeling woozy and yet hyped up, I searched for a seat. No way! They were all definitely occupied. I grabbed hold of a strap and tried to stand firmly Every time the bus lurched forward, we would all sway\nbackwards. The bus hurtled on, careening madly round corners, only to stop with a sudden jolt. I was crushed on all sides, and had my toes trod on several times.\n\nThen, we got caught in a massive traffic jam. Cars, buses and motorcycles around us kept up a constant honking. The burning rays of the sun stoked up the oven which our bus had now become. I became nauseous and thought many times about getting off. Yet, I was too tired to walk home. Inch by inch we moved and one and a half hours later, I finally arrived at my stop, which, thankfully, was just in front of\nmy flat. I shoved my way out, my strict upbringing forcing me to mutter a few insincere \"Excuse-me's\".\n\nI dragged my body up the flights of stairs to my second-floor flat. I did not even bother to try the elevator as I knew I would be competing with a crowd of thirty or more residents. Finally, I reached my door\nand, after a little fumbling for my keys, I entered my apartment. With a sigh of utmost relief, I dropped my briefcase and handbag on the floor, turned on the television and collapsed on the couch. \"All in\na day's work, my girl!\" I told myself, and gazed with unseeing eyes at the television."

        "content": "Thousands and thousands of acres of lush rain forests are cleared each year to make way for development. The once beautiful and spectacular forests are reduced to barren landscapes. This is for the sake of development, for the advancement of man.\nYet, what happens when trees are felled? Firstly, the earth is left vulnerable to soil erosion. The heavy tropical rains will carry away the rich topsoil, and the land without its topsoil will no longer be fertile. Slowly but steadily, the lush vegetation will give way to wasteland.\n\nSecondly, the flowing water will not only wash away the topsoil but will deposit it in the rivers. As a result, the rivers will become shallower. Consequently, floods will become frequent in the area. Thousands of people will suffer in these floods.\n\nAnother point to note is that forests are home to hundreds of species of flora and fauna. Animals and plants live in symbiotic relationships in the balance of nature. Man destroys this balance when he flattens the forests to the ground. Where do they go then, the great and tiny inhabitants of these forests? Nowhere. They die. If this goes on, the food chain will be disrupted. As creatures dependent on the food chain, man is ultimately destroying his own sources of food through the destruction of rain forests.\n\nWhen forests are a distant memory, a shocking fact will hit us full force. Mankind will be thrown into a state of unimaginable suffering and agony. What I am talking about is the lack of oxygen. While cutting down a tree to add yet another piece of luxurious furniture to Man's already opulent lifestyle, people forget that they are also cutting down our supply of oxygen.\n\nTrees absorb the carbon dioxide breathed out by living creatures, reprocess it and, in the end, produce the life-sustaining oxygen. Without trees, where will this oxygen come from? Will we process it in factories? Will a time come when man will be fighting for the very air he breathes?\n\nFurthermore, the excessive carbon dioxide will also effect a change in the micro-climate and raise the region's temperature. There will be a greenhouse effect on earth; warm air and radiation will be trapped under the earth's atmosphere. Then, as the earth's temperature rises, the ice in the polar caps will melt, raising the sea level. Great floods will hit the lower-lying areas.\n\nAs you can see, it is a vicious cycle. A change in our environment will trigger off another change which will trigger off yet another. This is why we. should keep the balance of nature. This is why we ought to preserve our forests. This is why environmentalist groups are pressurizing governments to reduce the felling of trees and the clearing of forests and to be serious about replanting forests.\n\nWith the support of ordinary citizens like you and me, they will get the attention of the people in power. We can also help by planting trees. Members of this beautiful planet must be united. By preserving our forests, we are preserving ourselves."

        "content": "If you were to see the number of suggestion slips stuffed into my school's Suggestion Box, you would be shocked. Granted, some of the suggestions are rubbish but I do agree with many of them. There are many ways in which my school could be improved, many weaknesses that need seeing to.\nFirstly, and most importantly, teachers in all schools should realize that they are responsible for their students' future. This is especially true for children from less affluent homes who cannot afford to supplement the school's teaching with extra tuition. Teachers should not shirk their responsibilities towards their students.\n\nI am emphasizing this point because some teachers do not seem to feel the slightest obligation to do their job well nor the slightest feeling of guilt when their students fail in the examinations. In fact, in my school, teachers are sometimes found sipping coffee or even having a snack in the school canteen when they are supposed to be in class teaching.\n\nOf course, there are teachers who are truly committed to their job and do deliver the goods. They stay up late into the night to finish correcting their students' work and to prepare effective lessons for their students. Some teachers will even devote Saturday mornings to conducting extra-curricular activities, such as the Scouts movement. Now, if only all teachers were like this!\n\nFurthermore, wouldn't the school be a much better place to spend our adolescence if we did not have to cope with teachers who vent their foul moods on us? We should not have to walk on eggshells because our teacher has had a bad day.\n\nAnother aspect of the school that needs changing is the set of school rules. Some are so irrational or petty! Take, for example, the rule on short hair for boys. What is the rationale behind this? Do the people in authority believe that everyone with long hair will turn out to be a thug or a villain? Well, look at Hitler: he had very short hair and he almost caused the extinction of the entire Jewish race!\n\nOn the other hand, punishments for serious acts of indiscipline should be made more effective, even if they have to be harsher. These days, students may get away with only a warning or a \"booking\" for offences such as breaking the school's tables, chairs and even doors. I strongly feel that these vandals should be made to pay for what they have destroyed.\n\nFurthermore, I feel that criminal action should be taken against students who beat people up, or threaten to do so, to extort money from them. If you behave like a criminal, you should be treated like one.\n\nAnother area that needs reform is the school curriculum. One major problem is the subject called \"Moral Education\". You just cannot learn good morals the way you learn any other academic subject, memorizing facts for examinations. Good morals have to be internalized. So, \"Moral Education\" should either be taken off the school curriculum after primary school or changed to emphasize practical application rather than \"head knowledge\".\n\nOur school hours take up a large portion of our day. Let us spend these hours usefully, in a secure, caring, fun-filled atmosphere. Our school years take up a large proportion of our lives. This is the time that we are molded, intellectually and morally. Help us to grow into worthy citizens of our nation."

        "content": "I climb into the cockpit and sit myself down on the metal seat of the F-16 \"Falcon\", one of the best supersonic planes ever invented. I run a routine check on all the aircraft's dials and gauges as well as the weapon systems through the heads-up display.\nThe sergeant gives me the thumbs-up sign from the far run way, indicating that all the external parts of the plane are in order and functioning well. I return the gesture to indicate that all internal systems are working well and that I will be taking off.\n\nI flick the start button and feel the soft vibration begin. I hear the hum of pure power. Pushing the throttle to three quarters, I feel the acceleration of the plane taxiing off the runway and into the air ... .\n\nI have always aspired to be a fighter pilot. My dream began when I was about seven years old. One day, my uncle took me for a ride in his private plane. It was a momentous experience for me! Soaring freely in the sky, high above the rest of civilization, I knew that I would never want to do anything as much as I wanted to fly.\n\nAs I grew older, I began to read books on aviation and air adventures. I was especially fascinated with accounts of air battles. Biggles was my hero above all other heroes. Thus, my ambition narrowed from just wanting to fly a plane to becoming a fighter pilot. The thought of scudding through the sky with the ability to defy gravity with a multi-million dollar piece of machinery and patriotic fervor excited my soul.\n\nThe requirements for fighter pilot candidates are many and difficult to fulfill. Among them are academic excellence, perfect eyesight, a fit body, quick reflexes and the ability to stay cool under pressure. Well, I have never been the kind of person to leave things to chance: I am constantly aware of the need to work towards my goals.\n\nThus, throughout my childhood years, into adolescence and up till now, I have always made time for exercise. I play games regularly, run ten kilometers a day and work out in the gym at least three times a week. It is crucial for a fighter pilot to be fighting fit. He must be able to withstand the high and low g's when piloting a jet at high speed.\n\nI have always been conscious of the need to preserve the perfect eyesight that God has blessed me with. So, I have always curtailed my hours of television-viewing. When I do watch television, I make sure I sit a good four meters away from the screen. I have always been careful to read only in well-lit areas. In addition, I watch my diet, eating food rich in vitamin A, which is essential for healthy eyes.\n\nIn school, I never stint on my study times. I made sure I qualified for the science stream in High School, as a pilot must have a good understanding of physics and mathematics. My hard work has paid off and I have been topping the class in these subjects. I have just sat for the O levels. The results will not be out for months but I feel confident that I have done well. Next year, I plan to do my A levels. And after that, I shall enlist in the US Air Force.\n\nThere is not much longer to wait. My dream is almost within my grasp. I pray with all my heart that it will become a reality and not remain just another of my boyish fantasies."

        "content": "\"Mr. Chairman, honorable judges, misguided members of the opposition, and members of the floor: Good day to all.\n\"Standing here today on this breezy morning as the third speaker for the proposition, I wish to continue where my team-mates left off to correct the misleading information presented by the opposition.\n\n\"For instance, the second member of the opposition claimed that the youngest child will be treated more leniently than the others. Now, is this an advantage? By being treated too leniently, the child might think that his misbehavior is perfectly acceptable. Ever heard of the expression \"Spare the rod and spoil the child\"? It is true. Without strict and loving discipline, a beloved child might end up being the black sheep of the family. Now, the opposition contends that it is an advantage to be spoilt in this way. How can this be?\n\n\"The opposition has also pointed out that the youngest child is usually more pampered. I agree. But, again, is this good? It is indeed enjoyable to be fussed over, pampered and mollycoddled but what will this pampered child grow into? It is a maxim that too much or too little is no good: Once a pampered child grows up, he will be overly dependent on others, in other words, spineless. Would you like to be this spineless adult? I leave you to decide.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, having straightened out a few delusions of the opposition, I shall present my own points. One of the advantages of being an eldest child is that he is used to being respected and obeyed by his siblings. This is because they know he is wiser and more experienced. This is a good feeling and it creates high self-esteem. This self-esteem will motivate him to succeed in every aspect of life.\n\n\"Undeniably, the eldest child will shoulder more responsibilities. He will often be left in charge of the younger ones. The eldest child is also cast as a role model for the younger ones. Thus, he has to try harder to maintain discipline and a high standard of behavior.\n\n\"The eldest child, having to cope with his siblings' antics, will also develop patience. He may have to give in to his siblings because `they are too young to understand'. Thus, he develops tolerance and understanding of other people's weaknesses.\n\n\"All these points were described as 'disadvantages' by the opposition. They are only disadvantageous if you are unable to see the long-term benefits. You see, these momentarily trying circumstances will shape the child and prepare him for the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Home Ministry, an average of 3 out of 5 successful people -- corporate leaders, lawyers, politicians -- were the eldest children in their families.\n\"On to my next point, which centers on the word 'privileges'. In most cases, the eldest child will inherit the greater share of the wealth. According to Chinese custom, the eldest son carries on the family name, therefore he deserves a larger share of the property. In monarchies, the eldest child is the heir to the throne, as in the case of Prince Charles. If you think that the eldest child is only privileged if he belongs to a wealthy family, you are wrong. The distinction is even sharper in poor families where the eldest child may be the only one whom the family can afford to educate or feed properly.\n\n\"So, there you have it. Clear arguments to demolish the opposition to this motion. And now I hand over to my opponents, to give the sensible ones amongst them a chance to start defecting over to our side. Thank you.\""

        "title": "Should our school examination system be abolished ? Give reasons for your stand.",
        "content": "From primary school to the end of their tertiary education, students face the daunting task of preparing for examinations every single year. So much time and emotion is poured into preparing for examinations.\nAdvocates of the system contend that annual examinations are a good way of training children for the stress of life after school - where deadlines and sales quotas need to be met, and work completed methodically and with minimum fuss.\n\nGovernment examinations are also said to be the necessary yardstick for measuring the capability of each person for further education or employment.\n\nYet, are examinations an accurate yardstick? A person's true abilities may not be shown by written examinations. Take Winston Churchill, for example. He was a school dropout and yet he became one of England's greatest statesmen, a national savior in World War II. Clearly, some talents and forms of ingenuity go undetected in examinations.\n\nAnother problem related to our system of examinations is that teachers become too \"exam-orientated\". They race through the syllabus so that they can cover everything in it in time for the examinations regardless of whether their students have understood the material. The weaker students often end up the victims in this race -- they are left far behind the rest of the class. They become more and more discouraged as they understand less and less of the lessons, to the point that they hardly care if they pass or fail. Sadly, this attitude will be carried with them into adult life.\n\nWhat about the \"swots\"? Well, speaking as one, I confess that I often wonder whether it is worth it. We rush from one tuition class to another and we spend most of our time studying for tests and examinations, or doing our homework. All through the school semester, we only have one thought in mind: to excel in the examinations. Is this really living?\n\nA related point is that some students are so occupied with their studies that they do not develop their potential in other fields. It is true that there are many clubs and societies in the school. However, many students just do not have the time to make full use of these extracurricular activities. They have to study, study, study. So, our emphasis on examinations is indirectly producing people who are only trained to study and reproduce facts rather than well-rounded individuals.\nIn conclusion, while I realize that it will be impossible to do away with all examinations, I feel that they should be given less importance within the school system. For example, instead of basing entry qualifications on one examination, students should also be evaluated through the cumulative marks of tests and assignments. Furthermore educationists, employers, parents and the students themselves should always be reminded that the results of examinations are not equal to the sum of the net worth of the individual."

        "content": "About two months ago, our Education Minister brought up the subject of school toilets. He suggested that cleaning these toilets should be part of the school curriculum. The public reaction to this issue was so strong that people have been flooding the mass media with opinions for and against his suggestion.\nOne of the reasons the Education Minister gave for his proposal was that cleaning toilets will teach students humility and respect for others. Firstly, the students will be able to understand the humility of the school workers when they have to clear up other people's messes in the toilets. This job is looked down upon and considered one of the lowest. \"They will also be able to respect the cleaners because he is able to do the necessary job, regardless of the low status it accords him. Another advantage of this proposal is that the students will try to keep the toilets cleaner as their friends will be the ones forced to clean up any mess they create.\n\nOn the other hand, there are countless reasons for me to be apprehensive about this proposal for making toilet cleaning part of the school curriculum. Firstly, which student in his right mind would be happy about having to clean a toilet? Most school toilets are dark, dirty and smelly. Cleaning them will be most unpleasant.\n\nFurthermore, a spell of cleaning toilets will certainly be a blow to their ego. Of course, in a wholly girls' or boys' school it would not be so humiliating. However, if it were a co-ed school, the male ego would certainly suffer a lot of pain. Imagine girls laughing and teasing a guy who is forced to clean toilets. Some egoistic guy will create havoc in retaliation!\n\nThen, there is the consideration that most students are playful, anyway. Imagine them expressing their playful nature in the toilets. Other than the fact that excessive water is sure to be splashed all over the place, the students may slip and fall in their merriment. More ill-behaved ones may even purposely push each other into the toilet bowls.\n\nOne other possibility that cannot be excluded is that students may be so turned off at the thought of toilet cleaning that they may decide to skip school on the days that it is their turn to learn this skill. Thus, the teachers of other subjects may find it hard to complete the syllabus, due to the rise in absenteeism.\nIn conclusion, I feel that the Ministry of Education should really ponder on this issue carefully. Frankly, I do not agree at all that cleaning toilets should be part of the school curriculum. Actually, jobs like toilet cleaning make one think of prison camps, where the inmates are forced to do humiliating chores. School is supposed to be a place where young people can imbibe knowledge and good values in a pleasant, enjoyable atmosphere. It is important that young people actually like to come to school."

        "content": "\"Mr. Chairman, honorable judges, my most worthy opponents and everyone else present here today. Good afternoon. Before I begin on my main points, I would like to express my disagreement with one of the points expressed by the proposition team.\n\"The second speaker for the proposition said that advertisements cause people to keep buying low-quality goods. Now, I feel that people generally are not so naive. Even the members of the proposition team have been able to note the various tricks and so-called brain washing maneuver. So, the tricks haven't worked, have they? Actually, few of the usual purchases that we buy are heavily advertised on television or anywhere else for that matter. For example, do you choose the most highly advertised tissue paper or toilet paper? At most, we would try a much advertised product only because it was something new. Take the Cherry Coke advertisements. Its advertising mode probably fits all the descriptions made by the proposition team member. However, how many of us were so influenced by these advertisements that he or she has started to drink the beverage weekly, or even monthly?\n\n\"Now for my first point, I would like to state the benefits of advertisements from the economic side. Advertisements can help companies to introduce their latest products to the market. If the companies are not able to inform the public about their new products, they will not have the confidence to try to produce it. It is undeniable that advertisements play a crucial role in increasing a company's sales. This may sound capitalistic, but we must remember the importance of these factories to the nation. With the increase in sales, the company can afford to give better pay to the workers and offer more jobs.\n\n\"Now, another point is that it is only with proper circulation of the products made possible by advertising that the companies are able to mass-produce their products. Mass production is more economical and allows the producers to lower the price of these goods! As a result, consumers can purchase these goods at reasonable prices. As you can see, millions of consumers benefit because of advertisements.\n\n\"Thirdly, industries can also greatly contribute to the expansion of a company from regional to international status. Let me give a real example. One man started a small and humble cottage industry of jeans-making. Because of its increasing popularity through advertising, this industry gradually weaved its way into the market until it started to prosper. From a cottage industry, this industry grew into an international company known by both the young and old. The name of this brand of jeans is none other than Levi's. This company was able to grow due to advertisements, creating job opportunities for millions of people, not only in America but also in Levi's factories in Indonesia, the Philippines and other third world countries.\n\n\"Fourthly, advertisements of the latest technology and inventions are also beneficial for the consumers, for it means they can find the right kind of product for themselves easily and quickly. Here is another real-life case. My grandmother used to have too many lizards crawling around her house and she is paranoid about them. Then, one day, she saw the advertisement for a lizard spray that can paralyze lizards temporarily. End of lizard problem. How could my dear grandma have found out about such a strange but useful product without advertisements? Jokes aside, through reading the advertisements in newspapers or magazines, many people find just the product required to take care of their particular problem. Estate managers can find out about the right fertilizer or pesticide; computer owners can find the best software; doctors can find out about the latest medications. Imagine all the bother one must go through to find out the product one needs amongst the rapidly expanding array of products and inventions available, without advertisements. Why, one would have to phone just about every shop in town! Nowadays, we can just flip open a newspaper or even the Yellow Pages. See how advertisements have been such a blessing!\n\n\"I rest my case. Thank you.\""

        "content": "\"I would like to share my thoughts with you on a subject that has always been close to my heart, that is, whether men should be house-husbands. You see, as a member of the male sex I feel guilty. I feel that man has always dominated, or should I say, bullied, the fairer sex. Women have long been downtrodden and forced to mind the house.\n\"There was a very good reason for this in ancient times. Eking out a living then consisted mainly of running around with a club or spear, hunting deer, moose, or dinosaurs. However, now that we're approaching the year 2000, there has been a vast change. Bringing home the bacon in modern times needs intelligence and sensible thinking. And, as we all know, women can and do think as sensibly and intelligently as men.\n\n\"Thus, more and more women now qualify as doctors, lawyers and scientists. So, then, who will stay at home to take care of the children? Usually in cases where the mother works, the children are left in daycare centers. This is not healthy. Children need parental care. So, what often happens is that the wife has to quit her job. Is this fair? Not really. The men should be given the duty to mind the house occasionally, especially when the wife has better qualifications.\n\n\"Some people doubt that a man can manage a household. You see, the women have been doing it for centuries. People have thus come to the conclusion that it is the woman's duty to mind the home and it shall be her role forever.\n\n\"Actually, men are perfectly capable of performing domestic chores and minding children. And, as fathers, men can give the affection and care that the children need. And that's what really counts.\n\n\"Personally, if my wife insists on being the breadwinner, I will be relieved of the stress of running in the rat race. I could even play golf every morning while the kids are at school. What's so bad about that? So, let's give the women the chance to work at those jobs that they've always wanted, while we men opt for more 'relaxed' lifestyles. And, who knows, perhaps the country would be run better. After all, looking at the current state of the world, what with wars, famines and nuclear weapons, perhaps we men should just stay at home to mind the house and let the women run the world!\""

        "content": "No man is an island. Everyone depends on his friends to a certain extent. Ever since man formed a system of verbal communication, all people have been in constant chatter with one another. Relationships are important to man, so much that people may shape their entire lifestyles simply to find favor with their clique or circle of friends. Therefore, much caution must be applied when dealing with our friends, especially in our speech. So then, must we always tell our friends the whole truth and nothing but the truth or is it sometimes simply none of their business?\nOne thing is clear: finding out that your friend has lied to you always hurts. In cases where lies have been told to hurt you or other parties on purpose, the friendship will never be the same. If the lie caused you great damage, the friendship will not be salvageable. Who would want a treacherous person for a friend? Yet, even when the matter is not of great importance, little lies can lead to the spoiling of relationships. I have a friend who often tells little untruths. Sometimes, he exaggerates circumstances a little, just to impress others, sometimes he tells half-truths to get out of trouble, sometimes, he makes up stories just to entertain his friends. Personally, I just do not feel comfortable with him. You see, I just never know whether he is telling the truth or one more of his little lies.\n\nApart from the question of maintaining credibility, sharing one's problems and joys with a friend can also be helpful as we deal with the problems of daily living. As the saying goes, shared joy is double the joy and shared sorrow is half the sorrow. Sharing the good times can brighten up a friend's day if he feels down. Sharing one's problems and despairs with a friend will bring forth the encouragement and advice we need to hear. Sometimes simply having an ear to hear our heart's cries and knowing that someone understands us will make us feel better. People have been saved from suicide just by having a friend to listen to their troubles.\n\nIt is clear, then, that some things need to be said to our friends without any twisting of the truth. However, there are times when telling a friend too much can also lead to problems. An all-too-common example of such a time is when one hears rumors. Gossip can start simply because someone thought a rumor was true and shared all her thoughts on the rumor with a friend. The friend, who actually had no real knowledge of the matter, passed all her thoughts and ideas to another friend and so on and so forth. The final result can be a mangled product which could really hurt the parties involved. The thing to do about rumors is not to spread them, even if you have strong opinions, about them.\n\nAnother noteworthy fact is that sometimes, telling the truth may be worse than saying nothing. If an ugly girl with an inferiority complex were to ask you if she was unattractive, it would be a very bad idea to tell her just how unattractive she was. One must use his discretion in such situations, stressing on her good qualities, of course. Telling the whole truth in this case would destroy her remaining shreds of confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel that friends, even the closest of friends, need not tell each other everything they know or feel. Some matters, of course, should be discussed with friends, while some others should be hidden. We have to balance our love for truth with the practicalities of the situation. Not being perfect, we are bound to make mistakes, of course. So, one must then be prepared to make up with our friends, apologizing for our verbal blunders and forgiving them for theirs. Well, that's what friendship is really about -- accepting people for what they are, imperfections and all."

        "title": "\"The Golden Age of Youth\". How true is this description of your life as a youth ?",
        "content": "\"The Golden Age of Youth\"? Who coined up that expression? I am certainly not experiencing \"golden\" days in my life as a youth. Furthermore, many of my friends' complaints seem to attest that their experiences of youth roughly match up with mine, that is, life as a youth is tough!\nFirstly, being young automatically means that I have limited knowledge and no job skills, which means that no one will employ me for any worthwhile job. This means, clearly and simply, \"No Independent Income\". Now, it is undeniable that without money, you become severely limited in your options. You cannot buy anything, go anywhere or do anything. Obviously, this is a problem for me.\n\nUnable to function without cash, I have to rely on my parents financially. Unable to buy a car, I have to rely on them for transport. Unable to buy a house, I have to rely on them for accommodation. This means, theoretically, that my parents are my Supreme Commanders. When they tell me to jump, I have to jump. In such a situation, I am deprived of the vital human right that caused the American Civil War - Freedom.\n\nSecondly, as long as you are not too old or too ill to walk, people will always be measuring you by your achievements. This is especially true for people in their youth. Parents, teachers, society and the government love to gauge us scholastically, physically, socially, morally and in whatever means they can think of. Thus, school examinations become so important that many of us will study hours on end to perform well in them.\n\nActually the pressure on us to perform well at all times is great. The pressure from our family gets stronger the older we grow. Since we started schooling, our parents have been comparing our test results with those of the children of their friends', who happen to be equally goal-orientated parents. In fact, since we were born, our parents have been comparing the ages at which we first started talking or walking, our kiddy IQ test results and such other traps for vainglory. If I were a piece of chicken, I'd consider myself \"Kentucky Fried\", not because I was \"spicy\" or \"original\" but because I have been chopped into pieces, tenderized, pressure-cooked and well-fried.\n\nThen, there is the question of romance. Practically speaking, youth is the worst time to get romantically attached, because, as was earlier explained, we lack the time and money to maintain a special boy-girl relationship.\n\nYet, during our youth, we are at our peak; physically, we are at our most attractive. Furthermore, our hormones are swinging about wildly as we mature sexually. Unfortunately, this causes us to be more prone to getting involved in romantic relationships, which leads to heartache and causes us to perform badly in our examinations. I think that the government should have chosen a better time to set all the major examinations than at this time, don't you?\n\nSo, youth is a traumatic time. It is definitely not \"golden\". In my opinion, the idea of \"The Golden Age of Youth\" must have been an illusion dreamt up by fools. Perhaps we should call it the \"Iron Pyrite (Fool's Gold) Age of Youth\"."

        "content": "Along the road from cradle to grave many of us get married. This in itself can cause more emotional disturbance than all the other events of our lives combined. Many factors make the difference between marital bliss and having \"an old ball-and-chain\" but the most important factor is probably whom we choose to marry. That is why I often meditate on the qualities I would seek in my future wife.\nTo be honest, the first thing I notice when I meet a girl is whether she is pretty or not. Long lashes and sparkling eyes do not cause someone to \"fall in love at first sight\", of course, but few people go round seeking ugly mates. I am no different.\n\nOf course, I would also prefer to have a wife who is intelligent. Some men have the stereotyped \"dumb blonde\" image of a perfect woman. However, I know my life will be enriched by having an intellectually stimulating partner to share my thoughts with, and to offer fresh insights to old situations. More importantly, a husband and wife should be intellectually matched so that they can understand each other.\n\nSports and games and other recreational activities are fun and foster closer ties. Who better to enjoy sports with than my wife? This will draw us even closer together. A wife should, after all, be a true friend whom I can have fun with and want to spend my leisure activities with. So, my ideal mate will be someone who participates in the games and sports I like or at least, be willing to learn them.\n\nOften, quarrels between husband and wife concern other family members. Your wife may be perfect but her parents may be irritating beyond comprehension. There was, for example, an incident in City Center where one man's mother-in-law came to stay. One day, she cooked and ate his pet dog for dinner! So, I always say that one's future in-laws should always be checked carefully before one makes decisions about marriage.\n\nIf you are dead tired after a long, frustrating day at work, a loving wife who comforts you and listens to your problems can really make a difference. So I would say, a sympathetic, caring kind of woman is the only one with whom I would make any commitments for marriage.\n\nCommitment is very important on her part, too. If a girl isn't prepared to be faithful to you but she marries you anyway, chances are she's going to run away and leave you one day, for your best friend, perhaps.\n\nI realize that I have listed a whole string of qualifications for my future wife. Well, if I can find all these qualities in one woman, I will really consider her The Ideal Wife. However, chances are, with a girl like that, everyone else will be trying to win her hand, too. So, I'll be in for a tough time! Furthermore, as the proverb goes, \"The best laid plans of mice and men can fail\". More than likely, I will meet a girl one day, fall in love and get married. And even though she might not be perfect, I'll love her, and, through the years, that might just be enough."

I fretted a lot and constantly demanded my mother's attention.

At odd hours of the night, I would ask for a hot drink or a cookie, or just some company.\n\n\"Mummy, stay with me!\" was my constant whine.\n\nNot once was that demand refused. Not once did my mother groan or grumble. She answered every unreasonable demand of mine with unfailing patience. My mother would put everything aside to comfort me.\n\nMy world was very small then. There was just me and Mummy. My world consisted of the feel of her cool palms soothing my brow and her floral scent as she leaned over me to tuck in my blanket. I remember her low voice, hushing me as I fretted about the pains in my joints. Most of all, I remember the look in her eyes, of deep concern for her sick child. That was how I knew my mother loved me then.\n\nMiraculously, I have outgrown my childhood ailments. Now that I am on the threshold of adulthood, my world has grown to include many exciting friends. Set free from the prison of the sickbed, I revel in the fun that the world has to offer.\n\nMy relationship with my mother has suffered from my wild pursuit of fun. She criticizes my choice of friends and tries to enforce rules and regulations to curb my activities.\n\nTwo nights ago, I stayed out way, way past my \"curfew\" hour, which is eleven o'clock. It was almost 1 a.m. when I reached my house. To make matters worse, I had been unable to call home to inform my mother that I would be delayed. There were no phones where we were \"hanging out\". I knew that I was in for it!\n\nMy mother flung open the door the minute she heard my friend's car pull in. Her face was red, sweat was pouring down her temples. My friends made a quick exit as she ranted at me, her arms waving wildly. I didn't say a word, in case one of those hands should find its mark on my face. I was ordered straight to bed.\n\nAs I got into bed, she stood in my room, still ranting at me for my disobedience and \"wild behavior\". I was tired. I just wanted to sleep. I looked up at her face to try to gauge if her scolding would be continuing much longer.\n\nThen I saw something familiar about the look in her eyes. It was the same look of concern that she had always had when I was so sick. I saw in her eyes all the fears that she had suffered that night as she waited for her daughter to return safely.\n\nThis is how I know my mother loves me now."

        "title": "How do you measure success in life?",
        "content": "Reaching the top of the tree in one's chosen occupation or profession is the usual standard by which success in life is measured, at least in the Western world. However many Asians would reject this criterion. The contemplative religions assert that success is only measurable in terms of religious advancement and of the acquisition of the virtues. Thus, success would be in inverse ratio to material advancement.\nMost of the world accepts the definition of material advancement, its objectives being affluence and perhaps power over others, both being the most important means of self-expression.\n\nSome are born into positions which already confer affluence and power, so success to them might lie merely in the preservation of the family business or estate and perhaps its enhancement for the benefit of the next generation. Most people have to work hard to to achieve success.\n\nThe western concept of success is not always satisfying and some people, at the height of their affluence and power, reject it in favor of the simple life. This happens for a variety of reasons.\n\nBeyond a certain point the acquisition of money proves unsatisfactory. The difference between the lifestyle available to a millionaire and that available to a billionaire is marginal. Unhappily money making can become an obsession, and some very wealthy people become very mean. Money also creates anxiety since it usually has to be put at risk if more is to be made. Other anxieties may be created when a large number of people become dependent on a financial empire. Money confers power which may corrupt. It is often made at the disadvantage of others, and it may damage a business man's relationships both with his peers and with his subordinates. These pressures and anxieties often have a detrimental effect on health and on family life. One's wife and children are inevitably neglected and unhappy. The children of successful capitalists or career workaholics sometimes reject everything the father or parents stand for. Success thus means failure.\n\nIt is of course possible, though unlikely, that worldly success can be combined with a sensitive and therefore successful approach to the problems outlined above. If a man or woman can achieve this then he or she truly has the right to be called successful.\n\nHowever success is not strictly related to the externals of power, prominence and affluence, though these are often its attributes. It is more to do with happiness and fulfillment. What then are its features?\n\nFirst, mental and spiritual peace. A satisfying yet balanced way of life makes for the former and a religion or at least a philosophy for the latter. The body should not be neglected; physical well-being is usually the result of good food and exercise; absence of strain is at least as important. A successful life depends crucially on good personal relationships both within and outside the family. To ensure the well-being and happiness of others forms a large part of success. Perhaps the fundamental way to achieve success is first to be sure of what you want to do with life and then to be sure that you are capable of doing it. Some people are strongly motivated to a profession or to politics or to social campaigning from early days; others have to find their own role in life by trial and error. Many of these careers will not confer much success in the worldly sense but they will lead to the success of happiness and fulfillment."

        "title": "In what circumstances is the invasion of one country by another justified?",
        "content": "Invasion is never justified if there is a possibility of resolving disputes by diplomatic means. The U.N., drawn up by the San Francisco Conference in 1945, in succession to the League of Nations exists to maintain international peace and security. Its Security Council can urge members to take economic or military sanctions, or can provide a peace-keeping force drawn from member - nations. Its powers however amount to little more than those of the old League, since the two world-power centers remain NATO and the Warsaw Pact association.\nThis having been said, invasions do occur. Recent examples include the invasion of Iraq by Iran, the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, and that of the Falkland Islands by Argentina. Motives for invasion vary; how cynical they are is a matter of opinion. There is national pride; the desire to annex territory which rightly belongs to a country but which has either become independent or has become the dependency of another. There is the instinct to expand, or not to become encircled, or to gain strategic territory, or to gain access to minerals such as oil, or to food. The naked aggression of Hitler in Europe was totally unjustified, so the Second Front invasion of Europe by the allies in 1944 can be amply justified. Sometimes, as in the case of Afghanistan, the ostensible reason was to establish a stable government in a country which, bordering on the USSR was claimed to constitute a threat through instability. That invasion was not justified.\n\nThe ground for military invasion is usually prepared by other means. If there is instability and national discontent, or even two extremist parties each claiming the government, infiltration is much easier. An actual invasion becomes a mere formality when a government accepts perhaps thousands of military advisers, massive war equipment, and no doubt extensive economic aid from one of the great powers. A physical take-over can sometimes be achieved without shedding a drop of blood. What is certain is that after such a takeover a large section of the population will remain discontented. Future troubles, as in Afghanistan, are inevitable, and lead only to further repressive measures.\n\nThe guiding principle governing the justice of invasion is surely this; do the majority of the people want such a take-over? A case in point is the invasion of the Falklands by Argentina, which country was at the time suffering internal troubles and needed a famous victory abroad. The Falklands, close at hand and regarded as an easy number, were an obvious choice, particularly since Argentina regarded the 'Malvenas' as their historic property. However, the islanders wanted to remain British, so the British armed forces had to throw the Argentines out. That particular invasion by the British was justified, particularly since, in fact, the Argentines were refusing to negotiate. However, realistically it becomes another matter to retaliate when the major powers become involved. Nobody wants to risk a full scale war for the sake of a principle. Nobody forgets Vietnam. So to invade or not to invade involves a crucial balancing of factors."

        "title": "Describe the system for maintaining law and order in your country. Can you suggest any improvements?",
        "content": "One hundred and fifty years ago a Conservative British Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, founded the modern police force. This replaced the old system of town and village constables in their local peace-keeping role under the beadle. Very quickly the new force obtained a national respect which it had never previously enjoyed, and despite a vocal left-wing and liberal minority, it retains that general respect today.\nIn case of serious trouble, behind the police force stands that section of the British Army which is home-based. It has, with reluctance, been called on in various roles during domestic emergencies. To man essential services during a general strike, or a strike of one or more of the essential services, including railways, buses, power-stations, water works, ambulance drivers and fire brigades. A less frequent role has been to quell riots and this is unpopular with the army since soldiers do not like inflicting injury or even death on fellow citizens. Examples are riots in pre-war London stirred up by the National Socialist movement, and more recently the riots in Liverpool. Birmingham and London attributed to a mixture of ethnic discrimination and unemployment. British people accept the need on occasion for this military back-up, but prefer it not to be used.\n\nToday the police are controlled by the Home Secretary, who is also responsible for that other troubled part of Britain, Northern Ireland, through the Secretary of State for Ireland. Ireland has always caused more headaches than the rest of Britain put together, and in that country the Royal Ulster Constabulary, an armed force, needs the presence of armed and equipped British troops, who are constantly called into para-military action. Opinions vary from those who advocate a 'troops out' policy, leaving Ireland to get on with a civil war, to those who would like to bring the whole of Ireland, forcibly, back into British hands. Since the Irish Free State came into existence in 1922, and before then, during the First World War Southern Ireland has tended to side with the enemies of Britain.\n\nThe county police forces of the rest of Britain are controlled by chief constables responsible to the Home Secretary, and the Metropolitan Police Force by a commissioner, also responsible to the Home Secretary. Because of crime increase, and the modern mobility of criminals there is more co-operation between these separate forces than before, and often, when the ramifications of crime cover a large area, joint operational headquarters are set up, their work being aided by data banks in a nationwide computer system.\n\nApart from straightforward crime, the situation is further complicated today by crime in a new guise i.e.. political violence, mostly in London. This often consists of a group of extremists from one foreign country attacking the embassy of another, and trying to buy publicity or political advantage with threats and the taking of hostages. To deal with these we now use a quiet little section of the armed forces known as the SAS just as we use a new section of the police force to quell street rioting, looting and arson, known as the SPG. So far these have not often been needed.\n\nThe traditional police force has only been armed with a whistle and a short truncheon, maintaining law and keeping order on the streets by presence rather than violence. Some of us deplore the tendency to issue firearms, but recognize that the police are at a disadvantage otherwise. Do we have to accept that the world must become more violent, meeting violence with violence, or work for a diminishing crime rate and a more peaceful and law-abiding community?\n\nIf the latter, there will need to be fundamental as well as cosmetic changes in our national life. The cosmetic changes include less policing by vehicles, and more on foot; more community policemen back on 'the beat' and knowing their area and people, and being known by them. Another will be to restore confidence in the policeman's fairness and integrity in areas where interested parties have sought to erode this confidence. Local authority police committees to monitor police activities are in the hands of anti-law and order elements, and do no good. They merely erode police morale. The fundamental changes needed go deeper. Since the motion to restore the death penalty was defeated in Parliament, a life-sentence must mean what it says. Firearm availability must be more strictly controlled. Above all children and young people should be less exposed to television and film violence, kept off drugs and alcohol, and taught, in the home, a new respect for law and order."

        "title": "Discuss the benefits of and the problems caused by the artificial damming of rivers.",
        "content": "The damming of rivers to form reservoirs was common practice in Roman times, and probably much earlier. Over the intervening centuries the practice has evolved for three main purposes; human consumption, irrigation, and industrial use. Since rainfall is never sufficiently uniform to provide a reliable water-source from normal river flow, the reservoir has always been a great boon, spanning as it does lengthy periods of drought. There are, of course, other reasons for damming a river. Following heavy storms in mountainous areas more water than a river can carry will flow down to the plain, inundating large areas often destroying crops, homes and animal and human life. Mountain passes, if dammed, give the opportunity not only to control the flow of flood water at its peak but also to retain large quantities for controlled use in dry weather. This control of water works from sea to river as well as from river to sea. An example is the recently constructed Thames barrier below Woolwich on the River Thames in England. This consists of solid pillars across the river with massive steel plates between each pillar which can be raised or lowered mechanically. The object is to protect the low-lying parts of London when a certain combination of wind and tide raises the water level by as much as thirty feet.\nA further use of the dam is to produce hydroelectric power, the power station, of course, being built below the level of the dam. Water is channeled through conduits and used as mechanical power for the turbines. It is then returned to the river. Reservoir water is also used today in vast quantities in nuclear power stations for cooling and other purposes and is similarly returned to the river or to the sea.\n\nSome rivers in their natural state arc not navigable by large vessels, or run dry in sea- sons of drought. Where such rivers can be dammed they can be given a constant depth for purposes of navigation, and this benefits a country's communication system.\n\nMore often than not a dam may be central in a multi-purpose scheme including most of the functions outlined above. This is particularly true in countries lying in temporate zones, where water shortage can be a nuisance but is rarely a disaster.\n\nMatters are different in underdeveloped countries which are hot, dry and barren. In these areas populations are often nomadic, driving flocks and herds from waterhole to waterhole, or scratching a mere subsistence from the soil. Drought means disease, hunger, dehydration and death to animals and humans alike. The damming of major rivers such as the Nile is crucial to life itself, and the control of their floodwater for irrigation purposes essential, but even this is not preventing large tracts of North East Africa from reverting to desert.\n\nPerhaps of least importance is the social value of a reservoir. Some stocked with trout, provide good fishing, and most are used by sailing clubs, and for other aquatic sports. A reservoir is also a great attraction to water-loving birds and often becomes an interesting staging-post for migrations.\n\nDamming a river can also cause problems. A great area of land, with its trees, flora and fauna, farms and houses, has to be inundated. Neither the residents, who have to resettle elsewhere, nor the environmentalists, appreciate this. The problem is more acute when the countryside about to be spoilt is environmentally unique, as in a recent case in Australia, where attempts were made to involve Prince Charles and Princess Diana in the dispute. Creating an artificial lake inevitably changes the character of a large area. Farmland is destroyed, natural scenery, in the opinion of some, despoiled. People have to move, inconveniently.\n\nA second drawback may be political. Many rivers flow through more than one country, that lying higher up the river having the whip-hand. A dam built for one country's benefit may be much to the detriment of another. The USSR has been in dispute with Turkey over this matter as has Egypt with the Sudan.\n\nDams are vulnerable to air attack in wartime. The destruction of the Mohne See dam in the Second World War brought the industry of the Ruhr to a virtual standstill, as well as causing loss of life. There have also been cases of the collapse of dams due to inadequate strength and imperfect design."

        "content": "In its mineral form sodium chloride, NaCl, is known as common salt. It is important because it is essential to the health of human beings and of animals. For domestic use it is fined down to what is known as table-salt, and small quantities of other chemicals are added to it to keep it free-flowing when in contact with the atmosphere.\nSalt and potassium are combined to produce iodised salt, used when iodine is lacking in diet. Its absence causes goitre, the swelling of the thyroid gland.\n\nLivestock as well as humans need salt, and this provided in the form of solid blocks, known as 'salt-licks'. Salt is also crucial to the food industry. It is used in meat-packing sausage-making and fish-curing both for seasoning and as a preservative. It is also used in the curing and preserving of hides and in the form of brine for refrigeration purposes.\n\nSalt is extensively used in the chemical industry; in the manufacture of baking soda, sodium bicorbonate; of caustic soda, sodium hydroxide; of hydrochloric acid, of chlorine etc. It is also used in soap-making, and in the manufacture of glaze and porcelain enamel. It also enters metallurgic processes as flux, a compound used to assist the fusing of metals.\n\nSalt lowers the melting point of water, so in combination with grit, it is used for clearing roads of snow and ice. It is also used for water-softening by means of removing calcium and magnesium compounds from tap water."

        "content": "It is difficult to grade the senses in relative importance to mankind. Opinions vary particularly between sight and hearing. A person blind from birth has no concept of vision, so presumably does not `miss' sight. It is different for a person who goes blind because suddenly, or gradually, so much is lost; personal independence to a large degree, driving a car, reading and watching television, enjoyment of all forms of visual beauty. Some of these deprivations can be partially overcome. The loss of sight tends to train a more acute hearing. People will always help the blind in practical ways, and there are many modern aids for the visually handicapped, ranging from braille and books on tape to all kinds of domestic appliances designed for the sightless. Musical appreciation and music making are also open to the blind. Many blind people would grade vision as less important than hearing, since, given help and their own determination, they can live a relatively full life. The obvious drawback to deafness lies in loss of communication, though today there are some marvelous machines which allow the sufferer to learn speech through varied frequencies of vibration. The traditional method of lip-reading supplements this, so that conversation and teaching can be carried out. The social disadvantage of deafness is that of the impatience of others.\nDeafness is not at once obvious and so may be mistaken for stupidity. In the modern world deafness can also be dangerous; traffic-sense, particularly in children, depends largely on hearing. Touch, taste and smell are all sources of pleasure, the two latter being important in the enjoyment of food, but they are all relatively dispensable. Their absence can, however be dangerous; the loss of nerve endings can lead to severe domestic burns and abrasions, while taste and smell can detect lethal gases and poisonous substances.\n\nFrom the human point of view most people would grade the importance of the senses in the order given in the question. This is not necessarily so in the animal world. Smell or scent is of crucial importance to many animals, who rely on it to detect enemies and to find quarry. Thus it becomes far more highly developed than in humans, since survival may depend on it. For the same reason hearing is of nearly the same importance. The hearing range of animals is much wider than that of humans. Dogs can hear supersonic sounds and react to them at great distances. Many animals have very limited vision, simply because vision is relatively unimportant. Touch and taste are also of less importance to animals than to humans, though, as with humans, these two senses, combined with smell, have a protective role in warning them off obnoxious and poisonous organic and inorganic substances.\n\nNobody can ask an animal to grade the importance of the senses, but it seems to be, smell, hearing, sight, touch and taste in that order."

        "content": "Pure science is the investigation of natural phenomena for the purpose of understanding. Observation leads to the formation of theories, which are tested experimentally. If the theory seems to explain to all the phenomena it is classified as a principle and added to the store of existing scientific knowledge. Applied science is known today as technology, which is concerned with techniques. As pure scientific knowledge advances, so does technology or method. Since method depends on knowledge, no improvements in method can increase knowledge, though they can facilitate the increase of knowledge.\nThe historian of pure science can trace its advance from the records of the earliest recorded cultures to the 20th century, during which pure science has made greater advances than ever before.\n\n6th to 7th Centuries B.C. Thales and his school. Pythaggoeras and his successors provided the first systematic method of understanding the natural world, especially in the field of Mathematics and geometry. Figures were constructed to provide proofs. The Egyptians, though less interested in strict accuracy, made their contribution, as did the Arabians and Indians in the field of arithmetical notation.\n\n17th Century. The second upsurge of pure science began with Galileo and his predecessor, Copernicus, who gave the world its first true understanding of the universe. Astronomy and Mathematics were brought together for the purposes of navigation. Francis Bacon sought to produce a system to replace that of Aristotle. The logical approach of Renee Descartes was of great importance, though the greatest advances were made by Sir Isaac Newton, who synthesized many theories into an intelligible whole.\n\nLater advances took place in the field of biology, bacteriology, surgery, anthropology. The names of Pasteur, Lister, Darwin and Harvey come to mind.\n\nIn the present century, atomic theory with all its consequences, was developed (Dalton), and the new theories of light, relativity and quantum mathematics. (Einstein).\n\nAlthough applied science will always remain the handmaid of pure science, it is also true that the advanced machines made possible by higher technology, enable the advance of pure science. Thus, although theory produced the telescope and the microscope as optical research instruments, electronics transformed both. The fact that we can now see into the far universe and into the construction of matter has had a profound effect on the theories concerning both.\n\nAnother example of many is the modern computer. While this remains the servant of the brain which invented it, one of its uses is to make a multitude of instantaneous calculations. This in turn eliminates the laborious mechanical aspects of investigation and gives the researcher the tools for making rapid new discoveries."

        "content": "Answers to this question will vary widely according to the country concerned. For example romantic feature films seem to receive great popular support in India, and their stars are almost national heroes. This may be due to the lack of good, or indeed any television, combined with the instinct to escape from a deprived environment.\nIn the West the film has not been the major entertainment medium for over twenty years. Almost every home contains a television set and much of what is left of the British film industry is concerned with film-making for this medium. Film stars in the old sense no longer exist. The great days of Hollywood ended with the last war. No longer do families make a weekly outing to the cinema. Today there are less than twenty films showing in the West End of London. In the 30s any provincial town could offer more than this. Today most cinemas have long since become Bingo halls.\n\nHowever the film industry, though small, is alive on both sides of the Atlantic, and when a good film is made there is still a following, and an excellent film can still make a lot of money. Another point in its favor is that the quality of television is deteriorating and seems likely to become atrocious when cable television is introduced. There will be even more space for rubbish and repeats.\n\nDuring the past twenty or so years much has changed in the taste of film goers. For one thing the cinema of today is the virtual monopoly of young people, unless a film such as 'Gandhi' with wide general appeal is put on. Deliberate attempts to entertain the teenager have produced many films with the accent on explicit sex and violence, though more recently such productions have moved into the 'video nasty' area. However the government is trying to prevent the sale of such cassettes for use in home television sets.\n\nOne 'clean' though juvenile taste which is fairly new is for space fiction films. 'Star Wars' and 'E.T.' are recent examples of overwhelmingly successful productions. 'The Return of the Jedi' is currently showing in London's West End.\n\nThere is no doubt that current popular taste rejects films which set out to be amusing. The days of 'Doctor in the House', of situation comedies, of films built round 'stand-up' comics such as Arthur Askey, have gone forever. They now form part of the television menu as repeats."

        "content": "Pop music began in 1960, suddenly replacing dance music, jazz and the tuneful lyricists such as Crosby, Sinatra and their imitators.\nPrior to 1960 young people were either adolescents or young adults, but then the 13-19 year group became a new class, the teenagers. They were the fashionable group, and at that time of full employment in the USA and the UK, the group with the spare money, since they had high wages and few outgoings. Thus they became the market for the pop industry.\n\nParental discipline, school rules and wartime restrictions had hitherto kept this age group in place. Now, in 1960 their instinct was to break loose, become totally independent, discard the society which produced them and ignore its social sanctions. They succeeded, aided by two groups of cynical adults; the money-makers and the drug pushers. Left-wing activists provided a third group.\n\nThe music began with 'skiffle'; the drummer, the electric guitar, the vocalist, but this quickly changed to rock n roll, with Elvis Presley as its afficionado, and his titles such as 'Rock around the clock' reaching international heights of popularity among teenagers. The focus became the star rather than the group. In Liverpool a group of four fresh-faced tidy young men with neat hair, began to produce original themes which reflected the innermost feelings of teenagers; calf-love, loneliness, insecurity, 'doing one' own thing', the misunderstanding of the adult world and a few curiously alien themes. 'Beatlemania' swept Britain and many other countries. But the sinister initial letters of 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' suggested the drug scene. The Beatles made millions, but millions more for their promoters. The world knows about the end of Presley, who has now become a cult figure.\n\nThe pop cult grew in the late 60's and early 70's into a major industry. This was the heyday of the top twenty; getting into this ensured rich rewards. Successful single makers cut LPs. Those selling over a million records entered the golden disc bracket; large country houses, Rolls-Royce motor cars, yachts, world-wide travel spread before the eyes of young hopefuls. And because a few made it, everybody tried, whether they really had talent or not. The money, the fame, the adulation proved irresistable.\n\nThe real money was made in the industry associated with the stars. For many years Carnaby Street set teenage clothing fashions, and, although Carnaby Street is no longer the centre, the denim jeans, and T shirt uniform has persisted. Perhaps the biggest money was made by pop concert and festival promoters. From time to time these festivals have caused trouble because of noise, litter, insanitary camp conditions and drug abuse. The problem has abated because of careful police monitoring.\n\nHowever the deepest effect of the pop scene on affluent young society was upon teenage attitudes to life. The establishment, by which is meant regular hours, hard work, morality, a worthwhile job and, in general, a sense of responsibility, was condemned as square. There is no doubt that the pop scene was orchestrated and manipulated by cynical adults, some of whom were villains. It has taken massive youth unemployment in England to destroy the pop market, and while there is still money in it for the few it is no longer possible today to buy an electric guitar and make your fortune in a month.\n\nMusically, pop stars never had the slightest influence in the real world, though in the old days they made more money than the virtuosi.\n\nToday the euphoria has largely gone, and with it the acclaim and the overnight fortunes. Perhaps the twenty years or so of pop fever provided a safely valve for the young who were none the worse for it providing they kept out of drugs and crime, unless one counts the partial deafness which results from long hours in a discotheque."

        "title": "What, if anything, have the great empires of the world achieved?",
        "content": "Self-interest, in some shape or form, has always been the motivation behind empire-building. Its occasion has been the development of military and naval power and in recent times air power, as in the case of Germany under Adolf Hitler, who sought to create an Aryan empire by the invasion of surrounding sovereign states. Its effects are interpreted variously, for obvious reasons. The course of history itself has always had something to say about aggression. Hitler's failure, for example, brought the democratic institutions of Western Europe into focus and laid the foundations of the European Community. The war also broke down social barriers, heightened the social consciences of the Western states, and accelerated the decolonization process of the European empires, especially that of Great Britain. Yet it also began the polarization of East and West, headed by the USSR and the USA respectively, and with the build-up of nuclear arsenals this poses in 1984 an even greater threat than that of Adolf Hitler in 1939.\nSelf-interest needs definition. To consider the great empires of the world we need to look back 4000 years. The earliest empires were necessarily limited geographically. The Phoenecian Empire provides a good example. The seaboard of Libya, centered in the Lebanon, produced a hardy race of seafarers, the Canaanites, who established colonies in Cyprus, Carthage in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Spain. They visited the Scillies and Cornwall and circumnavigated Africa. Yet their real interest was in trade, and they exported cedar to Egypt, furniture, purple cloth and jewelry all over the Middle East, thus enriching much of the known world. Moreover they invented an alphabet which gave rise to both the Greek and Roman alphabets, and through those later empires to the alphabets of most of the European states. Their inscriptions, such as the Moabite Stone and the Siloan Tunnel inscriptions, provided invaluable points of reference in Jewish Biblical history.\n\nThe aggressive instinct, the desire for enrichment by trade, and of course the need for territorial expansion; all are natural, if self-interested motives. An agricultural community with a growing population needs more land; hence, colonization. Following the Phoenicians, The Greeks acquired most of the Mediterranean world, and, following them, the Romans, at the height of Empire, had acquired the whole of the known world including territories as far apart as Britain and the West African coast line. We are used to thinking of the Romans as cruel, oppressive and rapacious, interested mainly in exacting taxes, 'asset stripping' wherever they went.\n\nAll this is true, yet our modern dislike of the empire-concept must not blind us to the immense enrichment conferred, if only as a by-product, on their vassal states.\n\nThe city states of Greece, in the period 750 to 600 B.C., were governed by tyrants, a name meaning 'kings', but whose powers were limited by the essentially Greek concept of democracy, which was the original forerunner of the modern democratic process of the free world today. The Greeks were adventurers, traders and law-givers, and their political contribution to the Mediterranean sea-board and even to France and Egypt, is incalculable. Their trade in wine, oil and scent, wood, metal work and pottery enriched other countries. Their sculpture, and architecture has never since been equaled. Their poetry and drama have remained supreme.\n\nThe extent and duration of the Roman Empire were of course much greater. Their positive contribution to the lives of vassal states covered the whole political, legal and cultural spectrum. Roman law provided the foundation of much modern law. They also enriched the known world in the spheres of art, architecture, law, town-planning, wall painting, and civic building.\n\nNo empire lasts forever. The dissolution of even the British Empire is now virtually complete. In a world where, because of modern travel, instant communication, and the heightened concept of sovereignty of states both large and small, it is right that this should be so.\n\nMany people see the only hope for the future in a one-world concept, in which aggression is outlawed and mutual respect and co-operation fostered for the common good. The West is concerned to trade rather than to exploit, to lend money rather than exact it.\n\nThe French and Portuguese concepts of empire were, of course, doomed to failure in the modern world, basically because those countries tried to keep the concept of colonization as an extension of the home country, ultimately ruled by the central government. The post-war wind of change brought about an irony in the case of the British Empire. Government had long since devolved to the great dominions, and even the very least of the overseas possessions were encouraged to develop their own governments. Yet the worldwide process overtook the gradual process of emancipation and, as post war history has shown, with disastrous results in many cases."

        "content": "Many capital cities were founded centuries, if not millennia ago, so it is often not possible to do more than deduce the reasons for the choice of their locations. Most, though not all of these, reasons are geographical. Before the arrival of modern communications and transport, any large settlement required a location which satisfied certain requirements.\nFirstly, an area of fertile land capable of supporting a growing population. The growth of Cairo at the base of the Nile delta provides an example.\n\nSecondly the area must lend itself to the spread of housing, and the erection of public buildings. Thirdly it must be near a good water supply such as a large river, though built above flood level. Fourthly it must be well away from the earthquake belts and volcanoes. Fifthly it must be defensible against enemies. Most large cities and capitals were originally walled, though possible attack from long range artillery, from the air, and nowadays perhaps from nuclear weapons, has rendered all capitals equally vulnerable.\n\nCapitals must have been located with these basic requirements in mind, though the origins of older ones are lost in tradition and folklore. London consisted of British settlements in pre-Roman times in a very defensible position which is now the city, the inner square mile. The Thames, England's largest river, not only communicates with the centre of the country but also provides deep water moorings for seagoing vessels.\n\nMore often than not, capital city locations were chosen at or near river-mouths for these reasons, with facilities for trade, both inland and overseas, very much in mind. South America contains a host of examples; Caracus, Venezuela, George Town, Guyana, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Santiago, Chile which is inland but has easy access to Valparaiso, which is on the coast; Lima near the Peruvian coast; Bogota, Colombia. To these could be added Johore Bahru, whence inland products were exported; rubber, tin, copra and pineapples. In a country covered by impenetrable rain forests and mountain ranges, rivers provide the only means of communication, both for trade and for political purposes.\n\nAnother factor rendering the seaboard popular was that of convenience to those countries which sought to colonize overseas. Conversely, some capitals became established because of foreign colonization. The U.S.A. is a case in point. Washington, the federal capital since 1800 was laid out by Pierre L'Enfant, a French engineer officer, who designed the city specifically as the center of government in 1790. He located it on the Potomac River, inland from Chesapeake Bay on the East Coast, as might be expected.\n\nThere are at least three examples of changes of capital city, made for political reasons. Peking was the capital of China from the 10th Century, the time of the Liao Dynasty. Later the seat of government moved to Nanking, but from 1421 it again became Peking. From 1928 to 1949 the capital was again Nanking and again reverted. Both Peking and Nanking which lies south of it, have easy access to the Eastern seaboard. The same thing happened in Soviet Russia. From the 14th century to the present day Moscow was the centre, excluding the period 1709 to 1918, when St. Petersburg, later Leningrad, then Stalingrad held that destination. The reason for the original choice of Moscow was that it was the gateway to the West; it was sheltered by a range of hills; it was built defensively; it satisfied all geographical conditions; it was the center of intersecting trade routes. The choice of St Petersburg was more political because although it is strategic for the Gulf of Finland and for Lake Ladoga, it nevertheless has a terrible climate and is icebound for much of the year. The fact however was that St Petersburg was the center for all revolutionary activity between 1815 and 1914. Also it is very defensible. The Germans never succeeded in entering it in the Second World War during four years of siege.\n\nIn 1960, Brazil dropped Rio de Janiero as its capital and moved inland to the newly-planned city of Brasilia, because it was felt that this would bring life to the interior. One hears that Nigeria is even now considering dropping Lagos as the capital in favor of a new town inland, though the reasons for this change are unclear.\n\nApart from geographical considerations, trade certainly affected the growth of Cairo from its early beginnings in 641 A.D. as the capital, not only of Egypt, but today of the Arab world. It has become the trading and distributive center for North Africa and the Near East.\n\nMany of the foregoing factors also apply to the building up of Bombay. Originally an island off the mid-west coast of India it is now joined to the mainland by means of reclaimed land. Its great harbor and westward facing position made it the obvious choice by the Moguls in the 13th century, who were followed by the Portuguese and in 1662 by the British."

        "title": "Consider how the transport system in your country might he improved.",
        "content": "All services are capable of improvement, even the transport services of Western Europe and other western countries, where rail, road and air transport have long been established, and where there are few, if any, obstacles to the establishment of physical communications. It is a more basic problem for the emergent countries, where often mountain ranges and dense afforestation have to be overcome. In this essay the problems of England are considered.\n\nRailways began to spread over England from about 1800, and until 1945 there existed a network which gave easy access from even the smallest village to all the main centers. Since then the system has deteriorated out of all recognition, for a variety of reasons but basically because England's constantly growing road network has shifted both passenger and goods transport away from the railways. In consequence almost all small lines have been closed down, and basically what is left is the inter-city network and London's commuter service from the home counties. Speed has improved with the adoption of the diesel motor but the experimental high-speed trains have proved a fiasco. As in most other western countries after the war the system became nationalized. High wage demands, lack of money for capital expenditure, and the general indifference of nationally unreliable, and generally unpopular, although we are constantly told that this is the age of the train, by Jimmy Savile. He is wrong. The 'age of the train' ended in 1954. Moreover British Rail makes massive annual losses, as indeed do most other European countries. Only a reversion to private ownership, as in the days of the rail system comfortable, economic and cared-for, and this is unlikely to happen. The present government is merely selling off minor assets, such as railway hotels and in some cases catering on railway platforms and in dining cars.\nThe Socialist doctrine affirms that as a national service British Rail should not expect to make a profit or break even and should be subsidized by the tax payer. The Thatcher Government sees this as bad housekeeping despite the fact that most European rail systems are already heavily subsidized. About half the population probably accepts that competitiveness is the only real way forward.\n\nGoods transport has largely moved over to the heavy, container-type lorry. In turn this involves the provision of suitable roads, and the road building program is severely limited by finance. The environmental lobby rightly complains about the damage done by these vehicles, especially in small villages, about the danger of pollution, about traffic jams, and about the loss of agricultural land where M roads are built. These drawbacks can and must be overcome by the provision of by-pass and further M roads. The London outer circle M 25, when completed, will remove heavy through traffic from the streets of London. Small vehicles and private cars, owned nowadays by over half of the population will also be able to move about more freely, and parking problems which at present bedevil all large towns and cities will be alleviated.\n\nIn a small country like England, internal air travel is of importance primarily to business people and nowadays all major cities have their own airports. London will eventually have five. Since there is ample private competition for British Airways, that organization, which of course operates a world-wide network, is efficient. The inefficiency is on the ground. It can take longer to reach Heath Row and pass through customs and baggage formalities than it takes to fly to Paris of Dusseldorf.\n\nRivers and canals must not be overlooked. There is a valuable move, backed by the environmentalists, to restore the waterways, not only as a means of commercial transport but also for tourism. This involves both bank-clearing and the enforcement of anti-pollution laws. The River Thames now contains a wide variety of fish whereas for over a century it contained none. Unfortunately it is little used for commercial purposes, though progress is being made on all fronts.\n\nMany of the transport problems in England, though not all, have stemmed from bad government theory and bad industrial relations in the past. Part of the problem has been a steady shift of population originally from country to town, and now the reverse. The task of promoting comfort, safety, economic cost, speed and reliability is not easy, but is being tackled."

        "title": "Scientists are the explorers of today.' Discuss.",
        "content": "Exploration in the commonly accepted sense began with people like the sea-faring Columbus when, in the middle ages it was realized that the earth is a globe, not flat. It held a crucial role for centuries in colonization and trade expansion. In the 19th century startling results were achieved by wealthy and gifted amateurs. However quite early in this century virtually the whole of the earth's surface had been mapped in outline, and most of it surveyed by explorers on foot. The process has more recently been completed by the use of the aircraft and the helicopter. Attention is now concentrated on underground and undersea exploration and in recent years on space exploration.\nBefore the First World War the international attitude towards exploration was competitive, as in the case of space exploration today, the USA. and USSR constantly trying to surpass each others achievements. After the first war the attitude was more co-operative. An international council of scientific unions was set up, its role being assumed by UNESCO after the Second World War. This organization co-ordinates results end supplies a limited amount of cash. This work culminated in the International Geophysical Year, 1957, in which 70 nations participated, producing a systematic study of the earth end the environment. A stop was put on territorial claims in Antarctica. The solid earth was examined scientifically by means of a series of deep probes, but since deep drilling is increasingly expensive, a stop was eventually put on this method.\n\nSince only 30% of the earth's surface is above sea level end only 10% habitable, attention has naturally been diverted to underground end undersea exploration for human reasons. It is necessary to drill for minerals, for fuel end for water in order to plan new facilities. Although modern exploration is largely pragmatic, the scientific aspect provides most interest, e.g. the work of the Upper Manke Committee. All observations are naturally indirect. They are based on drilling into the earth's crust where it is known to be most shallow in order to find out its physical properties. In the process of drilling more is discovered about an area's liability to earthquakes, its underground radioactive end magnetic values etc. The USA. pioneered this venture, end a drill of 35,000 feet was aimed at. Since it proved so expensive US Project Mohole was abandoned in 1967. Seismic methods are used for the discovery of oil end gas deposits and today there are airborne devices for detecting minerals such as oil end gas. These operate by detecting slight changes in the earth's magnetic field. There is also a scanning infra-red sensor of greet use in geo-chemical exploration.\n\nUndersea exploration is of equal, if not greater importance since its results have led to immense discoveries. Offshore oil end gas rigs now proliferate. However, much underwater work is a matter of scientific surveying. Sound echoing devices now enable scientists to map the ocean bed accurately end to discover far more about the seabed under the polar icecaps. Deep-see drilling produces core samples which provide useful information. Today the work is co-ordinated by a consortium of oceanographic institutes.\n\nIf space exploration is to be included then obviously science plays the dominate role in all ventures. The earth is now surrounded by hundreds of orbited satellites which provide various kinds of information, from weather reports to international communications. Many are in orbit for purely scientific reasons. They measure natural phenomena in space, solar end cosmic radiation, magnetic fields. They assist in technical observation of stars and lead to an understanding of the evolution of the solar system. There are also lunar end inter-planetary programs which further extend human knowledge. The manned projects must partly depend on the scientific know-how of the space explorer himself.\n\nHas modern exploration lost glamour and the old dependence on self-reliance? Partly; but human nature being what it is, outward-bound ventures in relatively unknown areas of the earth's surface will always persist."

        "title": "What Scientific knowledge should an educated person have?",
        "content": "The answer depends on one's definition of education, end there is no single definition. In the widest sense even the most primitive societies begin to prepare children for living from birth as a necessity for survival So do animals and birds. Formal education is based on literacy, in both East and West, that of China dating back to 165 B.C. when civil service examinations were instituted. Today one school of thought would define education as the means of living a civilized life, which in turn depends on the acquisition of culture. Culture implies a knowledge of the graceful and artistic things of life, and in Europe at any rate depends on no more than a knowledge of Greek and Latin, modern European languages being merely an optional extra. Many well-known schools in the West still lay a powerful emphasis on the classical languages as the best means of teaching the young to think properly.\nThe problem with the first paragraph is that society does not consist of wealthy dilettantes. Some knowledge of science is essential to us all because the march of scientific discovery largely dictates modern living both personal and social. There are, of course, still pockets of privilege everywhere in which the rich can take advantage of the knowledge, skill and hard work of others, but today most countries are essentially meritocracies. If the purpose of education is to succeed in life as well as to enjoy it, some knowledge of science, however superficial, is essential. Nowadays in the free world, the opportunity to gain specialized education in order to succeed is regarded as a basic human right.\n\n'Ars pro arte' is no longer a valid concept. We live in a scientific world. We cannot be safe in a modern home without a basic understanding of electricity. Children must be shielded from dangerous drugs. We need to know basic arithmetic if we are to deal with money, banking, even family economics. We need to know a little chemistry and biology if we are to remain healthy and fit.\n\nHowever the topic question implies much more than this, especially for the young person today. In a world which daily grows less remote and more interdependent due to satellite communications, jet travel and the ubiquitous computer, boys and girls should receive instruction in them all and be encouraged to specialize in one of these subjects, because job opportunities are increasingly dependent on subjects such as electronics and computer science. In Europe the emphasis has already shifted away from the heavy engineering and artisan industries. Coalminers, steel-workers and ship-builders are the dinosaurs of 1984. The growth industries of today depend completely on scientific specialization.\n\nEarly Chinese education included the martial arts, necessary accomplishments for those above peasant status. Modern martial arts certainly have not destroyed the need for personal bravery in the soldier but effective military action today depends more on the technology which a country can buy, and on the specialized knowledge required for the use of the modern weapons of sea, land and air. The basis of any increase in a country's gross national product is trade. Today the marketing of sophisticated goods abroad is a main growth industry. You cannot begin to work in this field without at least a reasonable knowledge of the goods you are promoting. Neither, if you are a politician can you even understand many of the issues dealt with in government without a degree of specialized knowledge in those fields.\n\nToday the emphasis has shifted from pure to applied science. It might be argued that men like Archimedes, Isaac Newton and Einstein were among the most educated people who ever lived. The frontiers which they established are still being pushed back. Yet modern interest lies less in discovering new laws than in the development of the old ones; modern education, for the majority, implies specialization in an established field.\n\nWill science finally eliminate the divisive elements in human nature by encouraging understanding and co-operation, for this is surely one of the aims of educations ? So far there are few signs that it will. The truth seems to be that science has its own momentum, and the most that can be said is that the educated person should at least know what is going on in the world.\n\nA knowledge of science is necessary if humanity is to be in a position to resist some of its worse results. Among these may be included nuclear and chemical warfare, and some of the frightening developments in genetic engineering. Science is neutral. Everything depends on its use or misuse. It neither explains nor contradicts religion. It is man's servant, not its master."

        "title": "What do you understand by 'fashion' and why does fashion change?",
        "content": "The word 'fashion' is generally used to mean style in clothing, 'style' meaning what is popularly accepted, admired or regarded as exclusive i.e. not available to the majority either because they lack the taste or the money to follow it.\nHowever fashion applies to many other things than dress and hair-styles e.g. house, building and the general design of most consumer-goods ranging from cars to kitchen appliances. The word also applies to customs, personal manners and standards of moral behavior. It certainly covers forms of speech, use of words and accents within a language.\n\nAll these things change from time to time, sometimes abruptly. Sometimes a form of dress, a phrase, or a custom may drop out of fashion but then come back for no obvious reason. However, the reason for change is usually apparent.\n\nIn the West post-war clothing fashions have been the subject of change because of the higher standard of living enjoyed in most European countries. Take England as an example. In pre-war days high fashion was the monopoly of the wealthy or well-to-do woman. If a woman works to a tight budget she will have to buy clothes and shoes for warmth and durability rather than appearance. During the war clothes for both sexes were rationed anyway, on a coupon system. This austerity, followed by post-war full employment, for women as well as men, started the fashion ball rolling.\n\nMen's fashions have always remained relatively static, variations in suits and shoes remaining fairly minor. However the freedoms of the 1960's moved young men into a much more informal style of dress, which reflected their casual attitudes, behavior and morality. The tee-shirt and denim jeans became almost statutory for the young of both sexes. Recently there has been slight return to formal dress, although the hat has, for no apparent reason, become the symbol of the elderly men, and, for most occasions, women too.\n\nReturning to women's fashions. A third reason for the constant changes lies in 'haute couture' as big business. At one time a new and exclusively styled garment from a couturier in Paris was sold only to the rich. The same garment today is only exclusive in its label, though a few models are sold to the rich as one-offs. The real business lies in the sale of the model to the mass-producing firms which bring new styles to the big stores in the High Street. Thus the shop-girl can wear the same style in clothes and shoes as Princess Diana. A fourth reason for change is that women like change for its own sake. They prefer two or three different outfits to one, in the course of a year. Mass-produced fashion clothes and shoes are therefore not made to last. They become 'disposables.'\n\nAnother reason for changes in customs, manners and morals, lies in subtle changes in ideas and outlooks. The Butch appearance of some western women reflects feminism, as does the look-alike garb affected by some couples. For men or women to live together in a homosexual relationship, so far from causing ostracism, is now accepted as fashionable in some quarters. Some men no longer open doors for women, stand when they enter a room or give up their seats in a railway carriage. Many women regard this once accepted behavior as male chauvinism.\n\nOther changes in fashion occur because of the power of propaganda, advertising and political pressure groups. The anti-smoking lobby has largely succeeded in keeping all public places smoke-free. The lobby has considerable backing from the medical profession.\n\nThe term 'fashion' applies also to the written and the spoken word; B.B.C. English, spoken in an 'Oxbridge' accent was used exclusively by newsreaders and public speakers until the 60s. In that decade local accents became more fashionable, due partly to the prominence given to pop-groups, especially if they came from Liverpool, such as the 'Beatles' or from the Midlands or the North. Changes in accent and expression have greatly affected both the theatre and the television play; subject matter is also very different today. The term 'kitchen-sink drama' sums up the process. Novels have also undergone fundamental changes in fashion, partly because of travel and partly because of a shift in political interest. Today best-selling novels are usually spy-thrillers or books which deal with contemporary subjects such as aircraft, banking, electronics or industrial espionage; others result from a new and sometimes sentimental review of England's past glories, her old wartime achievements, her social and industrial progress in Victorian and Edwardian days and her colonial power up to 1939."

        "title": "Discuss the various methods of advertising and their effectiveness.",
        "content": "It pays to advertise. The old adage remains true in principle because advertising not only sells goods but also creates the demand for new lines. The home computer is a modern example. The half a dozen big producers go in for highly competitive advertising, some of it aimed at children. They can play games, educate themselves, prepare themselves for modern living. All this can be done with books and paper, but parents are pressurized into buying computers, never-the-less, the sop to their consciences being that they can use the computer for family accounts. Of course they can. Equally they could do their family accounts once a month on the back of an old envelope.\nAdvertising sells goods and services, otherwise it would not exist, and the development of advertising in the West dates back at least three centuries, coinciding roughly with the publication of early journals such as The London Gazette, Tatler and Spectator in England, the circulation of which was largely limited to London and one or two large provincial cities. So advertising began on a local basis, because wherever you create a demand you must be able to meet it. So various factors combined to create national and international advertising; mass-production, based in the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, rail communication and transport, the development of printing, especially color printing, and the freighter for overseas markets. For as long as most people can remember advertising has been seen wherever the public go; on walls, shop fronts and hoardings, in railway stations and the underground, on streamers trailing behind light aircraft, from static balloons, on trains, buses and business vehicles, taxis and container lorries. With the advent of color-television, the commercial break has assumed primary importance. Some commercial radio channels still carry advertising. Handbills, advertising local firms, flood through the letter-boxes. Junk mail, addressed to computerized lists of likely buyers, fills the waste paper baskets.\n\nFrom this will be seen that overkill is one drawback to the effectiveness of modern advertising. People get fed-up if they are over-pressurized, especially intelligent people. The hard sell becomes counter-productive. Yet the fact that it continues argues that this kind of advertising is financially justified.\n\nAdvertising is therefore big business, and the world's capitals, outside the Eastern bloc, offer scope to advertising firms with their highly specially areas of expertise. Such firms employ some of the best ideas people, graphic artists, promotional experts, and film producers and technicians.\n\nThe effectiveness of advertising depends on the assessment of the consumer's motivation in buying, and a direct or indirect appeal to that motivation; sometimes the creation of that motivation, by an appeal to a range of human instincts. Where there is poverty in a potential market the only effective appeal is based on cheapness, reliability and effectiveness in a product. In a mixed or affluent community the field is wide open. Most Western advertising works in a competitive market where the variety of brands is matched by the consumer's power of choice.\n\nThe soft sell works best when appealing to the very rich, and usually price is not mentioned. A country house with a hundred acres of land is offered as a 'modest gentleman's residence, the Rolls Royce is merely described as the best car in the world. Everybody knows that a small group of products are the best in their fields, so advertising merely keeps them in the public eye. 'Apeing the celebrity' is another line of attack; if a famous heavy-weight uses a particular deodorant, or a great actress a particular shampoo, good sales result. Another successful line with a shampoo is that it works, implying that the others don't. In contrast sexy lingerie ads are self-defeating. They bore women and men don't usually buy lingerie. Yet sex can sell chocolates. If a stunt-man goes through the hoops to bring his beautiful girl-friend the brand of her choice he will take the easier way of buying them in the supermarket and she may begin to fantasize about the bringer. The appeal to snobbery still works. Because those bright, successful, affluent Jones next door buy certain brand names, the failed, boring economical neighbors must do likewise. Comic ads amuse some, repel others, but in either case people keep the brand name in mind, if only never to buy it.\n\nMost countries today have a statutory body which seeks to deep advertising up to a certain basic standards; ads must be morally decent, truthful and legal. However there are countless ways of disobeying the spirit if not the letter of the law. Subliminal advertising has rightly been banned. The advertising of foodstuffs has been improved by 'sold by' and statements of contents."

        "title": "What priorities would you set for government expenditure and why?",
        "content": "These priorities will vary enormously according to the circumstances and the state of development of the country concerned. Assuming that the country is politically independent, but that a reasonable level of defense has to be kept for the sake of parity with potentially hostile neighbors, a large slice of the national cake is already accounted for in terms of defense salaries and equipment. Could that slice be reduced in size. In terms both of nuclear and conventional arms, the current unfreezing of relations between East and West is partly based on internal pressures for economies in favor of more positive priorities.\nSimilarly, all countries have labor-intensive annual commitments where the main services are nationally funded or subsidized; the civil service, the police and customs forces, the health service, education, roads, railways and airlines. All have the potential for rationalization, perhaps privatization, with consequent economies.\n\nBasic policy must therefore be considered. If a country follows the socialist line, then all these, and many others, including housing and a comprehensive social security system, are the government's responsibility. If not, as many as possible of these services will be hived off to the private sector. For the purposes of this essay, let us assume that the country concerned is democratic, and that it encourages free enterprise, self-help and a business-like efficiency, and that it means to hold its own in the modern world.\n\nTo do so, it will need to achieve the following; economic development and the full exploitation of natural resources; a favorable balance of trade with, consequently, a strong currency; high interest rates if overseas money is to be attracted but if possible without prejudice to exports; the reduction or abolition of inflation implying some kind of wages policy in both public and private sectors, together with legislative control over the power of the trades unions. Given such an ideal and promising situation, we can now look at the national cake.\n\nAny government's financial leeway consists of revenue less unavoidable expenditure, and both can he regulated within certain limits. Income normally comes from direct and indirect taxation, such as value added tax or purchase tax. Taxation covers personal income, business, profits made on resource exploitation, and of course levies on consumer durables and perishables among other areas. The total net income can be raised or lowered at the will of government, although such changes are usually marginal. In a democracy, wild changes may lead to the overthrow of government. Also, such changes have to be made with a strict eye to inflation, which cancels out improvements. Thirdly, any great increase in borrowing erodes stability.\n\nAny chancellor will regard his expendable surplus as a cake to be divided into slices, after setting aside funds to service and reduce national debts. It will then be for the cabinet to press claims for the various departments represented, until agreement or compromise has been reached. So a budget is reached.\n\nThe press and the public may well have set their own priorities. Pressure groups will have drawn attention to social defects, and the opposition will certainly have done so.\n\nLet us take an imaginary country which fulfils all the above conditions. The chancellor has a usable surplus of $2 billion. It has been decided that the country's outstanding short-term needs lie in the categories of housing, roads and railways, health, education, sport and the arts. The long-term needs include the modernization of the Armed Forces equipment, the exploitation of natural resources, and the establishment of centers for research and development, science and technology. At the risk of becoming unpopular the chancellor will have to balance these conflicting claims.\n\nHe selects the following short-term priorities; housing, health and education, and out of the long-term needs, the exploitation of natural resources. Roads, railways, sports and the arts will simply be maintained at the old levels, allowing for inflation. The sooner natural resources are developed the better, because this will guarantee greatly increased revenue.\n\nA labor-intensive re-housing program will help to bring down unemployment. He allocates $330 million. Equal sums are allocated to the establishment of a subsidized health service, which he hopes will ultimately become non-contributory, and to the improvement of the national education service, to be shared from primary to university level. And since his hopes for a larger national cake in the future depend on resource exploitation, $1 billion must be allocated to that purpose."

        "title": "All history books are biased. Do you support this view?",
        "content": "This sounds a very sweeping statement. Nevertheless, there is much truth in it. The bias is not always deliberate. Every writer owes much to his or her background and to the national climate of opinion.\nThe important thing about the writing of history is that it should not only be factual but that it should include all the facts. For example, it would be wrong to write about the French Revolution without dealing with what led up to it, the glaring differences in living standards between aristocrat and peasant, the inequity of the law, the callousness of the rich and the rational philosophy of human equality and human rights spelled out by Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Otherwise the account would read simply as a record of brutal and indiscriminate violence on the part of the Paris mob.\n\nThe best of historical writing therefore includes all the facts, objectively presented, leaving the reader to draw personal conclusions. The problem of this kind of writing is dullness, where personal opinion or interpretation is rigorously excluded.\n\nNobody, either writer or reader, is totally without a political stance. One writer dealing with a popular revolution will castigate a mob for violence, greed and looting, condemning the murders which lead to the overthrow of a stable government. Another, dealing with the same revolution, will put all the blame on the government for its autocratic and heartless attitude to the people, and argue that the ugly features of revolution are necessary if full democratic control of government is to pass into the hands of the people.\n\nIf some historians tend to write, however objectively, from the national point of view, others tend to adopt the one-world stance, which is basically left-wing. This stance favors aggression by the oppressed and is invariably censorious about colonialism. It is also pacifist insofar as the established powers are concerned, although vague about the consequences of total non-aggression in all circumstances. The one-world view also tends to be selective in the presentation of facts, eliminating those which conflict with it's overall moral outlook. For example there is no mention of social and material progress or of the Pax Britannica in certain modern accounts of British colonialism.\n\nMuch the same applies to domestic history. While it is true that the old-fashioned historian concentrated on power bases, monarchs and political leaders, perhaps excessively, some modern historians see history simply in terms of the upward struggle of the poor, writing only about violence against the class struggle and against the trades union movement.\n\nMore recently, the writing of history in some countries has been debased out of all recognition. This happens when an oppressive government decides to brainwash its people into continued subservience. The technique is to suppress all the truth of the past and rewrite only the material which fits in with government policy. Such travesties are forcibly imposed on schools, while objectively-written history books are withdrawn from schools and libraries."

        "title": "Should one aim of education be the development of talent in such fields as music, art, drama?",
        "content": "It is only a tiny minority who are born without a talent in one direction or another. Even these people are usually employable. It seems logical, in general, that one aim of education should be to develop latent ability, whatever that ability may be.\nHowever, the pressure from educational theorists today is to concentrate teaching on preparation for employment. Parents, also, feel that the priority for their children is to become equipped to earn a good living. Governments urge concentration on certain subjects, so that a pool of labor can be formed which can move easily into specialized training. These essential subjects include English, or another international language, since these languages possess technical vocabularies and also equip young people to travel overseas in the course of their work. The other favored subjects arc mathematics, the sciences, the use of computers and other office machinery, engineering, and general handwork. Given proficiency in some or all of there, it is a short step to useful employment. Modern job opportunities lie in the fields of the service industries, i.e. banking, insurance and stockbroking, technology and the manufacture of sophisticated products, research and development and computers. Governments see these occupations as essential to national wealth creation, and therefore crucial to the general improvement of the national standard of living.\n\nThere will always he young people more interested in the arts than in the sciences. The arts are usually bracketed under the general heading 'liberal studies'; they include history, languages and literature, philosophy, politics and economics, social and environmental studies. Some require exact knowledge and serious study, while others are 'soft options'. In any real sense they are totally unproductive, and modern education has spawned a brood of these non-subjects. It is small wonder that both governments and parents discourage some of them nowadays. We live in a real world. Yet the reverse of this coin is the necessary enrichment of the culture of all countries in successive generations. What is material success if there is nothing to engage the artistic side of our nature in our spare time?\n\nPerhaps the greatest concept of education originates in the European cultural renaissance in Italy, and dates back to the late Middle Ages. It is the development of the whole person. Perhaps the modern version of 'mens sana in corpore sano', a 'healthy body in a healthy mind', still has its place. So even attention to sports training is justifiable.\n\nSo music, art and drama must all have their place in the curriculum, even if this is not a prime place. Every country has its own artistic heritage, and it would be tragic if that heritage were lost through neglect. Yet this is not merely a matter of conservation. Artistic pursuits have now become international and offer brilliant careers to gifted young people of every country. It is clear that those with this kind of talent should be encouraged."

        "title": "What types of fiction do you enjoy reading and why?",
        "content": "The reading of fiction is escapism, but not in any bad sense. To read is more positive than to watch television, because the visual nature of TV limits the imagination. Reading also excels radio listening, partly because the listener has no choice in the programs, and partly because the quality of radio programs is so uneven. There is a world of fiction available to occupy the reader's spare time, so much so that he or she can be ultra-selective in following personal taste. It is perhaps true to say that a good library is one of the finest assets a community can possess. Failing a library, paperbacks are usually available.\nReading opens windows on the world, whether past or present, and most people enjoy looking through these windows. Robert Graves' novels I, Claudius and Claudius the god reveal the Imperial Roman Empire, just as his Goodbye to all that reveals the horrors of the First World War. It may be this quality which distinguishes great from mediocre fiction. Tolstoy's War and Peace reveal the Napoleonic struggle, whereas Jane Austen's Persuasion being a study of the mannered relationships of early 18th century English country gentry merely gives the Napoleonic Wars a mention. So are we looking for people's reactions to a great sweep of national events, the sort we find in Pasternak's Dr Zhivago, with it's comments on the Russian system, or are we looking for an encapsulated set of personal relationships? Perhaps, from time to time, we enjoy both.\n\nOur choice of fiction also depends on mood. Perhaps, after a hard day in the office, we need to read something out of this world. What about Mr. Clarke's space fiction? Or perhaps it is something light and amusing. There is a whole world of this kind of fiction. Again, tastes vary. For this writer, the Atlantic Ocean is a great divide as far as humor is concerned, just as the Australian reader would see nothing funny in an English novel which I think hilarious. This argues that humor has to be related to a known background. The Englishman laughs at the James Herriott stories, because the adventures of this veterinary surgeon relate exclusively to provincial English characters. The American would be puzzled. However, a gifted raconteur like David Niven sells equally well on both sides of the pond. In The moon's a balloon and Go slowly, come back quickly, he pins down the foibles of both nations, to the delight of both, because he has spent much of his working life in Hollywood, and has absorbed both backgrounds.\n\nMost people enjoy a good thriller, and some, horror stories. Edgar Allan Poe's short stories set the horror trend. He was followed by a host of others, notably Dennis Wheatley, and more latterly by people like Blatty, who wrote the terrifying novel The Exorcist. The real trend, however, is for the good whodunnit, because the acts of violence are no more than pegs on which to hang intellectual solutions. Violence is never dwelt on for its own sake. This is the popular Agatha Christie genre, followed by dozens of other writers, some highly gifted, such as Georges Simenon.\n\nThere are, among many others, three genres which in the 20th century have had a great following. The outward-bound adventure thriller, represented by Alistair MacLean and Hammond Innes; the spectrum of spy mysteries, based on the machinations of MI6, the KGB and the CIA, John LeCarre being a very able exponent, and a whole group of modern novels based on carefully-researched subjects such as airports, hotels and banks.\n\nThis short essay does not mention the Classics, perhaps because the student may associate them too closely with examinations. However, they are still read for pleasure, and one should not forget that they were the popular literature of their day, and were often denied the literary status conferred on them by subsequent generations."

        "title": "Which is the more important, to cure disease or to prevent it ?",
        "content": "The answer depends on the standpoint of the individual. Should he or she contract a disease, then prevention is too late. The only thing left is, hopefully, a cure. However, a minister of health may take a different view. In any country he will need to decide on the allocation of his budget, and this in turn will depend on the priorities obtaining in that country. The main priority may be prevention. This will require expenditure in fields other than medicine; these are public works, nutrition and health education. Other ministries will therefore be involved. In the long run there is little doubt that the prevention of disease is of higher priority than finding cures.\nThis is particularly true in countries where people become the victims of epidemics, or where certain diseases are endemic. In certain tropical countries, malaria is endemic. The effects of it can be suppressed by drugs and its source, the anopheles mosquito, has long been known. However without strict public health regulations, e.g. avoiding standing water, and using mosquito nets in the wet season, malaria will persist, although the mosquito can be destroyed by spraying. Meanwhile a course of drugs will build up the body's resistance. Suppression and prevention will ultimately lead to a natural cure.\n\nDiscovery of the cause of any disease is crucial. Up to the 17th century England was ravaged by a series of bubonic plagues which killed off people by the thousand, especially in London. The old theory was that the plague was caused by the stench of rotting refuse. In fact, it came from rat fleas, which infected humans. The prevention procedures was to destroy the rats, which in turn meant providing London with proper drainage, and also to educate people in public hygiene. The plague was eradicated by preventive methods, in a period when finding an actual cure was medically impossible.\n\nThe most important preventive measure against disease is inoculation. The means is to vaccinate with enough of the virus concerned to achieve immunity to the actual disease. Certain diseases, some fatal, have now disappeared from the Western world as a result; immunity from poliomyelitis, yellow fever, tetanus, typhoid fever and some forms of influenza can now be achieved by injection. In the case of childish and non-fatal complaints, it is sometimes thought best to accept them, because where a child's bodily health is generally good a natural immunity results. In adults, jaundice and hepatitis are far more dangerous, although nowadays haematology saves many lives.\n\nOther preventative measures include eliminating the cause of disease from the environment; e.g. measures to prevent the inhalation of coal dust in the mining industry, and the rejection of asbestos from the building trade. Where the quality of water is suspect, boiling achieves a general level of safety. The strengthening of bodily defenses against disease is of strategic importance. This necessitates a balanced diet, reasonable exercise, warmth in cold climates, good sleep, and favorable housing and working conditions. When a disease has been caught, measures to control it include the use of modern drugs, X-ray therapy in the case of cancer, and at times, surgery.\n\nWhat is disease? It is the invasion of the body by outside agents, bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins or radiation. It can also result from changes in the body and from physical malfunctioning, or from failure to adapt to environmental change. Changes in diet and the invasion of microorganisms can also contribute. In general, people have a built-in immunity to these invasions, though not always.\n\nUnfortunately it seems that as fast as one disease is eliminated another seems to take its place. This applies less to infectious and contagious disease than to contraction by individuals, though not always. A greatly feared recent illness is AIDS, of which the origin is at present unknown, though its means of spread has become clear. So far, this scourge, which is becoming endemic in certain parts of Africa, is incurable. It can be contained by prophylaxis and avoided altogether by avoiding sexual promiscuity. The prevention of' its spread is essential. Its cure remains uncertain.\n\nMeanwhile there is no means of preventing or curing either the common cold or the various kinds of rheumatic and arthritic complaints. All of them can be lived with if drug suppressants are used, but the facts illustrate the patchy nature of medical advances. The same may be said about cancer. There are treatments, but so far no cure. There are preventive measures, such as not smoking, to avoid lung cancer, although the stated connection between smoking tobacco and lung cancer is opinion and propaganda rather than demonstrable fact.\nCertain addictions, including drug addiction, may be classified as disease. In no case is there a cure for the condition. Prevention by abstention is all-important.\n\nDramatic advances in bodily organ replacement. e.g. heart, lung and kidney surgery, now give new hope to many sufferers. Cure by skilled surgery may be the only option, since there are no medical treatments. Neither are there any preventative measures.\n\nThese examples and others can be cited to prove the topic-statement either way, but if one has to generalize for the long term, the balance may he on the side of prevention. However much of the latter remains empirical while the actual causes of serious diseases remain unknown."

        "title": "Do you agree that the primary purpose of the Arts, whether music, painting, drama or literature, is to entertain?",
        "content": "As Professor Joad used to say, it all depends what you mean by entertain. If the word means make one laugh, then there is obviously more to the Arts than that. Of course, we do laugh at comic songs, as in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, at wit and topical comment in newspaper cartoons, at farce on the stage, and at the likes of P G Wodehouse and Mark Twain in novels, and why not? The dictionary gives a wide definition of entertain -- to amuse, to occupy pleasurably. People obtain pleasure from many things, and so yes is the logical answer to the question.\nThe intelligentsia would answer no, in any country. Many seem to think that the theatre exists to make political points, or to make us think about some social problem, or to express the prejudices of the author. Of course serious writing, of whatever kind, should be free to deal with serious subjects; music and painting are seen as vehicles of getting across some message or other. Yet it is a strange co-incidence that without heavy subsidies from the state or some business source, intellectual Art in general could not exist. Where there is an attempt to give pleasure rather than to instruct, the public is far more likely to be prepared to pay to support the Arts.\n\nIn its early days, the British Broadcasting Corporation defined the object of sound, and later, television broadcasting as being to entertain, inform and educate, in that order, and there has been no reason to change that order of priorities. Other countries may have different objectives. Some regard the media as a tool of government. Others relinquish all control and place the media in the hands of advertising sponsors, allowing standards to find their own level on the basis of public popularity. Britain may have the best answer. Although funded from the license fee, the Corporation remains independent of Government. At the same time it has to compete with the Independent Television Authority for support. This saves the BBC from becoming too stuffy, and the ITV from dropping its standards to suit the lowest tastes. Cable television will bring wider choice, and the result of that remains to be seen.\n\nWhile they keep their independence, the media are free to respond democratically to public demand. In Britain, this demand is for entertainment which makes few if any intellectual demands. So we suffer a spate of situation comedies, soap operas and panel games monopolizing the prime viewing times. More intellectual programs are relegated to the early or late time slots; they comprise political and social comment, opera, ballet, serious music, documentaries, and programs concerning the Arts in general, religion included. In all fairness, it has to be said that Channel 2 is almost entirely given over to serious viewing.\n\nShould preference be given to popularity ? Should people be given what they want, or what somebody else thinks is good for them ? We return to the purpose of the Arts. Their purpose is to occupy leisure time pleasurably.\n\nThe problem with many exponents of the Arts is that their work has a minority appeal. Musical appreciation depends on personal taste, but most people like a recognizable and memorable tune. Most people prefer representational painting. Most people enjoy drama which has a beginning, a middle and an end. Most people buy a book because it is a good read.\n\nThe popularity test has been in question for a long time. Subject matter has broadened, and themes now cover the whole spectrum of life. Traditional and conventional themes have been abandoned. So much music has become tuneless, and dissonant. The theatre preaches sociology and politics. Painting and sculpture take some abstract form, personal to the artist. Literature, at least among highbrows, must be literary. No doubt all this has made people think, perhaps discuss, more than they once did. Yet, the fact that in Britain the Arts have to be supported by government handouts via the Arts Council speaks for itself.\nWhatever the intellectuals may think is good for us, the paying public will always vote with its feet. Entertainment in the widest sense remains the primary objective of the Arts, if the Arts are to survive."

        "title": "How far should the teaching of history aim to foster pride in one's country and its past?",
        "content": "In the 1930s a British schoolboy would turn his geographical globe and find that a third of the land surface was colored pink. This indicated the Empire, dominions, colonies end protectorates. The schoolboy felt a sense of pride, he might have thought one day we shall rule the world .\n\nSchoolchildren grow up, learn history in more depth, and bring a more sophisticated outlook to their study. The teaching of history has changed in recent years; indeed in some countries it has been merged with the story of progress in ideology, sociology and industrial development. Providing the new methods do not lead to the inculcation of political stances, and to the loss of the factual framework which has to be learnt the hard way, the new approach may be superior to the old. The old approach was to concentrate on power centers; the stories of rulers, armies, political figures, and military relationships with neighboring countries. This of course is legitimate history, and may or may not be a true source of pride, but it is far from being the complete picture.\n\nAnother factor running counter to old-fashioned pride in country is based in the post Second World War international agreement about basic human rights. These at once cut across national insularity. In the case of Britain, the wind of change led to the independence of ex-colonies and the distancing of the dominions from the influence of Whitehall. Gradually the one-world concept grew up. Its extreme adherents visualize total disarmament, total freedom to emigrate and settle at will, and eventually the international standardization of privilege and opportunity. Whereas the concept of my country, right or wrong is seriously suspect, the discarding of legitimate national pride unilaterally is impractical and unrealistic. The right kind of national pride is at least a partial guarantee of freedom and a counter-measure against aggression, whether military or subversive, on the part of both East end West.\n\nThere are some things which the teaching of history used to obscure, and in which e country can take no legitimate pride. They apply, in part or whole, to all countries. Militarism and unprovoked aggression towards neighbors comes first. Arising out of this, especially in Europe, came a history of colonization by conquest, followed by commercial exploitation. Although tempered by religious mission and the establishment of peace end stability, even social improvement, and the rule of just law, this part of history is no longer condoned. Most empire-building countries were cynical in their dealings with vassal states. Rule was despotic. Sometimes apartheid was built into the system. In some instances local people were deported as slaves to be used for commercial gain. Poverty and lack of opportunity were ignored. In more recent times there have been cases of empire-building by subversion rather than by military conquest. Some countries still behave aggressively through their secret services and their arms dealers. However patriotic, the history teacher should not be ashamed to impart this information, and it can he done without prejudice to the fostering of love of country for the right reasons. What are these reasons ?\n\nThe history of all countries traces the emergence of their peoples from the despotism of kings, barons and petty chiefs, alongside the progress to both national and personal independence. Students can also take pride in the development of the rule of law and the strengthening of personal freedoms within the law. Most countries have a history of industrial and nowadays technological development, and this has given rise to trades unionism which at its best seeks fairness and protection for the worker. Pride may also be taken in the development of the democratic process, the abolition of class barriers and the enhancement of personal opportunity. Neither should history teaching neglect improvements in living standards, reductions in working hours and the provision of health, cultural and leisure services.\n\nFinally, countries take legitimate pride in their own special characteristics; these include individuality in dress, music, the theatre, sports and games, and environmental development and improvement. Neither should the student be ashamed of the personal protection afforded by the society into which he or she was born, or of the good qualities of that society. These may well include kindness, flexibility, give and take, humor, respect for neighbor, family solidarity, care for the elderly, love of children, kindness to animals, generosity, community consciousness and hospitality to strangers."

        "title": "Are you for or against zoos?",
        "content": "Until recently the case for zoos was never questioned. They are accepted as useful and entertaining amenities which were also educational. Children love seeing animals, and a visit to the zoo has always been a treat.\nGradually however unrest has grown about the morality of keeping animals, reptiles and birds in captivity, though not on grounds of ill-treatment, lack of hygiene or incorrect feeding.\n\nThe concept of confining them in cages became suspect. More than fifty years ago a wildlife park was established at Whipsnade in Bedfordshire, UK, and since the Second World War in the grounds of large houses such as Longleat. The major-attraction types of animals such as lions, tigers and elephants thus have room to move freely and to set up their own social structures. They are fenced off from the public except in safari parks where people can see them at close quarters from rover type vehicles.\n\nThere are four points in favor of zoos, and arguments against them all. The first is conservation. Due to over shooting and deforestation in Africa, India and elsewhere, many species are endangered or becoming extinct. The koala bear, some types of deer and the Arabian oryx are examples. Attempts to mate these in captivity have been successful, with the result that their natural habitats have been re-stocked. This process is expensive and time-consuming, however.\n\nSometimes it is unsuccessful. Sometimes animals bred in captivity cannot adapt to the wild, and either die or fall prey to predators. The fact is that only 5% of endangered species are to be found in zoos, so the whole concept may be wrong. These arguments do not of course apply to bird sanctuaries, where the birds are encouraged to frequent natural but protected habitats, and are never confined.\n\nThe main argument against is that available money should be put into the saving of natural habitats. Realistically, this is totally impracticable overseas, and difficult enough in the country concerned.\n\nPoint two is that zoos are educational. Seeing and touching animals means much more to a child than any number of good books or pictures. Children have a chance to touch, groom and ride on animals in a modern zoo. Some zoos specialize in activity centers which generate love of animals, understanding and enjoyment. The counter to this argument is that animals dislike being domesticated for any reason, and that in the strict sense the zoo does not further education. Zoology is best learnt in the classroom, in the laboratory, and from the text-book. Another counter-argument is that for close contact, visual or actual, cages must be small. This inhibits exercise, and worse, prevents the putting together of enough animals to allow for natural social behavior, i.e. the setting up of families and clans. However it is conceded that given large enough cages or confined areas with sufficient animals these defects can be largely overcome. It has to be said that zoos are constantly improving their facilities and bringing them into line with the animal's natural surroundings as far as possible. The polar bear house in London Zoo is currently being remodeled in this way.\n\nIf the wishes of the public are to be considered, zoos as recreational amenities have a large following, and should be kept. Children have been mentioned, but the informative booklets, scripts and tapes available in a modern zoo attract the adult also. Entrance takings are high, and money becomes available for research as well as improvement. Some agree; others ask why animals should be made a peepshow.\n\nThe fourth argument for zoos is that they not only allow for research but also finance it. This again is not considered a valid argument by the opponents. What kind of research ? people ask. In the case of the London Zoo the answer is that they have an Institute of Zoology. This produces comparative surveys, statistics for analysis, and data bases. The veterinary branch learns how best to keep animals and treat them when sick. Animal nutrition is studied. Problems of re-introduction into the wild are studied. Animal behavior is studied. Nothing was known about the social habits of the rhinoceros until specimens were brought into captivity and observed in suitable surroundings.\n\nWhat of the future ? Despite all arguments to the contrary, the continued development of zoos seems to be a valid policy. The old defects will be overcome. Surroundings will be made larger and more natural. There is also a strong case for the specialized zoo or sanctuary, such as the woolly monkey sanctuary at Looe, in Cornwall, UK. This provides conservation, education about their kinship and social life in natural colonies, plus personal contact, with opportunities to touch and groom; also lectures. The future may lie in this direction."

        "title": "Write a critical account of the newspapers and popular magazines produced in your country.",
        "content": "In a democratic country, every aspect of the popular press is constantly under review by parliament and the general public; ownership, management, political shade, production method and freedom under the law are factors perpetually in dispute.\n\nThis essay attempts to comment on the press in Britain. It excludes the multiplicity of learned and technical journals which cover every imaginable private interest ranging from theology to karate, from motor cars to bee-keeping. These are not controversial.\n\nIn Britain newspapers are privately owned by wealthy individuals or consortia. Foreigners are free to buy in. Australians such as Rupert Murdoch own several nationals; however, any attempt by one person or group to buy an excessive number of titles would be denounced in the House of Commons and probably be brought before the Monopolies Commission. The government neither owns nor controls the press. Hence the freedom of the press remains a jealously guarded privilege. How therefore is the situation saved from the irresponsible individual?\n\nLanguage. English, French, Russian, German and Italian are international languages. They have the capability of dealing with modern technology. English has been taught for decades in schools all over the world as the second and sometimes the first language. Politics may dictate that English is given less prominence. However, trade, industry and technology nowadays demand two-way travel, and a lingua franca is essential. So to preserve the national language it is necessary for schools to give both it and the international language about equal prominence.\n\nDress. Clothes which are native to a country have evolved in relation both to climate and to artistic tradition. It is tempting for both men and women to adopt foreign styles imported by those who visit or settle for commercial and industrial reasons. International fashion affects choice of dress, particularly among young people. In a free country it may be wrong to dictate what people shall wear. However styles can be heavily influenced by the personal choice of prominent men and women. It would be a great loss if all countries assimilated to the styles traditionally worn either in the West or the Eastern bloc.\n\nSocial customs. These are most easily lost. Traditions in respect of births, marriages, deaths, agricultural festivals, attainment of manhood and womanhood and all other indigenous customs must be maintained if a country's culture is to be preserved. Again, this requires the help of government by way of positive encouragement in the shape of leadership and the granting of paid holidays or time off work without loss of income.\n\nArts and crafts. In developing countries there is often a strong input of foreign consumer goods. Every country has its own indigenous products, ranging from household utensils to clothing, sandals and shoes, leather goods, pottery, pictures etc. Despite balance of trade requirements there must be some control over imports of consumer goods and encouragement to continue buying goods of local manufacture. This may mean government subsidies to keep cottage industry financially viable. The continued production of all these items is crucial to the preservation of a country's culture.\n\nWay of life. The traditional roles of men and women are always threatened by the working hours demanded by imported industry and commerce. The agriculture-based work-cycle is easily lost in the five-day nine-to-five working week required when labor is transferred from the land to the factory or office. So also is traditional village housing when new housing is built near the major work places. Inevitably a new Westernized pattern involving shared household duties is imposed and when traditional male and female domestic roles are modified by the new job requirements. Little can be done about this. The upgraded status of women has come to stay.\n\nReligious observance. Enlightened governments always ensure religious freedom and declare national holidays so that the major festivals of all religions may be observed. Taken in aggregate, this free time may be excessive and compromises may have to be reached. Whatever one's personal faith there is little doubt that strong religious conviction continues to exert a beneficial social effect. The bad features of Western culture, the break-up of family life, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity, resulting in AIDS, and crime and anti-social behavior can be blamed, at least partially, on the breakdown of religious faith.\n\nLiterature, music and drama. It goes without saying that governments should encourage the support of all three, if necessary by financial subsidies. They all contribute to the richness of indigenous culture.\n\nIn peacetime, basically by a body called the Press Council. The government or the individual can complain about unfair reporting, the disturbance of personal privacy by journalists, sacrilege, immorality and other abuses. Editors usually take note of this body. The laws of libel of course apply. Material sensitive to national security can be stopped by legal injunctions, sometimes at the order of the Speaker of the House of Commons. In wartime, sensitive material is banned by a 'D Notice'. Otherwise editors can print material which they know will result in libel suits, and sometimes do so. Circulation benefits offset court damages.\n\nThe powerful unions, SOGAT and the NUJ, have hitherto controlled not only printing methods, but also to some extent editorial attitudes, but recently their power has been broken. Fleet Street in London had been hidebound by overmanning and antique printing methods. Rupert Murdoch set up a modern establishment in Wapping, north of the River Thames, and manned his printing works behind barbed wire by non-union labor. Thus he remained viable financially and was free in his editorial comment. Violent picketing continued for a year, but Murdoch set a trend which is being followed by other nationals. His methods were unpopular, but they were direct and effective.\n\nNewspapers in Britain are subdivided among major national dailies and local papers. Evening papers are on sale actually from l0 a.m. and are aimed at commuters. Many provincial papers are weeklies, and sell on local news combined with some national comment.\n\nThe national dailies and Sunday papers, with their color magazines, all have a political bias, based in the paper's history and tradition. These range from Communist papers such as the Star, to right-wing dailies such as the Express and the Sun, so that every shade of opinion is catered for. Such a wide spectrum gives the public a wide choice. In most cases their reporting is fair and factual, though naturally their political interpretations of both home and foreign affairs vary widely. All, including the establishment dailies, the Times and the Telegraphs compete for circulation in various ways. Many run competitions and games of chance. Some seek exclusives to increase sales. The gutter press prints soft-sex photographs and goes in for lurid reporting. All contain news, sport, politics, leaders, features, letters and advertising. At about 25p they are mostly good value for money.\n\nApart from technical journals, magazines in general have lost their hold on the British public because they were largely pictorial. The television has overtaken them. However, women's magazines are as popular as ever. They range from the intellectual -- feminist to the establishment social scene to the traditionally bland and non-controversial women's interest types of periodical."

        "title": "How important is foreign trade to your country?",
        "content": "Discounting the most primitive countries, foreign trade is important to all countries. Even primitive countries need it to some degree. Where peoples have been content with the produce of the land, the herd and the flock, there have always been itinerant traders, e.g. the Arabs who skirted the Sahara from Egypt to the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, Nigeria etc. They brought brass, ivory and woven goods to be exchanged for local artifacts. Modern communications have introduced more sophisticated needs even to primitive tribes. Chiefs and leaders have traveled and sometimes been educated in Western and Westernized countries.\nEvery country has a currency, a gross national product, and a sum of capital raised out of taxation. The currency has a strength related to other currencies with which it is grouped. That strength depends on keeping a fair balance between imports and exports. Where exports outweigh imports the currency becomes relatively strong, with two good results and one bad one.\n\nThe individual has good purchasing power. Foreign investment is encouraged by high interest rates which in turn control imports. However, exported goods become too expensive, and export trade becomes depressed. A careful government will seek a balance. Without high interest rates a trade balance will fall apart. Imports will grossly exceed exports and there may be a run on the currency, leading to inflation and increased unemployment.\n\nThe gross national product is derived from taxation and from the exploitation of natural resources. Minerals, oil and gas are often licensed for development to foreign companies, thus providing the government with a substantial extra income. A wise government will again find a balance between liquidating debt, improving social amenity in all its forms, and dropping the rate of taxation. The latter encourages the creation of new wealth by the individual and by the firm, at any rate in capitalistic countries. Socialist countries eschew the free market which all of the above implies as the means of raising the general standard of living. Instead imports, exports, the currency, wages and the distribution of the gross national product are strictly regulated by a bureaucracy. In the case of a despotism, the GNP is cynically used only for the benefit of the leader and the party in power.\n\nIn answer to the question, and in the light of the above, everything depends on the country in question.\n\nFor example, your country has an economy based in rubber tapping, agriculture and fishing. Subsistence is no problem. Villages are traditionally self-supporting. However, there is political unrest, because a neighboring country enjoys a much greater variety of consumer goods. The democratic government plans to raise your standard of living in all departments Where is the money to come from?\n\nMuch of it may come from the exploitation of the off-shore oil and gas already located by foreign mineralogists. This is a long-term project and the income derived from concessions to foreign oil companies will not be received for, say, five to ten years. The enhancement of foreign trade is more short-term and realistic. Yet, there are few factories and no products capable of competing abroad. To import what the people desire without exporting correspondingly would damage the economy.\n\nAs a government you decide to enter the overseas electronics market. New factories will be built in industrial areas adjacent to the big cities. Initial funding will come from the world bank. Foreign experts will supervise the installation of machinery, institute training schemes for the new labor force, advise on quality control and competitiveness overseas. A range of electronic products will be available for export with a limited quantity for the home market, in two years' time. A range of consumer perishables and durables can then be admitted.\n\nTaxation can then be graded from a low standard rate upwards. Only then, and after debts are repaid or serviced, can thought be given to the country's more general standard of living."

        "title": "Discuss the causes and consequences of erosion.",
        "content": "Erosion is the eating or wearing away of land features. It is caused by a variety of factors, some natural, others man-made. The consequences can he serious both for the natural world and for man himself.\n\nThe natural causes are weathering, water, ice, wind and change of temperature. The changes may be very gradual, sometimes taking millions of years and dating back to the major upheavals of the planet when the earth was very young. Wind and rain driving incessantly against sandstone, formed originally by immense pressures on early sea-beds and then lifted above sea-level by volcanic eruption or the clash of land-plates, wears the stone back into sand, thus creating beaches along the seashore. In the case of harder rock such as granite, surfaces are worn smooth.\n\nWeathering also erodes exposed coastlines in temperate zones. Often cliffs and dunes simply disappear over perhaps a short period of two or three hundred years. The sea encroaches, and sometimes coastal villages are lost. There is written evidence of English villages having been lost under the waves.\n\nThe sea also plays its part in the erosion process. The Netherlands, facing the turbulent North Sea, have for centuries fought the battle against salt water encroachment due to erosion. Great dikes have been built to exclude the sea, and gradually the low-lying salt flats have been sweetened and fertilized for agriculture and bulb-growing. In another way, the sea also erodes rock fragments by friction due to the tides. The smooth pebbles on northern beaches are the result of their having rubbed together over millions of years.\n\nThe great ice-floes attached to the poles play a conspicuous part in regulating sea levels. In general, sea levels are thought to be rising, though opinions vary as to the rate. At present, many fear what is called the greenhouse effect , i.e. the punching of holes in the ozone layer due to industrial gases and the use of CFCs. Nations are beginning to agree to eliminate these hazards. The result might be the melting of the ice-caps causing a devastating rise in sea levels. This would put much of the land in temperature climates under sea-water.\n\nSlow-moving glaciers also have an effect. Their immense power pulverizes any rocks in their path. The piles of shale at the foot of many mountains resulted from the pressure of glaciers millions of years ago.\n\nWind is probably the greatest single cause of erosion. Where there is no protection given to the soil, and after a period of drought or intense heat, the soil crumbles to dust and literally blows away. Man himself can either let this happen or take steps to prevent it. Rain, of course, has a dual effect. In some circumstances, it can wash away the soil into river beds, where it is carried down to estuaries, often silting them so that they require dredging. Inland, and on flat territory, rain holds the soil together. Yet, rain depends on trees and foliage which cause clouds to precipitate. The central plains of North America from time to time become dust bowls, simply because all vegetarian has been cleared in favor of large-scale, economic cereal growing. The same clearance of rain forests goes on currently in South America in favor of cash crops. Conservationists throughout the world are resisting these clearances, but are fighting vested interests.\n\nThe rain forests support a wide variety of animals, birds, insects and plants, many of which can only exist in their present habitat. This is an added reason for resisting deforestation. Sooner or later when the forests have gone the climate will change from hot and humid to dry. The soil will crumble and erode.\n\nTribes dependent on land for grazing and agriculture lose their herds, flocks and food. They become nomads or refugees and are exposed to epidemic and starvation. Erosion can cause much human suffering.\n\nEven in temperature countries large-scale farming is now being discouraged, for the foregoing reasons. In England such farming has meant the destruction of hedges, ditches and trees, again spoiling traditional landscapes and the habitats of bird, animal and insect species.\n\nSome erosion is natural and inevitable. Much however is caused by man. Long term conservation is essential if man is to pass on a beautiful planet to future generation."

        "title": "How important is ceremony in your country?",
        "content": "The importance varies, but few would argue that ceremony is totally irrelevant. Some ceremonies are of course mere tradition, and as such may be irritants.\n\nFor example, in Britain there is almost universal respect for the monarch. Yet, she and her court are hemmed in by ceremonies which is this day and age would be laughable if they were not pernicious. In fact the court consists of aristocrats whose function is both to preserve the mystique surrounding the monarch and the rigid class structure which they head. A typical example is that one has to leave a room in which the monarch is seated by walking backwards, no easy exercise. The same applies to an official leaving the Commons chamber when the Speaker is seated.\n\nThis is not an argument for the abolition of ceremonial, merely for rational updating. Many ceremonies have a laudable basis. They are often spectacular, and hence enjoyable. They provide relief from the humdrum greyness of daily life. They bring to mind the country's best traditions. In animistic societies ceremony implies the satisfying of the gods which rule human destiny. Ceremonies dignify human relationships. They sometimes provide a good excuse for enjoyable public holidays. Latin countries would never give up their fiestas. Ceremonial may reflect the structure of government.\n\nSome of this applies to Britain. Reverting to the monarch, I quote three examples. First, the state opening of parliament. The queen ratifies legislation, though she has political influence rather than power. Yet, she reads a speech in which my government will pass this act and that. Seated with her lords, she excludes the commons until black rod has knocked three times on the chamber door. This underlines the titular, though not actual superiority of the unelected lords over the commons. Secondly, the Trooping the Colour, which supplies even more pageantry. As head of the armed forces, the queen takes the salute of her guards, whose colors, in rotation, are paraded before her. This, and the daily changing of the guard, provide a great tourist attraction. Thirdly, the queen's visits to the City of London. Traditionally, the 'square mile' is independent territory, outside the queen's jurisdiction. She has to lay aside the sword of state and receive the Lord Mayor's permission to enter ceremonially. The Lord Mayor has an annual show, the floats in the parade reflecting all aspects of national life. However, at all ceremonial functions, whether the queen is present or not, the national anthem is played, underlining the loyalty of all her subjects to their titular head. Great ceremony marks the visits of foreign heads of state; banquets, parades, gun salutes. When such heads of state are respectable individuals, well and good. Often, they are insignificant, sometimes trumped-up gangsters. Then such ceremonies are hollow irritants, and the population resents both the hypocrisy and the traffic chaos caused in the Westminster area.\n\nFor some, though perhaps a minority of Britons, ceremonial affects courtship, engagement and marriage. Reflecting the old subservience of the girl to her father, the prospective husband will court the girl for some time, and then ask her father's permission to become engaged. His financial prospects will be considered. Marriage will be in church, where the ceremony will have as much tradition as religious content. Ideally, all this is meant to underline the permanency of marriage. Burial or cremation also demands ceremony, formal dress and tributes to the deceased.\n\nCeremonial dress may reflect history. There are special uniforms, all designed to impress, for the diplomatic corps, for courtiers, for service chiefs, for lords lieutenant, for mayors and lord mayors. Non- official civilians are desired to wear tail coats and silk hats for state functions. Dinner-jackets are required for formal dinners. Elaborate gowns and hoods are de riguer for university functions. All this originated in the desire to preserve certain standards of behavior, or to instill respect. Judges and barristers are be-wigged in court. When Britain was a colonial power, all expatriates changed into evening dress for dinner, even in the most primitive outstations.\n\nIt goes without saying that religious services are based on ceremonials, all of which have a devotional significance. Attempts are often made to simplify or exclude ceremonial, but there is little doubt that the soul of man responds to color, movement and beauty.\n\nIn Britain, ceremonial remains important, but many think that it is high time the more meaningless examples were abolished."

        "content": "Obviously the practical means of doing so lies in the hands of the police force, para-military anti-riot forces, and, in the last resort, the armed forces themselves. In democratic countries, these are firmly under the control of civilian governments, the members of which are freely elected.\nGovernments legislate and judiciaries administer the law. However, the degree of control over the individual and the nature of the sanctions to be applied depend partly on the traditions of the country concerned and partly on the seriousness of the law and order problems which the country faces.\n\nWhat are today's problems? Political protest, leading to strikes, street demonstrations, physical violence, use of arms and weapons, mob violence and vandalism, looting, and in extreme cases, civil war. Football violence, such as has recently excluded England from matches in Europe. Crime against the person and against property e.g. murder, rape, theft, burglary and vandalism. These evils spread from country to country by imitation through international media publicity. Paradoxically, they also spread when law and order sanctions are either tightened or relaxed. This dilemma faces Mr. Gorbachev precisely because of glasnost and perestroika, particularly insofar as political unrest spreads through the Soviets and Russia's satellite neighbors.\n\nSo the distinction between personal and political motivation behind lawlessness must be made. Where the motivation is personal, i.e. based in natural violence, social resentment due perhaps to deprivation, greed, sexual amorality, hatred or drug-induced mental states, then sanctions must be toughened as required. There are arguments for and against the death penalty, but there is little doubt that it provides an effective deterrent. There are arguments against physical punishments, but they also deter. English law provides severer penalties for offences against property than against the person. In view of the muggings, street and public transport violence experienced today, this must be reversed.\n\nThe modish, liberal explanation of the increase of such crime is that society rejects the poor and underprivileged. Rebuild slum areas and offer more government handouts and crime would disappear . This is nonsense. What is society but a collection of individuals? Every individual is endowed with personal choice. The individual must be made to choose the law and order path. Religion and morality must be instilled into children in the home, in the school and in the workplace. Some form of compulsory national service of a non-military nature would benefit young adults of all racial origins and of both sexes.\n\nThe more difficult question is that of offence against law and order when the motivation is truly political. Do citizens owe a duty to support and preserve the established order in return for the benefits they receive from it? If not, at what point does the freedom fighter become the terrorist? At what point in a democracy does the legitimate lobby become the violent, chanting, vociferous and sometimes blackmailing pressure group? The answers must of course depend on the political stance of the individual. Again however the distinction between political and personal motivation must be clearly made. In Ireland, religion and politics are used as a cover for common criminality. In South Africa, the motivation behind violence is often tribal rivalry or the instinct to loot, pillage and murder.\n\nThe justification for using the sanctions already mentioned in order to maintain law and order when offences are political lies in the quality of any country's government. Where there is democracy, where there is a multi-party system, where the legal system is fair, where human rights including that of free speech within the law are preserved, there lies the justification. When these things are denied then there can be a case for resistance, even revolution.\n\nYet, underlying the spread of common criminality is the flight from religion and morality and the weakening of the family system. Much youth delinquency could be pre-empted by discipline in the home, school and work-place, always provided the motivation behind such discipline is affection and the true well-being of the young person."

        "title": "How can we as individuals become more healthy?",
        "content": "The three basics are food, sleep and exercise, though the balance depends on age. As we get older, we tend to need less of all three. Metabolism slows with age, so we feel less hungry; with age we become less active and therefore need less sleep. However, all three basics are required at any age if we are to remain relatively young and healthy throughout our allotted span.\nFor the purpose of this essay, let us assume that you are a young man or woman of about eighteen years. You have an interest in sport as well as in academic work, preparatory to employment. You look forward to a long, active trouble-free, healthy life. No doubt you have been inoculated against the common killers such as typhoid, tetanus, diphtheria etc. Let us also assume that you have been born with healthy genes and have both a normal resistance to disease and a good recovery rate. You were not born with any physical defects or handicaps which require special medical treatment. You have an average to good health record. You wish to keep your health, even improve it.\n\nTake food. The temptation is to overeat. Stop when you stop feeling hungry. When this is socially difficult go without the next meal. What to eat? Try to avoid convenience foods; keep the intake of carbohydrates, fats and sugar low. Protein builds the body without thickening the waistline. All this of course assumes that a balanced and varied diet is available. Nobody could lecture the Ethiopian or the refugee or the very poor on this subject. When to eat? Three meals a day should be enough for a young man; one too many for an old man. Eating sweets, chocolates, ice creams, cakes etc between meals can undo all your good intentions. Fresh vegetables, not over-cooked, are excellent. If you can obtain fresh food in variety, good. Eat according to the rules, and forget food! And don't forget, ladies, that you also need food. Too much slimming can destroy appetite and lead to the downward spiral of starvation; anorexia.\n\nSleep is even more crucial than food. Eight hours per night for the young person, six to seven for the elderly. A medium to hard bed and circulating fresh air make for the deepest sleep. Most experts advise going to bed seasonably early, say not much after 11 p.m. The late-night film or disco should be the exception.\n\nA seasonable amount of exercise is essential to everybody. Most young people play sport, often team games, football, basketball etc and this, plus walking, sunning and cycling keeps the body in tune and sets up the kind of strength and stamina which pays dividends in later life in health. It is a mistake to give up activity when we exchange studentship for employment. All too quickly the body runs to fat. Some sedentary workers are out of breath after climbing one flight of stairs. Strenuous exercise in youth, phased down to walking, golf and swimming in later years, goes a long way to prevent heart and respiratory problems.\n\nAny normally healthy person, sticking to the above regime, will get healthier and stay that way. Yet, these are three final points. The first is to try to learn to kill needless anxiety, and to adopt a positive approach to life. Nobody can predict the future, so day by day living, albeit with an overall plan, is required. Worry and depression, i.e. psychological weakness, can be very detrimental to health.\n\nThe second is to practice normal hygiene. Cleanliness, especially in food preparation, is essential. Yet, nobody can create a totally sterile environment. Most of us have more built-in resistance to disease, however, than we imagine. Thirdly, smoking and alcohol. If you have never started, don't. However, and despite the pressure lobbies, moderation in both has never been finally proved harmful. Field Marshal Montgomery once boasted to Sir Winston Churchill, 'I neither smoke nor drink, and I am 100% fit'.\n\nChurchill replied, 'I do bath, and I am 200% fit.' Churchill outlived Monty by many years."

        "content": "Breathes there a man with soul so dead\n\nWho never to himself hath said,\n\nThis is my own, my native land!\n\nWhose heart hath ne'er within him burned,\n\nAs home his footsteps he hath turned\n\nFrom wandering on a foreign strand?'\n\nThus Sir Walter Scott felt about the mist, the heather, the mountains, lakes and snows of Scotland, his own native land. So do most of us, and this stems from affection and familiarity rather than from political and nationalistic considerations. So also must be Singaporean, away on business overseas, or the Vietnamese boat-person who cannot master a foreign language.\n\nIn my own case, at least fourteen years of my life has been spent in a series of permanent Army postings abroad. Two were spent on the beautiful island of Singapore, six in Germany during the second world war and again later, three in West Africa, three in Palestine. Each time I flew into the UK my heart leapt at the green familiarity of the little fields and villages, the woods and streams, the undulating landscape, as the plane came in to land.\n\nYet, there is much more to it than love of one's own countryside. I have lived permanently in my own country for the past eighteen years and have learnt all over again to appreciate the many factors which are most important to me, and which, as a young man, I thought I could do without.\n\nFirst and foremost, and this is perhaps selfish, I would miss family and friends if, for some reasons, I had to emigrate. In my latter years, it is an enormous pleasure to live near my sons and their families. Both sons, as it happens, are happy and successful. One is a member of Parliament and the other is a flourishing barrister. It would be sad indeed to miss their progress. It would also be a great loss if I could not watch the week-by-week development of my five grandchildren.\n\nAn then -- friends. What is life without them? Old friends especially. Those with whom we have shared experience, the ups and downs of life. Of course, we make friends abroad too but it is not always easy to identify with people from a totally different background. Again, one can practice one's religion anywhere. Yet is the overseas church, or mosque or temple quite the same as one's own?\n\nThere is always the language barrier, especially for the English. The fact that English is today's international language is no paradox. It is simply that our ancestors overseas, in the days when England was a great colonial power and had a trading empire, expected foreigners to learn English, though there were exceptions to this autocratic outlook. The fact remains that to speak one's own language in one's own country guarantees immediate contact and understanding. Perhaps Chinese, Malays, and some other far Eastern nationals do not see this as a problem. Unlike the lazy Englishman who will not learn, they can and do.\n\nWhat else did I miss when overseas? Perhaps the British political and legal system and the freedoms we take for granted. Life abroad can be minefield for those who do not study the laws and customs of their country of adoption. At home, one is brought up to know about these things and to avoid mistakes. One English tradition is that of freedom of speech, that is, within the law. This also applies to the written word. The principle is 'I disagree with all you say, but I would defend your right to say it to the death'. This means that the English can criticize the monarchy, the government, religion and law with impunity, a freedom not universally conferred. One would miss that in a country where to transgress might mean prison, or even a death sentence.\n\nThe center of this freedom is the English pub , or public house. Every village has one or two, every town has several. People talk, gossip, let off steam, and put the world to rights over a drink, in comfort, and in congenial company. The pub is perhaps the reason why there has been no revolution in England since 1688. There is no equivalent institution abroad.\n\nGood hospitals, good libraries, good clothes, good food and drink, good concerts and theatres, and good quality consumer goods are some of the other things.\n\nEngland has many faults but I can say with Scott 'this is my own, my native land!'"

        "title": "What can be done to alleviate suffering in the world ?",
        "content": "We live in a world in which we are perpetually exposed to what William Shakespeare described as the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. It is true that much suffering is caused by accident and natural disaster and is therefore almost unavoidable. A drunken car driver may kill or maim. Hurricanes and earthquakes leave a trail of death, injury and havoc. Some steps may be taken to lessen the likelihood of this kind of suffering by imposing severe penalties for drunken driving, or living, if possible, outside hurricane and earthquake centers, but the innocent still suffer, and are likely to go on suffering.\nUnmerited suffering has always perplexed philosophers, who can rarely say more than that we live in an imperfect world. Religions supply explanations; God, or the gods, punish mankind for breaking the divine law, and to some extent this is true. Abuse of alcohol, tobacco, drugs and sex carries with it automatic retribution. Whether catastrophe is a direct form of retribution for sin, imposed by a divine being or beings is very doubtful. What is quite evident is that we are required to live in a world which is dangerous, and whatever protection from either natural or man-made disaster we can find has to be made by ourselves. Some religions teach that there will be an after-life in which all wrongs will be set right, and where the injustices of this life will be redressed. This enables the faithful to put up with whatever misfortune comes their way in the hope of better things to come. Suffering has to be faced by everybody, sooner or later, and it is no use philosophing about divine impartiality. \"God's rain falls on the just and the unjust\", says the Old Testament. Nearer the mark is this rather flippant rhyme;\n\nThe rain it raineth every day\n\nUpon the just and unjust fella,\n\nBut mostly on the just, because\n\nThe unjust hath the just's umbrella\".\n\nThe lessons of history are against the probability of abolishing suffering, yet that is the ideal, the objective towards which all civilized human beings should work.\n\nIf selfishness and hatred could be replaced by unselfishness and love, this would go a long way towards the alleviation of suffering. Ever since pre-history there have been wars, usually caused either by pure aggression or by greed for fertile land or natural resources. Since 1945 war has taken on a new and horrific dimension. Though nuclear bombs have been used only against Japan, there is a proliferation of nuclear weapons, and recently there have been terrible examples of the use of napalm, nerve gases, and chemical armaments. There is no need to enlarge on the resultant suffering. And since all these armaments are universally available, and since the arms trade virtually knows no boundaries, any real progress must lie in the direction of multi-lateral disarmament and severe restriction on the arms trade. This can only be achieved by a move towards the one-world concept and a heightened respect for the dignity and basic rights of the individual.\n\nThe latter point raises the matter of political systems. Most civilized countries today are governed democratically rather than autocratically. The democratization of much of Eastern Europe is a real step forward. Gone are the secret police and the barbarous acts perpetrated against the individual by the previous regimes. However, political oppression and brutality to dissenters still exists in many parts of the world. It is to be hoped that the major powers will exert such pressure that autocracies will finally be overthrown. With that overthrow could come an end to torture and the physical and mental degradation which continues to scar the face of humanity.\n\nThere are three final points. First, religious fanaticism, an age-old problem. Does God want Holy Wars and the self-sacrifice of teenagers on the battlefield? Does God approve of hostage-taking, of the bombing of town centers or aircraft? There is one theme common to all true religious belief; \"Do unto others as you would they do unto you\".\n\nSecond, the poverty of the third world . The wars waged by, and the cynicism shown by many third-world leaders should be brought to an end, if necessary by force. International and voluntary aid is often diverted to the purchase of arms and the feeding of troops.\n\nFinally, the frailty of the human body itself. It is is true that God allows physical suffering but has given man the intellect to alleviate or prevent it, then medical research must not be hampered. Science is on the way to finding the cause, and therefore the elimination of cancer and other inherited diseases. Genetic in vitro probes can also prevent the birth of handicapped children. Research must be given the green light."

        "title": "Is air travel as safe as it should be ?",
        "content": "Statistically, air travel is reasonably safe when compared with road, rail and sea. Many countries have a high death and injury rate on the roads; train, ferry and ocean-going ship disasters are regular enough to be commonplace, taking a global view. Yet, air disasters are usually fatal to all or most concerned and are therefore more widely reported. Consequently, there is international pressure to make air travel as safe as possible, and rightly so. Yet, no form of travel can be made totally safe. The causes of disaster, whether natural or man-made, can never be completely eliminated.\nLooking first at natural causes, at least three can be identified. Bad weather is one. This includes storm, icing and air-pockets in the case of light aircraft; less so in the case of large jets with sophisticated instrumentation. One cause in the case of jets can be large flocks of birds or swarms of insects being sucked into the jet nacelles and thereby stopping the engines. This may happen at low altitudes. Little can be done to prevent this. A third is the alleged danger in what is known as the \"Bermuda Triangle\", in which both ships and aircraft have been lost without trace. In the case of aircraft the reason may be the loss of horizon due to electrical disturbance.\n\nMost dangers to aircraft however are man-made. The first and obvious danger is collision. In the busiest airports, especially in the tourist season, aircraft may take off as often as every twenty seconds. Much strain is imposed on aircraft dispatchers and traffic control generally. Clearance for dispatch is by radar and computer. Personal fatigue or mechanical failure in a radar center can be very dangerous. Aircraft often have to circle before being given landing permission, and collision or perhaps a near miss can result from mistakes in assigning heights. Most, though not all, countries have strict regulations governing air traffic control. Any strike by operatives will cause grounding -- bad enough, but preferable to taking risks.\n\nAnother cause of trouble may be the age of the aircraft. Metal fatigue eventually sets in; cracks appear, bits of the aircraft may fall off, even whole engines, or the passenger cabin may lose compression. This means almost certain death to all passengers and crew, and there have been cases where an aircraft has been lost because one of the doors was not properly secured. The important of safety checks before take-off is obvious. So also is the importance of regular and completely efficient servicing. Operatives' licenses can be withdrawn if government inspectors find inefficiency in this area. Most modern aircraft can shut down engines which catch fire, deal automatically with the fire, and proceed on three, or even two engines.\n\nCabin fires are equally dangerous. They may occur for any reason, but in many cases they result from a crash landing causing the fuel to ignite. Two things are important here. First, cabin exit must be unimpeded. Some modern aircraft have built-in chutes for swift escape. Much of course depends on cabin staff and their ability to prevent panic. Second, the seat upholstery must be non-flammable. Many people have died from the noxious smoke emanating from flammable upholstery.\n\nThere is argument today about emergency drills. Normally a steward will explain life-jackets for use should there be a sea landing, and just mention oxygen masks which are lowered to each seat. Should all these by physically tried out by all passengers prior to take-off ? Such drills are boring and time-consuming, but the time may come when they are mandatory.\n\nSome disasters are caused by pilot error. Recently, a Shackleton in fog crashed into a hillside in Britain, killing twenty-five young men. The plane has a good safety record. Again recently the pilot of a plane with a faulty engine shut down the good engine due to the failure of his instrumentation. The plane crashed, killing most occupants, and virtually destroying a small village. Sometimes instrumentation can be affected by electronic interference due to unauthorized equipment carried in the hold or hand luggage. This hazard can be eliminated.\n\nNot much can be done about terrorism except through airfield security and electronic vetting of all passengers and luggage. Unhappily not all airports are really efficient in this regard. Efficiency would arrest the terrorist and the hijacker on the airport.\n\nFinally, attempts by carriers to economize on pilot coverage and seating space must be prevented by law. The two essentials are fresh and fully-trained pilots, and reasonable space for movement in emergency.\n\nThe answer to the question is no. Much could still be done to avert future disasters."

        "content": "Music has always occupied a firm place in the life of every community. Travel, conquest and trade have led to the mutual enrichment of musical traditions, though on a very limited scale as compared with today. Distance is no longer an object. So the worldwide musical situation has become fluid. Roughly speaking, music has developed tonally in the West and atonally in the East; that is to say in the West an octave has eight tones with corresponding semitones; in the East the same span of sound has no such specific divisions. Yet, in recent times each system has affected the other. East and West have become more familiar with each other's music, and each other's music has become mutually popular. China, Japan and other Far Eastern countries now produce virtuoso in Western modes of performance, particularly the piano and violin. Many Eastern professionals take their place in Western orchestras.\nIndigenous music has always been connected with life experience rather than with purely aesthetic appreciation. Communities have music to reflect the moods of birth, marriage, death, war, celebration, commiseration, dance and religious ceremonial. The five basic instruments have developed in parallel; percussion, pipes, trumpets, horns and strings. Most countries are reverting to the sophisticated versions of these instruments. The danger is that thereby the traditional forms of these instruments may be lost. Many arts councils are alive to this problem.\n\nThere is a place for music to reflect our feelings about all the main events of life. Yet, there is an equal place for purely aesthetic appreciation. Most countries offer ample opportunities; radio and television, records, tapes, CDs as well as live concerts. More and more good music is being heard by all age-groups, and, with some reservations, this can only have a good effect. Music can be both the \"food of love\" and a means of \"soothing the savage brow\".\n\nNowadays schools and especially caring families seek to give children a grounding in music both as listeners and performers because this will enrich their leisure time in the future. This tuition should begin early, and before the child's life becomes over-complicated by sport and academic study. Children who are truly interested show promise by the age of six or seven.\n\nInevitably, almost all young people throughout the world are confronted by the pop scene . This may have no appeal at all to their seniors but must not be condemned out of hand, because its freedom, novelty and variety reflect the instincts of independence, protest, calf-love and sympathy with the underprivileged which characterize the teenager. The pop scene began in the USA and Britain in the early 60s but unfortunately was associated with some bad things; drug-taking, sexual dancing, alcohol and sexual promiscuity. The lyrics often overtly promoted these things -- an original Beatles song \"Lucy in the sky with diamonds\" threw up the initials LSD. For these reasons pop music was banned by the USSR for thirty years. This was extreme, if understandable. However, pop music will always have its place with the young in the modern world.\n\nThe main things young people should be helped to realize is that pop music is transient, of poor quality, and swiftly out of fashion. Secondly, it may be promoted by cynical individuals anxious to exploit drugs, sex and violence. \"Acid house\" parties are now banned in the UK. Thirdly, such music, e.g. \"heavy metal\", when played too loudly can injure hearing and be a nuisance to neighbors. The \"ghetto-blaster\" should be banned. On the positive side, pop concerts in the West have raised enormous sums for charity to benefit third-world countries.\n\nIncreasingly, music impinges on many aspects of modern life. We are now accustomed to the nuisance of \"muzak\" tapes in bars, lifts (elevators), restaurants, railway stations, car radios, long distance buses, aircraft, and even the home. Some of us could well do without this intrusive noise. On the other hand some people can do work which does not require too much concentration better with a musical background. Many British wartime factory workers were helped by \"Music while you work\".\n\nMuch of this music today is synthetic and computerized, but not all of it is bad. In fact, it can help to create atmosphere for say a cinema thriller or a TV feature. Music is an essential ingredient in many films, and has been ever since the piano accompanied the silent Charlie Chaplin epic.\n\nWe still need good military music, good church music, even good background tunes for TV serials and adverts. A good tune is a useful trademark.\n\nLike many other features of modem life, music has its place, but it must be kept in its place."

        "title": "How far are our lives today affected by the past ?",
        "content": "\"History is bunk\". This saying was attributed to the late Henry Ford, of the motor company. Though untrue, the statement makes the true point that no approach to the past is ever complete. Therefore the influence of the past on our lives is not easy to assess. Neither should we ignore the fact that in many contexts people deliberately reject the past for a variety of reasons. Yet, it remains true that genetic inheritance is a far more powerful influence on our lives than either upbringing or social environment, and that our genetic make-up has been conditioned by the past.\nYet, we are not entirely the victims of our physical inheritance. We learn a great deal from the attitudes of our parents and grandparents. Some we adopt, others we may reject as old-fashioned or irrelevant. The same applies to our hopes for the future. Just because father and grandfather were manual workers, does this prevent us from obtaining a good education and qualifying for a professional or business career ? Thankfully, in the modern world, and in most countries, it does not. More societies are ceasing to be autocracies, and are becoming meritocracies. The restrictions of the past make us even more aware of the opportunities of the present.\n\nThe same applies to outmoded class systems. Most countries have had class systems based on rank and wealth, supported by almost unbreakable barriers. Thankfully, this is generally less true today. Society is more flexible. If our grandparents kowtowed to the local dignitaries, we are no longer compelled to do the same. Except in countries which preserve autocratic and caste systems, education and opportunity have abolished these old shibboleths.\n\nYet, in many other ways we are still influenced by the past. The families and the societies in which we live are without question given their character by history. In many societies, family tradition is still all-important. Codes of morals, good manners and general behavior are instilled into us as children, and this has been the case for generations. The society into which we were born has its own standards of what is acceptable and what isn't. Most people conform to both, or are identified as drop-outs .\n\nThese pressures to conform stem from the different histories of different countries. A primitive and warlike tribe may put their young men through horrific initiation ceremonies in order to inure them to pain and to test valor, because they must become hunters and warriors, and the young men do not question the ordeal. Families in a country which has a caste system may withhold the freedom of women to choose their own husbands, or at least veto a marriage which is not approved. Women in other countries play a subordinate role because such is the diktat of their national religion. The young people of one African tribe will instinctively hate the people of an adjacent tribe because there has been a long history of warfare between the two.\n\nIn more advanced countries, military and naval traditions, which are deeply rooted in history, play a major role, especially in wartime. So does geography. The citizens of a small country surrounded by powerful neighbors, and frequently the victim of invasion, live in a perpetual perhaps subconscious fear of a repetition, and are often slow to develop independence and a sense of national pride. On the other hand, an island such as Britain, never successfully invaded since 1066 A.D., maintains a fierce pride in its freedoms and independence -- hence Britain's reluctance to become a European state. And from this stemmed the seafaring tradition which in the past enabled Britain to build an empire.\n\nAgain, some countries have developed by evolution, others through revolution. Both kinds may now be democracies, but in countries such as France the \"will of the people\" plays a much greater part than in countries where anomalies and injustices have been eliminated by parliamentary and legal reform.\n\nPerhaps the chief factor which affects our lives is education, and the style of education which any country offers is deeply rooted in its history. The teaching of history itself always has a national emphasis, which always colors the student's outlook.\n\nIn spite of modern communication, in spite of the modern, modish concept of a world community , in spite of the rebellious atmosphere of the 1960s in the USA and the UK, in spite even of glasnov and perestroika, the main influences on our lives stem from the history of the country in which we happen to live. This is mediated through the society to which we belong, and the families which gave us birth."

        "content": "A slightly eccentric professor of archaeology in West Africa would neither answer the telephone nor reply to letters. As for letters, he would say, leave them long enough and they answer themselves. As for the telephone, I consider it an unwarranted intrusion. If people want to talk to me they can come and see me. Of course, the world could not carry on in its modern way without the telephone, which has become an essential part of living. Yet, in some respects it can be a curse.\nToday, telephonic communication is worldwide and instantaneous. It is possible to dial people at the other end of the world without even going through an operator. This is fine, providing the time-differences are remembered. More seriously, in conjunction with satellite television, world news is instantly on our screens, sometimes even as it happens. Such exposure of, usually, unhappy events, wars, accidents, acts of terrorism etc can actually have a bad influence on the course of a war, a hostage-taking, or a tribal massacre. When it took a British ship four months to deliver a letter to or from, say, India, the crisis had often been settled locally, with much less anxiety all round.\n\nThe telephone has greatly decreased the volume of mail worldwide. Some letters have to be written, of course, but the art of private letter writing has become a dying art. Writing a good letter means first collecting then sorting out one's thoughts, and the finished article can be something to be proud of, a small masterpiece. And because letters today are considered of secondary importance, mail services in many countries have greatly deteriorated.\n\nOne of the most annoying experiences in life is to be seated in somebody's office and to begin to talk business when suddenly the telephone rings. \"Oh, excuse me\", says the official, \"I must answer this\". Why should the telephone be given priority over the individual who has taken the trouble to attend in person ?\n\nThe telephone can become a curse in the home, when it is abused either by the caller or by a family member. Most countries have customary hours for mealtimes, and a caller who is determined to speak to you at all costs will often make use of this knowledge, interrupt your meal, and perhaps or perhaps not apologize for doing so. Small wonder that many people take the phone off the hook when they sit down to eat.\n\nThere are the callers you can well do without. Some commercial concerns employ salespeople to use the hard sell on the telephone, and this is becoming such a nuisance that in many cases the problem is being brought under legal control. The worst kind of unwanted calls are abusive calls or obscene calls, made usually to single women and often late at night. Modern telephone systems can be made to identify the source of these calls, and this should go some way to helping the police solve the problem.\n\nFamily members have been mentioned, and here one thinks of the commercial exploitation of teenagers who are pressed to use chat-lines to pour out their troubles, or to talk to teenager pals overseas. Neither occupation offers any benefit, and the parents' phone bill may become astronomical.\n\nDoes all this mean that the telephone is really a curse? Of course not. Like any other advance in science the telephone is neutral. If it is abused, it becomes a curse. If properly used it is a great blessing in many ways.\n\nTo the lonely person, telephone chats are a blessing. To the disabled person, the telephone may be the only means of keeping in touch with family and friends. To the business, the stock exchange, and countless other features of modern life, the telephone is essential. In the police response to crime, in fire or medical emergencies, the telephone is indispensable. In all matters which require urgent communication and quick response, such as the locating of suitable bodily organs for transplant surgery, the telephone is a boon. For air to ground and ship to shore communication, the telephone is vital. Properly and responsibly used, it is a blessing."

        "title": "What are the qualities of a good teacher ?",
        "content": "Every student has his or her favorite teacher, but that teacher may not be the best qualified person on the teaching staff. In other words, although the mastery of the subject or subjects taught, plus an enthusiastic approach, is an essential prerequisite in a teacher, it is far from being the only qualification. There are some who know their subjects but totally fail to put them across to the students.\nLet us first examine the negative side. Unless the teacher has a voice which carries, without shouting, there will always be inattention at the back of the class. There are teachers who cannot stop talking, and who will lecture a class for forty minutes. Most students will be asleep after the first fifteen minutes. There are teachers whose manners and dress are eccentric; they may be popular, but few students take them seriously. There are teachers who either shout at or speak sarcastically to backward students. They are disliked by the whole class. There are teachers who prefer to talk about the football team or a certain television program rather than the subject they are paid to teach. While this again may achieve popularity, it certainly evokes no respect. There are teachers whose lives are marred by drink, drugs, or sexual deviation. These cannot begin to be effective teachers. So what are the positive qualities the student looks for ?\n\nA good teacher must be able to exercise discipline. Teaching cannot begin in an unruly class. In the past, class discipline has usually been strict and inflexible. The more modern approach is to allow more freedom of speech and movement, though no individual can be allowed to dominate proceedings by rough and noisy behavior. All teachers know the difference between a lively and a disruptive student. To be able to exert the right kind of discipline can be learnt, but this is often by bitter experience. There are a few fortunate men and women who have only to walk into a classroom to create order. Unfortunately there are more whose entry is a signal for chaos.\n\nStudents are always ready to work to the best of their ability for someone whom they respect, for two reasons. The first is the desire to please that person. The second, more important reason, is the knowledge that the teacher has the student's best interests at heart.\n\nStudy has two objectives, and a careful balance between the two must be kept by the teacher. The first is the ability to instill a love of the subject taught, which will be maintained in adult life. The second is to prepare the students as well as possible for the next examination, be it O or A level or university entrance in some cases. On the other hand, if, say, English is taught exclusively to cover the examination syllabus by means of learning context passages and model answers by heart, the subject will become boring. If there hadn't too much attention paid to generalizations about literature and its place in social evolution, then the lessons may well be interesting but the student will go unprepared into the examination room.\n\nThere should also be a balance between how much work the teacher does and how much the student does. Some modern educational theorists disapprove of any talking by the teacher beyond the bare minimum. Unfortunately, if students' work is not carefully guided, and if they are given free expression in their approach to any subject, most of them will learn nothing of value. Avoiding the lecture habit, the good teacher, who has already done his or her lesson preparation, will help the student to achieve certain objectives in each lesson by, a mixture of verbal instruction and class work. Television, radio and other visual aids are only marginally helpful, and should be kept to a minimum.\n\nIn schools which are not streamed, there will always be class members who are sometimes incapable of doing the work which others find easy. A good teacher will help them individually, sometimes after school hours, and if they are non-achievers, set them simpler work.\n\nTo a certain extent, a good teacher needs to be a psychologist, able to detect and advise on mental blockages, which are sometimes due to outside emotional disturbances. A good teacher should be someone you can trust and talk to, and whose sane advice on your personal problems is worth listening to."

        "title": "Do you think that there is any need for change in the education system in your country?",
        "content": "This essay examines the current situation in England and will, if at all, apply only in part to other countries. Educational tradition and emphasis vary widely, but the fact remains that whereas Eastern and some Western countries are producing young people well-trained for key employment and well-suited to modern life, England is, in 1990, signally failing to do either. How can this decline be reversed?\nFirst, it should be understood that there is a dual system in England. The private, or fee-paying sector stands alongside the state, or free sector, but between the two there is a great gulf fixed. Standards in the private sector remain very high, and produce the best results both academically and behaviorally. A few independent grammar schools likewise succeed, and even fewer comprehensive schools. The state sector is an almost unqualified failure. Many pupils leave school illiterate and innumerate and are fitted only for the lowest-grade jobs. The situation is so bad that both the Labor and the Conservative parties have education at the top of their respective agendas.\n\nThe decline dates from the 1960s, the era of drugs, protest, pop music and the hippy outlook. All this was a reaction against wartime restraints and disciplines, but with the coming of the new freedoms the best of the old tradition was lost. Suddenly the 'teenager' was invented. Neither home nor school could any longer exert discipline. In any case the old sanctions, including corporal punishment, were made illegal. At the same time the economy was booming and there was plenty of work, and therefore money, for young people. So parents, even if they had ambitions for their children, were mostly powerless to instill incentive. At the same time the teaching profession lost heart in the face of classroom chaos and often personal intimidation. To complete the cause for decline, the educational theorists had been at work. Education became child-centered, which means that if little Willy doesn't want to do his match, let him do what he wants. Competitiveness, both in the classroom and on the games field, was frowned on, because to lose, they said, made children feel inferior.\n\nThe consequence of all this was that teaching no longer attracted the best brains, and the profession plummeted in reputation. Both political parties now vie with each other in bringing forward plans to remedy a situation which, if not universally bad, is appalling in the densely-populated city areas.\n\nIdeally, education should offer the pupil three main objectives. These are: to fit well into society, to cope with modern types of employment, and to continue with self-education after school days. Commercially and industrially, England is becoming increasingly integrated into Europe. That, plus national pride and pride in oneself should provide incentive enough. The latent talent is there, but how can these incentives be imparted? And how can teacher quality and morale be improved? Not merely by throwing money at the problem.\n\nThere should be free and subsidized creche places, since most women have to work at least part-time. England has far too many single-parent families. Ideally there would be a return to the traditional family. Parents should help children at home and try to fire their enthusiasm for work. Parental partnership with teachers should be much closer.\n\nState education should drop peripheral subjects and concentrate on the traditional teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic in the early years. Only when they are proficient in these should children branch out into other subjects. There should be state-run examinations at three-yearly intervals. These would not only check the child's progress but also the teacher's proficiency. A system of awards to both teachers and pupils could be introduced. All this implies a national curriculum geared to the objectives outlined above.\n\nAt about age thirteen it will become obvious whether a child is suited to a science or an arts course, or to neither. Separate provision should then be made for all three categories. Youth Training Schemes for the third category should be greatly extended and made compulsory. There should be more technical colleges. Craftsmen should be encouraged to take on apprentices and the income of both should be subsidized.\n\nThe A level and university entrance systems in England are good, and should be preserved, and steps are being taken to improve the O level examinations which are now being replaced by the GCSE.\n\nThe present Conservative government plans to implement many of these ideas. The real problem lies in the middle i.e. in primary and secondary education. Correct this, discard faddy theories, and the new ideas will rapidly bear fruit. Staff will improve, and will therefore be entitled to increased pay and better standing in the community."

        "title": "Is it right that a pop singer should earn more money than a nurse?",
        "content": "Certainly not, if you believe that payment should be related to a person's value to society. The skilled nurse probably saves more lives than either the doctor or the surgeon who, in most countries, are paid infinitely more. In the UK the State Registered Nurse is paid more than the State Enrolled Nurse, because he or she has higher qualifications. Yet, even the highest qualified nurse today cannot afford to service a mortgage on a house. Their union deplores industrial action by the profession, but nevertheless it has meant strikes in the UK to force a reluctant government into financing better incomes in the National Health Service, and in the view of many these incomes remain inadequate.\nThe reason is that in a capitalist society incomes depend on the market economy i.e. supply and demand. If you supply a need and are in a minority you can command a high income. In a socialist state, the government evaluates the contributions of all workers and fixes wages accordingly. This seems a fair system. Yet, the reality of the situation is that any government's ability to pay depends on the size of the gross national product. If this is inadequate, everybody's pay will be low, with the exception of the favored few, and standards of living will also be low. It is therefore an irony that many governments are abandoning socialism in favor of the freedom of the market economy to create wealth. In doing so, they abandon what is perhaps a more moral job evaluation. Because on the whole there are enough nurses, they needn't be paid very high salaries.\n\nAmong young people the demand for pop music is insatiable. The supply is relatively small. The reasons for the demand are complex. Most young people go through a phase from, say, age thirteen to seventeen during which they long for certain things; freedom from parental control and from the accepted behavioral norms of society; freedom from dress conventions; freedom to protest against war, poverty, injustice, the police, sexual conventions, the establishment in general. With the utmost cynicism, the promoters of pop foster all these instincts. The other factor is that nowadays teenagers can earn or be given far more money than the same age-group ever had in earlier days. Thus there is a ready market for records, discs, tapes, T-shirts with the appropriate logos, concerts, TV and radio broadcasts. Unscrupulous promoters are often connected with the drug racket. Cynical promoters cash in on the charitable instincts of the young by organizing band-aid concerts. So whoever loses, the promoter wins. So do a very small proportion of the bands and singers. The vast majority eke out a poor living by playing and singing in public houses (bars) and local halls.\n\nSo the question really refers to the small minority who are successful. For every Madonna, there are a thousand would-bes. The women sometimes descend to pornographic videos and the men become builders' laborers. Few pop performers stand the test of time. Even fewer, who have bought large houses, powerful cars and yachts can save their money or preserve the life-style which belonged to their days of glory.\n\nWe live in a real world, which is fast becoming a shrine of materialism. It is no more moral for a pop singer to earn a fortune that it is for a property dealer or a business tycoon. Yet, that is life in the western and westernized world. What is immoral is that a nurse has to fight for a living wage. Nursing is after all a vocation, like that of the doctor, the priest or the social worker. The people served are more important than the money. Yet, many governments take advantage of the nursing vocation. In some respects they are as cynical as the pop promoters."

        "content": "Genetic research has made rapid strides over the past few years. The analysis of genes has had a practical effect on human medicine as well as on animal and plant life. Tendencies to physical and mental handicap can be detected at the pre-embryo stage, i.e. during the first fourteen days after conception. Manipulation and very early abortion are therefore possible. Opinion is divided as to the morality of this interference. The UK government has achieved approval for genetic research subject to stringent safeguards in its application. The breeding of animals, especially for export, is also affected, as is the development of plants and seeds with an immunity to diseases which previously could only be prevented by dangerous spraying.\nGreat strides have been made in the use of laser beams. These are extreme concentrations of light which have great cutting and penetrative power. They are used medically, for ophthalmic repairs to the retina, for the penetration of opacity in various contexts, e.g. astronomy and military tactics, for public display purposes, and for cutting purposes in industrial work.\n\nElectronics have increasingly wide uses in today's world. This development of ordinary electricity allows its conduction in a gas, a vacuum or a semiconductor. Compact printed circuits are now used in a wide variety of devices ranging from spacecraft to radio and TV sets, computers to screen games and automatic chess boards. Television program changes are now effected by small remote panels which convey recognizable signals which instruct the set itself. Garage doors can be opened automatically by the same means. Security outside lighting around houses comes on automatically when a person approaches within a certain distance. Electronics have permitted a host of new devices such as the cellular telephone. These are cordless, and though limited in range are just as efficient as the old cable version which of course is still in more general use. The police can make reports to base or ask for immediate help in emergencies. Business can be carried on to and from the motor car. The telephone can be used anywhere in the house or garden.\n\nAgain, the use of radio waves has become very widespread. In biology, they are used to study the effect of radiation on living tissue. Radiocarbon, an isotope, is used to date geological strata, old manuscripts, archaeological artifacts, paintings etc. It is also used in genetic research, for sonar and aircraft altimeters, for space astronomy and for the reception of signals from outer space. Radio is crucial to today's investigation of the universe.\n\nFor many years it has been possible to convey the printed word instantaneously over long distances by using the telephone system, i.e. the teleprinter. The use of fax or facsimile machines using the same system to convey images very accurately to a print-out machine has its obvious uses both for internal and international trade, and these are now very widespread. All businesses of any size use them.\n\nSatellites can be used for a variety of terrestrial as well as space research purposes. Using a dish which points to the satellite, modern TV sets can receive a much wider range of channels. These can also be received across adjacent countries' boundaries, sometimes with political consequences. Satellites are also used for radio and telephonic communications, and have certain military functions.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change came about when computers became small enough to be manageable. Today, they are used for an enormous number of purposes. On a national scale they store and produce on demand information for all government departments. They are used in business, in shops, in schools, in industrial production, in spacecraft, in military contexts and in private homes. Yet, they present problems. Their memory may be lost. They are susceptible to the new crime of computer hacking for purposes of industrial espionage or simply mischief. They contain and sometimes disclose confidential personal information, and this may seriously damage the individual. Yet, they have come to stay. Many schools teach their use from the primary stage onwards. This is essential to all pupils who expect a career in any sphere above manual work. They are integral to much modern medical work, especially in the diagnostic and monitoring spheres.\n\nAll of these advances affect modern life, perhaps predominantly the computer. Ironically, the concept is at least one hundred and fifty years old, but prototypes were mechanical and far too large to be feasible in use. The first serviceable example was used for code-breaking in the Second World War, and since those days the computer has never looked back."

        "title": "Can money buy happiness?",
        "content": "The title of the old American movie 'Poor little rich girl' answers the question. It is true that at weddings we often hear the newly-weds toasted in the words Health, Wealth and Happiness, but the epithet itself distinguishes between the three objectives. The fact is that you can be both happy and healthy and poor, by normal standards, at the same time. Yet, if you are unhappy, money can only cure your misery in some circumstances. And if you have an incurable illness no amount of money can buy the treatment to reverse that condition.\nMost people would accept that the human being is a composite of body, mind and spirit. Each of those parts has separate needs which must be fulfilled if happiness is to result. This fulfillment is most often, though not always, achieved through the love and companionship found in a good marriage. The newly-weds referred to above may start out together with few possessions and little money and still be blissfully happy. Body, mind and spirit are fulfilled. Yet, marital happiness is not a static thing. As the couple grow older they change, and happiness has to be constantly worked for if it is to mature into lifelong love and friendship. Sadly enough the divorce rate in the west shows that many couples lack that incentive, and are not prepared to show the unselfishness and willingness to put the needs of each other first, necessary if happiness is to last. Very often, this process of alienation goes on at the very time when the couple are getting past their money problems, when the pennies no longer have to be counted.\n\nThis situation is highlighted when money never has been a problem, as in the case of some of the British royal family. Differences in outlook, i.e. in mind and spirit, sever relationships most effectively. Whereas one royal, for instance, was interested only in farming and country pursuits, the wife, some years ago, decided to devote her life to 'Save the Children'. Money never entered the equation. They are permanently separated. Mind and spirit had grown apart.\n\nIf old money can be irrelevant, new money can be a positive menace. Every week in England somebody becomes a sterling millionaire having entered a winning football pool forecast. More often than not, the winner's cry is 'spend, spend, spend!' , and the money soon goes. In the process, homes shatter, bad relationships are formed, drugs and alcohol are abused, and often the winner ends up with nothing.\n\nSo at least this can be said. Money itself is neutral. The ideal is wise stewardship, i.e. its proper use, which generally means making one's existing lifestyle more comfortable, but using excess income for charitable purposes. Money should not be seen as the key to luxury and self-indulgence. Money is not the root of all evil, but the correct version is true enough; the love of money is the root of all evil . The love of money is a cold, alienating obsession. Was Howard Hughes a happy man?\n\nWhat can also be said is that whereas money cannot buy happiness, the lack of it can bring misery. Few things are worse than debt, as the family of Charles Dickens' Mr Micawber knew full well. It is the duty of men, and in many cases today of women, to provide enough money for the family to live in reasonable comfort. It is not their duty to provide that comfort by going into debt. The modern way of doing so is through the credit card which, if abused, is the sure road to unhappiness. As Dickens said, annual income £1 annual expenditure 19s 6d, the result, happiness. Annual income £1 annual expenditure £1 6d, the result, misery.\n\nThere is, perhaps, one sense in which money can buy happiness, and that is among the poorest of the poor in the third world. Happiness for them would be a safe home, enough food, medical care, and a school for their children. One day, the conscience of the world will ensure that they are given these things."

        "title": "Do you think that rituals, customs and ceremonies still have a part to play in modern society?",
        "content": "There are several factors which appear to militate against the continuation of rituals, customs and ceremonies in modern society. The first is the life-style norm in industrialized and westernized countries. An agricultural existence may be hard, but it is steady and unhurried. Modern living is fast living. Men and women work perhaps sixty hours a week in the factory, office or shop. Food imports mean that they are less dependent on the land, so the old customs connected with fertility and the propitiation of hostile spirits, all based in animistic beliefs, have become irrelevant. The climate of outlook has also changed. The religious and political hold of the old time chiefs has largely been replaced by democracy, in some cases one of the enlightened religions, and in others a kind of hybrid of materialism and humanism. So it might seem that the new will inevitably replace the old, inexorably if not quickly.\nIn some respects, ritual, custom and ceremony may have a reactionary, indeed at times positively malevolent influence. The modern world has set certain standards of human rights, in religion, in sexual and racial parity, in speech, in education, in political freedom, in freedom of travel. The objective is humane behavior within countries, and international peace and co-operation. Yet, in certain countries barbaric customs remain, especially where women are denied equality. Suttee. The harem. Slavery. Female circumcision. The cutting off of hands for theft. Floggings. Automatic torture, isolation and deprivation for prisoners, whether political or criminal. There is no place for these customs in the modern world.\n\nYet, some customs remain good, and should not be abandoned. The custom of hospitality to strangers, and of ensuring their safety while they stay with the host. The custom of giving to the poor. The custom of helping one's neighbor in distress. Many customs connected with the dead, for example the wake. This ensures solidarity with the bereaved, and has a strong therapeutic effect. Customs connected with courtesy; behavior in public and as a guest; good manners at table, the wearing of the correct dress for a particular occasion. Modern society would be poorer without these things.\n\nMuch the same applies to rituals and ceremonies. Where any of these retain a helpful meaning they are worth preserving. Of course, some have lost their original significance with the passage of time, and should be discarded. Yet very many, particularly those connected with religion, remain powerful for good. Religious services are more meaningful if they include music, colour and movement, and where each action brings an article of the faith concerned vividly to life. Much the same applies to the coronation of a monarch, where religion meets power and authority in ceremonial. The fact that judges wear special robes, and enter court in procession, reflects the dignity of the law. The same applies to the Speaker's procession in the UK House of Commons. The same applies to the military ceremonies of Changing the Guard and Trooping the color. The service for the launching of a ship recognizes the mariner's dependence on God. There are also worthwhile ceremonies connected with receiving a degree, or being called to the bar. Wedding and funeral ceremonies reflect happiness or sorrow and solemnity. Even the All Blacks carry out a Maori war dance before a match, and they remain very hard to beat !\n\nHowever modern, practical and enlightened modern society may be, people remain the products of their ancestry. History has passed on a profusion of rituals, customs and ceremonies. Some have become meaningless, or are positively inhumane, and society can do without them. However, probably far more enrich the lives of those whose existence could easily become barren and humdrum if the past were to be discarded."

        "title": "Patriotism has no place in an international society. Do you agree ?",
        "content": "Traditionally, patriotism has usually been regarded as a virtue. Horace said dulce et decorum est pro patria mori -- it is sweet and honorable to die for one's country. Sir Walter Scott wrote :\n \n\n'Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,\n\nWho never to himself hath said,\n\n'This is my own, my native land !'\n\nUsually, yes. Most of us have a built-in affection for the land which reared us, and to which we owe much. Wars down the centuries prove that men and woman spring to its defense in times of crisis.\n\nYet patriotism, love of country, has not always been approved when it amounts to 'my country, right or wrong'. O'Flaherty VC, a George Bernard Shaw character, said 'you'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race'. Of course that was Shaw in 1915, when men were dying by the tens of thousands. Yet much earlier Samuel Johnson had said 'Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel'.\n\nSo thinkers, whether classical or relatively modern, are divided in their opinions.\n\nWe are of course dealing with today, a time in which travel and communications have advanced with giant strides. In fact, there is a fashionable one-world concept. This outlook postulates that humanity is one. There should be no racial, cultural or political barriers. The identities of individual countries should disappear. Loyalty should be to the human race, not to one's country of origin. Humanity should become a worldwide melting-pot.\n\nYet, since we are dealing with today, we should concentrate on realism rather than idealism. The flaw in the one-world argument is that human nature does not change. Greed, aggression and the inability to forget old disputes create a perpetual, unchanging barrier. Changes in outlook rarely occur until they are enforced by catastrophe. Despite the holocaust, neo-Nazism has re-appeared in Germany. Despite all peace-keeping efforts, Jew and Arab will never live side by side in amity. Territorial disputes, as in Ireland, as in Yugoslavia, as affecting the Maories, the North American Indians, the whites and blacks in South Africa, are unlikely ever to be resolved.\n\nIf communications, modern travel and the spread of democracy in erstwhile Communist countries make the one-world concept a realistic possibility, other detrimental modern advances counteract the new challenge.\n\nIrresponsible governments are acquiring nuclear potential. The international arms trade flourishes as liberal governments pay lip-service to control but cynically fail to take action. Freed from the shackles of Communism, the eastern part of the Old Soviet Union is fast becoming a series of independent states, struggling to achieve western forms of democracy, ambitious to create market economies, careful to retain the Soviet nuclear armaments located in their territories. The whole political thrust is towards nationalism. Not only states, but also races, as in Yugoslavia and Iraq, wish to become autonomous. They are fiercely determined to preserve their identities, because apart from political and economic there are also social and ethnic factors to consider. Peoples are not readily going to sacrifice their customs and traditions.\n\nThat is why patriotism will continue to hold a strong position in the modern world for the foreseeable future. A strong United Nations can and does prevent, or at least try to prevent national and racial excesses of the worst kind. And if nations and races could achieve their legitimate political and economic aims by peaceful means, if the strong would help, rather than dominate the weak, then the time might come when wars became a thing of the past. In that imaginary situation, the best kind of patriotism, love of country, would evoke the best from all people in the realms of material progress, education, sport, international co-operation.\n\nThe unhappy fact, however, is that the world is bedeviled by the worst kind of patriotism - the use of 'love of country' as a cover for excess and atrocity. Men and women are imprisoned, beaten and tortured. A regime will try to exterminate Jews, gypsies and the handicapped. An old man will show no remorse at having murdered ten thousand Buddhist monks. Innocent hostages will be taken to be used as political bargaining counters. Essential foods and medical supplies will be denied to the starving.\n\nAnd all in the name of patriotism."

        "content": "Much to his housekeeper's disgust, the great fictional detective Sherlock Holmes carried out scientific experiments in his Baker Street rooms in the cause of solving crimes. Since his day, science has played an increasingly important part in both the detection and the proof of crime. Technology, the derivative of science, is used by most countries' police forces today and is responsible for bringing many criminals to justice. Dr Crippen escaped by liner to the United States, but an early ship to shore radio telephone enabled the police to arrest him when the liner docked.\nFootprint casts and fingerprints are traditional methods of detection. Fingerprinting was invented in Great Britain by Francis Galton and has been of fundamental importance in detection for decades. Some countries fingerprint their whole populations, though others, Britain included, regard this as an infringement of personal freedom, and restrict fingerprinting to those accused of a criminal offence, or to those who are screened for certain security categories. Science has greatly enhanced the efficiency of this system. Fingerprints are now held on computer, and much time and cost is saved by the fact that information can be exchanged instantaneously throughout the country. Co-operation with the National Crime Information Center in the US and with Interpol in the continent of Europe greatly enhances this facility.\n\nRecords of convicted criminals are now held on microfilm in conjunction with fingerprints, photographs and personal profiles and stored as computer data. These, again, are capable of instant retrieval countrywide and can also be made available overseas. In the UK, this data cannot be disclosed to a jury during a criminal trial, but should the verdict be guilty a previous criminal record becomes available in the matter of sentencing. The polygraph, or lie detector, is not university sanctioned. Its supporters claim that its ability to record nervous tensions is infallible. Others disagree.\n\nVery recently, DNA printing has revolutionized the process of bringing the criminal to justice, and in civil actions establishing paternity. The minutest quantities of blood, skin, hair or nail-parings can positively identify or eliminate the individual concerned. No two individuals have identical sets of genes. This scientific advance is particularly important in the examination of cars and rooms where crimes have been committed.\n\nInterrogation has always been an important part of criminal investigation. In uncivilized countries, drugs, psychological pressure and often physical torture have been, and still are used. These methods are banned in civilized countries. However, even in the latter, the police occasionally enforce signatures to false statements or to statements which are subsequently mutilated. Taped interviews today now go some way to overcome this abuse, though even tapes can be falsified.\n\nA good deal of crime detection and prevention has been privatized in recent years. Some countries allow firearms to security guards, others, such as the UK, do not. Various pieces of technology are in common use. Closed-circuit TV cameras allow centralized observation of customers in large stores. Flood-lighting around buildings can be triggered electronically when anybody approaches in the dark. Foot patrols are issued with light intensifiers, a military development, enabling them to see without being seen. Electric eye burglar alarms have been in use both in public buildings and in private homes for many years.\n\nObservation by police 'on the beat' who know their own areas intimately has always been a recognized and valuable means of crime detection and prevention, bolstering the citizen's sense of security. Unfortunately, this is being replaced by police car patrols. And although the latter are in radio communication with officers on foot and with police headquarters, the general public see this development as retrograde.\n\nDespite all the above, crime is on the increase in many countries. Its detection is no doubt becoming more efficient, due to scientific advance. This is related to an entirely different factor; the decline in religious faith and observance, which instills moral standards into children."

        "title": "If you were editing a monthly magazine for your age group, what main features would you include, and why?",
        "content": "In this essay, the 16 to 18 years age group is envisaged, and it is assumed that you, whether boy or girl, are 17 years old. You have left school with a good academic record but have decided to go straight into the publishing business. The principal of your firm has seen copies of the school magazine, which you edited, and believes you may have a flair for editorial work. She thinks there is a gap in the market for a monthly magazine aimed at your age group. Since you know the interests of your peers, you are given a free hand in selecting the main features of your magazine, but you will of course receive professional help. So your principal has asked you to list these features, giving your reasons, and you produce the following.\nA title must be found which is attractive, 'with it', and non-sexist. Since the magazine is aimed at both sexes, there must be a balance between male and female interests. By far the majority of the features will be of common interest. Young men today are as interested in fashion as young women. Both need advice on sex and romance. Girls often enjoy sports news as much as boys.\n\nMost young people are interested in pop groups and stars. Features on those of worldwide fame, such as (in 1992) Madonna, Jason Donovan and lead actors in highly successful films such as 'Robin Hood' and 'Crocodile Dundee' have an immediate appeal. Care will be taken to edit out dirt and scandal. This feature can also provide critiques of national, even local groups. This can be mutually beneficial.\n\nConnected with the above is the release of CDs, tapes, single and LP discs. Many young people are interested in classical music, so this area must not be overlooked.\n\nThe cinema is far more important in India and the Far East than it is in the West, where it has largely been displaced by TV. Television 'soaps', several emanating from Australia, are aimed at this age-group, with which they have become very popular, so some lively notes on what has been seen over the past month should be included.\n\nSex and romance are of absorbing interest to young people. Many are worldly-wise, some are naive, all need advice. This must be on the practical level, with a view to protection against disease, unwanted pregnancies and the modern scourge of AIDS. Religion and parental training should take care of the moral side. An opportunity should be given for young people to write in to the magazine for advice on personal problems.\n\nA health column for both sexes would be popular. A qualified practitioner would provide advice on problems important to the teenager but perhaps too trivial for the surgery. These include skin problems such as acne, weight-watching, balanced diet, exercise and so on. Again, letters to the column would be welcomed.\n\nSports provides an important feature. This would include news of and comment on all major sporting events, both national and international. Personal profiles and interviews with stars are always popular.\n\nToday, boys are just as interested in fashion as girls. Teenage clothing and footwear would feature prominently. In many countries today, teenagers have a higher percentage of disposable income than any other age group, and much of this is spent on fashion items. Hair-styling also comes into this category.\n\nA very important feature could be job advice for those leaving school but not proceeding to further education. This section would include information on training schemes, advice on interviewing, and for those interested, an indication of opportunities overseas.\n\nTeenagers are concerned with two topics, both of which could form important features: charity work and the environment. Many young people look for opportunities of helping others less fortunate, both at home and overseas. Preservation of our planet, and of threatened wildlife strike a chord. They are willing to set aside time for both activities.\n\nSome countries have a drugs problem affecting this age-group, and none are totally exempt from crime. The hazards of both could be regularly emphasized together with their effects both on perpetrator and victim.\n\nGeneral knowledge quizzes, crossword puzzles perhaps based on teenage interests, and notes on popular indoor activities such as video and board games would provide another attractive feature.\n\nSo also would letters to the editor and printed replies on selected topics. Suggestions for new features would be welcomed. This personal communication between magazine and reader is of the greatest importance.\n\nOccasional prizes and giveaway features such as posters of popular stars would all help circulation.\n\nSuch are the important features. Good illustration and professional writing are obviously necessary. Copy prices would be at the top end of the bracket. A well thought-out launch would be vital."

        "title": "Television will eventually be the death of sport'. Do you agree?",
        "content": "The word sport covers a multitude of activities, ranging from athletics to the field sports, hunting, shooting and fishing; from rowing to equestrian events, from boxing to hockey and soccer. To assert that TV will kill these off is obvious nonsense. With or without TV, the instinct to pursue these activities will remain. Sport enhances health, builds muscle, satisfies the competitive instinct, encourages fair play, and creates friendships and excellent social contacts among those who share sporting interests. Since Greek and Roman times, when the Olympics were founded, and took place, as today, at four-yearly intervals, sport in some shape or form has always been a leisure occupation, and it will certainly take more than the downside of television to kill it off. We will consider that downside in a moment.\nFirst, the benefits of television coverage should be appreciated. It is undeniable that televised sport offers first-class entertainment to those who are interested. The watcher watches in comfort, out of the rain and the cold. It is also undeniable that some sports, e.g. golf, come across far better on TV than they possibly can to the spectator on the spot. The cameras keep up with the ball in its full are, underlining the outstanding prowess of the top players. Team games can also be watched in comfort, and again with a comprehensive view of the whole pitch. The zoom-lens gives close-ups from many angles, and the immediate play-back facility shows the top-class players' abilities, the fouls, both accidental and professional , and the refereeing standards. All brilliantly exposed. Sponsorship provides crucial funds to sports teams at all levels, whether their matches are televised or not. Sponsors fund teams in proportion to television coverage and ground attendance. So improvements to grounds and spectator facilities are made possible, and money is provided for the purchase of star players. Finally, to be able to watch the top players perform with apparently effortless brilliance must encourage young people to go out and try to do likewise. Today, sponsorship provides money for the rich rewards available to stars, and this offers an added incentive to young hopefuls.\n\nOf course, televised sport has its drawbacks. Many people believe that ideally all sport should be amateur, the pursuit of physical excellence for its own sake, and with no financial reward. The film 'Chariots of Fire' highlighted a brilliant young miler. But as he moved towards Olympic status he too had a trainer!\n\nWas the trainer unpaid? It is certainly true that television encourages professionalism, even among amateurs. Rugby football in the UK, the amateur game, has been forced into a league system, which leads to star poaching. It also moves players towards demanding money, particularly when training occupies an increasing amount of unpaid time. Stars, who lose months every year on tours, must, realistically, be repaid. At present, amateurs are indirectly recompensed through giving their names to newspaper articles, by writing and signing books, by endorsements of sports goods and by appearances at functions. Television exposure is behind all this. This is why many people basically disapprove. The line between the pro and the amateur is becoming blurred.\n\nAnother criticism is more arguable. It is that many people are becoming sport watchers rather than sport players. There is also the argument that the television has reduced gates at unglamorous matches and events, and this has already led to the sale of many run-of-the-mill clubs, or their liquidation. Moreover, the excitement of the crowd atmosphere is lost in one's own home. As with the cinema, a visit is preferable to watching on the box .\n\nThirdly, there is the old Olympic ideal. This is, partly, to spread international goodwill. Today, through satellite television, the Olympics are watched worldwide by untold millions. Does this foster goodwill and fair play, or does it tend to nationalism, a win at all costs attitude? And it may be coincidence, but drug abuse among athletes has grown up alongside television.\n\nThe money motivation has been mentioned. It seems not unreasonable for players, whether amateur or professional, to be properly recompensed, but television creates stars , whether real or bogus, and these people can demand enormous sums, out of all proportion to their contributions and abilities. This hype is to be deplored. It does nothing for sport.\n\nSo television may be said to do as much harm as good. However, it will never be the death of sport ."

        "title": "Should the press be completely free?",
        "content": "Under a dictatorship the press is completely under the control of the government. The implications of this are that the authorities discard all stories unfavorable to their policies and supplement the favorable ones with propaganda and disinformation . All this involves control of TV and radio; in many countries, listening to broadcasts such as the BBC World Service, now available everywhere because of short-wave satellite output, is proscribed. People are not fools, however, and such dictatorship can lead to unrest and produce the opposite to the intended effect.\nIn most democracies, there is a varying degree of freedom. In Britain, for example, the government only steps in during wartime, apart from exerting control over stories which the Home Office regards as dangerous to the national interest, i.e. top security information. In these cases, a 'D Notice' forbids publication. Otherwise, and in peacetime, the press is entirely free to publish at will, subject to the following conditions: the material must be truthful, decent, and compatible with the laws of libel.\n\nLibelous material of course sells newspapers and magazines, and certain unscrupulous editors will publish for this reason alone, setting aside money to settle the damages in civil law which will inevitably follow.\n\nMuch of this is based on a section of the people's pleasure in seeing prominent people discredited. For example, Jeffrey Archer was awarded a half million pounds a few years ago because his personal morals were brought into question; Elton John received substantial damages because of a scurrilous and untrue account of the way he was said to treat his pet dogs. The courts now tend to award according to the seriousness of the alleged offence rather than on the prominence of the person concerned. The crux of the matter is whether the story is true. David Mellor, a prominent secretary of state, recently had some aspects of his personal life exposed. He did not challenge the stories, and chose to resign on the tacit admission that his lack of judgment precluded him from parliamentary office.\n\nA story may be defamatory, but if it is true there is nothing to stop its publication. This is the basic test on which most editors take their decisions, and logically there is no challenging this principle in a democracy. However, there are two classes of reporting in the British tabloid press which have incurred much public displeasure in recent years.\n\nThe first is the invasion of privacy. After some disaster, those closely concerned are often hounded by the press for human stories . This amounts to an unwarranted intrusion into private grief. The more distressed the interviewee the less he or she is spared.\n\nThe second is the gathering of newshounds, the paparazzi , with their long-distance telephoto lenses, their listening devices and their phone-tapping proclivities. These reporters dog the footsteps of very prominent people, such as the British royals. It so happens that two royal marriages have recently come on the rocks , with close friends of both parties involved in each case. For some weeks these stories sold millions of extra copies of the tabloids. There was much criticism in parliament, but nothing could be done; the stories were not denied. The editors claimed the right to publish on the ground that the stories were true, whatever methods were used to obtain them.\n\nPerhaps decency is the other issue. Some men like looking at nude women, and no doubt the regular 'Page 3 girl' sells many copies of the tabloids. The editors know exactly how far they can go without incurring the laws against pornography.\n\nIn Britain, complaints are heard by the Press Council, a self-governing but rather toothless body. Today there is a strong move to tighten controls by legislation, particularly in the case of infringement of privacy, and over the methods used to obtain information, particularly trespass. However, in any society there is always a demand for the sensational, and in a democracy repressive legislation is unwise. Part of the health of a good system lies in editorial freedom to criticize or applaud, and nobody should be exempted. After all, if there is nothing to bring into the open, there is no story. On the contrary, if there is real corruption, as in the cases of BCCI or Robert Maxwell, the press does the public a service by exposing the details.\nCompletely free is too sweeping a phrase. Yes, the press should be free, but subject to the controls mentioned above. Most democracies get it almost right."

        "title": "How far should architecture be both beautiful and practical? Discuss with reference to particular examples in your country.",
        "content": "Architecture may be defined as a combination of function and beauty in the art of building. Until the mid-19th century, all building was governed by three structural principles: the post and lintel, the wooden truss, and the masonry arch. From then, and especially since the 1930s, architecture has been revolutionized by the use of new materials, basically the steel skeleton and reinforced concrete. Thus, structures were freed from the weight limitations imposed by stone and brick at each floor level, so that greater flexibility in design was possible and virtually no limitation imposed on height. From very early times until the 19th century, building limitations had imposed certain styles on architecture, now known as classical styles. In the 20th century, certain innovative architects, such as Gropius, Le Corbusier and Mies van den Rohe broke away from these styles and produced fundamentally new buildings both for public and domestic use. Most modern architecture derives from these pioneers.\nSuch is a very general statement about what has happened in the Western world. All countries, however, have their indigenous architecture, differing widely in outward appearance but historically limited by the same weight considerations as have applied in the West. Alongside this, the new architecture has been adopted in the East. An observer could stand in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, London or New York, and not note any essential differences. However, many capital or large cities have placed these new buildings alongside traditional examples, with dire results. St Paul's Cathedral in London is overshadowed by a skyscraper bank complex, a tragedy to anyone with aesthetic values. Wren's magnificent structure once dominated the high ground on the north bank of the Thames and was visible from most parts of London. This is no longer so. The Prince of Wales has rightly castigated the modern architects who have been responsible for this visual vandalism.\n\nPartly as a result of his efforts, the problem of inappropriate architecture is now being taken seriously in Britain. Local planning authorities are made well aware of public feeling. Where, for example, there exists a high-street facade belonging to the 18th - 19th century in a small town, any new buildings are made to conform to this particular style. Not all countries take this line. There are, for example, no planning regulations in Spain. As a result, visual vandalism is unrestrained.\n\nThe above indicates the writer's prejudices! Yet it also raises various pertinent questions. For example, what is beauty? Is it an abstract constant, or does it lie in the eye of the beholder ? And what is practical? Is it, in domestic architecture, something which solves the problem of housing, insofar as roofs over heads are provided, or should it have a social dimension?\n\nIt is generally accepted nowadays that buildings should match up to the traditions of the cities, towns or villages where they are built. Thus, new buildings in Regent's Park or Regent Street in London, have to conform to Nash's neo-classical style. In other areas in Britain, Elizabethan half-timbering may predominate. This cannot be copied, but ways to conform can be, and are found. In many London areas, the hideous and inhuman tower-blocks of the 50s and 60s are being demolished in favor of old-style low level and terraced housing with gardens. Thus the social dimension is being re-introduced into domestic architecture, and this fosters a sense of collective and personal identity completely absent in the large complexes of flats and maisonettes, where conditions are depressing, and where vandalism and crime flourish.\n\nExcept where there are severe space limitations and little traditional architecture of much aesthetic importance, as in Hong Kong, many countries now realize that some kind of compromise is the right way forward. Obviously. the advantages of the new materials should be exploited. Height is a crucial factor. Traditional facades can be combined with modern interiors without doing violence to the advantages of either. Beauty and practicality are not mutually exclusive considerations. You can throw a bad picture away or destroy a bad sculpture. Not so a bad or inappropriate building. We owe it to future generations to be extremely careful."

        "content": "Just as he uses the French Revolution as the catalyst to resolve the relationships and destinies of his characters in 'A Tale of Two Cities', Charles Dickens uses the Gordon Riots to the same effect in Barnaby Rudge, his other historical novel.\nInspired by the eccentric peer, Lord Gordon, the London mob carried out a reign of terror in 1780 against Roman Catholics, involving murder, looting, arson, and acts of sedition including storming several prisons such as the Fleet and releasing the prisoners. Gordon escaped the consequences, due to lack of evidence, but other ringleaders were executed in public once the military had crushed the riots.\n\nThe riots occupy much of the story, and are brilliantly described. Hatred of the Papacy was the moral peg on which to hang the violence, and it presented the mob with specific targets, Roman Catholic churches, RC houses and their families. A mob out of control and guided by ringleaders will find the lowest common denominator of behavior. It is formed out of a depressed working class which has an inbuilt hatred of the 'Establishment' and, individually, old scores to settle against oppressive employers. Its real motivation is looting, revenge and the exercise of power. For a time the mob succeeded by instilling fear into the respectable population at large. Many house-holders put notices in their windows declaring their Protestantism. Dickens captures and conveys this sense of fear which dominated London and its suburbs for some weeks. This is the most successful aspect of the novel. The climax is the detailed account of the storming, burning and liberation of the Fleet prison.\n\nAll the same, there is a certain weakness in the plotting, and this is the weakness of many of Dickens' novels. Ever the sentimentalist, Dickens sees to it that all the characters, good and bad, get their just desserts. Life is not like that, and the plaintive Old Testament cry, Why do the ungodly prosper? is much nearer the mark. Yet Barnaby escapes the gallows on grounds of idiocy, even though he had joined the rioters for gain, albeit to help his mother. So he is a goodie; others are Geoffrey Haredale, a Roman Catholic whose house was burnt down, and Gabriel Varden, the locksmith who braved the mob in refusing to open the Fleet door lock. Anyway, his pretty daughter Dolly is needed for a happy marriage to Edward Chester. And the baddies ? We have Hugh, the savage ostler, Simon Tappertit and Dennis the hangman. All get hanged. And the smooth villain, Sir John Chester, a secret fomenter of the Gordon Riots; Haredale kills him in a duel. Stewart Rudge, Barnaby's father, had murdered Haredale's brother years previously, but nemesis catches up with him and he also gets hanged. Even Miggs, the smarmy but treacherous maid gets sacked. So everything turns out well! All this merely underlines the fact that Dickens, by far the most popular Victorian novelist, knew his readership. What did they want? Exaggerated sketches of low-life characters, who would make them laugh by their grotesque misuse of English. The good and bad characters already mentioned. A love interest, with a happy ending, after the young lady has been exposed to many perils. An exciting plot, with vivid descriptions. A well-executed denouement, in which justice is seen to be done all round. And perhaps an eccentric such as Barnaby Rudge, with his talking raven. Even the raven survives the ups and downs of the riots.\n\nThe novel has all this. It is a masterpiece of popular fiction, but it is still second-rate.\n\nMost Victorian novelists are too long and wordy for modern tastes. Trollope suffers from the same verbal diarrhoea, but his denouements grow convincingly out of his characters rather than being imposed on them. Dickens' few middle or upper class characters are thin and boring. We know that Haredale is bluff, rough but honest, whereas Chester is smooth, but treacherous. Nothing more. The characters representing the various layers of the working class are far more rounded, but their comic use of English is very suspect. Working class English cannot have changed so dramatically even in one and a half centuries. Then as now, they abused the language, but wordiness, long and involved sentences, and delay in coming to the point were never features of their conversation, especially in London. Shakespeare understood this. Dickens did not."

        "content": "Loneliness is not just a matter of being alone. The monk with his vow of silence may not feel lonely; the individual in an uncongenial group may feel very lonely indeed. So loneliness is a matter of the mind and spirit as well as the body. The richness of life lies in the companionship of a person with whom one has an emotional connection and perhaps a physical relationship, one who thinks in like terms and talks the same language. It is a person whose views on other people, the world in general, and God coincide. Unmarried people often find this in parents, so the loss of parents is perhaps unduly traumatic in their case.\nThe majority of people get married and find most of these outlets in the other person, if the marriage is happy. So bereavement, especially if untimely, is a prime cause of loneliness. Suddenly the house is empty, and there is nobody, even kind friends, children and relations, with whom one can quite communicate. The remedy? Time, and the determination to live the kind of life the other person would have hoped for. Remarriage? For some people, no doubt. Not for everybody. There is no real remedy for this kind of loneliness.\n\nThe fact is that widows and widowers, previously happily married, have a much increased lifespan nowadays. To have to live alone from say age sixty to ninety is no longer uncommon, and medical advance has to be counted as another prime cause of loneliness. It is not so long since people regarded survival beyond the age of fifty as a bonus. Today, the percentage of pensioners in Western communities is constantly rising. As an example, Greenwich in London (pop 11/2m) has 1/2m pensioners. So much social work, both municipal and private, has to be geared to the elderly, and much of it to the lonely elderly. This is why loneliness as a social problem is increasingly important. Very often the problem is exacerbated by extreme old age and sickness. To become housebound compounds the problem.\n\nAnother reason for the loneliness of the elderly is the mobility of younger people. In Britain, the old tradition was that children would house their parents, so that three generations might sit round the same fireside. Today, both job requirements and the cost of housing in or near the great conurbations mean that the young family moves away and can only pay a very occasional visit to the elderly parents. The late 20th century is seeing the collapse of the 'nuclear' family, and the old concept of mutual responsibility seems to be ebbing away. This means that a wide variety of social provisions, ranging from subsidized travel to 'meals on wheels' to home nursing has to be made today by local authorities and charitable organizations.\n\nThis problem is less acute in country areas and sometimes in certain areas of the conurbations, where the old concept of community and neighborliness is still extant. There is less need to be lonely in the village, where all residents are traditionally interested in each other. This mutual support is very noticeable in e.g. many villages in South Wales, where there is much unemployment and a degree of poverty. The flight of the young, however, also applies to villages, especially in agricultural areas, where farm work is no longer labor-intensive and where property prices have been pushed up by second-home owners.\n\nAnother cause of loneliness in urban areas is the unsuitability of post-war re-housing, much of it erected on old bomb sites. In the 60s, tower blocks and large areas of low-rise flats and maisonettes were 'in'; today it is realized that all this was a gigantic mistake, and many such complexes are being demolished to make way for old-style housing. The problems connected with steel and concrete are, first anonymity; also, depressing outlooks, vandalism and crime. Many elderly people live in fear. They install impregnable front doors, which impede the emergency services in the event of physical collapse or fire.\n\nWhat of the young? Many are, for different reasons, just as lonely as the elderly. In Britain, the suicide rate among them is increasing. Despair and loneliness of the spirit are the fundamental causes. Bullying, unpopularity at school, anxiety about examination results and job prospects all make for a feeling of isolation. Some of this may be self-inflicted; the young as well as the old have character defects. Yet there is a great need for counseling and reassurance, certainly affection. The feeling of being excluded from society leads to gang membership and crime, often drug-related.\n\nFinally, the decline of religion has had its effects. If a person of any age has a faith and a belief in God's love, a fundamental reason for living is imparted, and this does much to counteract loneliness.\n\nThere are no ready-made solutions."

        "title": "Money is the root of all evil'. Do You agree?",
        "content": "This is a misquotation from the Christian Bible. St Paul wrote to Timothy 'For the love of money is the root of all evil'. A very different statement.\nWhen a person makes a lot of money in, say, a successful business, there soon comes a point beyond which its possession is superfluous. At this point, there is a parting of the ways. The options are, first, cultivate expensive tastes, second, give liberally to charity, and third, let it accumulate.\n\nThe third option is perhaps the most dangerous. It leads to the love of money for its own sake; meanness to others, and a personal lifestyle which is unduly frugal. Silas Marner was the typical miser of the English novel. A wandering weaver, he settled in the rural West country, lived on virtually nothing, and converted his skills with the loom into gold coins. He hid the coins under a brick in the kitchen and his one pleasure was to count, recount and neatly pile up his treasure . When the hoard of gold was stolen, it seemed as though the end of the world had come. Finally he was weaned away from his obsession with gold by the humanizing influence of an orphan child.\n\nRobert Maxwell was a modern example. Already excessively wealthy, he loved money to such a degree that he stole the pension funds entrusted to his care. When the theft could no longer be concealed, he died by drowning, in circumstances which suggested suicide. He combined love of money - and power - with extravagance.\n\nThere is hardly any crime, major or minor, personal or political, which does not have an underlying money motive. No crime is excusable, but some crimes are less excusable than others, and the degree of guilt is somewhat in proportion to the perpetrator's love of money for its own sake. Serious, organized crime is conducted by gangs whose interest is two-fold; the instinct to amass enormous sums quite unrelated to the personal needs of the criminals, and the acquisition of power - another important motivator - in order to exert pressure on business people, ministers and even governments. Such people use blackmail, personal violence, kidnapping and murder to achieve their objectives. The immense power of the Mafia, the Tongs, and the drug barons is based on instilling fear. They have no pity, no social conscience about the personal and social consequences of drug addiction. Sometimes, as in the case of rival paramilitary gangs in Ireland, threats, violence, murder and routine extortions are cloaked by an ostensible justification; in this case, religion and nationalism.\n\nThe police rightly look for the financial motive when investigating personal crimes. In most of them, though not all, personal gain is found to be the motive. In others, hatred, jealousy, fear, sex and occasionally a pathological love of violence for its own sake generate such crime. A high proportion of crime committed in Britain is committed by young people. Mugging, personal violence, shop-lifting and burglary are carried out for money. Much of this is related to the kind of deprivation which is due to a bad family background. This leads to a general feeling that society, and the police especially, are natural antagonists. There is also an understandable envy of more fortunate young people.\n\nTraditionally, industrial bosses have tended to fall into the category of oppressors, and it has taken a century of trades union action to ensure a square deal for their work forces. Such oppression has always been seen as an evil. In ancient Jewry, the periodic Jubilee was used as the point at which all debts incurred by the poor were cancelled.\n\nSo the love of money accounts for much, perhaps most, though not all evil. Yet to take the topic-statement at its face value is a palpable nonsense. Throughout history, money, in the form of coinage, has facilitated the exchange of goods and trade in general. For a long period, bills of exchange, paper money, and the transfer of debits and credits have enabled governments to build up GNPs, and individuals to amass capital. The money itself is neutral. All depends on how it is used. Rightly used, money is the lifeblood of progress and makes possible a decent standard of living for all citizens. Wrongly used, it engenders the evils referred to above, and many more."

        "title": "Mathematics is the most perfect language of all'. Discuss.",
        "content": "Strictly speaking, a language is a verbalized means of communication, enabling the speaker to convey thought to another person. However, the more complex the thoughts or ideas, the harder or more cumbersome the language becomes. To explain verbally why 'the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides' would require a long and tedious paragraph. And this is the simplest possible example; anything more complicated would be unmanageable. So in this way mathematical symbols which nowadays are universally accepted, compress information in a way that no other language possibly could, and this fact supports the topic statement.\nHowever, this language is only available to most people in its simplest forms, i.e. arithmetic, algebra and geometry, and these are taught in schools because they have everyday usages. The shop assistant needs arithmetic, unless there is an automatic cash till, and technicians of all kinds need the other two; perhaps more, such as trigonometry, logarithms and the calculus, should he or she be dealing with quantities that vary in time and space. In this sense, of course, mathematics is a minority language, a language intelligible only to the specialists of all nations.\n\nThe time may come when knowledge of higher mathematics is far more widespread, however. The new mathematics is now being taught in many schools, sometimes alongside the traditional approach, and younger students find the new methods more intelligible. The principles of course have not changed; merely the setting out. However, there are great developments available to younger students enabling them to see the subject as a whole rather than as a series of separate compartments, and this should engender more interest in those whose natural bent is in the direction of the arts.\n\nMathematics has been described as 'the spearhead of natural philosophy', and this was certainly true up to about 1800. The subject grew up independently in China, India, the Arab world and Europe. For example, many of the Alexandrian and Greek schools of geometricians, represented by Thales of Miletus, Pythagoras, Euclid, Archimedes etc advanced propositions which were already known elsewhere. The West derived its number system from the Hindu-Arabic world, which reached Europe in about 1000 AD. The West learnt mathematics from the Arab world and, from the 15th century, great developments took place.\n\nDescartes revived algebraic geometry, Napier invented logarithms, Newton and Leibnitz the calculus. Lobachevsky developed non-Euclidian geometry, and was followed by Einstein, though the latter was more of a physicist than a mathematician. From Newton onwards, mechanics and astronomy began to use advanced mathematics and, later on, physics came in for the same treatment. Both pure and applied mathematics became the indispensable tools of progress. Pure maths reaches conclusions by means of the deductive process, and may be independent of need. Applied maths consists of developments to meet the requirements of science and technology.\n\nSo mathematics has become a beautiful language in several senses. Firstly, in its ability to compress ideas, just as a great poet achieves desired effects by great verbal economy. Second, because its tools, the symbols, are internationally accepted. Third, because it is entirely objective, and completely exact, allowing no room for prejudice or human emotion. Fourth, because it constantly provides the ground for new hypotheses. These in turn are checked by logic and observation. Often as with Pythagoras, mathematical conclusions can be checked by other means. So mathematics can lead man closer to absolute truth than any other means, that is in the categories of discovery in which it can operate.\n\nMathematics means facts , verified by experiment, and these facts are true within the four dimensions in which the human mind can operate. The other dimensions, perhaps six according to Stephen Hawking, must be compressed into infinitesimal space, so are likely to remain the prerogative of the Creator!"

        "title": "How far should scientists be held responsible for the effects of their discoveries?",
        "content": "As far as we know, man is unique in the created universe. One of the attributes separating mankind from the animal world is the urge to find things out, to add to the common store of knowledge. Historically, any attempt to thwart investigation, or to conceal or ban its results, has been doomed to failure. There is no case for restricting scientific investigation. However, the effects of scientific discovery are sometimes bad, so new technology based on such discovery should be, and usually is, scrutinized and carefully tested before it is let loose on the public.\nThe scientist is not the right person to carry out the scrutiny of the new technology. Indeed, though expert in the particular field, he or she is often woefully naive in other matters. The right people are government ministers who, in a democracy, are responsible to the people. The minister will seek reports from independent experts. This may mean lengthy scrutiny, as in the case of new drugs. The first reason for this is the humane consideration for human life and health. This means eliminating any possibility of harmful side effects. The second is more material; in the event of such harmful side effects, very considerable damages are being awarded by the courts to the sufferers nowadays. Many very large drug companies have their reports own research departments, and their findings, together with independent reports are passed to the Department of Health so that the minister can take the final decision. New technologies based on new discoveries are also controlled in this way.\n\nWhen scientists bypass the correct channels from whatever motives, and the effects of their discoveries prove harmful, then they must be held responsible.\n\nWhen they do, the motivation may be personal prestige, money or political bias. Isaac Newton's feuds with Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, and the German Leibniz resulted in unscrupulous behavior. While the promulgation of calculus can hardly be said to have public side effects, Newton's self-esteem, had it gone unchecked, would have had disastrous consequences in other fields, such as atomic research.\n\nScientists are relatively badly paid; judges on the other hand are well paid in order to place them above possible bribery. So the temptation to sell discoveries to the highest bidder must be great. This raises the point of national loyalty. As mentioned, scientists are often politically naive. Some fail to realize the industrial harm that the money motive can do to the country which both trained them and provided the crucial facilities for their research.\n\nOthers see patriotism as a deplorable nationalism. Many in this century have felt it their duty to support Communism. They are victims of the pathetic fallacy that we are, or should be moving towards a one-world society. So they have given or sold information to Russia. Thankfully, the end of the cold war has terminated this treachery, but the dangers of a nuclear confrontation, such as in the Bay of Pigs episode, is traceable directly to certain scientists for whom no punishment is sufficiently severe. They are just as guilty as the spies who peddle their discoveries.\n\nIn the case of the terrible side effects of exposure to nuclear energy, the scientist can hardly be held responsible, since in the early days nobody fully understood these effects. Madame Curie died of cancer or leukaemia. Many who were present at the early detonation of nuclear bombs at Bikini, New Mexico and the Monte Bello Islands, not to speak of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, have suffered disastrous long-term effects. Civilians who have been exposed to nuclear accidents or accidental leakages have suffered in the same way. Some people make the case that even to live near a nuclear power station has its dangers. Disastrous as all this is, the scientist can no more be blamed than the inventor of gun powder for the rifle and the cannon, or the first man to make a long-bow for causing death at a distance.\n\nThe same principle applies to all the harmful effects resulting from other scientific discoveries, whether actual or potential. The possible misuse of genetic discoveries is obvious, but it is hoped that all countries will exercise the kind of control outlined above. Again, scientists discovered the powerful insecticide DDT, but should not be blamed for the fact that it may destroy the ecology, or for the fact that some strains of mosquitoes have developed an immunity.\n\nHowever, there have been times in the past when the establishment has tried to suppress scientific discovery, deny its truth, or proscribe it altogether. Historically, the Christian Church has more than once been the culprit; in asserting that the earth is flat, in denying the Copernical view of the universe, the time-scale of the world's development, the physical ancestry of man as an offshoot of the world of apes. None of this succeeded in the long run, nor will any future attempts to suppress the results of scientific investigation.\n\nIt is only when the scientist personally and deliberately misuses his knowledge that he or she should be held responsible. Otherwise, the responsibility should, and actually does, lie with others."

        "title": "The sea is a bottomless rubbish pit'. Discuss.",
        "content": "First, we should be clear as to what is meant by 'the sea'. To get the concept into proportion, it is worth remembering that the area of the earth's surface covered by water is 140m square miles, i.e. 71%. Secondly, its mean depth is 12,450 feet, i.e. c.4000 meters. Obviously the depth varies. There are points in the Atlantic rift and in the Pacific Ocean where depths up to 8 miles have been recorded. Hence, there is no argument for saying that eventually the seas will be filled with human waste of various kinds, and there is no apparent reason why this waste should not be dumped in the sea. The all-important point is the control that must be exercised by international agreement over such dumping.\nThe fact is that the consumer countries will produce more and more rubbish as time goes on, and somewhere, somehow, this has to be disposed of. What are the options? They vary according to the source of the material, but there can only be three: sea, land and air. The disposal of rubbish as land-fill material is certainly not popular, at least in small countries. Nobody wants to live near land-fill sites. They disfigure the countryside and can prove positively dangerous. Poisonous material can leach out into rivers and adjacent farm land, damaging productivity, causing disease among animals and wildlife in general, and killing fish. People, and especially children living in such areas may also be exposed to disease.\n\nAir is a second option, in that incineration will convert rubbish into gases. Some domestic rubbish is already being used as fuel for the production of electricity, and this form of recycling will increase in the future. Yet, the sheer volume of all kinds of rubbish produced nowadays means that the first option, the sea, has to be used, undesirable as that may be in principle.\n\nPollution of land, sea, air, even the damage being done to the ozone layer, is one of today's great world problems. Any solution to the problem demands first analysis, then international agreement on the enforcement of acceptable standards, then target dates for their full implementation. Rubbish disposal should form part of that process.\n\nIf we consider the bottomless rubbish pit, i.e. sea pollution, it is obvious that dumping is only a small part of that problem. Two centuries of industry in the West have left rivers such as the Thames and Rhine so full of chemicals and sewage that no fish could live in them. That process is now being reversed. Agricultural chemicals have added their quota of filth. Add to this the occasional oil-spill and even a small amount of nuclear waste and one reaches the present seemingly hopeless situation. The Atlantic seaboard from the Russian arctic circle down to Africa is continuously, if patchily affected. There are similar inshore areas elsewhere. All these contributory factors must be tackled at source. The ideal situation to work for is that liquid waste should somehow be dealt with inland. That should become easier as new technologies replace old industrial processes. Solid waste, whether industrial or domestic, must be carefully graded. Much of it is bio-degradable; some of it is not. Material such as plastic and rubber should be used as landfill, if incineration is impossible. The action of sea water, wind and weather generally deals with the rest.\n\nThe big question is 'where should this happen?' and the answer probably is, in the case of Europe, beyond the continental shelf. It should be possible to devise containers capable of sinking non-degradable material to the bottom. Degradable material should be given some initial treatment. Toxic and nuclear waste are already being sunk in special containers.\n\nSewage, although generally treated, is normally piped into inshore areas, fouling beaches in many places. Recycling is the long term answer. It would obviously make cheap fuel and useful fertilizer.\n\nGiven such measures, the clean-up operation could be completed in a remarkably short time. It would involve governments and private firms in a great deal of expense, since present methods of disposal were chosen for simplicity and cheapness. Today, there is an altogether new interest in preserving and beautifying the environment. So one hopes that governments will be forced to move in the right direction.\n\nOtherwise the sea will remain a rubbish pit in exactly the wrong places."

        "title": "As technology advances, our leisure time is increasing. Do we need to be educated in how to use this time sensibly?",
        "content": "The topic statement makes a rather unreal assumption. This is that the only effect of technology is to reduce working hours. Certainly, the old sixty-hour working week has been reduced to forty hours in most countries, and the tendency is downwards. This of course was due in part to the replacement of manpower by machine power although until very recently in the West, the far more potent factor was the growing power of the trades unions. Within the past ten years, however, this power has been demolished by a creeping world trade recession. Instead of being forced to increase wages and reduce working hours by threat of strike action, many businesses have either closed down or laid off massive number of workers.\nIn Britain this applies to all the main industrial concerns as well as smaller private businesses. Almost all coal mines have, or will shortly close down due to the switch to nuclear power and gas as fuels for electricity production, and the almost total disappearance of coal as the fuel for domestic heating. In offices, computers have decimated numbers of white-collar workers. Machinery and large-scale farming have had the same effect on agriculture. Robotry has revolutionized car assembly, and standardized containers have eliminated the need for manpower in the docks. Added to all this is a worldwide drop in consumer confidence, due to a reluctance to spend in view of widespread job insecurity. The result of all this in Britain is that unemployment stands at just under 3m, and is increasing.\n\nSo to say that our leisure time is increasing is certainly true, even though the underlying assumption presupposes an ideal situation in which the advance of technology has had the single effect of shortening working hours. It may be that some countries are in this happy situation. The working week may have gone down to say twenty-five hours without prejudice to job security or loss of income. Inflation is low. The GNP is adequate and the balance of payments sound. Morale remains high. The population has a good basic education. All that is required is to find the right balance between work and play. Most people are not naturally lazy, so generally speaking the incentive to use leisure time constructively in built-in.\n\nThere are many ways in which this can be achieved, beginning at school. Most schools have a careers adviser as a member of staff, and many education authorities employ a peripatetic educational psychologist. Their work could be extended. There is no reason why their advice should be limited to school progress and future job opportunities. Also, the object is to find out the young person's true interests and capabilities. If academically inclined, the young person could be steered in that direction. A manually gifted child could be shown opportunities in that very wide field. Many countries could step up their coaching facilities for those who are good at sport.\n\nThere is an old saying that 'Satan hath some mischief yet for idle hands to do'. One of the aims of education should be to instill a liberal and humane attitude towards other people, especially those of other nationalities and alien cultures. A current problem in West Germany is xenophobia, caused by mass immigration from the East, and an uncertain economic future. National socialism among unemployed youth, with its hallmarks of intolerance and violence, is increasing. The fears of these young people are real, but their behavior shows up the basic deficiencies of their home and educational background. In Britain, extreme elements of Left and Right reflect their unrest by going in for petty crime and by showing hostility to the establishment and the police.\n\nThe solution is right thinking and a positive attitude to leisure, whether that leisure is enforced or not. This need is generally recognized, and some countries already provide a range of opportunities. Britain offers training and retraining schemes for young people based on what used to be called 'technical colleges'. Evening classes are available almost everywhere. The 'Open University' provides a spectrum of instruction via television. Libraries and specialized magazines have been generally available for decades.\n\nThe solution is a matter of personal incentive combined with professional direction. The key to both stems from parental direction and encouragement combined with enlightened schooling."

        "content": "Sir Winston Churchill, 1874 to 1965 (I think!). At any rate, I was stationed at Woolwich when the great man died, and the Royal Artillery had the task of organizing the funeral at St Paul's Cathedral. It was called 'Exercise Hope-Not' and it went into action at once, proving to be the greatest state funeral of the century, monarchs included. And not without good reason. Churchill inspired Britain to bring about the defeat of Adolf Hitler, at the time when all seemed to be lost.\nChurchill was a descendant of the great Duke of Marlborough, and was born at Blenheim Palace in 1874. He was sent to Harrow School where, for obvious reasons, he was very unhappy. His parents, Lord Randolph Churchill and Jenny Jerome took him away at a quite early age. The problem was the severe canings administered by one or two of the masters, ostensibly for academic shortcomings. In fact, it was likely that the masters concerned were sadists.\n\nIn 1895 he was commissioned in the 4th Hussars, and he saw active service in several minor wars. One was the Boer War, in which he was war correspondent for the Morning Post. He had already developed a fine command of the English language. Imprisoned in Pretoria, he made a dramatic escape. In 1900 he became Conservative MP for Oldham but, disagreeing with Neville Chamberlain about tariff reform, he joined the Liberals. In 1908 he became President of the Board of Trade under Asquith and brought in legislation which created labor exchanges.\n\nIn 1910 he became Home Secretary, and authorized the use of troops against armed gangsters in the Sydney Street riots. In 1911 he became First Lord of the Admiralty, and he put the fleet into a state of readiness for war. His participation in the Dardanelles campaign was a failure. From 1914 - 16 he served as a lieutenant-colonel in the trenches (First World War) and then became Minister of Munitions under Lloyd George in 1917, his main role being the development of the tank. From 1918 - 21 he was Secretary for War, and then he became Colonial Secretary, establishing the Irish Free State. He also supported the 'white generals' in Russia.\n\nOut of Parliament after the war, Churchill left the Liberals and in 1924 became a Constitutionalist. He was made Chancellor of the Exchequer, helped Britain return to the Gold Standard, and defeated the General Strike of 1926. Up to the Second World War he was out of office, disagreeing with Conservative policies.\n\nHis true talent for backs to the wall leadership was not realized until 1939 when Hitler marched on Czechoslovakia. He was soon made First Lord of the Admiralty again and then on 10th May 1940 became premier of an all-party administration. Undoubtedly, he inspired both the armed services and the civilian population to stand up to Germany. I well remember his broadcast speeches, especially the one in which he promised the British people blood and tears, toil and sweat. He announced the alliance with the Soviet Union, and he concluded a deal with President Roosevelt, the Atlantic Charter. He traveled to meet world leaders. He averted a civil war in Greece. He appointed General Montgomery to Africa, and the general achieved the turning point of the war at El Alamein. On 8th May 1945 he announced the unconditional surrender of Germany.\n\nAs so often happens, a great war leader is rejected in peace time, and Churchill did not return to power until 1951. He received the Order of Merit in 1946, became a KG in 1953, and in 1955 resigned office.\n\nNobody in this century can claim a higher role in the preservation of freedom.\n\nHis talents were considerable. He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1953, having written important war accounts and biographies. He was an accomplished artist and was elected to the Royal Academy in 1948. He also enjoyed brandy, Havana cigars and bricklaying!\n\nFew, down the ages, can match his record."

        "title": "What do you think have been the most important chances in your country during the last 100 years?",
        "content": "This essay concerns the main changes in England, many of which apply to the whole of Britain.\n\nIn the 1890s England was at the peak of her power, the strongest and most influential country in the world. Military conquest, followed by trade, had created the most far-flung empire the world had ever known. The development of the colonies under this influence fostered heavy industry and consumer manufacturing, enormously enriching the home country. Britain 'ruled the waves'. Yet the seeds of decline were already present. From 1890 to 1914 the power of Germany was increasing. Between the two world wars, Britain managed to retain her empire, but from 1945 onwards the constituent countries gradually achieved independence. British markets declined, and the emphasis shifted to the European Economic Community. By 1990 Britain had become an influential, though second rank political, financial and economic power. The country is now in constant financial trouble, and currently trade is in deep recession. In the past century, England has progressively moved into a situation of decline.\n\nSecondly, as in Germany, though to a lesser degree, saturation bombing in World War II destroyed large sections of the industrial infrastructure. Ironically, this facilitated the rebuilding of factories in the Ruhr after Marshall Aid had restored the German economy. In both countries the demand for steel and coal fell drastically, paving the way for the new electronic and high-tech industries. However, whereas the Germans retained and modernized their old infrastructure, England neglected hers. This, coupled with years of strike action, only terminated in the Thatcher regime, weakened the British economy, while the Germans strengthened theirs. The overall result is that, although still influential abroad, England has become a second-class power, living under the shadow of the USA, and currently unable to maintain her position in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Economic Community.\n\nHowever, all is not doom and gloom. Most though not all of the changes in England's social fabric have been improvements. In late Victorian and Edwardian days, class structures were rigid, and maintained both by the abject poverty of the working classes and by religious and moral pressures.\n\nThe terrible slaughter of the 1914 - 18 war largely removed the latter pressure, but inter war poverty, the slump of 1929 - 31, and the absence of any effective social security beyond a meagre dole served to keep the class system going. It was finally broken by the war of 1939 - 45. Class remains to this day, but the old barriers were eroded by the new entrepreneurial climate which climaxed in the 1980s. The post-war introduction of the Welfare State dramatically improved the lot of the poor, the concept being that the state would care for them from the cradle to the grave . This probably prevented a revolution in England. All manner of state benefits, from maternity grants and child allowances to funeral grants are now available to all whose income falls below a reasonable subsistence level. This modern care for the poor, the elderly and the handicapped is the most important social change of the century. Before 1939, the very poor ended up in the workhouse, the sick went on a doctor's panel - virtually a charity - and the unemployed received a dole which scarcely bought them food.\n\nA century ago, rail, which had displaced the stage coach, provided a countrywide network. However, in the 30s the car and the lorry were assuming greater importance. After the Second World War, Lord Beeching cut the rail network drastically and this process has continued, as roads have been improved and a nationwide M road grid built. Apart from the heaviest goods, such as coal, products are moved by container lorry, and the motor-car has become the common man's mode of transport. This has created a new set of problems; difficult parking and crowded city roads. Air travel, both internal and external, has facilitated movement both for business and pleasure, and has transformed the holiday industry.\n\nA century ago, education was almost the sole prerogative of those who could afford it, but gradually a compulsory state system has been established. This has its merits and demerits, and reforming measures are currently being taken. The same principle applies to the National Health Service. Medical advance has been such that the general health of the nation has improved beyond all recognition.\n\nA significant change for the worse has been the gradual erosion of the nuclear family. Today, there is little social disapproval of unmarried couples living together. Divorce is relatively easy. Related problems affecting children have consequently increased. Again, bad architectural thinking has done much to break down neighborliness and encourage crime.\n\nNot all the changes have been for good, but if I had to choose, I would infinitely prefer to live in 1992 than in 1892!"

        "content": "John Donne, the English metaphysical poet (d. 1631), wrote these famous words, stressing the interdependence of the human race. The death of any man, he continues, 'diminishes me', so 'never seek to know for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for thee'. The argument is that individually we owe everything, or almost everything, to human solidarity. The exceptions to that principle merely serve to prove the rule. Our own individual contributions add to the sum total of knowledge, experience and insight which in turn add to the pool available for others to draw on.\nThis dependence is most obvious in man's early days. To state that a child depends on its parents for everything goes without saying, and where a child is deprived of parental care, for whatever reason, immense harm results. Yet, wise parents avoid domination and seek to foster independence in the child while providing a secure background. This attitude in fact strengthens relationships within the ideal nuclear family, so that often three, sometimes four generations are able to make positive contributions to each other's lives.\n\nIn countries where there is sexual equality, the interdependence of the two married partners, both emotionally and practically, remains the norm, though there are minority groups which challenge the desirability of the married state. For some time, in the west, the creation of a home has required two incomes, generally for mortgage repayments. Widespread unemployment, due to the world recession, has often left the female partner as the bread-winner, and has therefore led to a role reversal. Though unnatural, this can be made to work. None of this matters where the married state, or even a strong partnership without marriage, is seen as a lifelong relationship. Mutual loyalty is the key to success and to the happiness of children.\n\nEmployment provides another example of the crucial nature of inter-dependence. Even where craftsmen in various trades personally carry out every process from raw material to finished product, the supply of raw materials and the final marketing situation are in the hands of others. In other jobs, joint action at every stage is crucial, as on the car assembly line. This is even more the case where jobs are hazardous. The miner, the crewman of a lifeboat, the trapeze artist, the policeman, the fireman, the soldier and many others all rely on their 'mates' to ensure safety and help in dangerous situations.\n\nWartime enhances the spirit of human solidarity both in the armed services and among civilians. The two World Wars brought civilians together in e.g. Britain, to such a degree that social and political barriers between classes and individuals were broken down. Thankfully, many of these barriers were not reinstated when peace came. Sadly enough, all wars produce refugees and displaced persons, and often a situation in which a return home is impossible. On humanitarian grounds, the collective consciences of enlightened countries allow at least a restricted degree of resettlement and hopefully a welcome for these unfortunate people.\n\nSport provides another example. In team events, interdependence goes without saying, but nobody can reach the highest levels in individual sports without the support of others, often family members, and the expertise of coaches.\n\nPeople tend to band together to produce solidarity in the sphere both of politics and of industrial reform. In a free society, the powers of a political party and of a trades union depend on organization and loyalty. Advances both in democracy and in workers' rights will always depend on these factors. Even religion is more than a personal relationship with God. The Second (Christian) Commandment is \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\"\n\nThe principle also applies in the realm of knowledge. Modern scientific research is a matter of team-work, and the outstanding intellects of our day work from the base of the discoveries of their predecessors, even when principles enunciated in the past are found to be inadequate, flawed, or actually false. Hawking would have been nowhere without Einstein, who would have been nowhere without Newton.\n\nThe human being is perhaps unique in that he or she can suffer emotionally and spiritually from sadness, disappointments, shame and bereavement. Some of these things can never be overcome, but at least the support of others helps us to live with them.\n\nFew of us would care to be marooned on a desert island, even given a comfortable existence. As the Christian bible reminds us in more places than one: \"You are members one of another.\""

        "content": "The impact of new transport and communication systems has had a more dramatic effect in the developing than in the old world. In the Far East, this impact will vary marginally from country to country. In the West, Britain provides some interesting changes, and it is with Britain that this essay is concerned.\nMany of the advances in Britain are due to post-Second World War developments in technology. Most have been beneficial. Some have been questionable in their effects on the life of the country. The old steam train poured smoke and grime into the atmosphere. Pollution and dirt disfigured towns and indeed whole areas close to the rail network. Diesel and electricity now eliminate this effect. However, the immense increase in road transport has brought even greater problems. Catalytic converters are so far optional. Gases dangerous both to humanity and to the protective ozone layer are freely emitted. Traffic jams proliferate, resulting in loss of money and tempers. Pollution also results from noise, as anyone living near the flight paths of London's six major airports will testify. At one time, Britain was covered by a valuable bus service network, but most of this has been eliminated or privatized, leaving many isolated villages virtually stranded, insofar as many people without private cars are concerned.\n\nThere is also a down side to the immense advances made in electronics over the past few decades. Personal privacy may be invaded by phone-tapping and the planting of bugs, which enable conversations to be picked up easily. These devices are easily obtainable. The privacy of computers can easily be picked up easily be broken by hackers, and a whole body of new legislation has had to be passed to counter these criminal offences.\n\nYet it would be unfair to deny the positive advantages of progress. The post-war period has witnessed the building of a country-wide network of motorways, the latest being the London orbital, the M25. Transport of goods has largely moved from rail to road. Container lorries convey goods both internally and to and from Europe. This has helped to enhance trade within the European Community but, like many another advance, has led to unemployment in the dock areas, since loading and off-loading containers is largely a mechanical process. Environmentalists criticize the proliferation of trunk and M roads, though nowadays their objections are largely taken into account. However, rail has not been discarded. Very heavy loads, such as coal for electricity generation, must still be moved by rail. Existing networks carry most commuters into London; inter-city services compete with short aircraft runs; England is shortly to be linked with the Continent by means of tunnels to France, now near completion; some lines are capable or taking high-speed trains.\n\nAir travel development has had a profound effect on both business and pleasure. Air-freighting has opened up new markets, greatly facilitating the import and export of all but the heaviest products. Production of course is governed by demand, and the tendency is towards increased sophistication if goods are to be competitive. So the result is a shift from mechanics to technology, from labor-intensive means of production to robotry, and from electricity to electronics. This has meant significant unemployment, the need to establish a state benefit system where this did not already exist, and the relocating of many work-forces. A consequence has been urban sprawl and the establishment of new centers of light industry. A further consequence has been environmental damage.\n\nAir travel for pleasure has opened up the world to holiday makers. The popular venue for the British worker is no longer the seaside town; it is the Mediterranean with its more or less guaranteed sunshine. This loss of sterling is somewhat offset by overseas tourism in Britain.\n\nAnd in the sphere of communications, speed and efficiency have been greatly enhanced. Satellite telephone communication enables instant world-wide dialing, together with faxing, on the same principle. Television and radio today permit instantaneous news coverage. The recent Barcelona Olympics were a wonderful example.\n\nAll these changes tend to move governments and peoples in the direction of a one-world concept, though without having any effect on the cause of peace and justice. The end result is merely a sharpening of our perception of man's inhumanity to man."

        "title": "Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of industrial development.",
        "content": "Over the past three decades, there has been an explosion of industrial development in many Far Eastern countries, ranging from those with no workforce expertise to the far more sophisticated states such as Japan and Singapore. Most countries have some natural resource to develop, be it oil, timber, rubber or minerals and gemstones. The general process has been to exploit these resources by importing foreign expertise and equipment. Ideally, the results have led to dramatic increases in countries' GNP, favorable balances of trade, and the establishment of hard currencies which attract foreign investment. All these should lead to the building of hospitals and health centers, schools and colleges, sporting facilities and other amenities. Good wages should permit radical improvements in living standards. Unfortunately, this only happens where a country enjoys a reasonably democratic political system. Otherwise, in a one-party state, the temptation is to divert new money into armaments, unnecessary extravagances and sometimes the pockets of those in power.\nSingapore and Japan are not typical of the Far East, since for decades they have been ahead of the rest in industrial development, although keen competition has reduced their lead in the past seven or eight years. Oil exploration in the Singapore region has dropped, and with it the demand for the re-export of oil-related machinery, drilling equipment and metal sheets and bars. Electronic components, diodes, photocells and integrated circuits; consumer goods such as radios, TVs, clothing, furniture and vegetable oils have also declined, due to competition from countries where much lower wage levels are acceptable. However, Singapore will always benefit from its free trade zones. There are six; five for seaborne cargo and one for airborne. With their time-limited but duty and document-free storage facilities, they will always remain an attractive proposition. So does INTRACO, an international and paid-up trading company which has many useful functions.\n\nThe above relates to trade as much as to industry, but the results of both are much the same. On the industrial side, apart from the products listed in paragraph 2, mention must be made of the great diversity of industrial products in modern Singapore; industrial chemicals, printing and publishing, shipyard re-structuring and upgrading, aircraft repair and overhaul capabilities, machine tools and related products, and office equipment. About 8% of the land area of Singapore is used for farming, the main products being pork, poultry, eggs, vegetables, fish and cut flowers.\n\nSo to summarize the advantages. Industrial proliferation generates jobs. Money can be spent on universities, colleges, schools and training centers. State housing, mostly blocks of flats, offers rented accommodation. Health, social and police services can be financed. Typical health hazards, such as the anopheles mosquito, can be eliminated, and both hygiene and family planning publicized. Above all, relatively late industrialization means that state-of-the-art factories can be built. There is no legacy of ancient factories to modernize or demolish.\n\nYet all is not sweetness and light. There is something to be said for a more leisurely pace of life. A sudden shift to urban dwelling and high-tech employment can and does, set up psychological problems, which lead to health problems. Moreover, there was something to be said for the semi-jungle nature of Singapore, and it would be pleasant to have a few wild tigers present. However, the main disadvantage is that industrialization sets up living standard expectations which depend absolutely on a healthy overseas trade. At present there is a world trade recession. Also, surrounding countries are becoming far more competitive. Inflation and widespread unemployment are the chief dangers."

        "title": "The place of color in everyday life.",
        "content": "What constitutes perception of color is not fully understood, though the quality of light coming from a colored object can be analyzed into electromagnetic radiations of various wavelengths. White light consists of a spectrum band of shades merging from red to blue. Objects will absorb certain parts of the band and reflect others, giving a perception of color to the eye. This perception is standard to the human race, though about two per cent of males and rather less females suffer from color blindness. Red and amber become indistinguishable, a dangerous situation at traffic lights!\nWhether realized or not, color exerts a great effect on humanity from the psychological as well as from the aesthetic point of view. For example, environmental coloring profoundly influences our working lives. It is not only for reasons of economy that until recent years, at least in Britain, governmental and armed services offices were uniformly painted in yellow ochre. So were hospitals, state schools, prisons and most other official institutions. The object was to create an undistracting environment. Latterly it has been realized that pastel shades are the most helpful. Sharp colors tend to lead to unrest and aggression. Drab colors cause depression and negative attitudes. Aesthetic considerations are more a matter of fashion. People are easily influenced by propaganda and fashion. A short time ago, many people were led to prefer sharp, primary colors in wall paint and soft furnishings, with no regard to match and mismatch. This was short-lived. The idea was soon superseded by light pastel shades which provide both a restful atmosphere and the ideal background for offsetting furniture, pictures and floor coverings.\n\nIn those days, the 60s, there was also a craze for psychedelic painting. Cars, generally bangers , were patterned with any kind of design. The thinking behind this was to reflect the kaleidoscopic colors experienced in the drug-induced states typical of that appalling decade. Fast colour switches were also a feature of the pop scene , and remain so to this day. Fashionable dress for children still reflects this objectionable colour freedom, which is known to be exciting to the younger generation, and to some degree enhances their urge to freedom. Perhaps my rather scathing comments are typical of my generation!\n\nArt in primary schools has undergone a profound change in recent years. Finger paints, poster colors, felt-tips and myriad-shaded drawing pencils, allied to the teaching attitude of free expression, enable youngsters to use colour more imaginatively than was permitted under older regimes. On balance, this may confer advantages which were not available to earlier generations.\n\nIn most Western and Westernized countries, the choice of style and colour in clothing for both sexes is a matter of individual choice, though tradition plays an important part. In Britain, for example, women's fashions were always dictated by class and income in the old days. Nowadays, mass production offers a much wider range of style and colour. Men tend to be much more drab -- quite the opposite in nature! -- and in Britain, this has its origin in Cromwell's Protestant ethic in the 17th Century. It led eventually to the standardized dark suit, collar and tie, which have now become almost a uniform, spreading to many countries where Britain once had an interest. Yet the male still has an instinct for colour and variety, which today is expressed in casual clothing. In Arab countries, dress design and coloring for both sexes is dictated by religion. Women wear full-length and loose-fitting black garments in public.\n\nThe importance of colour is seen in several other aspects of life. The best exponents of both representational and impressionistic painting use rich colour freely, using light to obtain depth and realism, to highlight, and to convey movement and emotion. The works of Turner and Van Gogh typify the two schools. The best of colored photography follows the same principles. Natural coloring may be subtly modified by the use of light filters.\n\nIn temperate and tropical zones, shades of green predominate in natural surroundings. This color is universally restful and relaxing, though it is notably absent in many inner city areas where the dull grey of concrete has a depressing effect. This is recognized in the surprising number of parks and gardens in London, for example. These make a significant contribution to social ease. In hot and dry equatorial areas, the above does not apply. People are conditioned to the browns, yellows and reds of their surroundings.\nWildlife uses colour very subtly, mostly for camouflage purposes. Certain fish and many insects use camouflage as a defense against predators, and some can even change colour in order to merge with their surroundings. The chameleon is the most obvious example. The same principle is used by armies. Khaki was chosen for the trenches, olive drab for bocage, and broken outlines for buildings.\n\nA final note concerns color of skin ! An important element in the one-world movement is the abolition of color prejudice and differentiation. Social taboos, particularly concerning inter-marriage, are of increasingly less importance."

        "title": "What is the value of mathematics?",
        "content": "The minimal objective in schools in most countries is to ensure that leavers, somewhere in their teens, are both literate and numerate. And while teaching methods have changed and in some ways advanced in recent decades, where the traditional approach has been totally abandoned, far too many pupils leave school innumerate. Numeracy may be defined as the ability to carry out elementary tasks under the three headings-arithmetic, geometry and algebra. Of these, arithmetic is the most valuable for ordinary purposes.\nIf that is true, it is something of an irony that electronics, which help mathematical processes in so many directions, have had an adverse effect on pupils' ability to do mental arithmetic. Pocket calculators give immediate solutions to virtually all mathematical problems. In no way do they exercise the brain. So, the use of logarithms and the slide-rule has disappeared. The ideal situation is the teaching of mathematics by the old methods and the use of calculators for checking purposes only. Given the basics, a pupil can then use the calculator to great effect in the outside world.\n\nSo, what are the uses of mathematics to the ordinary person? As a wage-earner, it is an obvious advantage to be able to check one's wage slip and bring any discrepancies in deductions for tax, insurance, union dues etc to notice. Secondly, it is essential to be able to work out a personal budget, and if possible to allow for savings to cover holiday expenses, other luxuries, and unforeseen calls on the pocket. As a professional, self-employed or business person, further advantages emerge. Assume you wish to start a small business and you approach your bank manager for a starting loan. He or she will expect a realistic breakdown of initial costs, wage bills, if any, expected returns, with provision made for taxation, VAT if applicable, rent, leasehold or mortgage repayments, and of course the preparation and auditing of accounts. None of this is possible without at least an elementary knowledge of mathematics, and your manager will show no sympathy if you expect to pay somebody else to do the work.\n\nAll of the scientific, engineering and technological professions demand the application of pure mathematics to physical problems, and this then becomes applied mathematics. A bridge-builder must work out all the stresses and strains to which the bridge will, or may be subjected, taking every factor into account; maximum load, wind pressure, storms and floods being obvious examples, in order to comply with safety standards. Mathematics provide the essential preliminary to this or any other major construction, such as a tower block, or an oil rig, and indeed to every minor building project.\n\nApart from mechanical engineering, applied mathematics are crucial to the generation and use of electricity, and to the sciences of astronomy, optics, thermodynamics, aeronautics, ship-building and virtually every other practical aspect of modern life. The manifold uses of electronics and computers are all mathematically-based. It is no exaggeration to say that life as we know it would be impossible were it not for this fundamental study.\n\nIn fact, every past generation since history began could say the same thing. It is true that there have been significant advances in the past few decades. However, counting and measuring date back to the early civilizations of the Chinese, the Hindus, the Babylonians and the Egyptians. Thales of Miletus and Pythagoras invented theoretical geometry, and in the 4th and 3rd Centuries BC, Euclid and Archimedes added to this knowledge. Western numerals are Hindu-Arabic in origin, reaching the West by about 1000 AD. However, significant developments came later, from the 15th Century onwards, and one needs only to mention Descartes, Napier, Leibniz, Lobachevski and Einstein, and what the application of their discoveries achieved, to underline the fact that mathematics has always been crucial to man's material progress."

        "title": "How important is discipline in your life?",
        "content": "The creation or development of self-esteem is the motivation behind discipline, whether self-imposed or not. Pride is the main factor impelling us to make the most of our lives and to fulfill our perceived actual or potential role in society. Thus, discipline makes for self-respect. Most of us are naturally lazy and selfish. Parents and dormitory prefects had to drag me out of bed. Schoolmasters begged me to try to use my brains a little more. My school peers ragged me unmercifully as I stuffed chocolates and sweets into my mouth and therefore put on fat. However, by my early teens, two factors-conscience and outside pressures, caused me to review my life-style. I was letting down parents and school. I decided to do some academic work, to lose some weight, and to build some muscle.\nA minority of people seem to be born with a single-minded motivation which leads them to achieve, irrespective of outside pressures. Most of us grudgingly accept discipline exerted from outside. This tends to sharpen our perception of what we could achieve and to appreciate its value. So, a decision is reached, or not, as the case may be. Imposed discipline becomes increasingly unnecessary as it is replaced by self-discipline. We begin to set ourselves standards well beyond the minimum expected by others.\n\nSo discipline becomes important in three contexts. First, young people are inclined to emulate a role model either in sport or academics, or even the pop scene. Second, there is a realization that we owe something to the aspirations of parents, whose expectations spring from love. Third, we are all the products of the society in which we live, and there is a case for saying that we should try to put something back. Unfortunately, in some western countries, many young people became the victims of drug and anarchic manipulators, and chose to opt out of responsibility. In the 60s these people formed an alternative culture, and are now the parents of some of the worst elements in the younger generation. In Britain, four out of five crimes today are committed by teenagers. There is also a large body of so-called new age travelers who cause nuisance all over Britain and refuse all dealings with normal society, except insofar as they expect to live on state handouts, funded of course by the taxpayer. Since 1960, part of the problem has been the steady erosion of the nuclear family. Another part has been the absence of moral training in the state school system. A third factor has been urban deprivation and unemployment. The old saying \"example speaks louder than words\" has much truth in it, and the exceptions prove the rule. Self-discipline involves taking decisions. Where there is innate weakness, however, the factors mentioned above will tip the scales in the wrong direction. Even when the background is unexceptionable, there are isolated cases where young people go the wrong way. This could be due to genetic weakness.\n\nMany activities are personal rather than communal. The artist, the writer, the solo musician, the athlete, must all set themselves targets. To achieve these means self-imposed discipline. However, this self-discipline becomes a pleasure the more it is practiced. The novelist Trollope earned his living in the postal service. However, his ambition was to become the most prolific writer of the 19th Century. He achieved this by getting up early and writing 2,000 words every day before he went off to work. He did this for most of his life.\n\nMost people have a religion, and discipline has its relevance here, not only in the context of regular prayer and scripture reading. Our faith is often tested by disappointment, failure, or loss of a loved person. So there are dark periods when only discipline can save us from apostasy. Mention must also be made of the armed services. Here, the same principle of an external discipline designed to lead to self- discipline also applies. An obligation to national service is usually resented by young people at the time. However, its value is nearly always appreciated in later life, for two reasons. It will carry a person through hard as well as good times. It will instill a sense of obligation to other people.\n\nModeration in all things, however. If discipline is important in your life, so be it. It is when discipline becomes obsessive that it has real dangers. A slimming campaign may be good. When it becomes obsessive, it may lead to anorexia. The psychological dangers of obsessive discipline are inflexibility, serious-mindedness, pomposity, lack of humor and the loss of a sense of fun and enjoyment. No workaholic can ever be a good family man or woman. And alienation from others may lead to severe nervous disorders."

        "title": "From your own experience, how would you define the pleasures of reading?",
        "content": "As a very small boy, the first pleasure I had from reading was being able to crow over some of my peers who couldn't. I became less of a little snob as I grew up. At every stage, of course, the reader finds different sources of pleasure. As a child, as far as I can remember, I looked for interest, fantasy and a good laugh. Up to the age of eight or nine, children seem to live in a world of half fantasy and half reality. Many enjoy situations in which adults are outwitted. Thus, popular comics were Dandy, Beano and Rainbow, and not the sobersides Children's Newspaper. The Richmal Crompton 'William' books were great favorites. So was Enid Blyton. Adventure was found in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and R L Stevenson. Crime detection meant Sherlock Homes. Mystery and horror were supplied by writers such as Bram Stoker and Wilkie Collins. In more modern times, there seems to be little significant change, except that Superman, E.T. and space travel yarns have been added.\nThe common factor in most of this is that the child and young person can pick up a book and escape from the humdrum into a new world of excitement, sometimes identifying with the hero or heroine. Girls tend to favor school stories and, later, magazine romances and romantic novels, taste for the latter often lasting well into adult life.\n\nThe attraction of escapism, modified of course by experience, lasts into later life. Most adults enjoy a detective story for relaxation. The murder or crime concerned is rarely dealt with psychologically. It is merely the peg on which to hang the clues leading to the final solution. The best of such stories also develop character to some extent and reflect the social back- ground of the years in which the novel is set. Thus, the pleasure of reading, say Agatha Christie, is partly nostalgia and partly mental exercise. Emotion plays a negligible part.\n\nAnother genre of books written for pleasure and relaxation is the humorous novel, represented by P G Wodehouse, Mark Twain and Stephen Leacock. Here, the amusement lies in comedy of situation, turn of phrase, and very clever plotting. Again, they are period pieces, in the case of Wodehouse evocative of the idle young rich of the 30s, and entirely without social comment. Humor draws the sting from inequality.\n\nI read the above categories for pleasure, relaxation, and a good laugh. However, most educated people have a balanced reading diet which develops over the years as a result of specialization in one subject or another. Most of us have developed a general interest in politics and current events, and in democratic countries these are well covered in the responsible press and in specialized magazines. In fact, all subjects are catered for by specialized magazines, ranging from agriculture to car maintenance. In these contexts, the pleasure of riding is derived from interest in the subject.\n\nInterest in politics and current events leads to the development of a historical perspective, and hence interest in the past. This is well catered for in an immense body of historical and biographical literature. Social history is necessary to the understanding of current trends. Historical romances often provide a good read, and the best of them are very informative about the events of past times.\n\nHowever, the classics provide the best all-round source of pleasure. It is one thing to have to study texts for one's A or O Levels. That can be hard work. It is quite another to rid them for pleasure in later life. They offer a more sophisticated source of interest than can be obtained from any other genre; development of character, social and political comment, action and reflection, humor, pathos, sometimes tragedy. The appeal of poetry should not be ignored. The best of it requires the ultimate in the command of language."

        "title": "Birds",
        "content": "Within the past few years, interest in all aspects of our environment has increased in proportion to the damage we are doing to it. Birds form not only an attractive but an essential part of the environment. Yet the protection afforded to them is patchy, at best. Taking Europe as an example and France in particular, there is a custom in that country to shoot as many as possible of the small song-birds as they return north from their migration to Africa. They are considered a delicacy.\nOf course the shooting of birds in Britain for sport as well as for food has been a tradition for centuries, but the shooting is restricted to game birds, grouse, pheasants, partridges and wild duck. Except for the wild duck, these species are hand-reared and fed by gamekeepers, the numbers shot are limited, and the shooting-season, which begins on 12th August, ends well before the breeding season begins. Thus, the game species are well preserved.\n\nFor many years steps have been taken to maintain, if not increase numbers of all types of birds. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds keeps a careful watch on preservation, and has instigated laws against the theft of eggs, which are rigorously implemented. Many sanctuaries for water-birds as well as songbirds have been established up and down the length of Britain. The public in general has been educated to place a high value on the bird-life of their country.\n\nYet for reasons other than shooting and theft, various species seem to dwindle away to the point of extinction, causing widespread concern. For many decades, habitats have been systematically destroyed by the clearance of woods and hedges to provide the large fields needed for modern agriculture. Secondly, certain chemicals used to keep crops free from pests also destroyed the food on which many birds survived. Today, the problem is realized, and attention is given both to habitat and food, with the result that many species have been saved. Some chemicals, which also poisoned the birds themselves, have been banned. Wide strips between fields are left in their natural state to provide cover and nesting facilities. Many woods and coppices have been replanted with the traditional varieties of trees instead of the cash-crop conifers. Sea and marsh birds have been encouraged to return by exerting some control over land reclamation. In many countries, the protection of birds is being given a high priority.\n\nBirds are appreciated for their beauty and their song. However, neither faculty exists merely to please the human race. The colored plumage of many male birds has the function of impressing females prior to the mating season. Birdsong may have the same purpose at that time, though some of it seems to be simply the expression of joie de vivre and perhaps a means of staking out territory. The writer visited Belsen concentration camp shortly after its liberation. There was an eerie silence about the place. During and for some time after the holocaust, no bird came near the camp. So there may indeed be an emotional as well as a practical aspect to birdsong. Another practical function is to warn against predators and if possible scare them off.\n\nBirds play an essential part in the cycle of nature. They may and do raid crops, but they also eat grubs and insects which do far more damage. They also have a role as scavengers; that work is completed by the insects, which in turn fall prey to the birds.\n\nA few species, the ratital, have become flightless through natural selection. These are the emu, the ostrich, the rhea, the kiwi and the cassowary. The vast majority, the carinatal, are wonderfully adapted to flight, some being capable of spending most of their two to three-year lifespan on the wing. The muscular power of their wings relative to body-weight, and the aerodynamic efficiency of their wingspans and feather distribution, developed over millions of years, is one of nature's marvels. That is why the loss of so many land-birds through insensitive agricultural development, and of sea-birds through oil-spills, is such a tragedy.\n\nAnother class of birds under threat and forming an essential part of the natural cycle is the predator; owls, hawks, eagles etc. These control small rodent pests and act as scavengers. Some also provide the sport of falconry, being to some extent amenable to human control.\n\nPerhaps the most wonderful feature of the bird is its ability to navigate so accurately in migrating. Its high body temperature and stamina can be built up to sustain amazingly long journeys, but the way in which the Arctic tern, for example, can fly direct from pole to pole, selecting just one small island stop en route, is not fully understood. Theories are manifold, but since fledglings with no experience perform this miracle, much still remains to be learnt."

        "title": "\"The Arts speak not only to us but about us\". Discuss.",
        "content": "The instinct to produce an art-form is just one of a series of factors which differentiate us from the animal world. It dates back at least as far as the cave-dwellers of pre-history who produced wall drawings which possess both artistic ability and emotional power. Hunting is the main theme of these, but the situations depicted between man and beast are those of stress and danger. Were these drawings meant to exert a cathartic effect on man's natural fear by giving him a constant reminder of the worst he would have to face?\n\nThroughout recorded history, painting has fulfilled this dual role. Subject-matter, depicted in tempera, fresco, oil and color wash, has reflected every facet of human life and activity and of the natural world. In most periods, there seems to have been cultural freedom, but not in all. Fashion, convention and religious pressures have dictated both subject-matter and treatment in certain periods. The various European schools of the Middle Ages, with the exception of the Dutch and Flemish, largely confined themselves to religious and mythological subjects. These paintings were gifted but stylized. Following the Reformation, these constraints disappeared, and subject-matter broadened, though favorable portraiture of the aristocracy, who patronized prominent painters, has continued until modern times. Turner was the catalyst in shifting from the constraints of objectivity to the freedom of subjectivity. His work inspired the Impressionists, who painted according to their own often subconscious reactions to the subject-matter. This freedom allowed as much to be read into the character and outlook of the painter as into what appeared on the canvas.\n\nMuch the same may be said about sculpture. All the ancient civilizations have left examples, mostly by unknown artists, in stone, wood and metal, usually bronze. Until fairly recent times, European sculpture followed the traditions of classical Greece and Rome and of renaissance Italy. Much of it concentrated on the beauty and grace of the human form, both male and female, on athletes, on prominent figures, and on political, mythological and military groupings. While representational sculpture has always reflected contemporary fashion and taste in choice of subject-matter, the same cannot be said of much modern sculpture. As in some schools of painting, much modern sculpture is abstract in concept. It may be titled, but the interpretation is left to the individual viewer. Epstein and Henry Moore were prominent exponents of this school. It says little to most of us, and virtually nothing about us. Today's more extreme exponents are equally inscrutable.\n\nModern architecture provides a variation on the same theme. This is due to the availability of new materials; reinforced concrete, plastics and other synthetics. Such materials allow the construction of tower blocks and offices, since the old limitations imposed by weight at each floor level no longer apply. So since Gropius and Le Corbusier, architects have given themselves a free hand. Opinion is sharply divided as to their success. Many examples are functional, but the architects' fallacy has been to ignore two things : human reaction against user-unfriendliness, and compatibility with surroundings. In both contexts, much modern architecture fails dismally. It succeeds only where it replaces nothing of value, or where space is severely restricted, as in Hong Kong. In many countries which have a civilization spanning the centuries, consistency in design and use of materials has provided buildings which go well together, and fit into their natural backgrounds.\n\nTheatre, music and dancing all provide excellent examples of the truth of the topic-statement. The classical theatre of the Far East offers the Westerner great interest, since it speaks of a totally unfamiliar world and gives fascinating character insights. Western theatre offers three genres, all of them expressive of their periods : the classical, typified by Shakespeare and a host of others down to Edwardian times, the 30s drama, concerned exclusively with the doings of the British upper and middle classes, and the modern theatre, which is largely working-class based. It goes without saying that music speaks most eloquently to our emotions. Yet it also reflects the mores and tastes of the periods in which it was composed. J. S. Bach reflects the love of form, shape and dignity of the pre-Romantic period; many others, notably the later Beethoven and composers such as Liszt and Chopin, the freedoms of Romanticism, echoed in the poets of the period -- Wordsworth, Shelley, Tennyson and Byron.\n\nMuch more could be written about prose and poetry -- even the dance -- on the same theme, but the case seems to be proved! The arts not only speak to our emotions, they also reflect our lives."

        "title": "Travel is said to broaden the mind. How far do You agree?",
        "content": "What is meant by broaden the mind ? Its opposite is to be narrow-minded, and this implies a rigid outlook conforming to preconceived ideas, and reluctance to change or modify those ideas. Several factors go to produce such an attitude. First, we tend to follow parental guidance in behavior, in religion, and in social and political beliefs. These are often reinforced by school and state. Such conditioning leads either to inflexibility or to reaction.\n\nIn the West, the 60s heralded such a reaction. In the UK and the USA, one effect of war had been to demolish many social and international values. Moreover, air travel was becoming more available. The 50s saw an attempt in both countries to maintain pre-war values, such as the work ethic, class structures and general conformity to old standards. So young people began to rebel. They opted out of society. They joined movements such as Flower Power and other brands of oriental mysticism. Society was rejected, responsibility to the state discarded, and accepted moral standards rejected. The pop scene, with its songs of protest, came into being. San Francisco became the centre of this alternative society and the Mecca of young dropouts worldwide.\n\nThis major movement among young people persists to this day. It illustrates the complete reversal of the statement that travel broadens the mind. Minds had been changed by the media, and this resulted in travel. Recently, a more acceptable result has been achieved by the influence of the media. We are now made instantly aware by the media of the sufferings of the poor and powerless due to war, violence, terrorism, oppression, injustice and natural disaster. So many worthwhile young people now spend a year or so before or after their further education courses in voluntary service overseas. Again, this shows that the topic-statement is true up to a point. Much is learnt by young people on these overseas ventures, but the motivation behind their departure is as much compassion as the desire to gain experience.\n\nThis desire to learn from overseas travel was the ostensible motive behind the grand tour of Europe undertaken by rich young men and women in the 18th and 19th Centuries in Britain. The true motivation however was just to have a good time. Nobody bothered to learn the local languages. The rich young people stuck together, barely mixing even with their foreign counterparts. They usually came home as ignorant as they were when they left. Foreigners were merely quaint. They really belonged to the servant class.\n\nColonialism, in the days of the British Empire, for example, had various subtle effects on British character. Members of the Raj and the army were dispatched to, say India, with a set of preconceived ideas about the essential superiority and rightness of the British character and system. The system did good in many ways, not least in maintaining the pax Britannica . And undoubtedly some of the values of the colonized peoples brushed off on to the colonialists. Overseas trade which followed colonization had the same effect. Yet this applied to a limited cross-section of the British people. Xenophobia remained the general attitude. In 1938, a black missionary wearing a turban was invited to preach in a Midlands country church. On his arrival in the village he was followed to the vicarage by a jeering crowd. The writer of this essay learned something of the Middle East by spending some three years in Palestine after the Second World War. The British Army's task was to defend the mandate which limited the number of immigrant Jews. I went to Palestine a confirmed Arabs, somewhat hostile to the gradual takeover of the country by the Jews. However, having seen the condition of some of the survivors of the holocaust and learnt something of their indomitable courage, enterprise and willingness to work, I gradually achieved a more balanced view.\n\nSince the 1950s, air travel for business and pleasure has familiarized the ordinary person of many countries with the outlook, lifestyle, and good and bad qualities of other nations. The degree of this mind-broadening however depends on the traveler's maturity in the first place, because it is quite possible to travel and learn nothing. Many British people emigrate to warmer countries such as France, Spain, Italy and Cyprus to spend their retired years. These expatriates form colonies which might just as well be English villages. They do not learn the language of their adopted country, they take no interest in social and political affairs, they mix only with each other. Travel does not broaden their minds.\n\nSo perhaps the general principle that travel broadens the mind is true, although it should be qualified. First, there must be a genuine interest in the country concerned, and where possible at least a little of the language learnt. Second, there must be some attempt to learn something of the history, social outlook, customs and religion of that country. Third, an open mind is essential if travel is to confer any benefit; prejudice and preconceptions must be discarded. Finally, much can be learnt from foreign nationals living in your own country. Given these pre-conditions, foreign travel will become an essential ingredient in mutual understanding and therefore, hopefully, the spread of peace."

        "title": "\"Disasters bring out the best and the worst in people\". Discuss.",
        "content": "The media keep disaster in the forefront of our minds. TV, radio and the front pages of the press seem to revel in disaster, whether natural or man-made, because the public have a morbid curiosity in it, providing it happens to other people. Disaster boosts TV ratings and sells newspapers.\n\nAs we absorb the results of a civil war, a famine, an earthquake, a hurricane, an air crash, we tend to put ourselves in the position of the victims and wonder how we would react. In such situations, most people act instinctively, and what they do is more spontaneous than calculated. That spontaneity is usually the subconscious reflection of character, and because life for most of us is lived on an even keel, how we behave in emergency is largely unpredictable, unless we have been previously conditioned to react in certain ways.\n\nSo what governs our reaction to an emergency? The answer is character. Character is governed by genetic structure, by upbringing and training, and by self-discipline, or its absence. If we react badly, we show cowardice, selfishness and indifference to the plight of others. If we react well, our conduct reflects the opposite of these failings. In the latter case, genetic history alone may govern our actions, but in most cases, people are poised between good and bad. It is then that external conditioning will tip the scales in one direction or the other. Even more important than training is love, the kind which puts others first and helps us to forget self. This is relatively easy where our nearest and dearest are concerned, more difficult and perhaps more admirable where the others concerned have no emotional claim on us. The old Latin tag \"amor vincit omnia\", love conquers all things, is most germane to our reaction to disaster.\n\nThe Second World War gave me a vivid example of two contrasting reactions to the same event. The house of a neighbor received a direct hit from a bomb which killed one of the daughters of the family. The father was a sincere Christian. Most people would have shaken their fist at the skies over Coventry which were still full of German dive-bombers. Instead, he fell on his knees and prayed for the souls of the German pilots. The following day, what remained of his possessions lying round the shattered house were looted. Two very different reactions to disaster. Looting often follows the breakdown of law and order. It is never justifiable, but it may be less reprehensible in some circumstances than others. Some would disagree, but they are those who have never seen a disaster such as a famine. If my children were crying for food and I had the chance to steal a bag of flour to make bread for them, I think I would steal the flour. Would this action reflect the best or the worst in me?\n\nThere is no worse disaster than war, and the trench warfare of 1914-18 saw perhaps the greatest slaughter of humanity of all time. Caught in machine-gun crossfire and by artillery barrages, hundreds of thousands of men were killed or maimed in a single battle. Yet there were countless examples of bravery and unselfishness on both sides when men would help the wounded or engage hopeless odds with total disregard for their own survival. Some or these actions were recognized by the award of medals and decorations. Most were not. The unknown soldier was in some ways the most admirable product of this century.\n\nAnd whether the disaster be a war, an earthquake or a hurricane, adversity tends to bring people together in a way that nothing else can. It goes without saying that the effectiveness of a service unit depends on the fact that every man knows he can depend on his colleague, whether he likes him or not. Whatever the disaster, the same spirit is seen in most of the civilian population. People open their homes to each other, offer help, comfort and encouragement in a way which is never seen when life is easy and normal.\n\nCowardice accounts for most of people's worst reactions to disaster. In fact few people, if any, are fearless. What, then, accounts for acts of bravery? The truth lies in the old Biblical saying -- Perfect love casteth out fear. Another classic example of the dual result of disaster is the sinking of the SS Titanic in 1912. More than 1,500 people were drowned, because there was insufficient lifeboat space. First-class passengers had lifeboat priority; some voluntarily relinquished their seats to women sailing in the second class. Since it was a matter of women and children first , some men dressed themselves up as women. Thus, disaster brings out character.\n\nNot all of us would react to disaster as we think. Self- preservation is the strongest natural impulse of all. Indifference to self has to be a very powerful counter-impulse if we are to be confident of behaving in the way we would hope."

        "title": "What childhood illusions have you had shattered as you were growing up?",
        "content": "For the student, this essay should prove easy enough, since childhood and growing up are recent experiences. For this writer, it is not so easy, the growing up period being rather a long time ago. However, it is said that as we get older, childhood memories become much sharper, so I hope that what will now be written is based in fact and not in fancy!\nI was lucky enough to have good parents, who gave me a secure background and who were ambitious for me to achieve success. in life. Some children then, and perhaps more now in Britain, lacked this basic advantage. Almost from birth, these children are neglected, often ill-treated, subjected to violence or abuse. Few are given incentives. They grow up believing that the world is against them, and quickly become street-wise , concerned with self-protection, and using violence to get something out of life. Childish illusions are knocked out of them almost from birth. Their view of life may be distorted, but it is realistic.\n\nAs a more fortunate boy, my first illusion was that life is essentially fair, that people who merit life's rewards always receive them, and that the tragedies of life are somehow deserved. It took the death of my best friend following a sudden terminal illness to shatter that illusion. That episode, and at a later stage, the deaths of so many of my contemporaries in the Second World War, finally convinced me that life is not a tight moral framework. It was not until many years had passed that I began to perceive the answers which a religious faith supplies. The obverse of that coin is that life often is fair when one hopes for a little unfairness. I remember having to take a History exam for which I had done little or no work. The night before the exam, I prayed hard for the few questions I could answer which would give me a pass. The right questions didn't come, and quite rightly I failed.\n\nChildren brought up with a religious background believe that prayers are always answered. One day, as a small boy, I had been stopped by my father from doing something I wanted to do, and I was angry. It came to bedtime, and prayers, finally to 'God bless ...' So I said, with my father present, 'God bless Mummy, and Grannie and Grandpa, and my dog, and that's all!' It took me some years to realize that God takes a rather more sophisticated view of our prayer life.\n\nAnother illusion is that the world is a safe place, that people are basically kind, and that they will never harm children. That was much more true in my youth than it is today, when, at least in Britain, children are taught never to speak to strangers. This is for obvious reasons in view of the great increase in child molestation and even abduction. As a child, I lived on the outskirts of a Midlands city but in easy reach of the country- side. My friends and I could roam freely through the lanes and over farm land, given a benevolent farmer. However, word went round that a small girl I knew had had something nasty done to her. The grown-ups wouldn't specify what that nasty thing was, but we were all warned not to talk to strange men. Another illusion shattered, but that was rather exceptional in those days.\n\nI cannot over-praise the kindness of my parents, but in their advice, however kindly meant, there was sometimes a false note. Mothers are naturally protective, sometimes over-protective. Mine was always averse to my playing rugby football, for which I had some talent. Of course some people get hurt. I was always rather in two minds until I realized the difference between natural concern and over-protectiveness. Another fact unrealized at the time is that great, sometimes life-long friendships are made through that most social of all games. To believe that parents are always wise is another illusion.\n\nHowever kind parents may be to their children, their conduct to each other is not always perfect. If we are fortunate as young children, we tend to idealize parental relationships. Differences soon become apparent, however, and another illusion is soon shattered. In the Britain of the 30s, marriage was sacrosanct. Divorce was career-threatening and socially unacceptable. Unhappiness therefore tended to fester within an ostensibly good marriage. Children were generally shielded from a soured relationship, but raised voices in another room, inexplicable absences by father, the visits of strange men to mother when she was alone, soon shattered the illusion that they married and lived happily ever after .\n\nPerhaps the final illusion to go the same way may be attributed to a strong body and a good constitution. Such physical assets build up the subconscious belief that one will live for ever. Accidents will always happen to other people. So will the aging process. These illusions are soon laid to rest."

        "title": "Reading novels is a waste of time. Discuss.",
        "content": "The designation novel covers a very wide spectrum of literature. It comprises the classic works of fiction of all countries. By definition, a novel is a prose piece of over 60,000 words. Many are much longer. Anything shorter is a novella ; if much shorter, a short story. The genre grew up independently in many countries, particularly those of Europe, though since this is an English General Paper it is the English (or British) tradition that will generally be referred to, with occasional references to countries which have produced fiction in some kind of English, such as the USA.\nFiction of course is not limited to the classics, which form a relatively small part of it. For at least three centuries the bookshops have always been full of the more ephemeral kinds of prose; the American block-buster , the J Arthur Clarke type of space fiction, the ghost story, the detective whodunnit ?, the romantic novel, the psychological thriller, the historical novel, the adventure story, the war story. The list is endless.\n\nIt is quite possible to become hooked on novel reading, and this has two dangers. To read novels when you should be doing something else, e.g. study, or practical chores, is indeed a waste of time. And it is never courteous to have one's nose in a novel when visitors arrive! Secondly, there are some people who find in a novel a means of escape from reality. This has other dangers. Too much relapse into fantasy may destroy one's ability to face facts.\n\nIf reading novels can be a waste of time, reading bad novels is always a waste of time and can be positively harmful. A really bad novel is not easy to define, but for anybody with intellect it has some, or even all of the following features: unreality in characterization and situation, poor construction, concentration on sex and violence for the sake of it, bad sentence construction, a boring approach, expletives and bad language generally, a biased attitude to people, situations and issues, and stereotyping of characters.\n\nThat said, to read anything is arguably better than read nothing, or sinking to the bottom line, mindless television watching. At least the capacity to read demonstrates that one is literate. In Britain today, there is an alarming number of school-leavers from the state system who can neither read nor write.\n\nThe case for reading the classics need hardly be made. Their characters live, and are of their time. Descriptions of town and country engross the reader. Stories, and therefore plots, seem to grow out of the characters. Often, great national events, wars and revolutions provide the background, but are integral at the same time. Characters and great events affect each other. The same process is seen in the good political, maritime or war story. The classical novel provides a window on another world; good contemporary novels offer new insights into our own world. The reader will inevitably gain in knowledge and understanding from this class of literature. Such reading supplies valuable background material for other studies; history, sociology, politics, psychology and economics.\n\nHowever, life is not all self-improvement, or shouldn't be. Reading for pure relaxation can do the reader nothing but good. The poor, ugly girl may find a therapeutic escape in a romantic novel. Just such a person as she is may be picked up by a dark, handsome, rich, even aristocratic stranger and transported into new worlds of delight. Why not? It will never happen, but there is no harm in dreaming. And there is the comfortable, stately world of the country house murder , where death is relatively bloodless, and the 'culprit turns out to be the colonel, the butler, or a rogue vicar. Pitting one's wits against the author's is a good form of relaxation. So, to the English reader, are the novels of P G Wodehouse, which open windows on the life of the idle rich in England in the 20s, contain absolutely no social comment on the rigid class system of the time, are brilliantly constructed, and contain laughs on every page.\n\nProvisos have been mentioned, and given those, no sane person could say that reading novels is a waste of time."

        "content": "The answer is that computers already allow some people to work from home, though clearly this cannot apply to more than a limited number of people and a limited number of occupations. As to whether this is desirable, the answer is philosophical as well as practical.\n\nComputers, both analog and digital, have developed out of all recognition since the Second World War, when they were large, mechanical, and limited in use. They were then used in conjunction with radar for missile guidance and also for code breaking and a small range of mathematical functions. Most of these functions are now available in a child's pocket calculator. The application of electronics in the 50s followed by the use of the silicon chip and pre-printed circuits widened the computer's function out of all recognition, permitting a myriad series of voltage controls. The computer today is powerful, compact and relatively small. It combines readily with word-processing, faxing, and the electronic creation of screen graphics, which can be modified either by keyboard control or by electronic pen. The analog computer rapidly solves\n\ndifferential equations for civil and mechanical engineering problems. The digital computer with its card-punching function permits access to data banks, and allows the processing of records and all the kinds of work connected with bills, orders, wages, VAT, etc. The computer today is integral in the world of business, commerce, design, word-processing and industry in general. Any organization from the small business upwards keeps a computer to which remote terminals may be linked, giving access at a distance to all its functions and information.\nThe need for all white-collar workers to do a nine-to-five job in the office has disappeared. Today, it is obviously possible for all workers down to lower- management level to work from home, and as computers continue to develop, it is likely that firms will find it convenient to let an increasing number do so. Whether this is a desirable change is a moot point.\n\nSome visionaries anticipate the day when computers, in combination with robotry, will totally eliminate the need for work as we know it. This may theoretically become possible, though in any event computers could never quite eliminate the need for maintenance groups. To most of us, however, such a prospect would be appalling. Leisure only has value by reason of its contrast with work, and the instinct to work is a built-in part of the human make-up. The past millennia have not adjusted our genes in this direction for nothing.\n\nA more likely scenario is that a much higher proportion of workers will eventually be able to operate from home. Of course, many people have always done so. The writer, the painter, the sculptor either work in the study or in an adjacent studio. Even the professional musician practices at home. Some of these are reclusive by nature, others not.\n\nThe majority of people are naturally gregarious. To produce their best, they need both the company of others, and the atmosphere of work. There is an instinct to go out to the job, and with all, save workaholics, to be able to draw a clear line between work and leisure. The benefits of doing so are obvious. Easy association with others is confidence building. Ideas improve and extend as they are exchanged. You cannot get the feel of a firm or institution at long range. If you have any responsibility at all you need to be in personal touch with managers and directors, not for ever using the telephone or the fax machine. And what about the social side, the friends made, the office party, the human element?\n\nTo work in public demands a certain standard of dress and personal care. It would need more self-discipline than many people have to keep up the same standards at home. Self-discipline and the observance of good routines may come easily to some, but not all.\n\nThe reality of today's work-pattern is that when children are of school-age, wives also take on paid employment. Perhaps the wife also would have a computer terminal and all the paraphernalia of a modern office? Would they share facilities or duplicate equipment? How many flats and small houses have even one room which could be turned into an office? Who would make the coffee, cook the meals, collect the children, do the shopping and the housework? One can foresee many sources of domestic discord!\n\nComputers may change. Human nature does not. As a tool, the computer is vulnerable to the enemy, industrial or personal. Hackers can wipe out records unless there is duplicated soft-ware backup kept under lock and key. Hackers can introduce a virus.\n\nThe more one considers the implications of working from home, the less desirable the project seems to be."

        "title": "Young people are slaves to fashion. Discuss.",
        "content": "Young people, or teenagers, are an invention of the American exploitation of the early 60s. The contemporary hype built them up into a separate class of society, and since jobs and money were plentiful in those days, the promotion of fashion in dress, music, politics and general outlook proved very profitable. Prior to 1960, people aged under eighteen were children; above eighteen, adults.\n\nThe cult swept the USA, then Britain and Europe, and finally many Eastern and Far Eastern countries, even where it was proscribed, as in China and pre-Gorbachev Russia. The promoters made full use of two factors common to the thirteen to eighteen age group; adolescent insecurity, and the concomitant desire to conform to peer pressures. Hence they became slaves to fashion.\n\nAs already indicated, fashion applied not only to clothes but to the whole of life. Some of it was harmless enough. Throughout history, the instinct to conform to current clothing styles was an unchanging phenomenon in the adult world. Up to the 60s, young people wore school uniform; in leisure hours, adult clothing. The radical change in the early 60s reflected the post-war instinct to defy conventions which were basically pre-war, and therefore associated with adult repression. So the tee-shirt and jeans culture was born, the tee-shirts carrying anti-establishment legends, references to hard left social policies, the lure of uncontrolled sex, the support of homosexuality, the attractions of the drop-out culture, and the wonders of the fast-growing hallucinatory drug scene.\n\nAs mentioned, some of this was inevitable and harmless. Some of it was pernicious. The pernicious element was centered in San Francisco, though it later infected London, Paris, and other major cities.\n\nAlongside this arose the pop music cult, and the successful stars and groups became the objects of hysterical teenage adulation. Presley, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles became the wealthy heroes. The subversive and corrupting views of some of them did immense harm. The fashions they set became irresistible.\n\nIn the later 60s and 70s, violence as well as drugs, alcohol and indiscriminate sex became fashionable. In Britain, for example, teenagers of both sexes joined one of two fashionable groups, the Mods and the Rockers. The Mods wore trendy, velveteen styles and rode mopeds. The Rockers dressed in leather and rode powerful motorbikes. Large groups of each faction would foregather in the main seaside resorts and engage in pitched, sometimes bloody battles. Later, the same cross-section turned to violent protest, vandalism and football hooliganism. The police have managed to stamp out most of this, and most teenage hysteria is currently connected with the pop scene and the occasional acid house party. For thirty years, the slavish following of fashion has led many young people astray.\n\nBut not all. Every coin has two sides, and despite all the foregoing, many, perhaps the majority of young people, are proving to be a very fine generation. Certainly they conform to teenage dress norms, enjoy pop music and modern dance, but in all essential respects they are first-class, certainly far more worthwhile than most of my contemporaries at the same age. We were conformist to adult ideas and attitudes, but in many ways we were lazy, self-interested, and entirely lacking in any real social conscience. We were quite oblivious to the overseas poor, the environment, the victims of disaster, whether natural or man-made, and to the animal world. In fact, we were selfish, and rather self-indulgent. No drugs, certainly, but plenty of cigarettes and alcohol.\n\nToday, many admirable features are seen in the young. They are individualistic rather than conformist. They eschew smoking, drugs and alcohol. They are fitter and generally more athletic than their predecessors. Many do social work in their spare time and some spend a year on voluntary service overseas. They have a conscience about people less fortunate and about the well-being of our world. They work hard and prepare for a market in which jobs are far from plentiful.\n\nAdmittedly, the media nowadays bring the world's suffering and problems to their attention with an immediacy unknown in earlier days. Yet the fact is that they respond. They are slaves, not so much to fashion, as to their consciences, and that is by no means a bad form of slavery."

        "content": "First, what is this effect? Ever since the Industrial Revolution began in the 18th century, smoke from fossil fuels, oil, natural gas and especially coal has deposited carbon dioxide in the lower part of the earth's upper atmosphere. The effect of this has been that part of the energy of the sun's rays reflected from the earth's surface has been absorbed by the CO2 and by water vapor and returned to the earth in the form of heat. Thus the atmosphere is behaving increasingly like a greenhouse. The glass allows the sunlight through but traps the heat. The consequence is what is called global warming.\nThere is a school of thought which says that the result will be a change in the earth's climate, plus an increase in nitrous oxide, methane gas and FREONS. It is predicted that by the mid-21st century, average temperatures will rise by 5 degrees C (9 degrees F). This will result in the melting of glaciers and the polar ice-caps. Coastal waters will rise and inundate many low-lying countries. Food production for an increasing world population will be put at risk.\n\nNot everyone, of course, accepts this scenario, though the quantity of CO2 in the lower upper-atmosphere is constantly monitored, and the fact that the level is increasing is not disputed. Whether or not the expected rise in average temperature will happen is another matter. There have been no significant climatic changes for centuries, indeed millennia and, the opponents of the doom-merchants argue, nature has its own methods of damage-limitation and self-adjustment. Moreover, there are no present signs of global warming. The weather patter in Britain, for example, is much the same as it was in Victorian days, or Roman days for that matter. Why should it suddenly change? Coal has always been burnt and before coal, wood and charcoal. Forest fires have always raged. Volcanoes, and explosions such as Krakatoa (1883) have always thrown tons of noxious gases into the atmosphere. After that particular explosion, a cloud of dust and gas drifted over Europe and darkened the sun for six months - before dispersing naturally. A tidal wave drowned 36,000 in the Java-Sumatra area. Nature's self-damage greatly exceeds any possible human contribution.\n\nThe fact is, however, that many people do take the greenhouse threat seriously, and there is a cross-section of people in most industrialized countries who lobby continuously against the continued use of fossil fuels. Whether they are right, or merely alarmist, only time will tell. However, the fact that CO2 is on the increase is undisputed. Further, it cannot be disputed that the greenhouse effect is a possibility, even if remote. Nuclear war is also a possibility, though remote, but every possible step is taken by democratic countries to ensure that it will not happen. So, therefore, should every possible step be taken to reduce, even eliminate CO2 emissions. There are already agreements in the USA and in Europe to cut down, or eliminate the use of fossil fuels by certain target dates.\n\nThe problem is that many countries are geared to fossil rather than nuclear power sources. Supplies of coal, and probably of oil and natural gas, are virtually unlimited. In Britain, most pits have closed down, causing wide-spread unemployment and much consequent human suffering. The coal lobby argues for emission cleansing and a compromise, both economic and environmental, may be possible. It would be cheaper, they argue, than to transfer entirely to nuclear power, whose installations may in any event cause health hazards and even the occasional disaster.\n\nOne optimistic sign is that proponents of all power sources agree that every generation has an obligation to preserve rather than exploit and pollute the planet. The worst culprits in the CO2 saga are the old-fashioned heavy industry plants, such as those in the Ruhr, East Germany, and what was the Soviet Union, and the fossil-fuel fired electricity-generating stations. Much of the old industrial plant has now been either modernized or superseded, and some countries such as France have moved over almost entirely to nuclear power. That, in my opinion, is the way forward.\n\nI do not believe that in any event, the greenhouse effect would have the dire consequences which have been predicted. Yet, it is a risk which we should not take. Modern technology has outgrown the use of fossil fuels, and apart from any possible dangers to future generations, the kind of world to which we commit them should be a clean, wholesome and beautiful world, as the Creator intended."

        "title": "If one could choose to be endowed with a great gift or talent, which one would you choose, and why?",
        "content": "I would certainly choose to be a concert-standard pianist, but please don't misunderstand. I have no desire to hear the thunderous applause, to be taken by the hand as the conductor and I acknowledge the standing ovation, to receive the bouquet, to come back on stage four times, to play a brilliant encore, to read the glowing press notices at the end of a late-night party.\n\nAll that is best left to the people who like that sort of thing. I merely want to match the professionals, to play as fluently, to memorize as completely, to express the composer's intentions as deeply.\n\nYou may have gathered that I am a competent pianist. I know that I shall never get much better. I need the music in front of me. I do not own a Steinway grand, but a gallant old Brinsmead upright, now in its eightieth year. One plays - and one dreams!\n\nSo what about the 'great gift or talent'? Is one born with it, or can it be developed? The answers are yes and no. Occasionally, in a televised piano competition, one sees a young boy or girl, say aged thirteen or fourteen, sit down and play a Chopin ballade or a devilishly difficult piece of Liszt with consummate, almost contemptuous ease. That has to be talent. I could never do it in a thousand years. I used to tell myself that I could if I practiced more. Now I merely recognize that gift in others. I would never deny that to flower into perfection, the gift must be complemented by hours of practice, daily. Yet without the gift, no amount of practice will achieve the result. The word 'practice' implies a chore, the kind of mental resolution which says 'I will do half an hour a day'. Well, yes, that will improve the muscles and therefore the performance. Yet, the talented youngster is content to live at the keyboard, with a short break every few hours for a sausage roll and a coca-cola. And in turn this implies a musical background - since I believe that such people are favored genetically - encouragement, a good piano, and above all opportunity. The development of a great gift has to be at the expense of a good general education. My late wife used to teach maths to Toots Lockwood, and grumble because Margaret's young daughter made little progress. Toots, a budding actress herself, once made the precocious remark 'Mummy didn't need maths to become a star, did she?'\n\nThere are various reasons why I would like to have been a gifted pianist. Firstly, for my own satisfaction, since I enjoy playing a wide variety of composers and would dearly love to extend my repertoire. Secondly, I would like to be able to hold each piece, however long, in my memory, and to be able to think exclusively of the interpretation as my fingers automatically translated the score into sound.\n\nAlso, I would like to be confident about entertaining my friends, and this demands not only memory but the ability to improvise. Fluent improvisation is a gift not possessed by all great pianists. The story goes that the jazz pianist Art Tatum once challenged the great Solomon to improvise on the tune 'Lady be good' for as long as he could. Solomon gave up after ten minutes. Tatum manipulated the tune for half an hour without repeating himself. So, my guilty secret is that I enjoy playing jazz music as much as classical. Certainly not the modern variety of the Dave Brubeck school, with its unrhythmic runs and depressingly awful harmonies. But give me Duke Ellington, Earl Hines, Teddy Wilson, Fats Waller - especially Waller - and I am happy. If I had Waller's rhythm and Tatum's ingenuity, life would be a rich thing!\n\nSo, personal satisfaction, giving pleasure to my family and a few friends, and helping my grandchildren, all of whom play the piano at varying levels consonant with their ages. None is likely to show a great gift or talent, but they will all become competent, like me. There is no greater satisfaction than giving them a hand with their scales, their theory, their pieces at Grades 3, 4 or 5.\n\nOne of them is likely to become a better pianist than me. She may even become very good, but like the rest of us, she will never be a virtuoso. I am rather thankful for this, because life is tough at the top, and there are many drawbacks to a concert pianist's life: jet-lag, bad hotels, the envy of one's peers, an unbalanced life, perhaps a marital breakdown.\n\nI prefer to have my cake and eat it. I would like the talent, but none of the pizzazz which always seems to go with it."

        "title": "It is a sweet and honorable thing to die for one's country. The poet Wilfred Owen described this saying as 'the old lie'. Do you agree?",
        "content": "This is a very old saying. Whether it is the old lie is arguable. In his odes, the Roman poet Horace wrote this no less than three times: 'dulce et decorum est pro patria mori'. He lived from 65 to 8 B.C., was also a soldier, fought at Philippi, afterwards lost his estate, and was reduced to poverty. He remained a patriot. The poet Wilfred Owen, a resident of France, returned to England to enlist in the First World War at the age of 22, fought in the trenches, and was killed at age 25, a week before the Armistice in 1918.\nThe most prominent war poet, Owen's verse expresses his hatred of war. How much of his virulence was due to the emotional instability caused by his homosexuality is a moot point. The fact remains that he fought. Why?\n\nThe intervening two thousand years have polarized the divide between the patriot and the pacifist. Any book of quotations offers scores of examples of quotations supporting both sides; Samuel Johnson described patriotism as the last refuge of a scoundrel ; Thomas Campbell wrote 'The patriot's blood's the seed of Freedom's tree'.\n\nFor various reasons, the modern pacifist's case is perhaps stronger than of his predecessors. Firstly, because the 20th century, in two major wars, made civilian enlistment compulsory on the part of the countries involved. In the UK in the First World War, extreme moral pressure was brought to bear. Any man not seen in uniform was in danger of being given a white feather by the women - for cowardice. The actual reasons for opting out varied; it could be cowardice, it could be a different form of national service, it could be a lifelong and previously stated total rejection of violence in any circumstances. In the latter case, such views were generally respected, providing some other contribution to the war effort was made. The Society of Friends (the 'Quakers') provides a good example in the Second World War. These men and women were prepared to risk their lives, and many lost their lives, in some form of national service; medical work, ambulance driving, merchant shipping crews, etc. One Christian school of thought rejects any kind of participation in war, arguing that aggressors should not be resisted, that tyranny, carrying as it does the seeds of its own eventual downfall, should be accepted. Their case has been greatly strengthened by the fundamental difference between earlier wars and those of this century. In the two wars 1914 - 18 and 1939 - 45, civilian populations were involved, like it or not, because of bombing raids, and ultimately the use of the atom bomb against Japan. Nothing, they argue, can justify what happened to London, Coventry, Dresden, Wuppertal, Cologne, Berlin, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nothing justifies mass slaughter. The future use of the hydrogen bomb would be even more horrific.\n\nAnd now the case for patriotism. Like it or not, the citizens of all civilized countries owe an incalculable debt to their homelands; protection from foreign aggression, from internal crime, from disease, from penury. They receive education, a minimum standard of living, an old-age pension; complete personal freedom, in keeping with law, freedom of religious worship, freedom of movement, every opportunity for self-advancement, at least in the democracies. In such countries, everybody is born under an obligation to the state, and if that obligation is rejected, so also should be the benefits mentioned. Perhaps even more fundamental is a built-in affection for the distinctive characteristics of one's own country, its history, traditions, folk-ethic, literature, music, human relationships. An aggressor such as Hitler would wipe out all these things, as he almost wiped out the Jewish population of Europe. He would replace freedom with tyranny, he would consign dissidents to concentration camps. So not only is force of arms justified in a defensive role, it is also justified in some categories of offence; e.g. intervention in foreign countries where populations are threatened with genocide, as currently in Yugoslavia and Ethiopia. This type of intervention is rightly carried out by professional armed service members at the instigation of the United Nations.\n\nWhat cannot be justified on patriotic grounds is expansionist aggression as is favored by certain leaders or, as in the past, by the empire-building countries of Europe, whether or not their rule imparted freedom, stability, enlightenment and prosperity.\n\nNone of us can accept what our own country has given us and still remain, morally, totally free agents. So given the provisos mentioned, and with every respect to the best kind of pacifist, I believe that the true patriot wins the argument."

        "title": "Those who have no knowledge of the past are condemned to repeat it. Is a knowledge of history important?",
        "content": "Historical knowledge is not only important. It is a crucial requirement in all who carry any kind of responsibility, whether in social, industrial, political or international affairs. In all these spheres, a knowledge of the past enables countries and individuals to sidestep old problem and to avoid the mistakes of the past.\n\nWhether peoples and countries actually do learn from past experience is a wholly different matter. During this century, Prussian aggression plunged Europe into two major wars. Basically, Germany never existed, any more than does Italy, or did the Soviet Union . The amalgamation of their constituent states is of quite recent origin. The break-up of the Soviet Union was due to the irrelevance of Communism in the modern world. This has done much for world peace, though there are still nuclear dangers. The case of Germany and Italy is quite different. National Socialism never sat easily on the Italians, so in 1945 there was no point in occupying Italy and regionalizing her government. She never had any real ambition to do more than unify her own states, and colonialism began to die a natural death in all European countries from 1946 onwards. In all this, the Allies showed wisdom based on the lessons of history. In their dealings with Germany, however, the story is different. The USA, with little personal history and less expertise in foreign affairs, put pressure on the Allies to re-unify Western Germany and to negotiate the existence of East\n\nGermany with Stalin. In the form of Marshall Aid, the USA poured money into West Germany, established a central government in Bonn, put industry back on a good footing, created a hard currency, reorganized their unions, and let them rebuild a massive army, albeit without nuclear armaments. For years Germany has kept quiet, awaiting her opportunity. The outcome is that in 1992, the whole of Germany had reunited, the power-base had shifted back to Berlin, and the country had achieved political, industrial and fiscal domination in Europe once again. The old enmity with France and England lies just beneath the surface. Zenophobia is again becoming rampant, and may develop into ethnic cleansing , that modern euphemism. The first danger in Europe will again be Germany. Their national anthem 'Deutschland uber Alles' sums up the national ideal, which is unlimited territorial expansion. The lesson of the past was there, and it was ignored.\nA knowledge of the past is also important socially, and governments, whether of Eastern or Western countries, ignore social history at their peril. One success in Britain post-Second World War was the establishment of the Welfare State. This was a humane and far-reaching concept designed to keep the whole population up to a basic living standard, to give free or subsidized medical care on demand, and to provide realistic state pensions for the elderly. It still exists in a modified form, and no government would dare to abolish it. The idea was to rid society of poverty, sickness and insecurity. The lessons of the past had been well learnt. Throughout English history, and especially in Victorian times, grinding poverty was the norm for the masses, both urban and rural. Laws against petty theft were brutal. Matters scarcely improved after the First World War. Unemployment in the 1920s was widespread. The dole was pitiful. So there was a general strike, street rioting, and near-revolution. This was in line with many minor revolutions which have occurred throughout English history. The Second World War provided not only a diversion from social failure but also an opportunity of uniting Britain to resist a serious threat from outside. From 1945 onwards, the old mistake of neglecting the working class was not repeated. Yet despite history, England perpetuates her ancient errors in respect of Ireland. Partition has never worked anywhere in the world. The Protestant north is in perpetual enmity with the Catholic south. So much dirty water has passed under the bridge form Cromwellian days onwards that peace can never be achieved. Neither can it be imposed, short of mounting a military campaign. In times of national crisis, Eire has proved ambivalent and treacherous. The harsh, but pragmatic answer is to pull our forces out, and allow the Irish problem to sort itself out. That means allowing civil war, but since both sides are permanently entrenched in mutual opposition and hatred, there may well be no realistic alternative.\n\nA second disastrous mistake in recent English governmental policy was the imposition of the poll tax, known euphemistically as the Community Charge. This was meant to be a replacement for the old property rating system, which was admittedly in need of revision. The poll tax led to financial injustices which exceeded the tolerance level of the British people. So Mrs. Thatcher had to go, and the government climbed down. English history records many attempts to impose a poll tax. None succeeded, and all ended in riot and bloodshed.\n\nYet perhaps England's most serious recent mistake is the headlong rush into membership of a federal Europe, dominated by Germany, controlled from Strassburg and administered in Brussels. France and Germany will vie for control of this monstrosity. British internal sovereignty is already severely eroded, and will finally disappear unless some future government comes to its senses. The Council of Europe has made participation in free trade dependent on membership. The sacrifice of principle to financial advantage has never worked in the past. Why should it in the future?\n\nThe past holds countless examples of the failure of most of the policies Britain currently follows. Their lessons are rarely learnt. A knowledge of history is important, of course, but such knowledge is of little use if the old mistakes are persistently repeated."

        "title": "What changes would you like to see in today's society?",
        "content": "The term society has no general application. Every country differs from every other, however subtly, so answers must relate to a particular country. This answer relates to England, not even the whole of Britain.\n\nPerhaps the first point to acknowledge is that in comparison with many other countries, England has an overwhelming number of good features. Yet there are several aspects of our society which I would like to see changed. Some of these changes could be effected immediately. Others would take longer. Society does not exist, said Mrs. Thatcher. She was wrong. Society consists of an aggregate of families. The first change I would like to see is the reversal of the current steady breakdown of family life. In Britain, the monarch stands at the head of the state and of the Established Church. In return for the privileges of their position, it has been generally expected of the Royal Family that they set an example to the country, and in the case of the Queen this example has undoubtedly been set. Not so, in the case of most of the other royals. In 1992 the so-called example set by this family has been appalling. This need not be spelled out. The world media have done this very effectively. The Queen herself described last year as an 'annus horribilis'. Many responsible people rightly wonder about the future of the monarchy, and their thinking tends to move in the direction of a republic. In the modern world, there is a strong case to be made for the abolition of hereditary privilege. However, the breakdown of family life cannot be attributed to the poor example of the minor royals. It actually stems from the permissiveness of the 1960s. The result is much suffering caused to children and young people, some of whom leave, or are virtually forced out of their homes, only to live in one of the cardboard cities , or to be put into care, or to join the drug scene and commit crime.\n\nUnemployment, currently standing at 3m plus, is another aggravating factor. The present government has no policy to deal with this, and gives every indication of being quite indifferent to the problem. Interim measures could be taken until the world trade recession eases. Much work is needed on local environmental projects and on the updating of the country's infrastructure, which has been grossly neglected for decades. This could be financed by a modest increase in income tax, a measure which I believe would be generally acceptable. We have an uncaring government, the result being that many once prosperous areas are now centers of poverty and despair. Throughout the country, small businesses are being forced to close at the rate of hundreds per day. This is because the government refuses to impose controls over rent and leasehold increases and to reduce the swinging industrial rate. The net result of all this is that people are reluctant to spend, because they live in fear of redundancy or unemployment and, even worse, house repossession, in cases where heavy mortgages were taken on in better times. The house market is a good indicator of confidence in the future. It has now been at a virtual standstill for five years.\nThirdly, crime, especially violence. Due to the decline in religious faith and the consequent lack of moral training in home and school, crime levels have become appallingly high over the past few decades. Bad social conditions in many areas exacerbate the problem. Prisons are overcrowded, so the judiciary is encouraged to minimize custodial sentences. The fundamental remedy is a return to Christian moral standards, or those of the other great religions, now represented among the large immigrant population. Many of them are setting the native English a good example. The latter offer young people little help, and certainly little discipline at home, and the reputation of teachers in the state sector has never been lower.\n\nMuch is being done to stamp out the evils of hallucinatory drugs in Britain. This country would do well to adopt some of the draconian measures which are proving successful in some Far Eastern countries.\n\nIn the case of child sexual abuse and violence occasioning actual bodily harm, custodial sentences are now mandatory. This is justified, since such offences have greatly increased in recent decades. At one time, children were safe to roam their own areas without fear of molestation. Today, this is impossible.\n\nNext, housing. Good neighborliness was the prime feature of pre-war terraced housing, now replaced in many cities by tower blocks and complexes of maisonettes. These concrete monstrosities eliminate family identity and encourage crime and vandalism. This is now realized. Much of this post-war building is now being demolished, and domestic architecture is reverting to old patterns. More low-cost or rentable accommodation would ease several social problems.\n\nEngland welcomes immigrants, and laws have been passed to outlaw discrimination. Most immigrants provide an enriching contribution. Their churches, mosques and temples are acceptable to most people. However, there is a down side. Numbers have to be controlled, and this leads to disputes. A bad mistake was to allow 'ghettoes' to be formed in the early post- war days. An even distribution of this influx should have been made mandatory in the early days. The basis of that is the immigrants, while preserving their social and religious identities, must also accept and respect British traditions. Agitators operate much more easily in areas of dense population, often inciting violence between groups in the wake of violence overseas.\n\nTo believe that all these defects in English society can be changed is to live in cloud cuckoo land. All the same, these are the objectives which we must all work for."

        "title": "Can telling lies ever be justified?",
        "content": "The old admonition to children, 'speak the truth and shame the devil', runs contrary to what is called the schoolboy's eleventh commandment; 'tell a lie, and stick to it'. The one adage advocates honesty at whatever personal cost. When charged with some illicit tree-felling, the young George Washington is said to have said 'I cannot tell a lie'. Those who advocate moral rectitude always argue that honesty is the best policy. Those who do not say 'get away with wrong-doing if you can'. Thus, as a child you avoid punishment. As an adult, you hope to avoid the consequences of your actions. The one is the result of a strong sense of morality. The other stems from self-interest and indifference to the fate of other people. Silence itself may amount to a lie, particularly when it is meant to shift blame from oneself. Cicero said it is the nature of a scoundrel to deceive by lying , and it may well be argued that truth is an integral factor in the health of society. Justice itself depends on witnesses pledging themselves to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth . The law has severe penalties for those who perjure themselves after taking this oath.\n\nSo logically there should be no circumstances in which lying can ever be justified. Yet, we can all think of occasions when to tell the truth would be a very mixed blessing.\n\nThis applies especially to those who have access to secrets of national importance, particularly in wartime, or when there is danger of war. In these circumstances another moral issue is raised, and that is where personal loyalty lies. Most would say to one's own country. For others, a strong political belief, based on conviction, is more cogent. So, during the 'Cold War' between NATO and the Communist bloc, people on both sides were prepared to betray their country's secrets. This was generally out of conviction rather than for money, though the spy was usually rewarded in some way, sometimes by asylum and the conferring of honors and position. Such men and women would argue, and some still do, that the ultimate end justifies the means, if the means included lying and deception, so be it.\n\nThe same principle applied particularly in the 1939 - 45 war. The allies relied heavily on agents, and the lies which were part of their stock-in-trade. Disinformation was born and played a prominent role on both sides. Some of the deception was very elaborate indeed. Hitler's forces in France were tricked into believing that the invasion would be at the Pas de Calais rather than along the Normandy coast. England created a wholly fictitious army in the wrong place by setting up a subtle system of signaling, designed to be picked up across the channel. German doubts were settled by the planting of spurious invasion plans by agents in France. As a result, the invasion was given a good start. Every patriotic Englishman would say that all the lies and deception were amply justified both by the motivation and in the event. In much the same way, the British Ministry of Information concealed some failures and exaggerated some successes for the sake of morale. It was morale which enabled Britain to counter what seemed to be inevitable defeat.\n\nSo, the good of others seems to go a long way towards justifying the lie, and this applies in some personal as well as national concerns. Nobody would applaud the man or woman who lied about extra-marital relations. The more honorable course is not to have any. Yet, it is not always kind to tell the brutal truth about a severe illness such as a cancer to a patient or to his or her relations just as soon as the illness is diagnosed. Treatment may be successful, so unnecessary sadness has been caused. Yet if not, there must come a time when the facts are disclosed. Not to do so prevents the patient from making testatory provisions. It also increases the shock to the family and friends when death actually occurs.\n\nKindness may be a good reason, if not to tell a lie, at least to be economical with the truth . Another is tact. These two virtues oil the wheels of all social relationships. A lady may have chosen a hat which she obviously loves dearly, but you think it is hideous. Never tell her, even if you cannot bring yourself to say 'Wonderful! Super!' There are ways of side-stepping the issue. Anyway, dress is a matter of opinion rather than of fact, and what does it matter? No good at all could be done by telling the truth , and absolutely no harm done by withholding it."

        "title": "Science can never provide a final answer or things, it is only a way of studying them. Do you agree?",
        "content": "It is somewhat rash to assume that the only role of science is to answer the question 'How?'. That was true in the days of Newton, when an educated person could have a grasp in outline of all human knowledge. Science then filled some of the gaps left by the deliberations of the philosopher and the theologian. Since then, it has far outstripped the contributions of both. Philosophy has degenerated into historical study, and has no modern contribution to make. Theology has made no advance since the Middle Ages. The mantle of seeking answers to man's most fundamental questions has fallen on science. Whether these questions will ever be answered is an entirely different matter, but there is no other way ahead. So the topic-statement is fundamentally wrong.\n\nBy science, of course, is meant physics, which is fundamental to all studies - chemistry, biology, astronomy, indeed all macro and micro investigation. Physics has identified the laws which keep the universe in a state of equilibrium, and today seeks a unified theory to account for the space-time continuum necessary to the existence of that equilibrium, and the various other dimensions beyond the four known which are postulated. So science moves towards the first philosophical question, Is there a unified theory, or are events ultimately random? The answer to this question, if ever found, leads to the far more fundamental question, To what extent, if any, is God (the Creator) limited by his own creation? The determinism of Laplace is now seen to be totally beside the point, and belongs to a mechanistic view of the universe which can no longer be sustained. Today, science is moving rapidly towards a chaos theory which takes into account God's freedom of action plus the predictable results of laws already known to us, and also unpredictable events.\n\nIt is interesting that whereas the old scientific determinism either limited to the Creator's function or precluded the necessity of a Creator, or saw the Creator as totally detached from his creation, science today is begin forced into a belief in God. It also moves towards an acceptance that the scientifically unknown area, the God - mankind personal relationship, is not only feasible, but likely. So science has become much more than a way of studying things. Whether science can get beyond this point is a matter of conjecture. At a shrewd guess, science may well establish the possibility of eternal life , without being able to advance any more proof than could the old-time theologian. World religions have always said that such a belief depends on revelation and personal faith, and it may well be the Creator's intention to keep it that way. Faith, at least, would be greatly devalued if it could ever become the subject of scientific proof, whatever that may be.\n\nAnother answer, again stemming from the chaos theory, is to the co-existence of good and evil. If there is a Creator, it follows that evil, at least as understood by humanity, must have been allowed to enter the world-scene at some point, but deliberately. Redemption from its consequences is another result, and history is the record of the struggle between the two forces. This, says science, although leading to apparently random results, such as the little child stepping under the bus, or a death from cancer, is not random at all. All the same, it may stem from 'chaos', if this is seen in conjunction with a belief in the indestructibility of the human personality. So, say the faithful, 'God not only creates, He cares', and science today is not disposed to reject this possibility, the two approaches may converge on the same point. The processes of the universe are incredibly diverse and complicated, so why should the possibility of life after death be ruled out?\n\nSuch a belief is an essential corollary to any concept of justice in the Creator's character. This is not justice merely in the sense of retribution. The early Jews believed the Creator got so fed up with humanity that He destroyed them in the Flood, but made a fresh start with Noah's family and the paired livestock! Divine Justice is part of the concept of Divine Love, which postulated creation, with mankind as it's highest sentient form, as an expression of that love.\n\nSo the great world religions have this at least in common with modern science; there is a benevolent Creator who offers post-earthly life in some other dimension in exchange for the human response of kindness and observance of a revealed moral law. Justice, therefore, moves into an eternal setting.\n\nA religious scientist will find no essential disharmony between his or her faith and the scientific outlook. The great questions of life have satisfying, if unprovable answers. Some of the inadequacies of religion, such as early church doctrines of the cosmos, and strictly Bible-based theories of the origin of species, have been corrected by scientific investigation without detriment to the central core of belief.\n\nWhere science, or more precisely the scientist, inevitably falls short is in the application of an essentially simple moral code to the complex issues raised by scientific advance.

        "content": "In some respects the topic-statement is true. Modern transport, especially by air, allows people to circle the globe in a few days, or hours, if an aircraft such as Concorde is used. Thus we have learnt to look upon distance as nothing. I can get to Paris from south-east England quicker than I can get to central London. So, the world has become a village? If so, the comparison ends there. In no respect does the world resemble a village community. Those who support the one-world movement no doubt share a great ideal but are, in fact, flying in the face of history, of present facts, and of any likelihood in the near future. Modern travel merely underlines the differences between races and nations. Rather than broaden the mind, travel confirms national prejudices. It may well lead to a greater international understanding, but to understand does not mean to agree, or to forgive. Modern travel may allow great athletes to meet every four years in friendship to discover the medal winners, but it would be naive to suppose that the Olympic Spirit had anything to do with the reality of international affairs or could possibly have any effect on them.\n\nOf course modern transport cannot be blamed for the state of today's world. Like atomic energy, it is neutral, and the blessing or the curse results from the way in which it is used.\n\nFirst, the benefits. Before the invention of the electric telegraph, news of a natural disaster in, say, an eastern country could only reach the west by steamship, so that by the time help reached a stricken area, it was too late to be of much use. Today, information by satellite, both in reports and pictures, is instantaneous. Response time is correspondingly quick. Modern transport planes can carry food, water and medical supplies to where they are needed in a matter of hours.\n\nSo the modern jet aircraft can help enormously in relief work. It has also proved of great benefit both to the business world and to tourism. Within certain weight-limits, it can be used for overseas trade worldwide, and the vast extension of available markets is largely due to the modern aircraft. And where business has to be done in person there are no real delays.\n\nThe aircraft has extended foreign travel, once the prerogative of the rich, to those of average income levels in most countries, and tourism has become a major world industry. The aircraft and the helicopter both have important search and rescue roles. Ships in distress can be readily located and given help. The helicopter has several roles, apart from its use by the police for searches and traffic control. Many lives have been saved in mountainous areas and at sea by speedy removal to hospital, by immediate attention by paramedics; a jet plane can carry a suitable human organ half across the world when a transplant is urgently needed.\n\nModernized and high-speed rail systems are likely to prove of benefit to many countries from the travel and trade points of view. To take Europe as an example. Tariff barriers in the EEC have now come down, and Europe, including Britain, has become a free-market area. In 1994, England will be linked to Europe by a channel tunnel, and Paris or Brussels will be reached as quickly as by air. Already, goods to and from Europe, and indeed worldwide, are transported in standardized containers, which are picked up and moved rapidly in heavy lorries to their destinations along new networks of motorways. The motorways also greatly ease long-distance car travel. At sea, modern oil tankers carry their vast burdens worldwide.\n\nYet as with any other advance, all is not sweetness and light. In the case of the jet aircraft, one needs only to mention the spy-plane, the bomber, the fighter, the assault helicopter, all of them potent war weapons, and a curse to millions of helpless people worldwide. The potential for nuclear, nerve gas, chemical and HE bombing is a curse which hangs over all our heads. The need for ever larger airfields means the destruction of tracts of countryside. Noise and oil-pollution make life a burden to those living nearby. In some countries, over-concentration on high-speed and inter-city trains has led to the severe neglect of existing networks and ordinary passenger rolling stock. In smaller countries such as England, there are now far too many cars and traffic jams in the large urban areas, providing an almost unsolveable problem. Ease of travel allows football hooligans and other undesirables to cause trouble overseas. Every improvement in transport facilities helps the criminal as well as the bona-fide traveler, particularly where immigration controls are relaxed. Immigration itself becomes an increasing problem. And at sea? All is well with the oil-tanker until it runs aground in a storm and deposits thousands of tons of oil along the shore-line.\n\nSo there is a case to be made of the more leisurely times, to some, the good old days . Modern transport has reduced the world if not to a village, at least relatively to village size. Whether the village will ever become a happy community is another matter."

        "title": "Work is the only route to happiness. Discuss.",
        "content": "The ideal put forward to young people has, traditionally, been 'mens sana in corpore sano', and this implies a proper balance between work and play. Yet to achieve happiness, that coveted but elusive state of total fulfilment, requires more. It is true that mankind in general, though with exceptions, has a built-in instinct for work. The vast gulf separating humanity from its physical origins, the animal world, is due to millennia of cerebral and physical activity. Yet there are other equally powerful instincts in the human make-up. The desire, in most cases, to form life-long emotional attachments; the instinct, again in most cases, to start a family; the making of friendships; the search for a fulfilling occupation, to name the most obvious.\nIn some countries there are a privileged few who are born into possessions, money and position, so the need to work in the normal sense does not apply to them. Yet it is noticeable that these people generally find some worthwhile occupation. This may be anything from estate management to patronage of some charitable institution to participation in the pop scene. This again indicates that to follow some kind of occupation, whether useful or not, is a genuine instinct.\n\nHistory supports this view, and literature has produced many sayings expressing the value, perhaps the necessity of work. 'Satan hath some mischief yet for idle hands to do'; 'our best friend is work' (Collin d'Harleville); 'to youth I have but three words of counsel - work, work, work' (Bismarck); 'sow work and thou shalt reap gladness' (Proverb); 'work won't kill but worry will' (Proverb).\n\nFor most of us work is both a necessity and source of fulfilment. We need a regular income, just as our country needs part of the wealth we create and claims through taxation. The fulfilment of the instincts mentioned in Paragraph 1 cannot be achieved without money. The right use of money is of course important; Charles Dickens made the point that to live sixpence below one's income led to happiness; to live sixpence above led to misery.\n\nThe definition of work is wide, ranging from manual labor to the highest forms of intellectual activity. We are not all suited to every kind of work. I would be of little use as a manual worker, since my skills in that direction are limited. Conversely, not all manual workers could do my work. Among other things, I write a little. I was once asked 'What motivates you to write?', the questioner expecting some high-falutin answer. I was tempted to answer 'Money!' In fact the best writers have all taken this view. Only the second rate prattle about artistic fulfilment .\n\nSo, the worthwhile student spends his or her early years developing the skills which will lead to gainful employment; not to amass money for its own sake, but for what money can do. As life goes on, money becomes less important, though at any stage it only assumes importance when one has too little of it.\n\nRealistically, during the current worldwide trade recession, the sad problem many people have to face is unemployment or redundancy. One hopes that this will soon pass. Some countries have training and re-training schemes to prepare their work-forces for the end of the recession. The fact that lack of work is so frustrating highlights the motivations for work already mentioned.\n\nIn any discussion of work its dangers must not be overlooked. It is possible to be so obsessed with work that other highly important human considerations are neglected, with disastrous results. The workaholic neglects his or her family. This may lead to separation, divorce, and or problems with growing children, not to mention damage to human relations generally. Trollope had a character, the Duke of Omnium. He was a most worthy and honorable character, became Prime Minister, worked indefatigably for the parliamentary acceptance of a decimal coinage. His wife and family, all admirably provided for, let him down consistently in various ways. His human sympathies had atrophied.\n\nThe love of money, work's product, may become even more dangerous. Charles Dicken's character, Scrooge, is an example. Another is Silas Marner, who did not reform his outlook until his store of gold coins had been stolen, and until he was confronted with the human need to bring up a small child.\n\nSo in general terms the topic-statement has to be supported, but with all the provisos mentioned. Like any other human instinct, its expression must be wisely handled."

        "title": "Science can never provide a final answer or things, it is only a way of studying them. Do you agree?",
        "content": "It is somewhat rash to assume that the only role of science is to answer the question 'How?'. That was true in the days of Newton, when an educated person could have a grasp in outline of all human knowledge. Science then filled some of the gaps left by the deliberations of the philosopher and the theologian. Since then, it has far outstripped the contributions of both. Philosophy has degenerated into historical study, and has no modern contribution to make. Theology has made no advance since the Middle Ages. The mantle of seeking answers to man's most fundamental questions has fallen on science. Whether these questions will ever be answered is an entirely different matter, but there is no other way ahead. So the topic-statement is fundamentally wrong.\n\nBy science, of course, is meant physics, which is fundamental to all studies - chemistry, biology, astronomy, indeed all macro and micro investigation. Physics has identified the laws which keep the universe in a state of equilibrium, and today seeks a unified theory to account for the space-time continuum necessary to the existence of that equilibrium, and the various other dimensions beyond the four known which are postulated. So science moves towards the first philosophical question, Is there a unified theory, or are events ultimately random? The answer to this question, if ever found, leads to the far more fundamental question, To what extent, if any, is God (the Creator) limited by his own creation? The determinism of Laplace is now seen to be totally beside the point, and belongs to a mechanistic view of the universe which can no longer be sustained. Today, science is moving rapidly towards a chaos theory which takes into account God's freedom of action plus the predictable results of laws already known to us, and also unpredictable events.\n\nIt is interesting that whereas the old scientific determinism either limited to the Creator's function or precluded the necessity of a Creator, or saw the Creator as totally detached from his creation, science today is begin forced into a belief in God. It also moves towards an acceptance that the scientifically unknown area, the God - mankind personal relationship, is not only feasible, but likely. So science has become much more than a way of studying things. Whether science can get beyond this point is a matter of conjecture. At a shrewd guess, science may well establish the possibility of eternal life , without being able to advance any more proof than could the old-time theologian. World religions have always said that such a belief depends on revelation and personal faith, and it may well be the Creator's intention to keep it that way. Faith, at least, would be greatly devalued if it could ever become the subject of scientific proof, whatever that may be.\n\nAnother answer, again stemming from the chaos theory, is to the co-existence of good and evil. If there is a Creator, it follows that evil, at least as understood by humanity, must have been allowed to enter the world-scene at some point, but deliberately. Redemption from its consequences is another result, and history is the record of the struggle between the two forces. This, says science, although leading to apparently random results, such as the little child stepping under the bus, or a death from cancer, is not random at all. All the same, it may stem from 'chaos', if this is seen in conjunction with a belief in the indestructibility of the human personality. So, say the faithful, 'God not only creates, He cares', and science today is not disposed to reject this possibility, the two approaches may converge on the same point. The processes of the universe are incredibly diverse and complicated, so why should the possibility of life after death be ruled out?\n\nSuch a belief is an essential corollary to any concept of justice in the Creator's character. This is not justice merely in the sense of retribution. The early Jews believed the Creator got so fed up with humanity that He destroyed them in the Flood, but made a fresh start with Noah's family and the paired livestock! Divine Justice is part of the concept of Divine Love, which postulated creation, with mankind as it's highest sentient form, as an expression of that love.\n\nSo the great world religions have this at least in common with modern science; there is a benevolent Creator who offers post-earthly life in some other dimension in exchange for the human response of kindness and observance of a revealed moral law. Justice, therefore, moves into an eternal setting.\n\nA religious scientist will find no essential disharmony between his or her faith and the scientific outlook. The great questions of life have satisfying, if unprovable answers. Some of the inadequacies of religion, such as early church doctrines of the cosmos, and strictly Bible-based theories of the origin of species, have been corrected by scientific investigation without detriment to the central core of belief.\n\nWhere science, or more precisely the scientist, inevitably falls short is in the application of an essentially simple moral code to the complex issues raised by scientific advance. Genetic manipulation is a case in point. The whole question of in-vitro fertilization is highly controversial.\n\nAll that is on the local scale. On the grand scale the Creator may, or may not allow the discovery of a unified theory of the universe which will provide answers to supplement, rather than displace the answers already provided by the higher religions."

        "title": "\"In order that economic development and progress can take place, a country must industrialise\". Discuss",
        "content": "Industrialisation is the application of scientific knowledge to man's economic, agricultural, and other wealth-generating activities. In other words, it is the conversion of the 'know-why' of science into `know-how' for industry; it is the practical application of man's inventiveness in the improvement of his well-being and the increase of his wealth.\nIndustrialisation depends on four essentials: the right idea, the right method of putting it into effect, the right moment in time, and availability of the right materials. Machine invented with the help of scientific know- how are used for quicker and easier production of wealth. Therefore, it is only sound commonsense to say that the economic development and progress of a country are dependent on its industrial growth.\n\nThere was a time when countries depended entirely on agriculture. Before the Industrial Revolution, Great Britain too was an agricultural country. Had it not been for the wealth she was able to amass from her colonies, she would not have become a wealthy nation depending on agriculture alone. America at first had an economy rooted in agriculture. With the invention of machines and with the advent of industrialisation, she made use of machines even for her agricultural activities, apart from setting up factories and manufacturing articles for sale.\n\nBefore machines were invented, the articles required for use by man were handmade. These articles were not produced in bulk. But machines helped man to produce articles in large numbers.\n\nToday machines are used virtually in all spheres of life. Agriculture, especially in Western countries, is highly mechanised. There are machines to plough the land, sow seeds, hoe and weed. Pesticides are often sprayed by aeroplanes and helicopters. Fertilisers produced in bulk in factories are used for the healthy growth of plants. All these facilities afforded by mechanisation double our agricultural production; this means increase in economic wealth and prosperity.\n\nIndustrialisation means growth of industries and better utilization of natural resources. Steel is produced, oil is refined and other products are made with almost no physical effort. Giant turbines are installed for the production of electricity. Human beings need not do more than just push buttons, pull levers or supervise. All this means that more work can be (lone by fewer people in less time and with less effort; and the production too is much more.\n\nIt is industrialisation that makes it possible for giant networks of communication to span land, sea and air. The telegraph, radio, television and telephone carry messages from one end of the earth to another almost as fast as the flight of human thought. The train, the aeroplane, the ship and the car carry vast numbers of people from one place to another at an incredible speed.\n\nThe growth of human knowledge and information has been greatly facilitated by the development of machines. The printing press had be- come so highly mechanised that books, magazines and newspapers are produced at great speed.\n\nAll the developed countries of the world have been highly industri- alised. Great Britain, Japan, France, the United States of America and Germany, just to mention a few of the advanced countries, are regarded as wealthy nations because they are highly industrialised. Industrialisation means enough manufactured goods to export, apart from self-sufficiency at home. Exporting products means earning money.\n\nA country that is not industrialised remains backward and poor. This is what has happened to the underdeveloped nations of the world. Not only that these nations are not scientifically and technologically advanced but they are dependent on the rich nations for their very existence. Even if these nations are politically independent, economically they are not.\n\nIndustrialisation not only means self-sufficiency in essential items and progress in terms of material wealth, knowledge, communication and transport, but also shows strength. A highly industrialised country is militarily strong; it can manufacture its own sophisticated weapons, and will not have to depend on stronger and more advanced nations for help in times of emergency.\n\nEconomic development is assured once the country becomes indus- trialised. But more than economic development and wealth, industrialisa- tion marks progress. The standard of living of the people in general increases with increasing industrialisation. We have only to look at the agricultural workers and the factory workers, and contrast them to realise how the latter maintain a better standard of living. A nation's prestige, her position in the comity of nations, her economic development, her progress in terms of communication, and transport, and her military strength are all tied up with her industrialisation."

        "title": "\"Reading is seeing by proxy\" (Spencer). Is reading a substitute for experience?",
        "content": "Robert Southey has written a poem in which he speaks about the companionship books have given him. He says:\n \n\nMy days among the dead are past,\n\nAround me I behold,\n\nWhere'er or these casual eyes are cast,\n\nThe mighty minds of old:\n\nMy ne'er failing friends are they,\n\nWith whom I converse day by day.\n\nThe poet says that books are his never-failing friends; in their company he derives delight, and seeks relief and solace while in sorrow. The poet's words in praise of books show that reading is a panacea for personal ills as well as for empathetic understanding and for vicarious pleasure.\n\nWise men all over the world have extolled the value of reading. Bacon has this to say: \"Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man,\" Lamb loves to lose himself in other men's minds. That is to say, he likes to enjoy himself in the company of books, which as Milton has described, are 'the precious life-blood of a master-spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life.\" In the words of Emily Dickinson\n\nThere is no frigate like a book\n\nTo take us lands away,\n\nNor any coursers like a page\n\nOf prancing poetry.\n\nSpencer's observation, \"Reading is seeing by proxy\", underscores the importance of reading in a man's life. He sees the value of reading as a means to experience what the writer of a book has experienced himself. That is to say, the reader sees what the writer has seen personally from the book written by the latter.\n\nBooks are of different kinds; some give us useful information and knowledge; some give us the personal experiences of their authors; some are imaginative renderings of experiences. What we call creative literature belongs to the third category. When we refer to reading, we have invariably in mind the reading of imaginative literature. In other words, by `reading' we mean reading novels, plays, poems, short stories, travelogues, autobiographies, etc. Imaginative literature is certainly different from books that are intended to pass on matter-of-fact, useful information and knowledge. The second category of books dealing with personal experiences such as autobiographies and travelogues is more akin to imaginative literature; for the books belonging to this category are 'the precious life-blood of master-spirits'. Both categories of books, namely, imaginative literature and literature based on personal experience, give us what the writers have 'seen' for themselves.\n\nThe word 'seen' is placed within inverted commas because seeing is experiencing not only through our physical senses but also through our mind's eye. What the poet imaginatively conceives is his experience; perhaps what he imaginatively conceives is based on personal experience. Wordsworth's poem on the daffodils or his sonnet, \"Upon Westminster Bridge\" are imaginative renderings of personal experiences. The point is when we read imaginative works we are lost in the worlds created by the writers and experience with them their experiences. Our own experiences are only second-hand, and therefore, vicarious. This is what Spencer means when he says, \"Reading is seeing by proxy'.\n\nWe may illustrate the above point with one or two examples. There is the famous novel, \"One Day in the Life of lvan Denisovitch\", written by Alexandar Solzhonitsyn. The novel is an imaginative rendering of the author's own experiences in a Siberian camp in the days of Stalin. This can be said of his other novels like Cancer Ward, First Circle, etc. The novels enable us to experience, imaginatively of course, what went on in Russia under the iron rule of Stalin. So too Pasternack's Dr. Zhivago helps us see vicariously the conditions that prevailed in Russia at the time of the Revolution and the events that took place in the wake of the Revolution.\n\nReading novels enables us to understand the culture of a people. The Russian novels, the English novels, the American novels - all talk volumes about the peoples of the countries against the background of which the novels have been written. Charles Dickson's Great Expectations, Nicholas Nickleby, etc., and Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckloberry Finn, Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, etc. and Tolstoy's War and Peace, Anna Karenina, etc., to mention a few novels, are examples.\n\nPoetry is more intimate and personal than the novel or the drama. Poetry gives expression to recollections of experiences, present and past. Wordsworth has defined poetry as 'emotion recollected in tranquility' and as 'the spontaneous overflow of powerful emotions'. What the poet deals with is his 'felt' experiences; reading poetry, therefore, enables us to 'see' what the poet has 'seen'. The poet's experiences may be mundane or spiritual. But his poetry opens up vistas for us.\n\nYes, reading is seeing by proxy. But is reading a substitute for experience? What we have stated above is that reading helps us experience vicariously what the poet, the novelist or the dramatist has experienced directly. Vicarious experience is only second-hand experience; it is not first-hand experience. There is a world of difference between first-hand experience and second-hand experience; one is direct, and the other is indirect. For instance, reading a travelogue and enjoying the scenes described in it is not the same as seeing the scenes and enjoying them ourselves. Reading is, therefore, only a substitute for experience, and riot experience itself. But then we cannot go through every experience ourselves; we have got to 'see' and 'hear' certain things through the eyes and ears of others."

        "title": "What qualities, in your opinion, make a book a \"Best Seller\"?",
        "content": "A 'best seller' is a book whose copies are sold in thousands. There is an inner urge in the reading public to buy such a book. The general reading public are normally averse to spending money on books. As a result, most of the books just gather dust in the shelves; they do not sell at all unless the sales are pushed up through advertisements and other forms of media publicity. But there are exceptions; those exceptions sell like hot cakes as soon as they are published and continue to sell for years to come. The question is: Why do these books, just a few in number, sell well?\nThe Bible is one of those books that are sold in large numbers. What is the reason for the Bible to be a best seller? The Bible is sacred to the Christians, and there are many Christians in the world; every Christian home will generally have a copy of the Bible. The Bible tells the story of the Jews, and of the birth and death of Christ, the Saviour. Besides, the Bible contains holy teachings which, though more honoured in the breach than in the observance thereof, are sacred to the Christians. If the reason for the abundant sale of the Bible indicates anything, it is this: a book whose content is sacred to thousands and thousands of people becomes ipso facto a best seller.\n\nIf the religious character of a book boosts up its sales, it may so happen that the non-religious, blasphemous character of a book also can increase its sales. We have the classic example of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses. To the devout Muslims The Satanic Verses is an irreligious book written with the obvious intention of attacking Islam and its founder Prophet Mohammed. The devout Muslims raised a hue and cry against the book and its author; the book, they say, is for burning. A top religious leader made a call for the 'liquidation' of the author of the book. All this arouses the curiosity of the reading public; everyone who hears about the book desires to have a copy. The book becomes a best seller. It is the controversial nature of the book that makes it a best seller.\n\nIt is not religion alone that makes a book controversial; political commitments, socio-political compulsions and prejudice and perceptions arising from loyalties to one political system or the other also do. For example, Pastermack's Dr. Zhivago and Alexander Solzhenitayn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch gained popularity enough in the West to become best sellers because of the controversial nature of the books and of the implicit criticism of Stalinist Russia contained in them. In other words, the controversy generated by the novels was primarily responsible for the sale of the books soon after they were published. The international recognition won by the books also accounted for their popularity.\n\nIn order that a book should be a best seller it should be able to attract the attention of the people. We have seen that the controversial -- religious, political, or socio-political -- character of a book may make it a best seller. But more than this, it is the uniqueness of a book that makes it popular, and therefore, best-selling. The uniqueness of a book arises from the originality of its theme and treatment. Saul Bellow's Herzog and Mr. Samler's Planet can be cited as examples. Perhaps it is the uniqueness of Gitanjali that not only earned Rabindranath Tagore his Nobel Prize for Literature but also made the book a best seller.\n\nIt is the uniqueness of a book that makes it a classic, that makes it universally appealing. Homer's Odyssey, Shakespeare's plays, especially his tragedies, and Tolstoy's novels like Anna Karenina and War and Peace are examples of world classics that continue to be best sellers.\n\nOther qualities associated with a book that is a best seller are its sensational nature and the strident note of social protest inherent in its theme. Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead -- a war novel --, James Baldwin's Another Country, J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Alan Paton's Cry, The Beloved Country are examples.\n\nAnother quality which appeals to the ordinary reader is the psychology of sex dealt with in a book; perhaps it is this quality that makes the books of Harold Robins, Ayn Rand, etc. best sellers. Nabakov's Lolita became a hot cake because of the overdose of sex in it. This is again the reason why Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover became a best seller once copies became freely available.\n\nThere is no one single quality that makes a book a best seller. But no book can be a best seller unless it attracts public attention. A book catches the eye of the reading public because of its uniqueness, its distinctiveness, arising from its theme as well as treatment. Joyce's Ulysses, Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse, etc. attracted the attention of the reading public because of their uniqueness. A book also gains its distinctiveness from the universality of theme, from the fact that it caters to certain basic psychological and spiritual needs and urges. For some sex may be the dominant urge; for some others yearnings for spirituality may be the urge; there are other urges and needs like one's eagerness to know more about human nature, about the exotic aspects of certain cultures, etc. A book that satisfies some of these basic needs and urges of man can be a best seller provided it has literary excellence in terms of theme, treatment and innovative technique."

        "title": "\"Material progress is meaningless if it does not go hand in hand with moral and spiritual progress.\" Comment.",
        "content": "The word 'progress' generally unfolds before our mind's eye worldly achievements in terms of money, prosperity, physical comforts and amenities. Worldly achievements constitute our material progress. Usually every one of us aims at material progress - economic prosperity, professional success and more money accruing from it, etc. But is it enough that we achieve only material progress? Has material progress any meaning if it is not accompanied by our moral and spiritual progress?\nMost of us crave for progress and work for it. But the kind of progress that we work for is only material progress and worldly success. We are over-enthusiastic about repeating spiritual slogans and doctrines, but are not keen on practising them. We pray to God, not for spiritual regeneration, but for worldly success. We are like Claudius in Hamlet; our souls remain below; our words go up. Our feet are on the rungs of the ladder of worldly success with our eyes turned upwards and with our mouths watering for the bunches of ripe grapes. Actually, our religious protestations, prayers and practices are only a means to an end; we seek God's intervention to help us in our worldly success - in our material progress. We do not pray for the betterment of our souls. We are down- right hypocrites even when we pray. We do not pause even for a moment and ask ourselves: \"What does it matter if we gain the whole world but lose our souls?\"\n\nMaterial progress alone is not enough; it should go hand in hand with spiritual progress. Then only can we become developed, well-integrated individuals. As Carl Jung says: \"Out of the fullness of life shall you bring forth your religion: only then will you be blessed.\"\n\nIt is not that material progress is not at all necessary; it is not that we should take to asceticism, austerity and poverty, and live like sages. We should achieve material progress; we should enjoy the fruits of science; affluence and prosperity should be achieved, and we should work for prosperity. But prosperity should not blind us to 'the fruit of the spirit'. Our prosperity should help us evolve ourselves into spiritually mature persons.\n\n'The fruit of the spirit' is a phrase used by St. Paul in his Epistle to the Galatians. By 'the fruit of the spirit' he means 'love, joy, peace, patient endurance, kindness, generosity, faith, mildness and chastity'. The qualities listed by Paul are observable human qualities. He gives us another list of qualities which make us less than human. These qualities may be called 'the fruit of the flesh' and these are envy, hatred, idolatry, sexual immorality, selfishness and so on.\n\nA spiritually evolved person is also a spiritually mature person and he shows authenticity, compassion, responsibility, discipline, self-respect, realistic sense of guilt, and co-operative as well as creative approaches to human relationships. He is a man of compassion, integrity and truth. Spirituality should not be confused with other-worldliness. It is, as the Bahai faith says, enlightenment, which is the result of knowledge, faith, steadfastness, truthfulness, uprightness, fidelity and humility. It is the same as the Buddha's way which is to do good, avoid evil, and purify one's own heart; it is the same as the five constant virtues of Confucian- ism: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and sincerity.\n\nMaterial progress becomes meaningful only when it goes hand in hand with moral and spiritual progress. A poet says that it is not in renunciation that we attain spirituality, but in involvement:\n\nDeliverance is not for me in renunciation, I feel\n\nthe embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight.\n\nThou ever pourest for me the fresh draught of thy\n\nwine of various colours and fragrance, filling this\n\nearthen vessel to the brim.\n\nMy world will light its hundred different lamps with\n\nthy flame and place them before the altar of thy\n\ntemple. No, I will never shut the door of my senses.\n\nThe delights of sight and hearing and touch will\n\nbear thy delight.\n\nYes, all my illusions will burn into illumination of\n\njoy, and all my desires ripen into fruits of love.\n\nThe poem says that we need not 'crucify the flesh' in order to become spiritually mature. What is important is to combine our passions with 'the fruit of the spirit'. If we kill our passions, we will be sterile in more ways than one and that is not conducive to healthy spiritual life.\n\nThe dynamic factors of mature spirituality - courage, love, and wisdom - are intimately interconnected. Courage is acting on the basis of love and wisdom and taking reasonable risks. Love is nurturing oneself and others with courage and wisdom. And wisdom is a healthy balance of reason and intuition, and is always open-minded.\nThe achievement of material progress should not be at the expense of our spiritual development. Healthy spirituality is an ongoing process; it' helps us develop an integrated personality. A mind that is obsessed with material progress forgets human values. We become less than human. We should become well-integrated individuals by cultivating spirituality in the midst of our preoccupation with the pursuit of material progress."

        "content": "Science has created problems for mankind. Science is a blessing all right, but it is not an unmixed blessing. Science has made life easier and more comfortable. Science has made it possible for us to communicate with each other readily and quickly and it has made travel easy and fast. Machines have enabled man to save hours of manual labour. But science is responsible for the present-day arms race and the threat of nuclear war under which mankind exists today. In view of the threat of total annihilation of mankind posed by nuclear advancement, there is the fear that science has failed mankind. How can a scientist defend this view?\n\nIt is a fact that science has given us the spirit of objectivity and positivism that is necessary for the development of human knowledge. But it is also a fact that this spirit, when carried to unreasonable lengths in an unimaginative manner, militates against the original intentions. The scientific method thus becomes misused. The spirit of positivism is exaggerated to such lengths that anything that is not proved by crude laboratory experiments is dismissed as superstition. A complacent world believing in the creation of man by God was shaken when Darwin came out with his theory of evolution and the origin of the species. Science makes us forgot that there is \"much in philosophy than dreamt of in heaven and on earth.\"\n\nThe scientist would say that the most diabolical use of science has been in the cause of promoting the baser human instincts and that it is politicians and statesmen who are to blame for this. Man uses science and technology for purposes of aggression; he uses the discoveries of science to win wars. In the past men used only bows and arrows and swords to fight with one another. But today thanks to science, he ha. at his disposal guns, planes, ships, submarines, missiles, etc. The race for weapons has led him to the discovery of nuclear weaponry. He can even carry on biological and chemical warfare. In the Vietnam War harmful bacteria were used among peasants to spread diseases. Chemicals were used to destroy acres of food crops. This is an instance of how scientific knowledge can be abused.\n\nThe monopolisation of knowledge and machines has led to the subjugation of one class by another and of a poorer nation by a richer nation. The mass-produced consumer items have captured the market, thanks to machines. This has resulted in the craftsmen and weavers going out of job.\n\nMultinational corporations from the richer nations sell old and hazardous drugs in the Third World. Some of these corporations are engaged in the manufacture of deadly gas and the leakage of this gas, as it happened in 1984 in Madhyapradesh in India, can kill thousands of people. The activities of some companies are a blatant violation of the very spirit of science which seeks to improve the lot of mankind through its discoveries. The scientist cannot be blamed for this. It is man's greed that is responsible - he wants profit at any cost.\n\nIt is true that science has improved man's living standards. But this has been achieved at a great cost to human fellowship. The old community feeling has been lost. In the past there was co-operation among people; today co-operation has given way to competition. The culture of material acquisition and possession has grown to such an extent that the worth of man is measured in terms of wealth and possessions, and not in terms of character, intelligence and achievement. As Paulo Friere, the Latin American educationist, says: \"To be is to have\". Men today strain hard to possess status symbols, and not to develop spiritually. Science has come to, mean materialism and material progress. Science in a way is responsible for the destruction of spiritual values. But the scientist cannot be found fault with for this. Man's spirituality is at stake because of his materialistic tendencies.\n\nMan's dependence on science has made man a slave to machines. He cannot live without mechanical aids. Man who has invented robots may be controlled by them. All the things scientists have invented can be put to misuse.\n\nMany keen observers and writers have been calling our attention to the loss of a sense of values and to the resulting deterioration of large segments of contemporary society. They tell us that we have been living under the illusion that more motor-cars, labour-saving devices and the like will bring happiness and usher in a better life. Without a strong sense of values and of direction, however, the human spirit tends to weaken or deteriorate. Technical devices can liberate man from drudgery and open up new possibilities for cultural development. They can also have a dehumanising effect and be potentially dangerous if there is no self-discipline and dedication to enduring values. Frederic Lilgo in The Abuse of Learning establishes the point of view that Hitler's Germany was a nation of highly trained specialists who were only interested in facts and were confused about values and that, as a result, moral paralysis set in. The crisis today is due to the over-emphasis on science and technology at the expense of cultural values. The steady increase in the crime rate, especially among juvenile offenders, can be attributed to this lopsided emphasis on science and technology."

        "title": "\"Man's economic and social activities have always. been conditioned by his physical geographical environment. \" Discuss this statement.",
        "content": "It is very difficult to say exactly what is covered by the term 'economic and social activities'. The term has to be understood in the context of man's economic activities and of his social activities. That is to say, though economic activities and social activities impinge on each other and are interconnected, those two types of activities have to be considered separately for the purpose of discussing whether they have always been conditioned by the physical geographical environment.\nThe term 'economics' is derived from the Greek oikwnene - 'household' - and every housewife performs an economic act when she decides how to spend her family budget. Even Robinson Crusoe on his desert island had to allocate his time between fishing, planting crops, or building his house and how to ration the limited supplies he had salvaged from his ship. Robinson Crusoe, however, lived in a very simple economy. Until Man Friday appeared, he had to do everything himself. Today economic activity is specialised and co-ordinated through markets in all but the subsistence economies in the least developed parts of the Third World where families grow their food and make what else they need.\n\nIn economic terms a market is not only a particular place where people buy and sell, such as a fish or fruit market, but also includes all those who are in contact with sellers and buyers of particular goods and services and can bring them together.\n\nWhat is important to note is that any economic activity aims at production of wealth to meet man's needs. In his primitive days man hunted and found food for himself; food to him was wealth, and that was what he needed. He depended on his environment for the kind of animals he could hunt for food. Later, when man began to till the soil, he cultivated only those plants that the soil of the region in which he lived was suitable for. So, he grew rice, wheat or other cereals, depending on the nature of the soil where he pursued his agricultural activity.\n\nAs years passed by he found that certain items which he did not have he would be able to get from other places through a system of barter. That is to say, his economic activity got linked with the economic activity of people from other regions because of the scarcity of certain items he was in need of. The barter system gave way to selling and buying for money.\n\nFrom what is said above it is clear that man could pursue his economic activity in his early history only with the help of what was available or what could be made available to him from his environment. This is by and large true today too. The resources available in a country determine its economic activity. For example, in the Gulf countries the main economic activity centres round production of oil. India which has extensive land remains primarily an agricultural country; this is so with countries like China and Russia. In India itself, depending on the environ- mental conditions that vary from region to region, the agricultural activities present a diverse spectrum. For example, in Bengal and Kerala rice is produced whereas in the Punjab wheat is grown; so also, in many parts of Maharashitra and the Uttar Pradesh sugar cane is grown. This variety is due to the differences in climatic conditions and the character of the soil.\n\nGrowing coconuts, rubber and pepper is an agricultural activity in Kerala. This is because of the suitability of the environment there for the cultivation of these crops. Malaysia grows rubber in wide areas. Again, it is because of the suitability of the environment.\n\nIndustries which have their moorings in agricultural activities are also conditioned by the environment. Rubber is an agricultural product. But rubber is the base for several industries. For industries to grow we require raw materials. Raw materials are products of the environment. This is why mining of coal, gold, minerals and metals as an economic activity continues to depend on the environment.\n\nNot all economic activities need be conditioned by the environment. This is because the world has shrunk because of easier and quicker modes of communication and transport. Industries which bring in wealth can be located in areas that have nothing to do with the environment. A thermal plant need not necessarily be situated in a place where coal is easily available. Factories manufacturing fertilisers, for the same reason, need not be dependent on the environment.\n\nSocial activities are very much bound up with economic and industrial activities. The social activities of an agricultural community are different from those of a community of people running industries. This is why there is great divergence between the lifestyles of those in cities and towns and of those in villages. The social activities of a people are determined by their economic welfare, and the economic welfare in turn is conditioned by the environment. So, it is by and large true to say that the social activities of a people have a bearing on the environment.\n\nSocial activities are an outward expression of the culture of a people. By `culture' we mean a people's way of life, their food habits, dress, manners, etc. In Kerala and Bengal people eat rice and fish, wear loin-clothes, engage themselves in festivities that have sprung from the native soil largely influenced by the environment and climate.\n\nIn conclusion we may say that both economic and social activities are interlinked in such a way that the one cannot be divorced from the other. The wealth that one produces from economic activities utilising the resources available to him in his environment becomes the guiding factor of his social activities."

        "title": "What is the relationship between freedom, rights and duties?",
        "content": "Freedom is a nebulous, abstract concept It admits of different and conflicting interpretations. The concept is nevertheless the very essence of human existence; for the exercise of an individual's freedom may result in the subjugation of another. Freedom or the exercise of it can degenerate into licence or tyranny.\nFreedom, according to some, is the absence of social control. Thoreu, for instance, believes that the best government is the least government'. He nevertheless admits the necessity of some government. There are, however, others who denounce all forms of social control; they may be described as anarchists. According to them `freedom' is unlimited. They little realise that anarchic freedom will lead to chaos and that the law of the survival of the fittest will prevail. This will result in a primitive situation where the strong are free and the weak are enslaved.\n\nThere are, on the other hand, many who view unlimited individual freedom with suspicion. They believe that any deviation from the restrictions imposed on the individual will shake the foundations of a stable society. But they little realise the fact that lack of individual freedom will take away all initiative from the individual resulting in the society remaining static instead of being dynamic.\n\nNeither anarchic freedom nor total denial of freedom is good to society; the first leads to chaos and disorder; the second results in a static society which will ultimately collapse under the deadweight of its own rigidity. In either case it is evident that freedom is a social concept; even though it is the individual that exercises freedom or that is denied freedom, the consequences are inevitably social in nature.\n\nC.E.M. Joad compares man's situation to that of a pack of porcupines huddling together with a felt wrapping around each one of them so that their quills will not hurt one another. That is to say, freedom is to be exercised by individuals within the limits of the law; the law brings into effect social control. Lack of social control and unlimited exercise of freedom result in the actions of one proving uncomfortable for another. On the other hand, if there is too much of social control, individual freedom is denied, and there is stagnation all around. Individual freedom, therefore, has to be exercised in such a way that the rights of others are not trampled upon.\n\nMan requires a high degree of integrity and social consciousness for the proper and legitimate exercise of his freedom. In The Fear of Freedom Erich Fromm argues that a low level of social consciousness makes man misuse his freedom by either oppressing his fellowmen or by running away from the exercise of freedom.\n\nProper and prudent exercise of freedom by an individual means taking into account the duties he has towards his fellowmen. Every individual has his rights as a citizen. These rights include freedom of thought and speech, freedom of movement, freedom to pursue a profession of one's choice, etc. But these rights and privileges are controlled by the law in the larger interests of the harmonious functioning of society. In other words, when an individual exercises his freedom as a right, he has a duty to follow scrupulously the laws of his land. You have the right to pursue a profession of your choice, but this does not mean that you can carry on smuggling or drug-trafficking which are banned by law. You have the freedom of movement; this does not mean that you have the right to drive a car without a driving licence or have the right to violate the rules of the road. Your freedom, in other words, is limited; the rights that you enjoy as a free citizen are curbed by the duties that you owe to society as a whole. Your freedom to exercise your rights is limited by your duties towards your fellowmen.\n\nFreedom is the liberty to engage in activities which do not harm the social organisation. But there is no unlimited freedom; for freedom can be exercised only within limits. Freedom is the exercise of one's rights, but the exercise of one's rights should not impinge on the rights of others. It is the duty of everyone to be mindful of the freedom and rights of others. There is thus an intimate connection between one's freedom to exercise one's rights and one's duties."

        "content": "While the world shrinks owing to modem means of communication and transport, the land available for our habitation also shrinks, posing a problem which, if not attended to now, can threaten food production. Agricultural land is disappearing fast and soil is being eroded or exhausted. Deserts are marching and forests are disappearing. The world, particularly the Third World, is being threatened with food shortage and over-population and the ills associated with these.\nMany areas are in danger of desertification. The Sahara in about ten years has moved south by 100 kilometres. The Thar desert in Rajasthan in India is marching at the rate of half a mile a year. Deserts have eaten into the Horn of Africa and much of the south-west of the continent, and they are moving without interruption. It is said that an area bigger than Great Britain is disappearing every year. All this means that previous agricultural land is being turned to desert. Soil is being eroded, exhausted or blown away. It is believed that if the present trend continues there would be very little farm land per person by the year 2000.\n\nThe chief agent of this depletion is man who is indifferent to the sensitive and delicately balanced ecosystems. Land is laid waste by the impact of his activities. As population increases, cultivation is pushed to new areas, thereby accelerating the process of depletion of arable land. Pastoral nomads and their cattle are other agents of this destruction. The land system cannot maintain these animals and it breaks down under severe strain. This means that the animals of the pastoral nomads eat vegetation far more quickly than the earth can regenerate it.\n\nAnother factor responsible for this shrinking is deforestation. It has . been estimated that half the forest area in developing countries has been denuded between 1900 and 1965 for cultivation purposes. It is feared that, if Brazil's forests are cleared at the prevailing rate of 62,500 square miles a year, the Amazon forest will be soon destroyed, thereby depriving us of a quarter of the world's oxygen supplies. A report of the Food and Agriculture Organization says that 86% of wood cut in developing countries is burnt as fuel. Deforestation decays the soil and reduces its capacity to feed and employ people. It also reduces rain, thereby causing droughts. The rain that falls in the area runs off to rivers, taking with it the top soil suitable for cultivation. This process can result in the silting of rivers which in turn can affect the irrigation system. The long-term effect of deforestation is desertification. It is said that in Java only 12% of the island has now tree cover. The Indonesian government has reacted to the problem by reforesting and outlawing shifting cultivation. I'll fares the land where denudation is indiscriminately practised.\n\nAnother ecological threat is salinization associated with which is water-logging. Many of the irrigation canals in the Third World are un- lined, and as a result water seeps down and raises the level of water table below. This process brings the harmful salts leached down by rain to the root zone. Plants, therefore, become stunted. This salinity has been responsible for the damage of 15% of the irrigated land in India. The estimate is that about 300,000 hectares are lost to salinization and water-logging.\n\nThe impact of these processes is the loss of arable land - the desertification of the earth. Radical land reforms and formation of co-operatives can arrest the trend. The sad fact remains that in many developing countries landlords frustrate government efforts. There is the tendency for the government to coddle cities and urban industries.\n\nBecause of these ecological threats, by the end of this century, the earth would have shrunk so much that it may have to support one and a half times the present population on three-quarters of its present cultivated area. Land is essential for life, and the factors referred to undermine the livelihood of the people of the Third World. When deserts march or the earth shrinks, the Third World beware!"

        "title": "Is space exploration worthwhile?",
        "content": "The explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 26, 1986 and the subsequent disasters spread gloom across the world. There was the need to look into the future and consider if astronauts be sent up in future and what should be the goals. Is space exploration worthwhile? There are compelling reasons why we should continue to go into space and explore it. The possible spin-off is real.\nTemporary setbacks should not deter the space program. There cannot be unimpeded advance in any field of human endeavour. The fact that man has achieved outstanding success in space exploration is sufficient reason why the program should be continued, and the nature of the success achieved so far justifies space exploration. In 1957 the Russians launched Sputnik into space, followed a month later by the launching of the first animal, the dog Laika, into space. In January 1959 the Russians successfully flew Luna I past the moon. Two months after, the American Pioneer 4 flew by the moon. Though the Ranger missions missed their target and the first Apollo spacecraft, sitting on the ground, caught fire, the space program had taken off. On July 20, 1969 Americans, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon while Michael Collins orbited around it. The space program achieved spectacular success in July 1975 when the Apollo astronauts linked up in orbit with two Russian cosmonauts. Explorations by nature are hazardous; people have always died. Setbacks are the price we pay for advances.\n\nOne of the main considerations for going into space is to take advantage of its resources. There are staggering quantities of minerals for the taking - minerals on the Moon, in the asteroid belt and on other planets. There are the resources of vacuum, solar power and zero gravity. We have now communications satellites and they have linked up the world, and our planet has become talkative. There are asteroids to tap for minerals. Of the more than 2,000 of these flying mountains that revolve round the sun many are made up of pure nickel-iron alloy. There are those asteroids containing carbon compounds. Apart from availing ourselves of these metals, other spin-offs are possible. Asteroids may contain clues to the mystery of the formation of planets. These carbonaceous asteroids are to provide resources for making oil, synthetics and even food.\n\nSpace exploration is worthwhile for another reason: to satisfy our instinctive urge to explore. Throughout time man has expanded by exploring unknown regions. Exploration led to the discovery of the New World and the arrival of Europeans in the Indies, and these explorations have had dramatic consequences. Explorations thrill scientists and space buffs; the benefits are shared by the whole world, and the urge to explore is satisfied, only to be aroused again. Contacts yet to be established will be beneficial. Wealth and enlightenment are to follow. Let us hope that the success of future exploration will not lead to exploitation of any kind.\n\nSpace exploration will add to man's scientific knowledge and help the advance of science. There is scope to solve the mysteries of the universe, and man must go up. In the Space Stations to be built it will be possible, because of the zero-gravity, to manufacture materials and medicines that are difficult or impossible to manufacture on earth. It will be possible to monitor the earth, its weather and agriculture. Zero-gravity should help us to convert ordinary metals into something rarer than gold. Zero-gravity alloys may give us whole new substances; perhaps our future buildings will be made of zero-gravity substances. There is also the possibility of developing a superconductor with which we can conduct electricity without wastage. The dust on the moon or the moondust will be a source of minerals. Will not the airless, low-gravity conditions on the moon make it a prime site for industrial development?\n\nThere is scope to settle in worlds beyond our planet of birth. Our planet is already overpopulated and in the next few decades millions will be added. New technologies are to help us to occupy other planets and transform them into livable places. And the first place to be converted or 'terraformed' will be the moon. Mars and Venus offer opportunities for terraforming. There is water on Mars, Venus, a virtual desert, can be colonized by transporting ice, perhaps from comets. There is much that can be gained from space exploration, and space will be the answer to the many ills of our world. Achievements so far and the possibilities that science and technology are to unravel make space exploration worthwhile."

        "title": "What is healthy eating?",
        "content": "Paradoxically, while people in some parts of the world are over-fed, there are millions in other parts that are under-fed. One group needs to watch their diet while the other has to struggle for one square meal a day. Nutrition is the business of all, whether the over-fed or the under-fed. Healthy eating ensures healthy living. And a healthy man is a happy man, and the reverse may not be true.\nOur ancestors ate what was available. Many foods available to them were obtained for short seasonal periods. Today we eat what we like, and eating has become a fashion and a hobby. We suffer from gourmet's diseases, and, generally speaking, we are aware of the consequences of unhealthy eating, i.e., eating what we like to eat and not what we need to eat. The human body may be likened to a machine made up; of many component parts working together to perform different functions. Healthy eating consists in eating food items that contain essential nutrients to ensure the proper functioning of this human machine. Over-eating can disrupt the functions while under-eating can impair them. We have heard of famine-stricken countries where people suffer because of the lack of calories. Their struggle is to have sufficient food.\n\nIn affluent countries the problem is one of imbalance - too much in the way of calories and the lack of specific vitamins and minerals. Healthy eating ensures a balanced diet. What the human body requires for its proper functioning are essential nutrients that include protein, fats carbohydrates, water, vitamins and minerals. The shortage of one of these leads to malfunctioning; extreme deficiency of nutrients can result in death. Vitamin C deficiency leads to easy bruising and bleeding from the gums and vitamin D is required for healthy teeth and bones. Vitamin B complex deficiency can impair the production of energy and the break- down or formation of proteins, carbohydrates and fats in the body, often causing anaemia. It is said that without vitamins to add to our mineral framework we would all be like exhibits in museums.\n\nFats are a source of our energy. Polyunsaturated fats not only provide calories but also help the biochemical reactions in the body. Essential fatty acids are vital for healthy living. Saturated fats with which cholesterol is associated are often the cause of heart disease. Apart from their energy-related roles, fats help in the building of body tissues. The internally stored fat provides extra energy. Subcutaneous layers of fat, those under the skin, insulate the body. Moderate deposits of fats cushion internal organs like the liver and kidneys. But food high in fats can be harmful and high fat diets are linked not only to obesity but also to heart disease. To eat healthily one must control the fat intake, particularly if the life-style is inactive.\n\nCarbohydrates are the major source of energy. Besides providing the most energy, carbohydrates are part of the body's connective tissue. They are contained in those materials that determine our genetic inheritance. They detoxify the poisons that invade us. Complex carbohydrate foods add bulk to the diet and ramrod the food through the digestive system.\n\nMinerals control the body's chemical balance. Minerals come to us through nature's food chain. The mineral content of our food is stored in our bone marrow and it is released to the cells when needed. Overdose of a particular mineral can be fatal. Healthy eating requires a wide variety of foods that can supply us with the right amounts of the minerals we need.\n\nProtein is the stuff of which all body tissue is made. They are vital. There are times when the body needs relatively more protein than it does at other times. For a growing child protein is vitally necessary. Proteins are really combinations of hundreds of molecules called amino acids and eight of them are essential. Protein foods with right proportion of these essentials have high biological value. A diet without adequate proteins cannot be considered healthy.\n\nIt is not the quantity that makes a diet healthy; it is the quality of the food and the amount of nutriment it contains. Healthy eating provides the body with the foods that it needs to reach its full potential and maintain it in top running condition. Healthy eating keeps us healthy and happy at all stages of our life. Balance is essential: if there is a deficiency in the nutrients, the body will break down, and excess can be harmful."

        "title": "What are the main types of pollution, and what can be done to prevent pollution or to reduce its effects?",
        "content": "Media coverage of pollution of our air and water and land often shocks us. Environmental research has given us valuable information about the different aspects of pollution, and it behoves us to be aware of our often inadvertent interference with the environment so that we will be able to take intelligent and appropriate steps to avert a possible catastrophe -- our own destruction through environmental pollution. Pollution can affect what we eat, our air and the water we drink.\nPollution can be incidental, usually the result of an accident as in Bhopal in India or at Chernobyil in the former USSR. Then there is persistent pollution - pollution that goes on all the time but does not receive as much attention as incidental pollution. We are all familiar with the pollution caused by thick smoke from factories and the damage caused to the ozone layer of the atmosphere by the use of aerosol sprays.\n\nAir is polluted by substances that may occur as solid particles, liquid droplets, gases or as mixtures of these forms. Carbon monoxide (CO) is the most abundant and widely distributed in the air we breathe. Anthropogenic source contributes most to this type of pollution. The presence of CO in motor-car exhaust is well known. Other pollutants in emissions of internal combustion engines are hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. Air is also polluted by sulphur oxides. Apart from these gases there are small, solid particles and liquid droplets collectively called particulates which are feared to affect the respiratory system. Modification of the internal combustion engines and development of exhaust system reactors are two measures to control pollution by motor-car emissions. The four types of equipment used to control particulate emissions are gravity settling chamber, cyclone collector, wet scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators.\n\nThe signs of water pollution are obvious: disgusting odours from lakes and beaches, shortage of drinking water, the toll on fish population and oil floating on the surface of water. Pollutants from such sources as sewage, industrial wastes and effluent from slaughterhouses reduce dissolved oxygen in water which is a fundamental requirement for animal and plant life in water. Lakes suffer from acidification. Acidity damages aquatic life. Burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, in power stations, factories, engines and other combustion processes produce sulphur and nitrogen gases which combine with oxygen and water vapour and finally causes acid rain. Generally water has buffering ions to neutralise acidity. When it lacks them, alkaline substances can be added. Environmental damage caused by acid rain can also be lessened by reducing the amount of sulphur and nitrogen gases released into the atmosphere.\n\nOur dependence on oil-based technology leads to oil pollution of water, especially the sea. Oil spills such as the blowout in 1969 at Santa Barbara when 10,000 tons of oil entered the ocean are serious enough but they represent the source for less than 10% of the total oil that enters the marine environment annually. Waste oil and grease from industries contribute significantly to marine pollution. Oil films in the sea retard its intake of oxygen and animal life is affected. Water birds are damaged when they are smeared by oil. Fish and lobsters that live in the bottom are killed and washed ashore. To prevent oil spill in harbours, floating booms are used. Another method of combating this pollution is the use of water bubble barriers. Certain chemicals are also used to gel or solidify oil. Then there are mechanical methods of clean-up.\n\nTap water almost always contains harmless amounts of organic and inorganic substances. Inorganic substances such as lead and nitrates are cause of concern. Lead is necessary for the human body, but it should not be more than 3 milligrams per week per person. But dissolved lead pipes used in the distribution network aids lead to dissolve. To prevent this safer materials are to be used. Another measure is to make water slightly alkaline by adding lime and soda ash. The concentration of nitrates in drinking water should not exceed 50 milligrams per litre. Treated sewage contains nitrates and it pollutes river water. Fertilisers used on land contain nitrates and they are washed down to rivers by rain. Nitrates can be treated at water works by a process called biological denitrification.\n\nMan pollutes his environment by continuous and indiscriminate release of human and industrial waste. It is important that we realise our mistake and take appropriate action to save ourselves and the future generations."

        "title": "Man is born free",
        "content": "But everywhere he is in chain. - J. J. Rousseau\n\nDiscuss the meaning and importance of freedom in the light of this quotation.\n\n \n\nEvery animal including man is born free. All animals in their natural state, except man who is precluded by civilization to be in his natural state, are free. Some animals lose their freedom only because of man's needs and deeds. The world is 'open' and not 'closed' in its natural state; every animal - man is not exempted - desires novelty, spontaneity and genuine creativity, which are the hallmarks of freedom.\nMan, though born free like other animals, is in chain everywhere. This is because of the restrictions and restraints which he imposes on himself and which are imposed on him by others. For example, no one is expected to appear naked in public in the name of freedom. There are social norms to be followed. Different occasions demand different customs. Man, living in a society, has to follow certain customs, conventions and traditions in the interest of harmonious existence; he cannot take the stand that he is absolutely free and that he can do things in his own way.\n\nMan, in the process of his change from primitive tribalism to civilized existence, has chained himself more and more to rules and regulations. Unlike other living creatures, he is capable of thinking and is intelligent to devise ways and means of exploiting his fellowmen. This exploitation leads to his keeping them subdued and enslaved. Imperialism in the past and neo-colonialism and neo-imperialism today have only been instruments of suppressing the aspirations for freedom of the exploited. A classic example of suppression in the modern world is witnessed in the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination practised in South Africa.\n\nThe craving for freedom in any living creature is instinctive. In man it is not only instinctive but also cerebral. The fight for freedom with which one is born has been age-old. It continues unabated, and it can be traced back until it is obscured in the dim past. The Magna Carta, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, the American Bill of Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Supreme Court decisions on civil liberties in the United States, India, etc. point to man's craving for freedom. He has always said:\n\nOff with the fetters\n\nThat chafe and restrain!\n\nOff with the chain!\n\nEmerson almost deifies Freedom; he sings:\n\nMy angel - his name is Freedom -\n\nChoose him to be your King;\n\nHe shall cut pathways east and west,\n\nAnd fend you with his wing.\n\nToday man in his civilised existence attaches importance to freedom in the sense of the protection of the civil liberties, of which the rights to think, speak, and write are especially important. These and related freedoms are not granted by the state or any group in society, even though the state may need to exercise some control where conflicts of rights occur. If the state grants these rights, then the state can take them away, and that is what freedom-loving men in the past have not been willing to admit. Those rights are human, social, natural or god-given, based on the nature of man and the conditions necessary for his development and the common good.\n\nFour kinds of freedom need to be distinguished. There is first, freedom of choice, or moral freedom. There is, second, freedom from external restraint, or physical freedom. This is a particularly important issue where totalitarian governments are in power. Freedom from external compulsion is very important. Even a dog lies contentedly all day long in the shade of a tree, but whines miserably if tied to the same tree for five minutes. Tom Sawyer's pals were willing to give up their most cherished possessions for a turn at white-washing his fence, but \"would wail like fettered injuns\", if told they must do the same thing at home. Everyone is against compulsion and restriction of his freedom to choose.\n\nThe third freedom is political freedom which includes equality before the law, trial before an impartial tribunal, and the right to vote or be elected. Under political freedom come freedom of speech, thought, and conscience, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly or organisation and a share in the control of the conditions of life.\n\nThere is social and economic freedom. Here, the question arises whether there should be control or legislative regulation of a man's business, professional, or other activities, or whether these should be free from all interference. In the interest of the harmonious functioning of society, there must needs be checks and balances. These checks and balances are bound to encroach upon the natural freedom of which Rousseau speaks.\n\nIt is true that man is born free. A civilized existence demands certain curbs on his natural freedom. Today man has surrendered part of his freedom for the sake of his civilized existence. This, however, does not mean that he is everywhere in chain. Here and there man exploits man. But in a civilized society man cherishes his moral freedom, his intellectual freedom, his political freedom and his economic freedom."

        "title": "\"Arts and the appreciation of the Arts can improve the quality of life. \"Do you agree?",
        "content": "Arts have an important place in modern society; in fact, these have had a great influence on his existence right from the dawn of civilization. While man generally concerns himself with the bare necessities for survival, he has never considered the mere continuation of existence a sufficient goal. Man is in part a creature who thinks and decides, but he is perhaps primarily a being with feeling, with a wide range of responses. His emotional reactions and feelings need to be cultivated and refined along with his thoughts, if he is to become mature. These reactions and feelings belong to the realm of aesthetic experience. It is man's aesthetic sense that enables him to make judgements, favourable or unfavourable, on artistic works, that is, on what he hears, sees, and reads. Aesthetics holds surprises and insights for the inquiring mind. Beauty in some form is recognised by men everywhere.\n\nHow are aesthetic experience, beauty, and the arts related? Aesthetic experiences are basic and fundamental to art, and that which does not have aesthetic value cannot be termed art. That is to say, the arts express beauty which is satisfying to our senses. In much contemporary as well as traditional aesthetic theory, art is what is beautiful, and what is not beautiful is not art.\n\nDefinitions of beauty are many and varied. It has been defined as 'truth', 'the expression of an ideal', 'harmony in diversity', and 'an intrinsic quality of things themselves'. The modem trend in the interpretation of art, however, is not in full agreement with the traditional identification of art exclusively with beauty. If an artist is endeavouring to give certain experiential qualities in an artistic form, then he must be free to express the ugly as well as the beautiful.\n\nAccording to modern interpretation, the artist portrays things as he 'sees' them, and so in many instances he must express the misery and the injustice, the ugliness and brutality, which are part of his vision of life. Some works of art are not beautiful, and some beautiful things like landscapes are not works of art. The possession of beauty, however, may be taken as the criterion of art that is likely to continue to appeal to man.\n\nThe purpose of art, all agree, is to bring immediate pleasure and satisfaction by revealing certain experiential elements of reality; it can also fortify us in various ways to meet the practical demands of life. Aesthetic response to music, for example, may be therapeutic. It may stimulate or soothe us; it may change the rate of the heartbeat, ease digestion, or affect other bodily processes. Aesthetic experience may help renew our spirits, exciting us and giving us courage and enthusiasm for some strenuous task. The power of aesthetic experience in its different forms to create various moods, from patience to a spirit of sacrifice, is well known.\n\nAesthetic experience and response may help create a social bond between diverse individuals and groups by arousing sympathy, developing understanding, and producing a desire for harmonious relationships. The presence of beauty, whether in nature or in art objects, tends to make our lives qualitatively richer.\n\nPlato says that even ordinary human beings, if they are amid masterpieces of painting, sculpture, architecture, and so on, will be ennobled thereby. If artists are gifted to discern and disclose the nature of the beautiful and graceful, \"then will our youth dwell in a land of health, amid fair sights and sounds, and receive the good in everything, and beauty ... shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health-giving breeze.\" The young will imbibe a taste for beauty and decency and this will affect their entire lives. Hunter Mead, while discussing the nature of aesthetic mood or attitude, mentions three characteristics of the aesthetic attitude. 'There is, first, the aspect of detachment; in this a person is released from the practical concerns of everyday living. A second characteristic is a disinterested and non-possessive aspect. \"To appreciate without the itch to acquire, to love without longing to possess, to contemplate with joy and satisfaction but without thought of social advantage ... : this is to achieve the disinterested attitude which is fundamental to the aesthetic mood.\" The third aspect is impersonal, and involves \"the temporary elimination of certain expressions of the personality.\" One is absorbed by the aesthetic object; in a sense one gets \"outside himself\", transcends his narrow interests and acquires a new perspective. This mood carries detachment and disinterestedness a stage further.\n\nArts and the appreciation of them have a civilizing function. This is the reason why we regard arts as an integral part of life; arts cannot be separated from the daily activities of men and women. Arts certainly enrich our lives."

        "content": "Governments are necessary; without governments there will only be chaos. This is why Thomas Paine says, \"Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil.\" Paine in his writings pleads for the rights of man; he knows that any government will have restrictions imposed on the citizens' exercise of absolute rights in the interest of order, harmony and peace in society. Even the best of governments will have to do this. Curbing the rights of man, according to Paine, is an evil. But since governments are a necessary evil, they should be tolerable ones. Paine is convinced that \"in its worst state\" government is \"an intolerable one\".\nWhich form of government is the most tolerable? In the modem world monarchies have practically ceased to exist, even in the states where the heads of states are monarchs. Great Britain has a monarch, but the monarch is only a figure-head, and the country is one of the strongest democracies in the world. Nepal, a state ruled by a monarch, has also a form of democratic government. Today people all over the world clamour for democracy; this is most pronounced in states that have been under single-party (mainly Communist) rule. The modem world sees in democracy the most tolerable form of government. This is because it knows that \"no man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent.\"\n\nThere are three basic types of government seen in the world today. These are the Western-style democracies, the people's democracies, and military dictatorships. The Western-style democracy may be called 'liberal democracy'; it is found throughout western Europe, in North America, Australia, New Zealand, India, Israel, etc. People's democracies are modelled on the former U.S.S.R. government, and constitute single-party rule. Under the people's democracy, the government is all-powerful and is a form of dictatorship. Military dictatorships - which are the worst form of government - have come into being in some of the Third World countries where the fragility of governments could not resist the might of the military craving for power.\n\nMilitary coups come about because the armed forces provide the only stable and effective power base in a crumbling, fragile democracy or single-party rule. The common feature of military governments is that the armed forces, through their leader or leaders, effectively dictate policy. They may choose to do this invisibly, working behind a screen of civilian forms such as legislatures and cabinets. This has been the case in Pakistan till recently and in Brazil since 1964. The armed forces may also choose to rule openly themselves as in Chile and Argentina. Many military regimes, create a political facade to buttress their rule. Whatever be the subterfuges adopted by the armed forces to give their government a democratic semblance, the executive power is wielded by the military; sometimes a military council controls a mixed military-and-civilian government. The hallmark of a military government, whatever be its form, is the iron hand with which it rules; that is to say, no opposition to it or free criticism of its functioning is tolerated; freedom of the citizen is wholly curbed. It is this aspect of the military rule that makes it intolerable.\n\nLiberal democracy or a civil government is any day preferable to a military government. The military government may have enlightened economic, political, and social goals. But the very fact that dissent is not tolerated by it and the freedom of the individual and his rights are curtailed makes it objectionable and obnoxious. In a civil government there is only limited control or restraint imposed on the citizen. Government intervention is there only to see that laws are obeyed, that the poor do not starve, and that children are educated. The individual's dignity and rights are respected; his beliefs are not interfered with. Dissent is tolerated; the policy pursued by the civil government alters as the views of citizens change. To ensure all this there are safeguards in the form of freedom of expression, and association, a freely elected representative assembly and methods of slowing the decision-making process of the government until public opinion has reached a settled conclusion. Above all, the actions of the individual and the government are subject to the scrutiny of an impartial and independent judiciary.\n\nMilitary governments are dictatorial; civilian governments are democratic. A truly civilian government is democratic and liberal. The world is veering towards the adaption of democracy. This is what we see today in Europe; Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika are only the off-shoots of the citizens' craving for liberal democracy."

It implies that the previous age was dull in comparison with the present age and that the thrill and excitement of living in the present age would not have been there in the previous age. By the present age we mean the twentieth century, especially the second half of the century. What has made this period so thrilling and exciting? What did the previous age lack in comparison with the present?\nTill the Industrial Revolution the previous age must have been pretty drab and dull. Our forefathers did not have the benefits of fast-moving vehicles like the airplane, the car or train. The benefit of electricity and its uses was also not there. People brave and adventurous as they were - moved from place to place by bullock carts and sailing boats; for light they had to depend on lamps and candles. Their knowledge about the world was limited.\n\nBut since the second half of the nineteenth century there has been and explosion of scientific knowledge; there has also been an explosion in technical education, which A. N. Whitehead describes as \"the greatest invention of the nineteenth century - invention of the method of invention\". Interaction between science and technology has greatly accelerated the pace of technological development. The scientist has furnished the technologist with basic information and experimental proofs and the technologist has come up with new techniques and precision instruments such as the computer.\n\nThere has in other words been a technological revolution. Since the Second World War, the progressive miniaturisation of components such as transistors and of electrical circuits has revolutionised communications. It has facilitated the design of compact computers, and the expansion of cybernetics and automation. Miniaturisation has made possible not only intercontinental ballistic missiles, but also the space programmes of the superpowers which provide satellites for the transmission of radio and television signals and for surveying the earth's resources.\n\nThere have been developments in other important spheres too. Bio-technology, the manipulation of man's own body, has made spectacular advances. The pharmaceutical industry provides an array of drugs to combat dreadful diseases. By saving life, medicine has paved the way for the population explosion, but has also abated it where possible by contraceptive chemistry. There has been great progress in medical knowledge and in the adoption of methods for cure and prevention of diseases.\n\nScience and technology have thus vastly increased man's powers. All these inventions give us a lot of thrill and make our life on this planet quite exciting. Who knows whether we will not be able to make occasional flights to Mars and similar other planets? But the thrill and excitement vanish when we think of the misuse to which science and technology can be put. A Third World War can wipe off human civilization from the face of the earth. In other words the progress man has achieved in material terms also spells his doom.\n\nThe question may well be asked: Have we any reason to be jubilant over our space flights and revolutionary communication systems with the Damocles' sword of nuclear war hanging over our head? The answer is 'no'. So, to be alive in the present age, to be born in this age, is not to be linked with good luck or fortune.\n\nThe man who would choose to have been born in a previous age can be said to be in his senses because he would have certainties to go by and spiritual values to ennoble him. In the present age he would have only material comforts under the shadow of an uncertain future. Perhaps his life in the present age will be exciting for him, if he can make wise use of his scientific and technological knowledge and at the same time make the world a better place to live in. The saving aspect of this age is that Fascism and Communism are being replaced by liberal, democratic ideals and that there is much talk, and a good deal of action too, taking the world to a new federal order in which peace and harmony will prevail. If at all the present age has to be preferred to the previous age, it is for the exciting idea of a new world order and for the translation of this idea into a reality."

        "content": "The quest for a happy life engrosses every human being. But every- one tends to define happiness in a distinctly individualistic fashion. Philosophers and thinkers have attempted to define a happy life. The Hedonists have a simple notion that happiness consists in the gratification of physical appetites. There are others who believe that happiness is attainable through the acquisition of material goods. The more intellectually inclined tend to think that happiness lies in the pursuit of literature, arts and philosophical thoughts. Emotional satisfaction which is to be found in human relations - love for one's parents, wife, children, etc., and friendship - also gives one happiness. To R. G. Ingersoll, \"Happiness is the only good\", but to Shelley it is something elusive; he sings:\n \n\nYe seek for happiness - alas, the day!\n\nYe find it not in luxury, nor in gold,\n\nNor in fame, nor in the envied sway ...\n\nThe definitions are varied, But all of them suggest that happiness is a state of mind and that different people derive happiness in different ways. To some it is physical gratification or emotional satisfaction; to many it is intellectual. There are many who believe in the saying, \"Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die\". But the be-all and end-all of life does not consist in eating and drinking and that happiness cannot be derived from these two elemental activities. There are also people whose mental make-up is such that they derive a lot of happiness if they arouse jealousy in others and 'feed fat' the grudge and hatred they have against their enemies.\n\nOne would wish to be happy and at the same time be virtuous. One need not make a choice between being happy and being virtuous. That is to say, one would like to lead a virtuous life that would give happiness too. No one can be perfectly happy. Life is a mixture of joys and sorrows. There is the fact of the existence of suffering too. Unhappiness or pain accompanies the experiences of birth, illness, failure to satisfy desires, separation from friends and loved ones, old age and death. Even the more fortunate are unable to ward off old age and death. This is a basic truth about life which is mentioned in all the religions of the world. The Buddhist philosophy speaks of suffering as a universal problem of life in a world that is finite and changing. A second truth which Buddhism upholds is that suffering is caused by desires or cravings. These desires tend to grow or increase as we attempt to satisfy them. A man wants ten thousand dollars, then he wants a hundred thousand, then a million, and his wants do not cease. This kind of desire is the real cause of unhappiness, but it is encouraging to know that it is within our control, and that something can be done about it. If men rise above desires and ally themselves with values to which these desires are irrelevant, they may find a serenity unaffected by any of the calamities that befall them.\n\nA third truth mentioned in Buddhism is that desires can be destroyed or blotted out. There is also a fourth noble truth in Buddhism and this truth is that we have a way-out through the Noble Eightfold Path. Buddhism mentions the fact that evil and suffering can be removed if only we have the right knowledge about the nature of our self.\n\nOne may derive happiness from life by following the Eightfold Path. The Eightfold Path insists on right understanding, right aspiration or purpose, right speech, right conduct, right mode of livelihood, right striving or effort, right mindfulness and right concentration. One's happiness is very much dependent on one's virtuous conduct which in turn consists in the elimination of lower nature, including selfishness, and in the attainment of peace and contentment, joy, insight, and love and compassion for all living beings."

In some societies suicide is accepted or even expected in the face of disgrace. Hara-kiri is an ancient act of ceremonial suicide in which a short sword was used to slash the abdomen from left to right, then upwards. This was resorted to by warriors to escape capture by the enemy as well as to avoid dishonourable execution. The Japanese favoured hara-kiri to avoid capture even during the Second World War. Like the Japanese the ancient Romans and Egyptians also killed themselves to avoid disgrace or capture by the enemy. We have the examples of Brutus, Cassius, Mark Antony and Cleopatra.\nThere are many countries in the world which have made attempts to consider suicide a cognisable offence. (Incidentally, this is the only criminal offence that attracts punishment for just the attempt, and not for the commission of the offence.) Until 1961 the U.K. sought to discourage suicide by making it a crime; it still is in India and in some U.S. states.\n\nThere is by and large no social sanction for suicide. An attempt to commit suicide is often thought to be an implicit 'plea' for help, and may result from extreme depression and helplessness. There are also the cases of some notable literary figures who have committed suicide; Ernest Hemingway, Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath are examples. Hamlet contemplates suicide in a mood of depression:\n\nTo be or not to be: that is the question:\n\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\n\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\n\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\n\nAnd by opposing end them.\n\nIn the U.S., suicide is the cause of 1.4% of all deaths each year. The suicide rate there is 12.7 per 100,000 population. The comparative rate for Britain is 7.8 and for Switzerland 23.8.\n\nNo one religion or organisation or group of people encourages suicide or upholds the commission of suicide as a personal right. In fact not even courage is attributed to the person who commits suicide; he is, on the other hand, looked down upon. As Martial sings,\n\nWhen the blandishments of life are gone,\n\nThe coward sneaks to death, the brave live on.\n\nWe may, however, ask ourselves the question whether a man has a right to die as and when he chooses. An individual has got his personal rights or fundamental rights; these are the right to freedom of speech and expression, to acquire, hold and dispose of property, to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business, etc. In other words, the fundamental rights guaranteed under a democratic constitution are intended to ensure peaceful life for the individual. Personal rights imply respect for the dignity of the individual.\n\nGod has given us life. Is it within us to take that life as and when it pleases us? Perhaps not. You may argue that taking one's own life is not taking another's life and that in the same way as you have no right to kill another person you have no right to kill yourself. Both your life and the life of another person are God-given. This is perhaps a religious view.\n\nBut even rationalists and atheists who do not believe in a life after death or in the existence of God do not recommend suicide as a panacea for personal suffering. They too insist on the useful role which every individual can play in society. According to them, killing oneself is defeat- ism. They say that a healthy mind does not contemplate suicide as a solution to personal problems. The very thought of suicide is an aberration of the mind. All cases of suicide, when investigated upon, show that it is disillusionment, despair, depression, disgrace (or the fear of disgrace), and lack of courage to face life in the raw that drive a person to suicide. Depression, disillusionment and despair are psychological symptoms.\n\nIt may also be argued that persons who have outlived their useful- ness to themselves and to society should have the choice to take their own lives. That is to say, persons who are suffering from incurable diseases like leukaemia or AIDS or those who are old and incapacitated for life should be given the freedom to choose to die. The law against suicide should not prevent them from ending their lives, if they wish to do so. In other words, euthanasia should be encouraged. But euthanasia cannot be permitted except under special circumstances in view of the dangerous potentialities of the practice. To allow a fellow human being suffer agonising illness, giving him no opportunity for a merciful release, is inhuman. The patient should be the best judge. If his thinking is impaired, the doctor could be the judge. If life is a round of suffering and if one has suffered enough, it should not be his bane to die suffering from a terminal disease. And we all pray for a peaceful death.\n\nSuicide as a way out of worldly problems, say, failure or unrequited love, is cowardly and is as bad as homicide. It is an aberration of the mind that drives a person to suicide. It is perhaps not the individual who is responsible for this aberration; the circumstances may combine with his lack of fortitude. Social measures can be adopted to allow an individual to lead a contended life. Condoning suicide is ruinous to civilised existence."

        "content": "My father who is generally niggardly with praise is extremely generous where our mother is concerned. He spoke of her once as selfless, sacrificial and devoted and to this I would like to add: helpful and understanding. It is not unusual for us teenagers to run into little problems and then to boggle at them. Whatever we do, she is there solidly with us to help us. I am convinced that one of the greatest boons in life is to have a devoted, selfless, helpful mother. I have. Definitely she is the person I admire most in this world.\nThere is no gap separating us. children, from our mother and we do not create that artificial barrier called the 'generation gap'. To her I am an open book and, as a rule. I do not pry into her personal problems, if at all she has any. She speaks little and has a patient ear for our rigmarole. Our conversation, often one-sided, can be long and topics may range from the pranks of my little sister to something new in chemistry that I learnt at school.\n\nA quality that I admire most in her is her selfless devotion to us. Her own interests are of little importance to her where ours are involved. The meals will he ready at the time we need them. She will forego a good night's sleep without a murmur, nursing us when we are ill. Her personal possessions are meager and they have to be so. In her scheme of things our interests come first. The little ornaments we wear today were hers. In the knowledge of fashions she seems to excel over us. She seems to take secret delight in seeing us fashionably dressed.\n\nMy mother has an undeclared philosophy and that is to use to the full one's abilities and she practices rather than preach it. In spite of all the domestic chores, she finds time to read and often she reads books that have educational value. She knows a lot about child psychology and now adolescent psychology. The culinary art for her is something that is to be continually developed. She avidly reads health magazines in order to regulate our intake of vitamins and minerals. She keeps abreast of developments, both national and international, and is particular about reading the newspapers early in the morning.\n\nShe believes that our ties with relatives and friends should he maintained and makes it a point to visit them at regular intervals. Since my father fights shy of people not so close to him, it is our lot to accompany her when she wants to visit someone. Perhaps she needs one of us as an escort, partly because tradition requires it; it could also be because she is timid. When visiting, she ably exchanges niceties and invites them all home as if we do not give her the company she needs.\n\nMy mother does not have a black list of don'ts. She gives us freedom of speech and action; but ensures, by what she does, that responsibility is not dissociated from freedom. At times, when we get on her nerves, she keeps a statue-like silence and the little things we do to please her and to make her break this vow of silence seem to have good sudden effect. She does not compete with us in any way and she does not believe in forcing us to study. Perhaps she feels that we would emulate her and that all she wants us to do is our best. She does not wait eagerly at the gate to know our position in class and she learns of our performance in the examination only when we. with certain amount of pretended modesty, present our report cards for her signature.\n\nTo our father she is secretary, companion, domestic accountant - all rolled into one. Her devotion to him is typically oriental and at times it would appear that her only goal in life is his and our happiness. It is not unusual for him to run into a bad temper and my mother's moderating influence has a good effect. He seldom talks to us, but mother as his secretary keeps him informed of our activities. My father is appreciative of her loyalty and devotion to us and as I said earlier he is rather extravagant in praising her motherly and other qualities.\n\nPerhaps my mother does have her own share of weaknesses but I am not conscious of them. To me she is as close to perfection as anything in the world can be. I believe that in any family, it is the mother that keeps the members of the family happy and together. In my family, she succeeds amply."

        "content": "I am not one of those that finds happiness and delight confining themselves to the house during holidays and spending time on household chores. My brother. Paul, should be my mother's pet for. in spite of his devotion to studies, he finds time to help her in her household tasks. I subscribe to his view that all at home must cooperate in doing these domestic chores - cooking, mopping, ironing etc, and also the task that I detest most - dish-washing.\nI leave most of the tasks to others to allow them to live up to their maxims regarding cooperation at home, but I seem to have a penchant for cooking and I enjoy this. My mother is the chef at home; but she is not the only one. Often my dishes, though I let myself be guided by instinct rather than by any thought or plan, turn out to he delicious and, what more, appetizing even to the weight-conscious members of my family. I don my apron on Sundays when we make sure that Mum is absolutely free from all work so that she can relive her carefree days at least once a week. However, she seems to like to be in the kitchen and help me when I cook.\n\nCooking, as they say, seems to have some therapeutic value. What I often succeed in accomplishing are preparing vegetable dishes. Washing vegetables is not a pleasure and the washed vegetables are cut and, of course, mother is by my side helping me regulate the sizes. The frying pan is kept handy and the different ingredients could he had easily because the receptacles containing them are labeled. When my mixture is fried I become meek and speak rather pessimistically about the outcome of my enterprise. To see the contents in the frying pan change colour and turn into a dish to be served is indeed a pleasure. My experiments in the kitchen give my mother a break from the routine, and the members of my family get something different.\n\nI should not make the others do what I do not like. I follow this principal after meals. After lunch, I force myself to the wash-basin in which would have been piled up all the plates, cups, spoons and so on. The receptacles which I had used for cooking would have found their way into this basin earlier. Like a doctor getting ready for an operation (for I am allergic to the detergent which we use for washing dishes) I put on my gloves. My innate dislike for washing up seems to be in line with my body's chemical reactions! I think of all the nice things I had done in the past or visualize a badminton game which I had won. This little trick of self- deception makes me forget the tedium that awaits me. Usually it takes me a full half hour to wash and clean those dishes. In the process I would have splashed a lot of water around: hence the kitchen has to be tidied up. The washed plates are wiped and placed in their racks. I feel a sense of relief when this post-cooking task is completed.\nAfter that I take a siesta and both the tedious tasks are forgotten. I look forward to the next Sunday though my enthusiasm is invariably dampened by the self-imposed domestic task of dish-washing."

        "content": "Surprisingly and contrary to popular belief, more accidents happen in the home than in the streets. Perhaps this is because most of our time is spent at home. Accidents can cause great sorrow, and taking into consideration the fact that there is no place like a safe home. I think it is worthwhile discussing the safety precautions that should be observed in every home.\nElectrical gadgets, no doubt, take a load off the hands of housewives. Faulty gadgets, however, have caused many accidents. Most of these could have been prevented as home accidents, as a rule. are the result of carelessness. In view of this, I suggest that these appliances not he handled with wet hands. Water is a conductor of electricity and chances of being electrocuted are high. Fuses should he installed wherever possible as they prevent fires. Faulty gadgets should not be used, or should be repaired immediately by qualified electricians.\n\nMedicines and poisonous substances should be kept away from the reach of children. They should have little, if any, access to sharp objects such as knives and scissors. Cuts are by far the most common of home accidents.\n\nHandles of saucepans should be placed away from one while cooking. Otherwise, a careless move may lead to scalding. Boiling water or oil is likely to cause scalds and these can be very painful experiences. Burns too are common. Therefore pots and pans should not be touched with bare hands unless one is certain that the pots are not hot. Extra care should also be taken whilst using an iron.\n\nSwallowing of objects is common among small children. Bright colors, in particular, attract their attention and the first thing they do on getting these objects is to put them in their mouths. Such objects should be kept away from children. Plastic bags left around the home can cause suffocation. Here too, children form the majority of the victims. Litter should be placed in plastic bags before being disposed off instead of being thrown everywhere. We have to congratulate the Ministry of the Environment on having thought of this very good idea.\n\nFloors, no doubt, have to be cleaned and polished regularly. All the same, avoid making them too slippery. People may slip and one can imagine the danger if the victim is a pregnant woman. Playing with matches and fire should he discouraged among children. Their carelessness can result in fires.\n\nLast but not least, I suggest that parents equip themselves and their children with a sound knowledge of First Aid. Accidents in the home can never be totally eliminated but First Aid will definitely make matters safer."

        "title": "My secret ambition",
        "content": "I may call my ambition to become a pilot a seven-year old obsession. My parents seem to have decided what my career should be. As I learn more about aircraft I become more and more interested and I believe soon I will have to disappoint my parents.\nMy parents want me to be something else. They have told me several times that they would like me to take up architecture. But I know that my aptitude is different. My mother was very frightened. she mentioned all the air crashes she had read about and told me that it is a hazardous occupation. My father is not concerned about the hazards and it seems he wants to realize in me an ambition which he had nursed in his youth. My friends seem to think that being a pilot is as good a job as any other, but they wonder if I am suited for it. Some of my friends think that I am only interested in the idea of being a pilot, and have warned me against deceiving myself.\n\nI should think that this idea developed in me when at the age of nine my father took me for a joy ride on a Cessna. I still remember its name - The Sky Hawk. I watched what the pilot did from the time of take-off until landing. I then imagined myself strapped in the cock-pit, handling the controls. When an air show was held. I went everyday of the week to see the demonstrations. It was this air show I believe, that made me more determined. I am a member of the Air-Training Corps. One of my hobbies is building model aircraft, and I have more than a dozen plastic models suspended from the ceiling of my room. I also make aircraft models with balsa wood and paper, and spend hours flying them in the open field next to my house.\n\nI feel that I have the necessary qualities to become a pilot. My little mathematical ability should enable me to study the theoretical part of the pilot's course. I am in the science stream and the Physics I learn at school will be an advantage. My vision is 6/6 and I am above the average in height. My school has developed in me a sense of responsibility and I am safety-conscious.\n\nI am not sure whether I would like to be a commercial pilot handling passenger aircraft or a fighter-pilot in the air force. Being a commercial pilot has several material advantages. Commercial pilots are very highly paid and are also given many fringe benefits. They can travel to all the cities that their airline serves. If they get tired of one circuit, they can switch to another and visit all the countries in the new itinerary. When out of the country, they are given excellent accommodation and other benefits.\n\nBeing a fighter pilot, though it means being paid less and having less material advantages, has its thrills and excitement. Airplanes have always fascinated me and will continue to do so. I find myself thrilled at seeing new engines, and new control systems. I shall be able to take my craft very high and penetrate the atmosphere. I can dive down, make arcs and do a whole lot of other feats which I will not be able to do as a pilot officer of a commercial plane. As a commercial pilot, I would not have as rough a time as a fighter-pilot. Except for a few squalls and fogs and mist, commercial pilots control their aircraft with a certain amount of boredom, and the routine makes their job dull. Fighter-pilots have to keep on testing new techniques.\n\nAs other boys of my age, I have also an ambition. The realization of it may not be possible. I have at least the satisfaction of having a goal before me and the desire to reach it will give me sufficient motivation. I hope my ambition will remain a secret in a conventional sense at least"

        "content": "A legend is a traditional story and it is not historical. As with other legends, the legends of my country need not be true. These stories have been handed down from generation to generation by word of mouth and what we hear today could he a much exaggerated version. There is something fascinating about these legends and they are a part of our national culture.\nThere is a rather mythical story of how Singapore got its name. A certain Indian king, we are told, was passing by Singapore in a ship when a great storm arose. All the efforts his sailors made to keep the ship steady failed. They threw several precious things overboard to appease the wrath of the sea gods, but they failed. At last one of them requested the King to throw his crown overboard. Immediately after the king threw his crown overboard, there was calm. He saw an animal disappearing behind the trees. It looked like a lion. The king was excited and decided to call the place. Singapore, meaning lion city.\n\nAnother legend, which appears to have more substance in it, relates the adventures of a refugee noble from Palembang in Sumatra, Parameswara. Parameswara fled to Singapore from his native state and was very well received by the governor of the island, a Siamese noble called Temagi. Parameswara repaid his host's hospitality by a rather mean and unworthy action; he killed Temagi and assumed the role of ruler. Temagi's brother, who heard about the outrage prepared a fleet and headed for Singapore. Parameswara fled, and ended in Malacca where he founded a kingdom.\n\nSome of the legends involve ghosts and spirits, and the most popular legend is that of the 'Pontianak'. This is a female demon who entices men by her beauty and then kills them. Unlike Dracula. she derives nothing from killing but some unexplained pleasure. She is said to move only in rural areas. Film-makers capitalized on this legend by producing a series of horror thrillers. The films seem to have distorted the story, thus exaggerating the original legend.\nThe point about most legends is that they are an inflated, distorted account of incidents that are probably factual. Many years ago. cases of thefts and molestation of women were reported, and the offender was reported to be a very dark man, almost nude. and gleaming with oil. He could probably have been an ordinary burglar. oiled to evade capture. Or he could have assumed this unusual appearance to terrify his victims into subjection. Or he could have tried to convey the impression that supernatural forces were at work. The point was that following a few incidents, news spread about that a strange being 'the oily man' was going about. It was even said that he could appear and disappear at will.\n\nThe legends of my country have not yet been carefully studied. Although a few legends have found their way into print, no organized attempt has been made to collect them to form a comprehensive compilation. These legends, especially the historical legends. are about the only records we have of very early history, and until archaeological findings are found that can verify or falsify these legends, we cannot discount them as completely false."

So great is her influence on me that I often think in terms of atoms and molecules.\nI suppose I admire her most because I want to be a scientist and she is, I believe, the idol of aspiring scientists. Never will mankind forget her stupendous discoveries as thousands, if not millions, of lives have been saved by her persistent search for truth.\n\nShe was born in Poland in the year 1867 and at a very young age, her exceptional abilities were recognized by everyone. At the age of sixteen, she finished her education, winning the Gold Medal for being the most brilliant student. From then onwards, she worked very hard as a governess so that she could provide for her sister. Bronya, and help her acquire a sound knowledge of medicine. This is only one of the man instances which proves to us her kind-hearted nature.\n\nAnother admirable quality of hers was her love for Poland. She was very much against Poland being ruled by Russia but realized that she could not do anything to alter this situation. The first element she discovered, Polonium was named after her native country. She was beautiful and, for a lady, had plenty of courage and determination to put forward her theory of the phenomenon now known as radioactivity. The scientists in those days refused even to consider what she believed saying that she was only a lady. She, however, was able to prove what she believed, mainly with her husband's help, and was subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nHer husband, Pierre, was a Frenchman whom she married at the age of twenty eight. He too was a scientist and gave her all the encouragement that was needed for her success. She loved him dearly and his death was a shocking experience to her. She was in a state of shock for many weeks and never really recovered from it. She, however, realized that she had to continue her work for all the others who would benefit from it and was more than successful in doing so. She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics and is the first person to have received this prize twice.\n\nShe was practical and realistic in her outlook. This is clearly illustrated by the manner in which her two daughters were brought up. She made them aware of the hardships of life and they grew up as independent youngsters. She also made it clear to them that life was not a road strewn with roses.\n\nRadium, another of the elements she discovered, is being used to cure cancerous growths and has saved millions of lives. It is of interest to note that she took all this as an obligation and was never proud of her achievements. She remained humble throughout her life.\n\nNever will the world forget this brave and courageous woman. She is the person I admire most and I trust many others admire her too."

My friends frown upon my pessimistic attitude so I shall be optimistic when I think of what life has in store for me. If everything remains equal, I would be comfortably off and be pleasantly, burdened with responsibilities.\nMy physical energy would be very much diminished and 1 would have retired from football. I hope to be a veteran badminton player, playing doubles at least twice a week. Perhaps I would not take to golf, even if I have the opportunity, for badminton is my second passion today, football being the first. I could be mentally restless and I would have developed a few hobbies and orchid-growing will be one of them. I would be inviting friends to play bridge with me on Sundays and we would he absorbed in the game, unaware of the world around, like the lotus-eaters.\n\nNow I find myself wildly enthusiastic about everything I do and I have made great plans for the future. I have variously decided to become a pilot, a journalist, an officer, a teacher and a doctor. I wonder how many of my dreams will be realized. In twenty years, I shall be thirty six. At the age of thirty six. I would have chosen one occupation and stuck to it. At the moment, the prospect of a routine life terrifies me. but at thirty six, any other way of living would be difficult.\nIn spite of all my protestations of remaining a bachelor. I have a feeling that I will be married and be having children by then. I would probably have not more than two or three children. I shall probably have a couple of girls and a boy. I really am not in a position to say anything definite about the kind of woman I am going to marry. Probably I shall be married to a very quiet but intelligent woman who is very practical, efficient. understanding and realistic in her attitudes.\n\nPerhaps I would have finally decided to become a teacher. If I would emulate my teachers I should be dedicated and efficient, preparing my lessons thoroughly and teaching effectively. I would be conscious of the teacher's responsibility for the mental, physical and moral development of the taught. I would be the badminton master of the school. If I would be a successful teacher. I would eschew the idea of becoming a headmaster.\n\nI shall have some material comforts and live a happy life. I will probably have a house of my own. I wonder what kind of magnificent television sets we will have then. There will be a whole lot of channels to choose from. If the satellite system is perfected, we shall be able to view television programs from all over the world. I love music. I expect in twenty years, the degree of fidelity in electronic sound reproduction to be so high that I can actually listen to great, realistic concerts in my own room. At the rate we are miniaturizing electronic combinations. I expect my entire sound system to be the size of a match box. My telephone will have that gadget that will enable me to see the person I am talking to. I wonder if domestic lighting will be the same. I can safely predict that my kitchen will probably look like some high-class science laboratory. There will be numerous labor-saving devices that will ease our domestic burden. Video tape recorders and regular home movies might help us to while away our time. I wonder what my car will look like.\n\nThe material comforts that I would enjoy will not make me lose my values. I will not be living in an artificial world of my own. My children would he my first responsibility and I would treasure the company of my friends and relatives."

What usually happens is that I leave for some place with a group of friends and then begin to wish I had gone somewhere else. This time I am going with William to Mersing.\nWilliam has a huge bungalow by the seaside in Mersing. Usually his bungalow is crowded during the holidays because William likes his friends around. This time, however. William wants the bungalow all to himself because he wants to try scuba diving. He is new at scuba diving. He wants me to go along because he knows I have only been there once before and that I like to learn more about sea sports. William loves to show off his skill in sea sports. William proposes to stay in Mersing for at least two weeks. This means that I shall have to take quite a number of cloths and other necessities with me. I may have to take back my suitcase from Albert.\n\nWilliam has two or three boats. The boat that I look forward to using is his powerful twin-engine speedboat. The entire boat is made of fibre glass, and the base of the boat and the short keel are made of transparent fibre glass. When you sit in it you can actually see the water below your feet and you get the queer feeling that you are standing on water. Its speed is another remarkable feature. At times, I have seen the whole boat leap clear of the waves. But I know that at the same time that it is fun, it can also be extremely dangerous and that if you crash at eighty miles per hour, you could be killed. I shall spend most of the time in the speedboat, and learn how to control it, especially when the sea becomes choppy. I would like to try racing in circles, and practice maneuvering through floating buoys.\n\nThere are water-skis in the boat too. William. who is highly skilled in sea sports, knows how to use skis. I shall spend some time learning how to ski. Needless to say, the first few attempts will tire me. I shall learn to get used to balancing. and then to maneuvering the skis through water. William has promised that he will not speed when I am learning. I think if all goes well, I ought to be a proficient water skier before the holidays are over.\n\nWilliam has a larger boat, which he calls his yacht. Actually it is a big white boat with an inboard engine and it belongs to his father. This boat can travel far out to sea. William's father has been known to sail this boat from Singapore to Kuala Terengganu. We will take this boat some twenty miles out to sea, weigh anchor, and stay for a couple of days. The last time I was there, I caught a fish some two and half feet long. William has a spear gun, and a harpoon gun. and he intends to take them along. He has never speared sharks before, and he told me he would like to try. Probably we will shoot sharks from the boat. It is very dangerous to venture into the water when there are sharks around. William has a friend who is a fisherman who knows exactly where to find fish.\n\nI shall probably accompany William when he sets out in his speedboat to find a place where he can scuba-dive. There is a magnificent reef in Mersing which is partly submerged when the tide is up. Usually he brings up all kinds of weird coral. Sometimes he brings up lots of peculiar fish for me to examine, and then throws them back in the water.\n\nThere will be a lot more than just fishing, diving, boat racing and skiing to keep us busy. Apart from lounging on the beach and trying to get a tan, we might probably wander a few miles down the coastline and hike for the fun of it. I expect I shall return with lots of memories."

        "content": "A true friend is one who helps you when you are in need. He can he your confident and one who patiently listens to you when you have something to tell. The attachment need not always be emotional. There are times when reason should give way to emotion. The qualities I have liked best in my friends are their physical and moral courage, their sympathy and sense of responsibility.\nAs a school prefect, I was involved in a rather unpleasant incident one day. A notorious bully was collaring a much smaller boy outside school when I interfered and warned him that I would have him reported if he did not stop at once. The bully did as he was told. but boasted that if I had not been a student of some authority, he would have had no hesitation at all in striking me. I must admit that I was irrational when I told him that he could ignore my being a prefect. As this he flew into a rage and he threatened to beat me up outside school, but when he came face to face with me, he told me he would set some delinquent boys on me. I must confess that this piece of news startled me for I am, like most other people, unwilling to get involved with delinquents. He did bring some delinquents the next day and they approached me threatening. A smaller boy, knowing by some instinct that a fight was brewing. shouted excitedly. News of the impending fight spread like wildfire in the school. Three of my friends, who were expecting such trouble to develop, rushed to the and stood beside me, ready to fight the thugs if necessary. Every one of the hoodlums turned pale for they were cowards at heart and slowly moved away. I had no trouble from the bully since, and I was proud of the way my friends had risked their necks for me. In fact this gangland invasion was intended only to incommode me.\n\nAnother quality I admire in my friends is their capacity for spontaneous sympathy. None of us knew Wilfred's uncle very well, but we knew that Wilfred loved him a great deal. Wilfred's uncle loved his wife and daughter very much. When he died. nearly a year ago, his wife was completely distraught. She lived in a rather remote part of the country, and there was nobody to help her, save a couple of neighbors. Wilfred knew there was no man in the house to take care of things and he decided to pack up his clothes and leave for his aunt's house straightaway. We knew Wilfred was too upset to be able to manage anything, and all of us cancelled our proposed trip to Mersing and went with Wilfred to his aunt's house to help them prepare for the funeral.\n\nOne other quality I admire in my friends is their sense of responsibility. Most of the time we chose to behave in a manner that suggests irresponsibility, but when we are required to do something, we go about it with seriousness. The two instances I have cited above will show that we can be serious when necessary. We like being together, and we like to loaf all day. But all of us are studying, and all of us are aware that we cannot afford to neglect our education. We never let anything disturb our studies because we know studies are necessary."

        "content": "The bond between parents and children is one of love and affection; yet we come across people who hate their parents and also people who feel that their parents have let them down. Why it this the case ? Are these people unnatural or are they justified ? Perhaps in some cases they are justified. Most men and women get married and have children but not all of them are worthy of being parents. Parenthood, like other responsibilities, needs devotion, dedication and a lot of preparation. Prospective parents must recognize their responsibilities and realize what parenthood involves.\nThe first essential of good parenthood is the acceptance of the role. A man who marries when he is young may resent his first child for it would be a rival for the affection of the lady of the house. Similarly. a woman may resent her first child because it suddenly puts her in a different class of women. Couples who become parents can no longer call their time their own. Often the newcomer may necessitate changes in the household routine, giving up of a job on the part of the mother and various other sacrifices. The world of affection which should surround a child should precede its birth. It is here that good parenthood begins.\n\nFondness, however, is at no stage a synonym of pampering and spoiling children. Parents have the responsibility of cultivating those qualities in their children which may help them to face life, make them brave and likeable human beings, impart to them a sense of integrity and strength and these lessons cannot be learnt haphazardly. Parenthood is a full-time task and the only way of cultivating the right habits in children is through example and by providing an atmosphere which is conducive to the growth of these qualities. A child learns these virtues at home and the influence of his parents can counteract all other influences whether good or bad.\n\nThis is the theoretical aspect; in practice, the recipe for good parenthood is love and understanding. These two envelop a whole world in themselves. Love means love in the right degree, love which does not ignore discipline, love which does not yield for the wrong reasons and for the wrong ends, love which can provide security and confidence for the growing child, love which leads to sacrifices and makes one devote some time and join in enjoying the simple pleasures of childhood. Understanding means trying to find what the child wants and why, giving him the freedom to try new ideas, to experiment with hobbies and learn from the world of nature. Understanding in love becomes hiding one's fears and allowing the child to develop a sense of adventure and fearlessness; it means loving without clinging. It is not only confined to this, it extends further. It includes patience and forbearance. There may be occasions when a child may be afraid of things: of participation in social and public functions, of swimming of heights and endless other things. Understanding means trying to find out the reasons for the fear and perhaps giving in for the time being and helping the child to overcome it gradually.\n\nWhatever is of value in the human character is born out of love and understanding. There can be no strict rules that one should say \"No\"' or put one's foot down or allow a child complete freedom. Each situation has to be judged and examined individually and each parent has to make the decision himself or herself. But there can be one rule: don't corrupt the child. Don't teach it to accept the second best, don't bribe it into obedience, don't be tyrannized by its tantrums, don't blackmail it or allow it to blackmail you. If the child remains incorruptible, it has every chance of growing up to be a person of generosity and compassion.\n\nBeing a good parent is in itself a process of growing up. One should have the capacity to love and to love wisely: it is this kind of person who makes a good parent. Share yourself with your children and they will love you and learn from you."

        "title": "Libraries and their uses",
        "content": "The first thing that I normally do upon arrival at a new station is to find out about its libraries and bookshops. Though bookshops may offer the latest in books, the utility of libraries surpasses that of bookshops. Libraries house a world 24 of knowledge. It is not only difficult but almost impossible for an individual to collect or possess all that a library can possess. Books. reference books, various kinds of dictionaries, magazines and periodicals all can be found in a good library. With the present day prohibitive cost of books, it is the library habit that pays. Besides the cost, all books do not have the same utility for everyone. A few books one may like to read over and over again but there are many that one only needs to refer, to read once, to compare versions or to find additional information. This is true not only of reference books and dictionaries but many voluminous history and autobiographical books as well.\nLibraries may often acquire and possess rare books for the life of a library is not limited to one generation. Libraries go on enriching themselves year after year and generation after generation. Many good university libraries establish archives in order to collect works of national importance and of famous writers. They also buy and preserve manuscripts and letters and thus make it possible for the past and the future to be related to each other.\n\nLibraries, at times, also conduct seminars and discussions. They provide avenues for discussion and exchange of ideas. They also have been responsible at times for introducing the public to the latest trends in various subjects and may have forums where book reviews are presented. Thus they attract the public attention towards the latest publications and their book reviewing has an additional advantage in that it is a two-way traffic and not confined to the mere reading of the review.\n\nNo one can question the importance of a good library for the serious researcher. He not only needs the rare books and manuscripts, reference hooks, specialized journals but also the other services of the library like inter-library loans. catalogues and various other things. Most libraries are willing to lend hooks to other institutions but not to individuals. Many also undertake to provide bibliographical details and make reading lists on various subjects and thus facilitate research.\n\nBut libraries are meant not only for the serious researcher but also for the ordinary individual - the growing child, the busy housewife and the active businessman, the diplomat, the soldier and the manager. In modern times libraries are tending towards specialization. We have children's libraries, devoted primarily to social sciences or humanities. We also have mobile libraries which have specific days on which they visit certain areas. People who are too busy or too ill to go out to a library benefit from this facility. This helps them to maintain their contact with the world and also to help overcome the sufferings and stresses of personal life. There are many libraries which serve the public through the mail by he postal membership scheme. Most cities have a public or a municipal library where the membership fees are nominal and a large number of people can benefit. There are many books which are good enough to read but not good enough to treasure.\n\nSometimes reading is done out of intellectual curiosity and at other times merely to pass some examinations. Not all hooks may be of enduring value: but still one has to read them. Libraries are very useful in this respect. Almost all of us find the need to depend on libraries. They are a storehouse of knowledge and in a library, in the presence of hooks, one comes face to face with the limited world of the self. They teach us a lesson in humility."

        "content": "Clothes can tell us a great deal about a person's background. his social status. his aesthetic tastes, his mood and even about the climatic conditions he ordinarily lives in. They can also indicate whether he has been recently bereaved or not. at times it is possible to find out the marital status of women by the way they dress. If a person is wearing black it is indicative of some bereavement. Of course now black bands are also worn to indicate resentment of the policies of a firm or an association. White is associated with a large number of emotional states. In many Asian societies it is considered to be a colour of mourning and amongst the orthodox Hindus white is the colour of widowhood. At the same time white stands for purity and chastity. White is the colour for bridal dress in the West. In tropical countries it is a colorful scene that meets the eye. The lush greenery of the landscape in Malaysia, in Singapore and in Burma is matched by the floral designs of the sarong and the bright colors of the blouses and the shirts. Bright colored clothes besides providing a contrast to the greenery, also reflect the heat and are cooler to wear. Similarly it has been noticed that people living in sand colored surroundings of the desert are inclined to dress up gaily and are conspicuous amidst their surroundings.\nThe quality of the material used and the tailoring at once indicate the social status of the man. If the clothes are of a good quality but are worn and threadbare then obviously the man has fallen on evil times. If they are new but not well cut and the wearer doesn't carry them with ease then it would be fair to say that here is an upstart who is learning the ways of the rich. Poets and Bohemians carry clothes with a subtle indifference and cultured women impart a grace all their own to the clothes they wear irrespective of the quality or the cost of the clothes. It should be understood that in the tribal world, the aborigines do not pay excessive heed to clothes. They belong to the world of civilization and consciousness. they belong to the post-lapsarian period when Adam and Eve had become acquainted with good and evil. The European gypsies - though colorfully dressed do not make dress their prime concern. In the civilized and highly sophisticated societies, however, clothes have acquired a disproportionate importance.\n\nSartorial differences have been minimized to a very great extent. The use of synthetic fibres and cheaper imitations of expensive garments have flooded the market. Imitation furs and jewelry add to this effort at camouflage. It is not always possible to judge correctly the social background of a person due to these reasons. People are consciously dressing according to the accepted standard in order to benefit from class prejudices. Though this may pass in many cases, the truly naive and the truly sophisticated don't join in this effort and even if the naive do, they are not successful. For when a man fresh from a rural background tries to acquire an urban exterior, the rest of his behavior will give him away.\n\nClothes, like language, can be used both for deception and expression. They can express a personality transparently: they can also help achieve a disguise and carry through a deception. If the attempt is to deliberately deceive people, clothes can go a long way in doing this and this hypocritical behavior may one day become reality. As far as human integrity is concerned it is best to follow Thoreau's advice: \"Beware of all enterprises that require new clothes\", for clothes may well destroy the man within."

        "title": "Colors in nature",
        "content": "The world of nature is colorful and bright and human ingenuity cannot hope to match it. Right from the sky above to the sea below, nature abounds in the richness of color. The human eye and the human mind respond to this world of color and identify themselves with it. When a person is cheerful and bright we refer to him as a 'colorful personality', similarly the different colors are used to indicate human moods and attitudes: blue is associated with depression, white is likened with serenity, green with jealousy and red with rage. Color is also used to relieve tension. Psychologists have investigated the effect of colour on the working ability of workers and have come to the conclusion that certain colors are more conducive to Positive thinking than others.\nNature fulfils man's longing for color: there is variety in everything. The sky can be clear and blue, it can be dark with clouds, it reflects the glory of the rising sun and the variegated hues of the setting sun. The sea which is normally associated with blue is not really so all the time. The sea water can he blue, green, grey and many more subtle shades and even the rivers and streams reflect the surrounding area and acquire that colour. Coleridge's poem 'The Ancient Mariner' is rich in its description of the world of nature. People who do not observe are not able to notice the finer shades and are consequently not able to enjoy this valuable side of life.\n\nIn the west, seasonal changes bring in changes in the landscape. While spring is rich with colour, autumn provides a restful view to the eye with its soft browns and ripe greens and winter brings in the whiteness of snow along with its stillness conveying the effect of sleepiness and hibernation. And if on the one hand there is joy and vivacity in spring, there is coolness in the abundance of the green forests, and a challenge in the dark rocks of the mountains and an immensity in the vast, barren stretches of sand.\n\nOn the question of birds, I have discovered that in their world there are endless color combinations. If green and grey birds mate, the new born chick has a lovely soft green color; if yellow and blue mate the chicks may be either a heightened blue or a softened yellow. No painter's effort can successfully capture the elusive world of nature.\n\nNature's world of color, especially among the animals, has a deeper purpose than there variety. The colour of animals helps them to successfully camouflage themselves. If the toad is brown and mingles with the color of the earth, the frog merges with the green colour of the scum. The polar bear is white but not so the tropical bear. Fishes also have the ability to change colour in order to mingle with their surroundings as do some birds like the willow ptarmigan. Lizards also have different colors according to their surroundings - a desert lizard will be sand-colored while a lizard in a heavy monsoon area will be of greenish hue. Butterflies and insects also share this characteristic. This is not to say that animals and birds do not have bright colors which contrast with their surroundings. This also has a purpose. The bright colors of the peacock are not only a pleasure to the human eye but they also push the peahen into obscurity and offer her greater protection. A male bird may display some brilliant coloration to scare a rival. The Chinese ring-necked pheasant does exactly this, he puffs out his red pouches on the side of his neck when confronted by another male.\n\nThus color does not only give pleasure, it also has a purpose. Imagine life without the color of nature! It would indeed be dull and monotonous: the sparkle of life will not he there. Color also has brought up problems. The whole problem of racial discrimination is connected with the color of the human skin. Men are hidebound in their narrow beliefs and have not yet learnt to value the variety of color and have not understood nature's purpose behind this."

        "title": "A great inventor",
        "content": "It is surprising what a man can achieve with imagination and hard work put together. Yet how few of us achieve it. It is futile to say that some are too poor and others too rich to put in the required amount of effort and the necessary amount of concentration. There is an inexplicable something in the makings of a genius. That is why he is a genius! Thomas Alwa Edison, the great American inventor with more than one thousand patents to his credit, was one such man. Not at all bright in the ordinary sense of the word, hard of hearing and frequently absent from school, he was earning eight to ten dollars per day at the age of twelve and was the owner of several newspapers and vegetable shops. This was the result of initiative and hard work and not of necessity for his parents were fairly well-to-do and could give him a reasonable amount of pocket money. Born on 11 February 1847 in Ohio, he moved with his parents to Port Huron in 1854 where his father became a dealer in grain and cattle feed. His father Samuel Edison came from a line of long living, hard-working people of Dutch origin and his mother was of an American Quaker family. He perhaps inherited his shrewdness, and his ability to assess people from his mother and the capacity of hard work from his father. Thomas Edison started earning money right from the age of nine and from then onwards he never looked back.\nEdison's first invention came at the age of sixteen, when he invented a gadget for the automatic transmission of an hourly signal; this he followed up with an automatic vote recorder for recording of votes in the congress. When the politicians laughed at the idea, he realized that an invention should not only be useful but should also he in demand. Later he was to learn that the price of an invention should be measured not according to the effort and labor put in but according to its value to the purchaser. This he learnt when he went to finalize the deal with Marshall Lefferts, the President of the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company for a stock-ticker which he had invented. He went determined to ask for $3,000 but felt too timid to do so. Timidity paid him dividends for Marshall Lefferts offered him $40,000 with which Edison was able to start a factory.\n\nEdison was not content with merely making money. It was only of secondary importance for it helped him continue his research and experiments. He was responsible for at least fifty different inventions connected with telegraphy. He also invented the quadruplex communication system by which four messages could he sent simultaneously. He also invented what is now known as a stencil, and paraffined paper for wrapping toffees. Edison used his imaginative faculties to the full. Amongst his major inventions is the phonograph or what is commonly known as the gramophone. He first used it to record telegraphic messages but as the paper made a musical noise while rotting. the idea occurred to him that it could also be used for recording music and the human voice. Having very little taste for music he was quite surprised when demands poured in from the Germans for records of classical music. He himself visualized it mainly as a business and educational aid.\n\nAmongst other notable inventions were his inventions related to the world of electricity. He invented the carbon filament electric lamp and erected the first central electric power station in New York. Though he made no direct contribution to communication, he patented a system of wireless communication by electrostatic induction. Edison also devised the first cinema camera and made the first commercial motion pictures.\n\nAs a person, he was naive and simple but once exposed to the tricks of the commercial world he was quick to develop a business acumen and play his part in the world of business. He was a shrewd judge of character and was also very lucky in having talented young men to work for him who later became inventors in their own right. Henry Ford was among the talented amen who worked for him. Edison's first marriage took place in 1871, which was perhaps a romantic marriage. But his wife died in 1889 and Edison remarried, this time a good eighteen years his junior. His life acquired a different tone after that but he lacked the finer delicacies of parental life. absorbed as he was in his work. He died in 1931 at the age of 84. His life is an example of what can be achieved by people who may not be brilliant in the conventional sense of the word."

        "content": "Robert Louis Stevenson's observation that books though good enough in their own way are a \"mighty bloodless substitute for life\", has always appeared to me as correct and rich with meaning. Those who live in a narrow. confined society find it difficult to develop an out-going personality: they, at times, are not to tolerant and it is always easy for them to fall into a dull routine. Amongst the aristocratic families of Europe of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries no young man's (or young woman's for that matter) education was considered to be complete without travel. Those who were not lucky enough to have adequate funds found other means of traveling. They either traveled as companions and employees of the rich people. or. if adventurous and daring. joined professions which took them abroad. People have traveled as tramps and stowaways. The whole world of commerce and the colonial system grew out of this urge for travel and adventure. Traveling does not necessarily mean traveling abroad: it means traveling as much as one can - travel to the next town. to the seaside resort, to the small hill station, the next state, or the nearest island. It basically implies getting out of the rut, seeing other people. learning about their way of living and thinking, and thus developing a broader and more tolerant outlook towards life.\nTraveling is the best kind of education. Of course, it is no substitute for the basic learning of the three R's. But it can be a substitute for most other kinds of learning. For when we travel we get the opportunity of seeing and knowing people at first hand. One sees them as people. but meets them as individuals. Traveling even in one country is beneficial. Some parts of the country abound in rain and in backwaters, in lush, green landscapes: others have the right kind of soil and terrain for plantations - rubber, tea, coffee or timber. Still others may be having factories for canning marine products. In another part of the country there may be oil fields or coal mines or oil extracting units. So by traveling over these areas one is able to see the different kinds of industries, soils and people.\n\nCustoms, languages and religious practices differ from place to place. One learns about them and learns to live with and accept the differences. The truth of it can be seen in multiracial societies like Singapore and Malaysia where Chinese, Malays and Indians live side by side. Traveling from one corner of India to another is like traversing a whole continent. The cultural preferences vary from place to place. These experiences increase aesthetic sensitivity.\n\nBesides learning about the customs of other people and gaining a great deal of knowledge, travel also teaches adaptability. Those who travel a great deal and are willing to rough it out are not so fastidious about the ordinary comforts of life. They make cheerful and pleasant companions. Travel also breaks through religious fanaticism and encourages exchange of ideas. People who have succeeded in developing an interest in birds and animals, in rocks and minerals and in plants and trees find travel a rewarding experience.\n\nIn the present day society, individuals can perhaps survive only if they can get out of their limited circle. It is important that they know what is happening around them not only economically and intellectually but also politically."

It is a difficult question to answer because one takes so many things for granted and yet even if one of then' was removed we would miss it terribly. Many People cannot do without money or the comforts which money can buy; but I think in the long run these are the things one may manage without. There are other things which are indispensable and which are precious in life. Health is the foremost amongst them. One cannot enjoy anything without health. One thing is more important than health and that is a positive outlook A positive outlook is the basis of all that makes a good life. It makes a person warm and understanding, outgoing and likeable. It helps one to win friends.\nIt is on this base that one can build a structure of those values which have meaning in life. It is self-respect and sincerity which are important. I value my self-respect. If one lacks this respect for one's inner self, one may stoop down to the worse possible things. The claims of one's conscience, the necessity of facing one's own self and cultivating and maintaining a sense of integrity, of responsibility, of truth these are valuable in life. Take away self-respect, destroy a man's conscience and he is no better than a beast. A man without a conscience may well become ruthless, brutal and immoral for he never feels the necessity of self-examination. Or he may stoop down to the level of self-abasement and be abject and servile. I value my self respect for it keeps me upright and any day I can confront my inner self without any hesitation or qualm.\n\nAnother thing I value is the feeling of doing something worth-while; to have a sense of satisfaction at doing or having done a job well. It is immaterial what we do; what matters is the amount of involvement and sincerity we bring to it. And finally the amount of satisfaction we derive from having done it well.\n\nI also have intellectual curiosity. It is necessary to have it in some measure so that one can keep on growing and not remain stagnant. If one wants fulfilment and purpose it is impossible to derive it from a limited, daily routine. Intellectual curiosity leads to involvement and to a widening of interests and the need to meet challenges in life. To continue living day after day in the same limited pattern is a difficult and suffocating experience. Intellectual curiosity is accompanied by intellectual alertness and a keen power of observation. There is great beauty and great wealth in the world of nature, one needs only to be gifted with the capacity to observe to enjoy it.\nGiven these gifts one should be able to have the warmth of friends and a happy family life and these are things that I value in life."

        "title": "The popularity of detective stories",
        "content": "A small bookshop, a roadside stall, a railway or a bus stop bookstall is ordinarily well stocked with popular books and most of them are detective stories. Why is it that so many of us would have books as companions for a night's journey or prefer them for light reading? There must be some explanation for this kind of behavior and a tangible reason for the popularity of detective books. All detective books do not follow the same pattern. Each different writer has a different way of treating his subject matter, of constructing his plot and also his particular \"flavor\" which he imparts to his work. All detective novels are not centered around a murder, many are. Therefore, besides certain general reasons for the popularity of detective stories, there are also certain specific reasons why certain readers have a preference for some particular writers\nDetective novels do not demand emotional or intellectual involvement; they do not arouse one's political opinions or exhaust one by its philosophical queries which may lead the reader towards self-analysis and exploration. They, at best, require a sense of vicarious participation and this easy to give. Most readers identify themselves with the hero and share his adventures and sense of discovery. The concept of a hero in a detective story is different from that of a hero in any other kind of fictional work. A hero in a novel is the protagonist; things happen to him. his character grows or develops and it is his relationship to others which is important. In a detective story, there is no place for a hero of this kind. The person who is important is the detective and it is the way he fits the pieces of the puzzle together which arouses interest. Thus in a detective story it is the narration and the events which are overwhelmingly important, the growth of character is immaterial. What the detective story has to offer is suspense. It satisfies the most primitive element responsible for the development of story-telling, the element of curiosity, the desire to know why and how. So detective stories offer suspense, a sense of vicarious satisfaction and they also offer escape from the fears and worries and the stress and strain of everyday life.\n\nThere are detective stories for all ages for they have a universal appeal. Enid Blyton's prolific writings include the mystery series of the Secret Seven and the Famous Five. These books are very interesting but they have something more than mere detection to offer. They satisfy the desire for an adventurous life for many children' who live in urban areas or in unimaginative surroundings. They also have a didactic purpose as the writer avails of every single opportunity to drive home a moral lesson. There are also Alfred Hitchcock's children's mystery novels. They are equally interesting and instructive as the incidents require unraveling and do not involve murder and the children engaged in this activity are presented as intelligent, hard working and disciplined.\n\nFor the adults the choice available in detective fiction is very wide. As far as the morality is concerned some of them are harmful and are likely to have a deteriorating effect on the readers if they are not discriminating enough. Erie Stanley Gardner's cases and his famous lawyer Perry Mason provide some very interesting examples of legal quibble. It is the court scenes with their wit and repartees which attract a large following among readers. In Della Street, his secretary, supplied the romantic interest on a subdued note. In Agatha Christie's detective novels, the main interest lies in working out the plot. In Peter Cheyney's novels, it is drink and violence; in Alistair Maclean's it is spying and courage and romance. Ian Fleming's James Bond series are thrillers and not really detective novels. One cannot but remember the Sherlock Holmes stories and novels. They have a wide range and appeal to the young and old alike. G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown will also be long remembered.\n\nThe detective story is not a modern creation although it is true that never before has it had this amount of popularity. The Gothic romances popular at the end of the eighteenth century had this same element of mystery and detection which became the object of satire in Jane Austen's NORTHANGER ABBEY. Wilkie Collins' THE MOON-STONE and WOMAN IN WHITE are models of detective fiction. Serialization of novels normally encouraged the writers to end an instalment on a note of suspense. Writers who have attained the stature of classic writers have written a great deal of work which hovers on the margin between detective fiction and a work of permanent literary merit. The margin is very thin; the detective plot has to have a plus factor - something that has universal value and is significant where human life and future are concerned. Charles Dickens' HARD TIMES, GREAT EXPECTATIONS and BLEAK HOUSE fall into this category. Many people who would rather stay away from intellectually 'heavy' books find it hard to resist these. Detective fiction is also popular because the story moves with speed."

        "title": "Qualities of a good citizen",
        "content": "A good citizen is one who is a good person. There seems to be no scope for differentiating between the two - for a weak or a bad person cannot be a good citizen and it holds true the other way round also. It is a man's everyday behavior and his everyday virtues which count and contribute to his character. A good citizen is one whose behavior is consistent with the canons of self-respect and social justice and he should be reliable both in peace and war.\nThe first and foremost quality asked of a good citizen is patriotism. He should have a genuine love for his country and should have a sense of involvement in its day to day affairs, in its economic policies and its international relationships. All this cannot be achieved overnight: it is the product of a good training and a good heritage and various other factors contribute towards patriotic feelings. The first among these is the right kind of upbringing. If a child hears only stories of betrayal and listens to a discussion of the various methods of making easy money, he is unlikely to imbibe any good qualities. The hand that rocks the cradle shapes the world. Honesty, integrity and self-respect are the qualities that can only be nurtured at home. These form the foundation of good citizenship.\n\nA home and a family are a miniature group. If a person gets his values and priorities correct while living in it, he will make a good citizen. A good citizen must put the interest of his country before his own personal interest and he should not enter into any contract which may prove harmful to the interest of his country and he must do his share of the work and share due responsibilities. These are the qualities which add up to strength and character. A good citizen puts his country before self. There are many jobs which if correctly performed add to the national progress. Industries, when expanded properly, become a part of national wealth. They provide opportunities for employment and development. A farmer, a teacher, a soldier each one is important in his own role. He who loves his country puts his heart in his job and does it to the best of his ability. A good citizen stays away from anti-social activities like smuggling and corruption.\n\nIt is not only the passive virtue of not being anti-social which is important. but the positive quality of asserting oneself, being fearless enough to point out and face anti-social elements. It is not enough to slink out of their way and say that we are not concerned. Courage is not only physical but also moral: one does not require it only when faced by an enemy or in a moment of crisis but in day to day decisions and activities. Courage is intimately connected with self-respect. A man who is servile and can stoop down to any level will not he brave and will not be honest. A man who has a great deal of self-respect will he courageous in the face of odds.\n\nAnother thing which is necessary is good health. There may be circumstances which may be beyond our control; but by and large it is the duty of a good citizen to look after his health. For if a man is healthy. he can bestir himself for others; if he is healthy he can do his duty and can afford to he brave; lie can also save the of many precious man-hours. A healthy mind finds its natural habitat in a healthy body.\n\nAdded to all these is the sense of pride a person has in his cultural tradition, the feeling of identification he has with his background. However, this pride should not be allowed to deteriorate into chauvinism. It should be seasoned with the proper degree of humility. No country is too small to be on its own; and no country too big to learn from others. And a country needs its citizens to be free and fearless to make it strong. For as the poet has said:\n\nNot gold but only men can make\n\nA nation good and strong\n\nMen who for truth and honor's sake\n\nStand fast and suffer long."

        "content": "When it comes to deciding who my favorite writer or who my favorite star or character is, I find it a very difficult choice. I am appreciative of the fineness of each individual character that I do not feel the necessity of making a choice. But if it has to be made the character of Desiree Clary in the Novel DESIREE written by Anne Marie Selinko is a character portrayed with remarkable insight into a woman's nature. It is the character of Bernadine Eugenie Desiree Clary. the daughter of a silk merchant and Napoleon's first love that is intriguing and her strength, her quick reactions and her obstinacy attract admiration. She is seen in this novel as a daughter, as an excitable girl, a fiancee, a rival, a princess and a queen. She is also portrayed in the role of a wife and mother.\nWhether or not the portrayal is historically true, it is difficult to say. But the portrayal is quite fascinating and one can read the lengthy book from cover to cover only to fathom and understand the character of Desiree Clary. There is something remarkable in her character. Napoleon's mother appeals to her to intervene in order to save a life. Her sister Julie clings to her for support. Napoleon's first wife Josephine depends on her and seeks comfort from her on the night of her divorce. It is Desiree who is instrumental in Napoleon's surrender and who prevents the shedding of blood.\n\nIt is not merely her importance that matters. She happens to be there and continues to be there when needed. There is, in her, a hidden strength and resourcefulness. She is also very brave. When her sister and her children, her nephew and niece and Napoleon's stepdaughter's sons come to her for protection and she finds herself short of money, she does not borrow money, she does not sell her jewelry; instead she goes straight to her father's silk warehouse (after a lapse of many years) and collects her share of the money. She does not even hesitate to sell silk at the counter. Here she learns that her sister Julie's husband had regularly been drawing his share. She is far too human and non-materialistic to be bothered by materialistic considerations.\n\nDesiree is also very unconventional. She is not hedged in by the rules of etiquette. She treats her aides with remarkable unconventionality and appears very human in her relationship with them. Her way of arranging a meeting with Oscar, her son, after a long interval of eleven years is also unconventional. It is because of her unconventionality that she is reprimanded by her adoptive mother-in-law, the Queen of Sweden. But true to her character, instead of submitting. she defiantly walks out of the palace not to return for a long, long time.\n\nOne thing very remarkable in her character is her sense of gratitude and of attachment. She does not forget people who have either helped her or have won her regard at sometime or other. Her visit to M. Persson, her father's ex-apprentice, illustrates this. She is often overcome by nostalgic memories and has a sense of humor. Both these qualities help her to save her husband from his inner fears.\n\nHowever, Desiree has her own failings. Her pride and self-respect blind her to her husband's needs. She does not join her husband when she becomes Queen of Sweden. She must have been terribly lonely without her husband and her son, but the loneliness of her husband must have been more strenuous as he would have been on the political front. He yields to his sense of insecurity by resorting to dictatorial and anti-democratic methods. It is now Desiree's return to him, her continued stress on the Rights on Man, and her reminder of their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary save him from his sense of insecurity. If, in spite of this shortcoming, she was able to retain his love in competition with Russian and Prussian princesses, there must have been some tie which could endure the strain. And though time leaves its impact and she is not completely unscathed by sorrows, she is a forceful personality; she is the lady of peace."

        "title": "A review of a book I have read",
        "content": "Jean Webster's novel, \"Daddy-Long-Legs\" is one of those rare books which live for ever. First published in 1912 it has run into numerous editions. Recently I came across an edition of the sixties while browsing in an old book-shop. It takes one back to less hectic times when there was a chance to live and learn, when people had the leisure to give expression to their benevolent instincts, to cultivate personal relationships and nurture them into enduring ones. But more than all this, it is the story of a young innocent romance between a foundling and a millionaire without the sullying touch of money anywhere.\nOne is not allowed to forget that Jerusha Abbott is a foundling, an orphan who does not know who her parents are and what her origins may have been. The girl doesn't allow herself to forget it in her long road to self-discovery. In fact the small world of the orphanage is so cramped that she cannot help remembering it when she finds herself in the big, wide world. And she can never bring herself to go back to the world of the John Crier Home. She, however, is uninhibited in her expression of loath to return. Her attitude is in contrast to the attitude of Jane Eyre in Charlotte Bronte's novel of that name just as the world of the Home for orphans is different from that of Oliver Twist's world of hunger and scolding in Dicken's \"Oliver Twist\".\n\nAnother factor which is the life and breath of the novel is Jerusha's character: hers is a quicksand character. That is her moods of depression are short-lived she is by nature a ..sunny soul\", and able to see the funny side of things. At the age of seventeen her future is decided and she is to be sent to college at the expense of an unknown benevolent trustee who prefers to be called by the name of John Smith and wants only a regular report about her progress. It is these letters that form the body of the novel. Jerusha, who later abbreviates her name to Judy, used these letters for expressing her heartache, her contentment, her gratitude, her loneliness and also her liveliness. The unknown benefactor is a much hyphenated man, a \"Kind-Trustee-who-sends-Orphans-to-College\", and because the only thing Judy knows about him is his height she labels him Daddy-Long-Legs. Her letters are marked by candor and honesty. she does not hesitate to admit her ignorance. She tries to treat her unknown benefactor like a living person and entreats him to take up various roles in order to fulfill her longing for a family. One Christmas she buys herself seven presents with the five gold coins she receives from him and pretends that they are from her parents, her grandmother, brother Harry, Aunt Susan, Uncle Harry and sister Isabel. On another occasion she entreats him to be a grandmother.\n\nIt is not a fairy tale though it reads very much like it; it is not a mystery though there is the right amount of narrative suspense. It is a natural story about natural emotions. Judy is jealous and lonely; she has brilliant success and also fails in two of her examinations. She writes stories but most of them are rejected. Her mysterious benefactor does not disclose his identity but we learn that he is Julia's Uncle Jervie, and as the young uncle of her flat-mate he treats her to an opera, manages to spend a holiday with her on Lock Willow. a farmhouse, and begins a correspondence with her. In the capacity of her benefactor he instructs his secretary to forbid her from holidaying with the Mc Brides. There is the right degree of impertinence in their relationship. The discovery that Uncle Jervie and Daddy- Long-Legs are one and the same comes right at the end of the novel. It is both a surprise and a very pleasant attachment.\n\nThe letters carry the narration forward; they have a touch of humor and of satire. Judy avails of every occasion to dig at families and family pride at silk stockings and frivolous hats and at education. It is Julia Pendleton's family tree which infuriates her and she writes, \"on the topmost branches of her family there's a superior breed of monkeys with very fine silky hair and extra long tails\".\n\nAnother attraction besides Judy's endless chatter, are the sketches accompanying her letters. The book has a nostalgic touch and is very human in its approach. It is realistic and the descriptions are lively and amusing. It is worthwhile to spend an afternoon or an evening with it."

        "content": "It happened just a few houses away and in an entirely unexpected manner. It was late afternoon and I was returning from school. There was a small cluster of people crowding the roadside. I pretended to be ignorant about it. as if I had not noticed anything at all for I was scared. I kept to my side of the road and wanted to slough away. Apparently some altercation had taken place. People were talking loudly and vociferously. But it was an ordinary altercation until suddenly it took a turn for the worse, it became a physical scuffle. One man took out a knife. I wanted to run away but my feet were as heavy as lead. Rooted to the spot I watched the rest of the fight. Another man brought forth an iron rod from somewhere. It appeared to be premeditated as if the people had come prepared for some kind of confrontation.\nSuddenly I heard the barking of a dog and I tried to find out the direction from which the sound was coming. There was a small dog quite lost in the crowd and yelping away around the legs of the people. Perhaps he had bitten someone. There was a shriek. What had happened ? It was difficult to find out immediately. The weapons started moving to and fro, it was a chaotic scene - frightening, stupid, brutal but still human. What turned it into an ugly scene was when the man stabbed the dog. It yelled horribly as it lay on the ground. This, a completely unnecessary act. made the whole thing ugly and brutal. I felt sick and miserable. The dog was by now almost dead - though there was a very slight vibration in the body as the blood gushed out. It was an ugly scene.\n\nThe brutal attack on the dog caused a stir, and it made it quite obvious that it was something more than an ordinary quarrel. People crowded around but the crowd maintained its distance, scared and frightened. I was pushed into a side lane and was content to hide myself behind the wall of people. I still felt very weak and shaky after having been sick there on the roadside. My mouth tasted as if filled with sand, dry and dusty. I had no voice to talk or cry for help.\n\nWhat happened next was even more cruel and inhuman than what had already happened. The man who had the iron rod hit hard on the scalp of another man. One could almost hear the crack of the bone as the man fell down. Perhaps if the crack was not audible, the mind was so keyed up that one imagined it. Seeing the man collapse, some people rushed towards him and many others away from the spot. The culprits disappeared. None of them were to be seen. Only the dog lay in the pool of blood and the man unconscious kept him company. I couldn't sleep the whole night; the sight haunted me and has left a permanent scar on my young mind. I feel scared and unhappy when the roads are lonely or quarrels take place."

        "title": "Qualities of an ideal husband / wife",
        "content": "An ideal wife or husband would be a person who is an ideal companion. Does it appear that I am running around in circles ? I hope it does not. Though the traditional role of a husband is different from that of a wife, the qualities of a person are not sex-oriented, they are person-oriented. What do I want in the person I marry ? My list may be a long one: but it is sound in its priorities. I want the man I choose as a husband to be generous, to have a sense of humor and to be trusting and trustworthy. I would like to build our relationship on affection and respect and on complete frankness. A tall order ? Let me explain myself.\nAffection and respect put together are the essence of love. They are more durable than the euphoria of romantic love linked to physical attraction. It is true that beauty contributes a great deal towards life's pleasantness, but unreflecting, unthinking beauty has nothing to recommend itself. What is perhaps welcome is a general smartness of behavior and looks, but there may be cases when this is also shelved to the background. Respect in a relationship is very important, and note I mean respect, not awe or fear or any other feeling but respect which includes self-respect and can be stretched a long way to cover the crevices of feelings.\n\nI would like my future husband to be frank with me and to discuss financial, emotional and other problems with me. For if there is any ground on which I cannot tread, or any occasion when I find the door closed against me, or any time when whispered conversations take place, or papers and letters are kept away, or I look askance and don't get a reply, then there lies the beginning of distrust and rift. A marriage is a companionship; it extends into old age and can mature into a relationship where words need not be exchanged and still complete understanding may exist. It is a relationship which cannot be built on lies or half-truths. When I use the word 'frank' I do not only mean emotional friendships though they too are included. Is it not more graceful that my friends of the days when I was not yet married be known to my husband than that I spring a surprise on him or leave him to work his imagination in different directions ? Similarly I would like to know about my husband's friends - men and women. Frankness should extend to all money matters. I should know (and so should he) what our economic position is.\n\nA marriage is the basis of a family; it grows and matures and strengthens over the years. It cannot do so when the partners concerned pull in different directions. A home is a place where one feels there should be no uneasiness, no appearances to maintain, where one should feel free to express oneself and be one's own true self. This is possible if there is some basic generosity in the members of the family for generosity backs up the desire to understand, to be less critical and more forgiving in one's approach.\n\nDon't you know that a grim man is stern and unforgiving ? There are numerous little problems which can be laughed away. At times this capacity to take things lightly, to see the funny side of an otherwise grim situation may cement a relationship much more than anything else. Laughter keeps one young. It is the best medicine. So let's live and laugh together."

        "content": "Modern science has made most things possible and among them is the exploration of other planets. Imaging the world twenty years hence. It is like a journey to another planet. Let me take you along with me to the year 2100, to a world a perfection and comfort.\nLife has fallen into a pattern. We are no longer human beings, but robots living for years and years. Many of us have false limbs and still others have transplants of all kinds, eye, brain, heart, kidney. We are not individuals but reflections. There are those who can trace their family history but there are also others who owe their existence to test tubes and similar methods of science. Parents and sisters and brothers are there but marriage is not all that sacred. We have very few inhibitions and believe in both freedom of thought and action.\n\nDear visitor, why do you continue to stand outside, won't you come and be my guest ? Come inside. I'll get you a cup of tea and we'll watch television. There are live telecasts and I can take you wherever you want without even stirring out. Don't be scared if the chair moves when you sit down. The chair is meant to adjust itself to the contours of your body. The cushion is not of foam or some other material, it is filled with water so that your back is comfortable. Do you see the walls ? They are made of balloon rubber. I can wrap up my house and be on the move whenever I like. Do sit down. Let me press this button. Here is the tea for us. It is a synthetic product. I hope you like it.\n\nWe hardly ever do any reading or writing. All of us use dictaphones or tapes. We just send them across if we feel the need. We use telephones and planes. You will find very few trains though cars are common. But we no longer use gasoline. Cars can be propelled on other kinds of energy. Water, air, alcohol and chemicals are some sources of energy. During summer we also use solar energy.\n\nDo my clothes strike you as something different ? Well they are made of synthetic paper. I wear them, sleep in them, and, when I am tired of the color and design, I simply throw them into the electric fire - no washing, no ironing, no wardrobes. I go out and buy a fresh suit and that's all.\n\nMusic is still very popular. We all like a lot of noise and it keeps us happy. It is difficult to concentrate or anything while this din is going on. But it suits us for we don't have to think. The machines do our thinking and decision-making for us and computers are our teachers.\n\nShall 1 pull the curtain ? The evening sky is beautiful. I have many plants in the garden and brightly colored flowers. I am fond of them. They are a constant reminder of the beauty of the natural world. They still need the sun and the rain. They still have their personalities while we are non-persons. Don't contradict me for I am a man with a memory."

        "content": "There is nothing to beat the beauty of a winter evening in a tropical country. The sky acquires a blazing hue just before the sun sets and all of a sudden the day is plunged into darkness reminding one of the passage of time, of the interaction between life and death, of the joy and sorrow of meeting and parting. Winter indeed is the best part of the year; it is welcome in its short-lived glory.\nHave you ever realized the coziness which winter brings ? It lies in the colors around us both in the world of nature and the human world. People were bright colors, red and green and dark blue. These colors radiate a warmth of their own. Flowers blossom in huge clusters bringing the countryside alive with their vitality. Spring lives on the fringe of winter in the tropics. They start appearing in November and normally the flower shows are held in late January or early February. Dahlias, lilies, chrysanthemums, hollyhocks, poppies - the list is endless. Thus winter is for one not only a time of colour but also a time of fragrance.\n\nBirds find their way to the tropics from the cold, frozen regions and they add their colour to the landscape. To visit a bird sanctuary during winter is an experience which lives with one for many years. Even our own garden at home attracts whole Rocks of them. The time to watch them is early morning.\n\nI enjoy long walks in the evenings in winter. They seem to wrap one up. There is no heat, no stuffiness, no lethargy. The cold wind as it blows across my face leaves behind a tingling sensation. I don't like to hide my ears behind a scarf; instead I like the tip of the nose and the ears to get cold, to come alive at the touch of the wind.\n\nIt is not only the world of nature which appeals to me but also the home. The house becomes a warm cocoon in itself. Sometimes, if we are lucky enough to have the old kind of fireplace, we light a fire and the family gathers round it taking in its warmth till the late hours of the night, talking and singing and reading. At such times, I like to hide myself in a huge armchair with a book. It is so pleasant to linger over a book and a cup of coffee. Winter is the time when you belong to everything or shall I say you relate to everything, to the world of nature, to the family, to books, to flowers, to the coats and quilts. Summer is the time of withdrawal, of alienation, of quiet retreat, of shedding off all externals.\n\nOne is more brisk and alert and happy in winter and though the days are shorter, one can work for longer hours. Winter in the tropics is a matter of touch and go. We begin to wait for it before it arrives. The slight nip in the air is an event in itself and we are impatient to take out our woollen clothes and before we have had its fill it begins to prepare for its departure. The days become longer, the need for woollen clothes starts decreasing, the feel of the sun on the skin becomes harsh and unpleasant, the open country begins to shun us. Winter is on its way out and the long summer days sprawl before us in their lazy, sleepy manner."

        "content": "I am young for my seventy years though people think I am old. They are misled by my white hair and the abundant wrinkles on my face. I have been like that for many years. I sometimes think I was born with an old face and a young heart.\nPeople say the need for sleep lessens with the increase in years. I have always been an early riser. I am up and about before everyone else in the house and I hope I am not a source of nuisance to others. In fact, we are by ourselves. my husband and I; others, our children and grandchildren, are occasional visitors. It suits us for though we are often lonely, we value our independence. Imagine our going to live with any one of them ! I would hate to be treated as an appendage. I value my independence.\n\nWe are up early; but I still like to read in bed. My husband is a religious man; he would rather say his prayers. I like to read with my spectacles and all and linger over the morning tea. Then I am up with all my aches and pains and the whole process of housekeeping starts. I can't really attend to many chores; but I can give orders, instruct and check and this I do in plenty. After bathing and washing and prayers. we find ourselves sitting down to breakfast. It is still very early. If you look at the clock, it's just seven-thirty; but we have already been up for some hours.\n\nI have a quiet morning except for an occasional visitor from the neighborhood. I am fond of listening to music; at times I get nostalgic and try to arrange my treasures. Old people are as proud of their possessions as children of their collections. I also write my letters at this time of the day. I don't like to rush. We have help in the kitchen, and, therefore, I don't have to worry unduly about that.\n\nMy husband still attends to some business. He is an estate-agent and goes to his office for a few hours. He comes home for early lunch and a siesta after lunch. Then begins our busy time. Our children, grown up men and women, and our grandchildren and young teenagers know that if they have the time we would welcome them during this part of the day. Sometimes it's a meeting ground for them; sometimes only one or two turn up. One is a writer and his time is his own. Another is a teacher. She is free in the evenings. Another is a doctor, with the afternoon free. Yet another is a contractor, so he can come at any time. We are never alone at tea time. There is noise and activity in the house and shouts of laughter and quarrels and loud arguments. Sometimes some child has come from another town. Then the others come to meet him or her. At times the young people disagree so violently that they shun each other for months and take care never to run into each other. We have then to mediate and advise them. Such periods are rather tense.\n\nBy six the exodus begins. They go away to attend to their tasks and I sit down to view the television. My husband meets a friend or two, some workmen, perhaps, and goes for an evening walk which is often combined with the daily marketing. We spend a little time in the garden and then have dinner. It is then time to sleep. Thus loneliness and gaiety alternate with each other in our lives, but we are together and we are happy. We have the best of both the worlds."

        "content": "Life as a waiter has multiple advantages. Not that it is all pleasure and no drudgery. Its greatest advantage is the crowd of people one meets. As a waiter does not meet them at a social level, there is no question of being involved. Nobody seems to mind the waiter. People sit and talk over cups of coffee and plates of sandwiches, over hamburgers and lunches and dinners and they pay little heed to the shadow figure hovering around their table, catering to their requirements and bringing things to and fro. They discuss business deals and family affairs; they discuss problems, delinquent children as well as courtships and marriages. A waiter can, if he so desires, become a very knowledgeable person simply by listening to these conversations. He also learns about the happenings in town and may become the best informed person regarding the scandals, next perhaps only to the barber.\nI took this job up as a temporary measure when I had just finished school and was on the look out for an opening. But it has so far proved fairly lucrative and I am happy and so I am still working as a waiter after four years.\n\nWe can afford to begin our day lazily for it stretches into the night. Yet we are seen as being very lazy. So by nine the day beings with cleaning and polishing of the tables and the silver. Except for one or two stray clients, the real arrival of customers is only at about 11:00 am. For about half-an-hour or a little later students from the university, businessmen, office workers and bank employees turn up. Other periods of peak activity are the lunch time from about 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm and then the evenings from 6:30 pm to 7:00 pm or so. I don't really care very much for the rush hours in terms of work, but it is the best time for tips - all kinds of tips - money and information. As for work, one is kept on one's toes, rushing to and from and often there are quarrels and violent disagreements in the kitchen when everyone wants to get his order complied with first, when the cooks are also hot and harassed and the manager is also curt and impatient.\n\nMy job becomes very difficult at such times for inside the kitchen I have to be aggressive or the cooks would not attend to me at all, and outside the kitchen I have to be polite and courteous, the perfect gentlemen-waiter. So a complete switch-over of behavior has to take place. But towards the fag-end of the lunch hour, one can relax for by then only the leisurely business crowd is left. They linger over their meals when they want to strike a deal. It is a tithe that they reveal a great deal about investments. (And one can benefit from eavesdropping.) Moreover, if the deal is an important one, the host is liberal with tips.\n\nBesides the businessmen, people who tip fairly handsomely are young lovers or a mature couple celebrating an anniversary. Never expect anything from college students. But those in love have eyes for nothing else but each other and in their joy they want to share their happiness. Everyone loves a lover. I have often watched love traveling its normal course through desire, happiness, courting, adoration, worry and uncertainly towards love and maturity and marriage.\n\nWhat I detest most is the late hour when the customers do not move, when perhaps only those who have no homes linger in restaurants. By the end of the evening, one is tired and ready to sleep, ready also never to think of becoming a waiter. Yet the next morning the day begins and one is back at work ! This is the law of nature."

        "content": "A person who wears blinkers cannot grow and be independent. He can only be led. Education is by no means merely an acquisition of knowledge and its transference to the answer papers; it is a process of growth and of the development of one's potentialities. Schools and colleges are places where young students are sent so that they can participate in other activities besides classroom learning.\nReading is a very important activity for growing children for it brings the world to their doorsteps. It also makes the task of learning more enjoyable. Children like to listen to stories. We are aware of this from our personal experiences. Children like to see pictures for pictorial representation makes the whole story vivid and interesting. Beginning with fairly tales and children's stories one can progress to geographical and general knowledge. Reading books of every kind helps in the development of a child's intelligence and personality. There are books about birds, about social customs, about inventions, wild life or planets. They serve a purpose. They activate the intellectual curiosity of a person and leads him to further reading. A person who reads a great deal will usually do well in a debate or a discussion; he or she will be in a position to organize other activities and above all will never he lonely or solely dependent on human company. A person who is fond of reading will stay away from senseless agitation and activities. It is more likely for such a person to develop greater sensitivity and also greater appreciation of nature.\n\nThe drama is yet another activity which helps develop and express human personality. It adds an extra-dimension to the relationship between human beings. Men and women who are normally shy and introvert may emerge as entirely different beings on the stage. Drama gives them an opportunity to shed or camouflage their inner beings and for a short while acquire a brand new extrovert personality.\n\nThe drama is in many ways a direct offshoot of reading. Those who read a great deal possess active imaginations and may indulge in a lot of play-acting in the privacy of their study. Moreover, being always on the look out for good plays and good roles, they may read a lot.\n\nThere is another aspect to drama. It develops confidence and a young child can get rid of the initial stage shyness more easily than an adult. An appearance on the stage also gives the child a sense of importance. Applause brings him recognition, a role confers an identity. More than this, appearance on the stage also helps them to relate to others. In some ways it is an effective check on inflated ego. Rehearsals are as much team work as any sports event and every actor is quick to realize that the success or the failure does not depend on any single person. It is the result of a combined effort. Thus the drama helps both the shy and the out-going to arrive at a balance in their personalities.\n\nSchool education, if confined to the classroom, is likely to be incomplete. It must take into consideration various activities which help a child to grow. Sports, games and athletics have their good points just like reading and acting."

I have now acquired a ground floor flat with a stretch of land. The years I have missed on gardening are so many that there is a compulsive need within the to spend time with the plants and the flowers. They are growing things and as new leaves appear and buds begin to blossom it gives me a deep sense of satisfaction. Actually I have always believed that a house becomes a home when the postman brings letters and the flowers begin to blossom.\n\nSometimes I like to put on some records and have a lazy evening with music. There is hardly any time to listen to good music, music that you truly want to listen to, not some transistor or radio blaring in the background. I don't really care for loud music or pop music. I like it played soft. It casts a spell in the right atmosphere, it helps one to relax and concentration is shifted from problems and anxieties to the soothing sound of music. I like serious songs and serious music. Once in a while, however, it is an entirely different enjoyment to have a music party. A party of this kind is not focused on the food but on music. A group of friends who have similar tastes in music may come over for an evening and thus one enjoys both their company and the music.\n\nSometimes we like to sit down to a game of bridge. Not that we are very good at the game, but in our family circle it is very enjoyable. Winning or losing is not what matters. What we really like about it is the battle of wits. We all strive to win and to guess each other's hand.\n\nOccasionally, I do like to spend an evening trying out some new recipes. It is great fun to try them and surprise the family that evening and then be appreciated by them. It is much easier to try two or three of them in one evening than to spend different evenings on each of them. Reading is something I find irresistible. That is the easiest thing to do. It makes one truly independent for there is no dependence on friends, on music, on company or anything else. One can simply take a book and be happy and inhabit a world of one's own. It may be a world of experience or a dream world, but it is a world which gradually absorbs one.\n\nCan one spend an evening as one plans ? Perhaps not. It is never possible to do so. There may be unexpected visitors or unwanted claims on one's time and the evening may turn out to be very different from what was planned. It may not be possible to call one's time one's own."

        "content": "When people talk about the dark, they mean a place or situation where there is no light. Light could refer to natural or artificial light. But for me, and I am sure for many people, the dark is really associated with the black dark of the night. Some people are afraid of the dark because it is often associated with the time when evil and bad elements come out and play. It often starts in childhood when the darkness of the night induces a child's mind to think of goblins and monsters.\nMy parents trained me to sleep in my own room since I was very young. I remember some nights when I had nightmares, and I would wake up feeling that I was the only person left in the world. At first, my parents would rush to me when they heard me talking or screaming in my sleep. But later on. they put a bed-side lamp in the shape of a horse next to my bed. For a long time, that lamp was my shelter in the night. On nights when I woke up from frightening bad dreams, the light calmed me down. Besides its association with evil and ghosts, some people are afraid of the dark because most crimes such as robbery and housebreaking occur at night. The unknown is always scary. In the same way, you may never know what lurks in the dark, what is out there to frighten or confront you.\n\nOn the other hand, the unknown is mysterious, and as such can be exciting and challenging. I am one of those people who find the dark fascinating and adventurous. Many writers and song writers get inspiration for their work in the late hours. When I started to try my hand at poetry, I found that my ideas come mostly in the night. It must be that in the stillness of the night, when the working hours are over, creativity is more intense.\n\nSome people also find the dark exciting because it is during these hours that nightlife begins. Take a walk along Orchard Road during the nights, and you will see people rejuvenated by the bright lights of the nightclubs and discos. I am not a \"party person\" but I believe that the darkness of the night has a relaxing effect on people. Perhaps it is because their work-day is done. But I think there is something more to it. The dark holds an element of adventure, a feeling that anything can happen. That is why all nightclubs have dark interiors - so that the illusion and the relaxing mood of the dark are continued.\n\nAnother interesting thing that I have noticed about the dark is that it changes its mood in different settings. Under the bright lights of the city, the dark is racy. I remember walking along a quiet beach in the East Coast of Malaysia one night. There, the dark was calm. You could hear the voices of the wind and the sea. It reminded me of a wise, old man. While the sun in the morning brings light and hope, we need not be afraid of the dark. The dark is a gift from nature. Its mystery stimulates our minds and senses."

He had been transferred to another school, and we would be getting a new teacher.\nWhen she walked into the classroom, I heard a few girls giggling. Miss Rahman the new teacher looked very ordinary. In fact, she was rather thin and short. Some of the girls commented that she did not wear make-up at all. But as the saying goes \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" On her first day. Miss Rahman introduced herself briefly and explained how she would approach teaching English Literature. She told us that she wanted it to be a \"living\" subject because human life is complex and wonderful. We could all learn about life from stories written by great writers.\n\nShe also asked us to write on a piece of paper a short description of what we each like and dislike, and what we want our lives to be. When we handed it back to her. I thought that this exercise would end up like the others before. It would be forgotten by us as well as by the teacher. But Miss Rahman proved me wrong. Each time she talked to us outside the class, Miss Rahman seemed to remember the details we wrote and showed concern about our interests and expectations of life.\n\nShe told us that to enjoy reading, we have to imagine that our mind is like a multi-dimensional television set. When we read, we create pictures and images in our mind. If the book is a good one, we can also feel the emotions that the characters in the book are going through. Reading a book, thus, is an imaginative experience that cannot be duplicated by any technology.\n\nMiss Rahman would often ask us to give our interpretations or views about certain passages in the book. She always considered our opinions carefully and never used the word 'wrong'. In this way, many of us lost our fear of literature. In fact, we enjoyed offering out views, and we looked forward to her interpretations which she explained in a clear manner.\n\nWhenever we had covered the lessons and had some free moments before the class ended. Miss Rahman would tell us about tier travels. She studied in Canada and had also worked as a teacher in Pakistan. Her travels had taught her that there are some universal emotions and needs that unite people all over the world. That is why we can learn to enjoy literature written by a writer of any race or from any period of history.\n\nOn the last day of class, Miss Rahman gave us a list of hooks which we might want to read during the holidays. She promised us that we would enjoy reading them. Our class gave her a book \"Great Woman Writers.\" We wanted to thank her for making us enjoy a subject which many of us had considered dull or difficult.\n\nIt is not often that we get a teacher who not only prepares us well for the examinations, but who also cares for us as individuals."

When the villagers gave directions to their homes. they would tell the visitors \"when you see Chan's Sundry Store. take the right path\" or \"When you get to Chan's Sundry Store, ask Mr Chan for further directions to my house.\" But more than that, Chan's Sundry Store catered to the needs of the villagers. It was a big store and the Chans filled it with necessities such as foodstuff and drinks, as well as other things such as bicycles and small furniture. A few years ago. he even started to sell music cassettes and video tapes to please his younger customers. The villagers were very fond of the store because the wide variety of goods sold there often saved them a trip to town.\nThe store was run by Mr and Mrs Chan. In the beginning, it was a simple grocery store. But they continually added more and more things till it had become almost like a department store for the village. The Chans were very friendly and helpful. They even helped customers who were in financial difficulties by giving them free bags of groceries.\n\nThe store was built on a big piece of land. The owner of the land had decided that he wanted to build a row of houses on it. That would bring him greater profit than the rental paid by the Chans. When news of this plan reached the villagers, they were upset and angry. They held a meeting and agreed that the store should not be demolished. They sent letters to the owner of the land, but to no avail.\n\nSoon it was the day the owner had scheduled for the demolition of the store. Almost all the villagers came to witness it as well as to offer support to the Chans. The store had been emptied of all the goods and furniture. But in the minds of the villagers, they recalled the times when it was choked full of goods and products. and the times they enjoyed browsing in the store. A few men were still angry and wanted to confront the workers who were going to tear down the store. But Mr Chan spoke to them and told them that it would be useless to create trouble. Then the crane started to dismantle the store. Mrs Chan was not the only one who cried. Some of the villagers also shed tears over the loss of an important and cherished building in their village.\n\nMr and Mrs Chan went to another village to live with their son. On the plot where Chan's Sundry Store once stood, the owner built a row of terrace houses and a small grocery store. At first, the villagers boycotted the store run by newcomers to the village. But after a while, they started to go there to buy their groceries. But it would never be the same as Chan's Sundry Store."

        "content": "There is a saying \"beauty is in the eyes of the beholder\". What one individual considers beautiful may not be beautiful to another. To me, beauty is not only something that pleases the eyes, but also pleases the other senses and the mind. I think true beauty makes you see beyond the lovely sight. It will give you insight or realization of something interesting beyond just the outward appearance.\nWhen we talk about beauty in people. we often refer to their physical attractiveness. Of course, a beautiful or handsome face is pleasant to look at. But I find that the most memorable \"beautiful people\" are those who have captivating personalities behind the pretty faces. In one of my previous classes, there were two beautiful girls, Sue and Lin. Both had almost flawless faces and trim figures. But Lin was used to getting her way. She felt that her looks could help her get anything she wanted, especially among the boys. Sue, on the other hand, treated her beauty in a matter-of-fact way and she was nice to everyone. She was also a member of the debating team, her personality made her a more outstanding beauty than Lin.\n\nThere is another kind of beauty in people that attracts me greatly. This is what is known as inner beauty. People who have this kind of beauty have attained inner peace. They care about their fellow-man, and try to right the injustices in this world. Two well-known personalities who exemplify this are Nelson Mandela and Mother Theresa. Mandela was willing to sacrifice his life and freedom to obtain equal rights for the Blacks in South Africa. Mother's Theresa's mission is to help the poorest of the world's poor.\n\nIn fact, even around me. I know some people who are always ready to lend a hand to a person in trouble. I greatly admire the beauty of these people because they are the ones who make the world a better place. This inner beauty. I notice, gives a certain radiance to their looks.\n\nI also love the beauty of art. I enjoy classical art as well as folk art which is painted by untrained artists. To me, the beauty of an artwork is not just in the skills involved. A painting that attracts me is one which evokes an emotional reaction. When I gaze at a painting. I am trying to figure out the artist's point of view. The beauty of art, to me. is that it gives a glimpse into the artist's life or his surroundings.\n\nWhere places are concerned, to me, there is nothing comparable to the sea. It may take on different colors, or be calm at one beach and choppy at another. But it is like a timeless beauty - always a pleasure to look at and often so appealing that you cannot resist jumping in for a swim.\n\nSome people think that things of beauty are only attainable if you are rich. I disagree completely with this. Everyone has his idea of beauty, and we need to have things, people and places of beauty in our everyday life. In the words of a poet \"a thing of beauty is a joy forever.\""

Most students in the school know him as a champion swimmer. James always represents the school in freestyle swimming and has won a lot of medals in competitions. He is also a member of the water polo team. Last year, in the district championship, James was the one to score the winning goal for our school team. He is well-remembered by his schoolmates for this.\nJames is friendly with almost everyone, and he is known as the class joker. Sometimes, before the teacher comes to the class, he would stand in front of the class and throw us a riddle. His favorite riddle is the one which asks \"do you know why ...?\" Actually, he never gives us time to answer. He would shout out the answer almost immediately, and the class would burst out with laughter.\n\nEven when James is called upon to answer a question by a teacher, his answer often contains a joke or a remark which makes us laugh. Usually, because his jokes are funny and not rude, the teacher would laugh along with us.\n\nJames also likes to organize outings and gatherings. Unlike some people who only invite certain groups to these functions, James often organizes them on a class basis. Once, he organized a class outing to the zoo. Towards the end of the visit, to show our appreciation, James had arranged a special treat for our class teacher who was accompanying us. It turned out that he had reserved for her the zoo's special offering - tea with the orangutan! Of course, the animal was tame and had been trained to sit quietly with human visitors. We all, including the teacher, had a good laugh.\n\nOn another occasion, we had a class gathering at his house. James comes from a rich family, and lives in a bungalow with a big garden. Most of us already know about James' background because he used to come to school in a chauffeur-driven car. When James was in secondary three, he told his father that he preferred to take public transport. He wanted to be more independent.\n\nI suppose the fact that James is not affected by his talent nor his wealth adds to his popularity. But some students say that even though it seems that James leads such a charmed life, he does not see eye to eye with his father about his future. James' father owns a business and he would like James to work in the family business after he graduates. But James is keen to pursue a career in sports or entertainment.\n\nAt this stage, it is still too early for this disagreement between James and his father to develop into a real conflict. I hope, as an adult, James will continue to make full use of the talents that has made him such a popular boy in school."

I cannot understand people who will pay large amounts of money to travel all over the world to see sceneries in other countries and then miss out on the simple joys of witnessing something as simple as dawn breaking. I love to do this and this is what one scene looked like.\nIt was dark when I arrived at the park. I glanced at my watch and by the luminous dial saw that it was almost 5:00 am. I sat on the park bench and waited. I heard a rustle of leaves above me and peered into the darkness at the branches of the tamarind tree under which I was sitting. An owl with a mouse clutched in its claws glared back at me. \"Sorry,\" I said and saluted the bird. She seemed to have understood. She took off gracefully and flapped her wings to hurry home; probably to feed her babies.\n\nI waited in the darkness and heard a single twitter. Then more of the feathered orchestra joined in one by one. Soon it was a chorus as more and more birds began their song to dawn. I could distinctly hear different species amidst all that chirping. Then I looked up and saw the first streaks of light. The King was stirring and his first rays went into the sky as he lit up the clouds. The clouds took on a golden hue. I kept staring and at the same time listen to the birds greet their king. Then I saw one group of clouds brighter than the others. King Sun was behind them. Then slowly his crest appeared and I felt the first rays strike the tree above me. Golden rays filtered through the leaves and streaked down to me. I felt bathed in the light. I lifted up my hands to salute to Giver of all Life. \"Thanks Your Majesty,\" I whispered softly. Meanwhile my neighbors in the trees took of in a gigantic wave and with wild chirping and twittering went off to look for breakfast. Another beautiful day had begun.\n\nWith a smile on my lips and a song in my heart, I got up and went to the roti-prata shop for my breakfast."

I accepted rain as a fact of nature; but not something to enjoy. Then I met Julia. Julia is my tenant: an older lady who had never bothered to marry. She was an outdoor type and as tough as nails. As soon as she came to live in our apartment, she adopted me as her niece and we became good friends. My parents liked the influence she had over me and never questioned whatever I did as long as it was with Julia.\nOne day, we went for a walk. The sun was shining when we set out but on the way back, it began to drizzle. Reacting as I had been taught all my life. I began to run. Julia caught me in a vice-like grip. \"We will enjoy the rain,\" she said. I was aghast and told her that we would get sick and so on. She grinned broadly and said. \"Want to bet?\"\n\nShe would not let me run from the rain. \"Just feel it and enjoy it,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nA few drops landed on me. I began to feel them.

The rain drops were running down my blouse and tickling me all over. \"Don't be a softie, enjoy it,\" laughed the defiant Julia.\n\nI said, \"Heck,\" and decided to. It was beautiful.

Then she broke into song and I joined her.\n\nWe sang at the top of our voices as we walked along.\nInstead of going straight home we strolled into the park. A lot of people stared at us, but I did not care. Then the rain stopped and we decided to go home. It felt good to be completely wet.

        "content": "Like all other creations of science, the internal combustion engine is not a complete blessing. The advantages of this invention are many and I would not agree with the view that the world would be a better place to live in if the internal combustion engine had never been invented. Incidentally, this invention has been indirectly responsible for the many problems that man confronts today; but its advantages more than compensate for these.\nThe first practical internal combustion engine was invented in 1860 by a French engineer and later inventors developed the carburetor in which vaporized gasoline could be substituted for illuminating gas as fuel. The most common form of internal combustion engine is that which is to be found in automobiles. The smoke emitted by an automobile contains a high quantity of carbon monoxide and soot. Carbon monoxide affects lungs causing death in extreme cases of exposure. But the little that comes out through an exhaust pipe may not kill. However, the exhaust from all the vehicles in a crowded city can pose health hazards. The air in the area becomes polluted. In cities like London and San Francisco, the soot combines with the fog to create smog. That part of the human anatomy most affected by such phenomena are the lungs. Most crowded cities in the world are introducing legislation to curb air pollution. Vehicles emitting black fumes because of faulty engines are forbidden on the streets Town planners separate industrial centers as far as they can. Smoke disposal units in factories are urged to cut down as far as possible the smoke hat is allowed into the air. Many road accidents are indirectly due to this invention.\n\nThe idea of igniting the fuel in the cylinder of an internal combustion engine by injecting into it compressed air has led to the invention of the diesel engine. Diesel engines are used in ships and they are employed to provide motive power for trains. They propel the trucks and help the building industry. They are also used for irrigation and drainage purposes.\n\nAutomobiles have quickened communications over land. We need the internal combustion engine. it is indispensable for mass production. Today, everything has to be mass produced to suit the needs of people. Specialization and the growth of crowded communities have made modern society a tightly-knit and efficient society. It would not be wrong to say that the internal combustion engine today sets the pace. What would have happened a the internal combustion engine had not been invented. Factories would still run on steam and would require coal.\n\nThere is a tendency in man to bemoan the inadequacies of our age and wish we were back in the past. The past, it must be remembered, also had its problems. As we progress, our new developments are bound to bring their attendant advantages and disadvantages. What we have to do is to accept these disadvantages as inevitable and find a way to surmount them. If pollution becomes a menace, we have to combat it."

        "content": "In school we are told of the dignity of labor, the equality of man and his responsibility to society. According to our Careers Master, the fundamental philosophy of vocational guidance is that the job that a boy should take up should be compatible with his abilities and aptitudes. Viewed in terms of this ideal, each man, whether he be a teacher, doctor or politician, is contributing a share to society and all their contributions are to be considered equal.\nIn Asia, after independence, owing to the importance of leadership, the politician has come into the limelight. The conception of politicians as scheming slogan-shouting individuals has become obsolete. To us, a politician is a man who has the country's interest at heart and who is more involved in achieving concrete results than in making empty speeches. We also have an inherent, vague respect for politicians because they are connected with government. We tend to think that the politician is more important because his work involves organization and planning at national level. Plato, the great Greek thinker, once remarked that in most trades, one requires skill - that to be a good potter, one has to learn pottery, to become a good carpenter one has to learn woodwork, and so on. He remarked regretfully that the only profession which did not require any training or skill was politics, and that the sorry part of it all is that the mistakes made in such high circles, could ruin a country.\n\nEvery country needs doctors. No country in the world can progress if its citizens are physically unhealthy. There is nothing the most brilliant politician can do in a situation like this. The doctor is often motivated by the sincere desire to help his patient. He has an abiding sense of human dignity and his integrity remains undiminished even when confronted with callousness and brutality.\n\nThe importance of the teacher lies in the fact that it is lie who is responsible for the training and education of the youth of the country. The future of any country depends on its youth, and much depends on the kind of education they receive. That is why a teacher's role is difficult. He has to see to it that they get the training that will prepare them to be useful citizens of the country. He also ensures the moral and physical development of his pupils.\n\nMany of us, I am sure, will remember the story of the man who was given three wishes and who asked for health. wealth and wisdom. The politician by ensuring prosperity is providing the wealth, the doctor, the health and the teacher, of course, the wisdom. In this not sufficient argument to prove that all three are equally important ?"

        "content": "In a few years, the large family will be considered a thing of the past; today it is no longer a status symbol. A large family is different from a joint family of a few decades ago. A large family may consist of the father, the mother and four or more children. A small family which, because of population increase and food shortage, is considered ideal today may consist of the parents and two children. There are advantages and disadvantages of being member of a large family.\nGrowing up in a large family may develop in one discipline and a feeling for the others - qualities that are desirable for good citizenship. Food and other consumer items will not be sufficient and the members will learn to share things fairly and forego little things that may not be indispensable. Everyone in the family will have his share of domestic chores to do and what he does and the problems of his parents, often train for life; when he too will set up his own home. Thus the children in a large family are likely to grow up as responsible adults conscious of the needs and desires of others.\n\nA large family will be a lively family and life at home will never be dull. There will he many to talk to and discuss with. A problem that is brought by one will be shared by all others. When one is in distress, one can be assured of warmth and affection. Every member is a distinct individual and hence the views of the different members on a subject under discussion will be different. What an opportunity to see a problem from different angles! The interests of the children will be different and life would be one of variety.\n\nThere are disadvantages too. When parents raise a large family, and are unable to discipline them, their children will become noisy, quarrelsome and vindictive. The father or mother can cause a rift in the family just by showing partiality. Some parents, unable to discipline their children, resort to excessive punishment which only serves to alienate the children further. These are some of the reasons which family planning associations state to show that a large family is disadvantageous.\n\nMembers of a large family may be denied the benefits of higher education. In a competitive society, children who are denied proper education. may be unsuccessful and the chances are that they would be bitter and disappointed. The helplessness of the parents and their poor financial position may have an adverse effect on the children. The children may be denied the luxuries. Bereft of parental care, children may resort to evil ways and become social liabilities. The bitterness they develop as children will influence their attitudes and they may fail in life.\n\nIn the past, when more children meant more hands on the farm, it was advisable to raise large families. Times have changed and soon a large family will become an anachronism. Today our attitudes have changed and those who are conscious of the harsh realities of life are aware of the disadvantages of a large family."

        "content": "The question whether married women should take up jobs or not has attracted much attention lately and there are sensible reasons for advocating both the courses of action: going to work and not going to work. It would be fair to assume that this is by and large a middle class problem. Amongst the working class there is no taboo on women - whether married or single - taking up jobs outside the home whether it is in the field or the factory. It is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money. As working has ordinarily been associated with the need to earn money, the problem has not arisen amongst the rich classes. This question, because it is associated with the middle class, has two important aspects to it: first the notion of respectability which hinders women from taking up jobs once they are married, and secondly taking up a job means spending time away from home and may thus interfere with the smooth running of a household and the bringing up of children.\nWhen men feel that their wives should give up a job simply because of marriage, the idea strikes one as ridiculous. This kind of attitude detracts from the pleasure of doing a job for its own sake and reduces it to a mere material contract. When a married woman takes up a job, why should it reflect on the husband's ability to maintain her and his family or affect adversely his sense of respectability? Working outside the home besides providing an opportunity for self-expression also helps in the growth of personality. It gives a woman a much-needed sense of independence and self-reliance. Some men also object to their wives taking up jobs because they feel that when women work in offices or libraries they have to mix with other men and this somehow sullies them or poses a threat to their integrity. This is not really so and most balanced and mature women should be capable of taking this in their stride. And even if this is true then the remedy does not lie in segregating women from men or treating them as a different species but in educating menfolk towards decent behavior. If a man respects his wife and the other women he meets or works with, this problem of social behavior would be solved.\n\nAs long as working outside the home is not detrimental to the health of the lady concerned there is no harm in working. It is true that tradition has defined the role of a woman as a mother and as a wife and many women grow up to think that their sole duty lies within the house but in the present day circumstances this is no longer practicable. Besides economic help which a working woman provides, there is an extra dimension to her character which makes her a better wife and mother. Because a working woman comes into contact with the outer world and is likely to have wider interest, she can help to create a healthy atmosphere in the home. With her increased knowledge and better understanding she can also make a better mother. A woman who has to stay away from her home for considerable stretches of time and who has only limited time for her children will ordinarily try to do her best for them and to make the best of her time with them. If she has some imagination she can do a great deal for them.\n\nWomen need jobs as much as men for a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and children also grow up, go out to school and later to work and they get married, thus leaving a big gap in the mother's home. Thus marriage and mother-hood have no right to enslave a woman for a lifetime if they cannot provide the necessary degree of response. A job becomes a burden when it is undertaken under compulsion, or in ill-health, or if it makes claims which are difficult to fulfill. Otherwise work should be a pleasure. Married women may find it difficult to take up jobs when they have very young children. In order to help solve this problem many employers are willing to provide part-time jobs and are also willing to allow two women to share one job. With the growth of opportunities many married women have been able to start small industries or business which need not take them away from home. With most governments insisting on limited families and with husbands willing to share household duties, the present age is prepared to accept a married woman who works. And women themselves with better educational opportunities are willing to accept the challenge of a job alongside marriage."

        "content": "\"Look to your health: and if you have it, praise God, and value it next to a good conscience: for health is the second blessing that we mortals are capable of. a blessing that money cannot buy\". - lzaak Walton\n These are words of wisdom and none would question their validity. But there are times when people do value money over health. When a person has been deprived of a thing for too long, he longs for it: and as money is the commodity most in demand people want money to fulfill their needs. It can help rent or build a house. It can buy medicines, clothes, fruit and food: it can pay for the small pleasures of life as well as the big ones - from a cup of tea to a holiday abroad. Aesthetic and cultural enjoyment - tickets for the latest play, an evening at the opera, an expensive book, the latest L.P. - all these money alone can buy. There are far too many things which are out of the reach of the middle and the working classes. A good education, expensive sports and games like skating and golf, traveling in comfort, owning the gadgets which add comfort to life - these are things which people with limited incomes cannot buy. The unprecedented unemployment of the thirties was responsible for a great deal of human misery and resulted in the loss of self-respect and dignity. It also forced people to recognize the worth of money and resulted in a disproportionate attachment to the material world.\n\nThere is no denying the value of money and the pleasure of enjoying it: but there are basic issues involved. If money can be got only after a huge amount of sacrifice, is it worth it? Is it really necessary for human beings to go on increasing their needs and temporary pleasures? Or would it be wiser to impose a self-restraint on one's needs? People get so busy in getting money that they forget how to enjoy it. Engaged in getting money, man has no time for his family or his friends and at times no time even for his health. On the other hand, the pursuit of money may adversely affect both his physical and spiritual health. He may overcome his initial scruples in his desire for power and money. The question then is how much evil is justified to get to the good.\n\nIf one has to choose and even if there is no choice, health is better than wealth. A healthy person can look after not only himself but also others. He can be a useful member of society and of a family. He can be generous and sympathetic and be constructive in his thinking. An ailing person whether man or woman is a drain on others. And money can buy medicines, pay for a visit to a health resort or long hospitalization but it can neither buy health nor happiness. It is immaterial that a man can buy an expensive pair of shoes, if he has no shoes. Ultimately it is equally irrelevant whether a man is dressed up in the most expensive clothes, or drives the latest model of an expensive car. What is important is how good a human being he is. And for this he needs health. If he is healthy, his whole approach to life will be governed by this factor. Ask a man who has been through a long illness and an equally long spell of poverty and he will chose health. Money is the value of the man-made world - not of the world God created. Health is a god-given grace and let us be grateful for it."

        "content": "Games and sports were played for honor and as an incentive for better physical health and efficiency. They were played for the spirit of the game, for cultivating sportsman- like qualities, for team spirit. This was a healthy attitude and a fairly moral one for the correctness was stressed and the main idea was to develop and strengthen the character of the player. This was the idea behind the emphasis on games and athletics in public schools in England. But in recent times the whole idea has been defeated. The competitors in today's world do not depend only on stamina, their own proficiency, and the fairness of the game. The referee's or the umpire's judgment is often questioned and the loser may not take his loss gracefully.\nIt is not only individual human beings who are affected by the change in approach to competitive games. whole nations and countries are affected. The government and the public play an important role in moulding the attitude of the player. Competitive sports have become a matter of national prestige for many governments. They offer awards and recognition. The public is equally quick to hero-worship a winner and it loses no time in dropping a loser like a hot brick. Even all this could be overlooked as the passing fancy of a whimsical public, but what is difficult to ignore is the creeping in of politics in international games and sports. This happened when the Olympics took place in 1972 and the Arab-Israeli enmity assumed the face of a ghastly massacre. It has been happening also in the African countries where racial discrimination has often been a basis of selection and participation. Chinese diplomacy has sometimes been linked with the friendly visits of their ping-pong team.\n\nIt is true to a very great extent that the present day emphasis on the winning of the event has detracted considerably from the enjoyment of the game. It has resulted in the employment of many unfair and underhand means and has thus weakened the qualities which contribute to team spirit and uprightness. At the same time it has to be conceded that those countries who win in international events and do well do so because they are obsessed with the idea of victory and because they concentrate on obtaining it at any cost. This attitude reflects a ruthlessness which they also bring to politics.\n\nWinning is important. Take away the desire and the glory associated with victory and you take away half the fun out of the game: but disproportionate emphasis on winning destroys the total spirit of the game. Otherwise. it is not only internationally recognized games and athletic events that are enjoyable but also many more competitions which express a healthy feeling of rivalry. Recently a wood chopping competition was held in Australia where the champion defeated his own brother who held the previous year's championship. And I'm sure no ill will or unfair means played a part. It was pure and healthy fun. This is how it should be Competitive sports besides providing an outlet for energy should also help develop those special skills which build stamina and aid efficiency. They must not, however. deteriorate into inhumanity."

        "content": "Ambition is another name for man's desire to do well, to hear himself praised and to attain fame and immortality. It is man's struggle against his mortal existence. It would be foolish to deny the importance of ambition for it is the fuel needed for success and fame. Men have sacrificed some immediate gain, health and at times even wealth for the sake of satisfying their ambitions. Each man's ambition may be different from that of his neighbor. Somebody may want to become a musician, another a general, still another a painter. It may not always be the ambition to win wealth and fame. At times it may only be a non-materialist ambition to do a job well. But though ambitions may very in kind, the quality of ambition cannot differ. It needs determination, devotion and at times even ruthlessness.\nDick Wittington became Lord Mayor of London from being a poor orphan boy. Napoleon. the son of a Corsican lawyer, became the supreme dictator and Emperor of France. Other men have risen to fame from similar modest beginnings and have been of great service to their country. Thomas Alwa Edison struggled hard to get patents for his inventions and put in plenty of hard work to realize his ambition. Marconi. in spite of his personal wealth, had to struggle. Scientists like Madam Curie are people who have used their ambition correctly and fruitfully and have not allowed it to deteriorate into greed. There are other people whose greatness and courage at once come to the mind. The great Indian leader Mohanlal Gandhi is one such. His ambition was to create in fellow men mutual love. His ambition was to free his country through a non-violent revolution and he never allowed any personal gain or loss to come in his way.\n\nIn fact good men who have not allowed ambition to get an upper hand strike one as being so modest that one does not normally associate the word ambition with them, primarily because their ambition has been for others and not for their limited selves. Albert Schweitzer is one such example. It would be wrong to say that these people had no ambition for without it they would not have made any effort. All constructive effort is motivated by ambition whether for self or for others. Patriots, writers, soldiers, painters and men in other walks of life are all motivated by it. Only the extremely servile and the extremely complacent are not affected by it.\n\nThere is, however, a very narrow line between ambition and greed. And some people, if they happen to meet with rapid success, are prone to lose their bearings. When ambition becomes free from all social and moral responsibility, it results in the destruction of man's integrity. History provides endless examples of this. The story of Dr. Faust told by Marlowe confirms this. Many men who began well and rose from humble beginnings lost their moorings and headed towards self-destruction. They are examples of men who put personal gain before social gain and whose ambition became perverted. Shakespeare's play \"Macbeth\" illustrates this point. Many great men have aided their own destruction by refusing to recognize the legitimate limits of ambition. The first lapse of mankind became possible when ambition entered Eve's breast. Like the first fall of mankind, ambition is double-edged; if on the one hand it is the beginning of a world of knowledge and experience, on the other, it brings suffering and death. Ambition, as Alexander Pope wrote.... \"first sprung from your bless'd abode; the glorious fault of angels and of gods\"."

        "content": "I feel that today it is no longer real merit which helps one in landing a good job: rather it is the grade one has secured in an examination. Not only the degrees have multiplied over the years. but the possible areas of specialization have also increased. A look at the dailies is an educative experience. The various openings are for men and women who have successfully gained a large number of qualifications. It is imperative for one to have had a consistently bright academic record. A prospective candidate feels he has lost the chance even before having been fairly tried because the paper qualifications stand between him and the final interview.\nIt is easy enough to guess the way the employers think. They feel that anyone who has had the courage and determination to slog for long hours has proved his capacity for hard work. In the process, they assume, he has also proved his sense of responsibility and reliability. Thus the candidate's seriousness of purpose stands him in good stead.\n\nBut would it not be worthwhile to examine the other side of the case? The person who has slogged hard has perhaps lost all his initiative and has not allowed his imagination scope to develop. In order to be a good examinee one may have to wear blinkers, give up all extra-curricular and time- consuming activities and thus develop a lopsided personality. The qualities required for a good examinee do not always go to make a good administrator or officer or technician.\n\nFirms, employment agencies and prospective employers who attach a great deal of importance to examination results are mistaken in their assessment of the examination system. A written examination is by no means a foolproof test of a person's intelligence. The syllabus seldom changes and in certain cases the questions tend to follow a set pattern. The examination system, besides being subject to many vagaries, leads to memorizing by students. On the other hand, a candidate who may not have fared well where marks and percentage are concerned, may have a fully developed, rich personality. Instead of selecting a few important topics he might have worked hard over the whole syllabus: instead of memorizing, he might have understood and grasped the course. What is more important is his involvement in extra-curricular activities which would have been more sincere and genuine.\n\nThe main purpose of education is to teach one how to think, how to act, to develop one's initiative and to be able to take decisions. In fact, education equips us for facing life, for solving and braving the problems which may confront us from day to day. To link education solely to the examination grades is to distort its meaning, to falsify its essence, and to prove our own inadequacy in such matters.\n\nMany businessmen with great acumen have had no formal training in the trade they pursue, many able administrators may not have had much success in examinations. School dropouts and delinquents have often risen to meet a challenge much more strongly than successful examinees. In many a village in the East it is still possible to come across old men and women who store the wisdom of the ages. In today's world the educational system need not necessarily inculcate sound moral values, and examinations are in no way a real test of brilliance. If I were to choose people it would not bother me how well they have performed in the various examinations, but my concern would he to discover how much they know of their subject and how quick and alert they are in their responses and the way they react to a problem. Thus the interview should he the proper base for selection and not the grading in the examination though it has to he conceded that the minimum grade should have been obtained."

        "content": "It is an undeniable fact that the growth of materialism has surpassed all known limits and the present century is the age of greed. Just as there were previous periods which were known for different characteristics, like the stone age, the bronze age and also the age of faith, the age of reason and enlightenment, our century is the age of greed. The source for this, perhaps, is the growing industrialization and urbanization. Rural society is in many ways conducive to close personal relations while urban society is not. People in over-crowded cities are more than ever-conscious of keeping up with the Joneses whether they do it on bank loans or hire- purchase systems. Every one seems to be caught in the rat-race. In today's world, heart attacks, psychological problems and the increased number of people who are victims of high tension are a standing testimony to our greed.\nOften one wonders why this has happened. There is a strong nostalgia for the peace and leisure of the bygone ages; but man feels helpless in the present set up. It is difficult to he a loner when so much importance is attached to the rank and status which money brings. How did it all come about'? I suspect that the growth of individualism which has on the one hand led to freedom and personal development, on the other, has led to an increased concern with the self and personal glory. Another reason which has contributed to this sense of greed is the increased mechanization of the age. With better and still better gadgets available, men long to possess them and are led to work for these. One major factor has also been the political history of the present century. The two World Wars demonstrated the fragility of human existence. In fact the Second World War, with the use of the atom bomb, brought a finality to it. Ever since then, men have been constantly living under the shadow of a nuclear war. The glaring lack of spirituality and the large- scale displacement of religious faith have also led to this growth of greed. We are a generation condemned to our fat with nothing to look forward to.\n\nThis greed is by no means a by-product of the affluence of the developed nations and it has made its presence felt in the developing countries. In fact, it would not be wrong to say that corruption seems to have infiltrated all sides of life in the developing countries. Patriotism, national interest - all seem to have been pushed into the background. Armaments, airplanes and other similar products are also ordered because of the money which is exchanged and not because of their mechanical soundness. Expediency has become a byword in political life. A code of conduct is entirely absent from public life. The motto seems to he \"Each one for himself and no one for others\".\n\nThe twentieth century has been labeled in various ways - the age of affluence, the age of illusion, the age of atrocity. The age of greed is perhaps as good a label as any other."

        "content": "Men and women have similar faculties and capacities. The difference of sex may asset itself in family relationship, but there is no reason at all for it to assert itself in emotional, cultural, political or commercial matters. The very idea of restricting women to work connected with the home is motivated by a desire to bring increased freedom to the male population. It has its roots in the perpetual clash between liberty and equality. Men have enjoyed freedom over the ages simply because women were denied it. The Greek city states did not bestow any rights on women or on slaves. In both Eastern and Western societies, for centuries, the belief that woman's place is in the home has been perpetuated. The myth of the fair sex or the weaker sex has proved a convenient peg on which to hang all kinds of inequality. Women had no independence or rights. In certain countries daughters could not inherit the property of their fathers, only male heirs were in direct line of succession and widows who had no sons had no right on ancestral property.\nThere have been a few cases of brave women who have struggled for their rights; but a full-fledged movement only began towards the close of the nineteenth century. It is only now, after years of struggle, that women in some parts of the world have left the confines of the house. They are coming forward to participate in the task of bread-winning and even in the defence of the country. There are woman scientists, administrators, executives, engineers, doctors, lawyers, judges and politicians. Though their numbers are still limited, their work has won them recognition. They now join the police not only as constables but also as officers. Even postal services employ women.\n\nThere are patches of matriarchal families in some societies and it is true that the greatest equality is enjoyed in those societies where the matriarchal system has prevailed. There is no possible reason for denying women these possible avenues of development. They have proven their merit and worth in almost all spheres of work. It is true that long working hours may interfere with their house-keeping and rearing of children; but advanced societies have begun to cater to this requirement. Many women give up their jobs for a few years to attend to these important functions. When the children are a little older, they come back to work With increased facilities and better gadgets at their disposal, housework has become less time-consuming than before.\n\nParticipation in the business of life is very important if we are to have a better society, a healthy home and men and women who are not frustrated and discontented. It would be an attempt to put the clock back if we were to differentiate between the sexes. It is impossible to make non-persons out of persons. In some ways women are even better workers than men. We have no right to discriminate against women."

        "content": "Boarding schools: What would be one's spontaneous response to this term? I am sure it is a mixed response for there are both advantages and disadvantages. The first response of the young child is of being on his own, on the threshold of an adventure. If he is familiar with D'Arcy and Billy Bunter and with the novels of Enid Blyton, he can well imagine hostel life to be a glorious picnic. But once he goes to school, he realizes that boarding houses do not only mean midnight get-togethers but a great deal more in terms of discipline.\nIn fact, boarding schools do have a lot of advantages. The boarder can avail himself of all the facilities which a day student cannot. Teaching hours can be adjusted to give the child sufficient time for games. Children of the same age group are together. Hours have to be observed for meals and various other activities. The students learn both self-reliance and independence and become capable of looking after themselves. Often they may have to take decisions and make choices and these help them mature earlier than they may have done at home.\n\nThere is nothing in this world which is an unmixed blessing. Boarding schools have many disadvantages. At a tender age children are denied family care and affection and are deprived of maternal care. Often when they have to decide things for themselves, they may feel lost and unhappy. Boys are grouped together into dormitories and are thus unable to have any privacy or freedom. Many teachers and housemasters are harsh and strict and not understanding. More than all there is the attitude of the parents. Many parents think of boarding schools not as institutions of education but as corrective institutions. When they feel that their child has become wayward and does not devote sufficient time to studies or does not obey them, they think of a boarding school.\n\nMany of the children who are sent there may be children who have failed to respond to the love and care of their parents or are children whose parents have failed to give them love and care. If hoarding schools are used as a threat, then children cannot he expected to like them. There was a whole generation in England which rebelled against public schools. They felt that there was a great lack of freedom and an excessive uniformity in thought. But times have changed. Many principals of modern schools try to understand the psychological problems of their wards and have a flexible approach towards the methods of enforcing discipline. If the family atmosphere is sound and healthy, then boarding schools are good; but, if something is basically wrong with the family background. then no school can help the child. Home is the first school and the best one.\n\nOften it becomes necessary to send children to hoarding schools. This happens when there are no proper facilities in a nearby school or the parents are being frequently transferred or have to go abroad. If the child has the basic security and he feels that he is wanted, nothing will go wrong. Every child should spend at least a year or two in a boarding school; otherwise he lives in a cloistered world and his education is incomplete. By living with people who do not belong to his family circle, he learns to adjust, to become less selfish and to become more considerate."

        "content": "Man leads a complex life. He works to support himself and his family. During his non-working hours, he rests and spends the time with his family and friends, or with his hobbies. People look forward to weekends and holidays. 1 have also heard people say that if they were rich or if they win the lottery, they would not work anomer. It may seem as if we do not enjoy our work, we only want leisure time.\nI do not agree with this. Many people may feel that they want only leisure, but if they really get their wish, I do not think they will enjoy it for very long. There is an old saying \"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\". I think, in a similar way, we can say that \"All play and no work makes Jack a bored boy.\" It is important for us to have balance in our lives. Work makes us feel that we are doing something worthwhile with ourselves, while our leisure enables us to have time to relax. Recently, I read a story about a man in the United States who became a millionaire after winning the lottery. He left his job and enjoyed his leisure which included his hobby of fishing for a couple of years. Then he went back to work. He told the reporter, \"You can fish only for so long.\n\nWork makes us independent. We are able to support ourselves. I think work is also good for our self-esteem. Everyone needs to find out where his interest and talents lie. Work also makes us strive hard, and our ancestors have always stressed that diligence is a virtue. People also enjoy work because it makes them feel that they are using their time constructively. Many wealthy people who do not have to work for a living still work for these reasons. Many people also enjoy work because it gives them an opportunity to get to know and meet other people. One of my uncles, a school teacher, chose to retire early. But after two years, he decided to go back to work. He missed the interaction with his colleagues and students.\n\nOf course, we cannot spend all our hours working, so leisure is equally important to us. During our leisure hours, we are free to make our own choices whether to pursue hobbies or to spend time with people whose company we enjoy. We can choose to pursue a lively activity or just choose to late around reading or listening to music. Also, unlike the office or workplace, we do not have to face people whom we do not get along with. I think this freedom makes some of us feel that we enjoy only our leisure, and not our work. Leisure breaks the monotony of the working week, and because we have fewer non-working days than days of work, we cherish our leisure more.\n\nI think people need both the discipline of work and the freedom of leisure. It is quite natural to feel that we only enjoy our leisure because during our free time, we are our own boss. But I think if each of us suddenly becomes rich and we are given a choice between \"all leisure\" or \"work and leisure\", we would choose to enjoy the joys of both work and leisure."

In Asia, the most popular one is football or soccer, and in America, American football and baseball are the most popular ones. Tennis and basketball are sports that have worldwide appeal. Fans are willing to pay a lot of money to see high quality sports. Thus, there has developed in the most popular sports a group of athletes known as professional sportsmen. They are paid for playing in a team. Their payments are not paltry sums.\nProfessional sports is very big business, and these sportsmen can demand very high salaries depending on how good and how popular they are. The best professional sportsmen in the United States are reported to be paid salaries that run into millions of dollars. There has been criticism that professional sportsmen are more interested in making money than playing the game. I do not agree with this criticism because of the very nature of their job. which is playing in a sporting team. These sportsmen. to become professional, have to be the best talent available. Sports is a game where you cannot fake your ability. You must have natural talent, and normally people who are highly talented in their field love what they are doing. A sportsman has to have passion and drive for his sports, or else his lack of enthusiasm will show in his performance.\n\nBesides, professional sports is a very public game. When the sportsman does not perform well, his failure is seen by thousands, even millions of stadium and television viewers as in the case of American football and basketball in the United States. Everyone from the man in the street to the newspaper sports writer will discuss his poor performance. Thus every time a professional sportsman does not show interest in playing the game, his career is jeopardized.\n\nWe must also remember that professional sportsmen have a short career as it is based on his physical strength and agility. A sportsman hits his prime in his 20's, and by the time he is about 35 years old, his career is over. While in their prime, many of them try to make as much money as they can. Some make additional money by appearing in advertisements or promoting merchandise bearing their names. I do not think there is anything wrong with this. After all, their popularity and ability to make money this way depend on their reputation as a sportsman. If they do not perform well in the game. it will erode their popularity and affect the sale of those products.\n\nDue to the demand for their talent, professional sportsmen are highly paid. But the money they make is tightly linked to their ability to play the game. They cannot afford to be more interested in making money than in playing the game. If they slip in their performance as professional sportsmen, their career will soon be over."

But for our generation, I notice, two or even one child seems to be the norm. An only child often gets more attention from his parents. As there is no other sibling to compete for his parents' attention, it is easy for an only child to get his way. My neighbor Cecilia is an only child. Since she was young, she has always been the first one to own the latest toy and gadget. Now that she is a teenager, Cecilia is always dressed in the latest fashion.\nThe only child often has no one to play with. As a result, he is more resourceful in keeping himself entertained. He is usually good at an activity that he can indulge in without a companion such as creative writing, reading and painting. An only child also tends to mature faster because he is always surrounded by adults. I think the greatest disadvantage of being an only child is that he does not have any brother or sister to play with.\n\nAs children, my sister and I were always playing together. We would play all kinds of games. When we grew up, we exchange news about clothes and friends, and confide in each other. Of course, we often quarrel and bicker with each other. But our sibling bond is special. The only child has the disadvantage of not knowing this relationship. It must also be lonely at times not to have a companion of his generation in the family.\n\nAs the only child often gets his way, he does not have the opportunity to learn to share. A child with siblings inevitably has to learn to share food, toys and even his parents' affection. This can be annoying in childhood, but it will help him get along with people as he grows older. On the other hand, an only child who does not receive parental guidance will take it for granted that his needs and wants will always come first. That is why some people who grow up as only children have trouble sharing things in school. As they grow up, they will also face the same problem in situations which require teamwork.\n\nAn only child may also face unreasonable expectations from his parents. They may focus all their dreams on the child, and assume that he would fulfill them. I am sure that there are times when an only child wishes that he has brothers and sisters. Perhaps it would help him to know that there are times when some of us who have siblings envy the privileges and attention enjoyed by an only child."

        "content": "Every person. at some point of his life, will encounter problems. I agree that young people have more problems than adults, especially in today's world where things are changing quickly.\nCertainly, adults have their own share of problems. I have known of adults who face financial difficulties, particularly if they have a family to support. Some also have health problems, and there are others who worry about finding a life partner or trouble with their marriage.\n\nYoung people have their own problems. Our problems are harder to solve because there are often no clear-cut solutions to them. One of the areas that can trouble young people is the search for identity. This is an inevitable problem in a teenager's life. He is no longer a child, yet not quite an adult. Some younger people who have been pampered and sheltered during their childhood years find it hard to become more independent. I know some students who come from such backgrounds and they have trouble adjusting to teenage life. They still expect things to be handed to them. Sometimes their parents make decisions for them.\n\nOn the other hand, there are those who want to be 'instant' adults. To show that they are grown up, they feel that they have to smoke and keep late hours. As a result, they miss out on normal teenage activities like sports and other extra-curricular activities which they will never expe rience again. Some young people also rebel against conventional ideas to assert their identity. It is typical to show their rebellion in their choices of clothes and music. But those who have weak family ties may run away from home. or be caught up in bad company.\n\nYoung people also become more aware of their looks and the opposite sex at this stage. Among some of them, there is a tendency to judge people by their looks. I have heard boys and even girls disparage a girl for her plain looks. This attitude can make the less attractive girl self-conscious and unsure of herself.\n\nDuring the teenage years, young people begin to show an interest in dating. There is so much pressure from the popular media which constantly features stories and songs about couples and romance. Some students realize that dating will interfere with their studies, but they may feel like 'nerds' if they do not date. Young people who date often cannot handle the pressures of the relationship as well as their studies. As a result, they suffer failure in both. Nowadays, young people face a lot of pressure to do well in their studies. For most of us, we know that academic success is good for us, but at times we do feel the stress. No one wants to disappoint his parents.\n\nIn many ways, it is wonderful to be young. There are so many things to learn, and the whole world to explore. But I think we have more problem to resolve than adults have. I suppose overcoming these problems will lead us on the path towards adulthood."

        "content": "During the month preceding the examination. I was haunted by the fear of falling ill while the examination was on. I was able to banish such fears and concentrate on my studies, but this fear crept into by subconscious mind and it played havoc on me. I now have the consolation that it was I a dream and that the dream has not come true.\nOn the evening of October 20th, my birthday, a few friends of mine and I spent some time eating and exchanging banter. When they left, the thought of having squandered precious time nagged me. I attempted to study; but the irremediable habit of procrastination gets the better of me. I literally idled away my time and when dusk fell I cheated myself with the thought that I would wake up early in the morning and make up for lost time. While all except my father were agog sitting before television and forecasting the results of a football program to be telecast live, I went upstairs to sleep. While in bed, sleep seemed to elude me and the bug of falling ill during the examination began to harass me. I counted from fifty to ten backwards and I was soon asleep.\n\nIf Alice's experiences in the Wonderland of her dream were bizarre; mine were shocking. To my subconscious mind the bogey of illness during the examination was true.\n\nI felt a sudden irritation in both my poor eyes and what started as an irritation became a pain. I called my mother (and I am glad I really did not disturb their rendezvous in the lounge) who rushed to me. She called for my father, but he was away at a party. It was nine at night. My mother consoled me, but she could do nothing to ease my pain. I felt that I would not be able to sit for the major examination in English Language (and that both papers, and Mathematics in the afternoon!). I now became mentally agitated, and whether the pain or the fear made me suffer more I cannot tell now.\n\nMy father returned and he was in high spirits. He little realized that there was one of those problems awaiting him. He came to me. I was standing facing the wall. He seemed to have experienced my agony, and, without a word, he carried me downstairs, put me in his car and sped to a private hospital. On the way he indirectly asked me to forget about the examination the next day. I explained to him that I felt as though there were needles and pins stuck in my eyes. On arrival at the hospital I was promptly wheeled into the Emergency Room. The doctor thought he was right with his diagnosis - nervousness due to examination. He pronounced that for me the examination had ended and that he would issue a certificate the next day to be presented to the authorities.\n\nMy father was undaunted by this pronouncement. In a few minutes we reached another doctor. He sounded young and pleasant. My father's explanation was quick. The doctor needed no explanation. He had diagnosed at sight, and correctly! Before he applied his scientific formula on my eyes he said that I would open my eyes in two minutes. But I could do so in less than a minute! Tears welled in my poor injured eyes and I strained my eyes to see this kind specialist, and my father. There was none. All I saw was the clock on the wall opposite me ticking away. The din in the lounge had subsided. I was overcome with happiness. I am happy that it was all a dream - or was it a nightmare?"

        "content": "I would not have thought of relating this incident had it not been for its chastening influence on me. My brother and sister refer to it as the lucky incident for it, in their opinion, has endeared me more to my father. But now as I recall it after a lapse of six months, I feel I should not have been disobedient and I should have saved embarrassment and displeasure to all concerned.\nThe afternoon was dull and sultry. I was annoyed by my father's rather deep-toned voice which when raised would mean that he is caught in a had mood. I ignored it at first but for about three full minutes it continued to assault my ears. My little brother's short answers in subdued voice made it clear to me that my father was again at, what he calls, his fatherly responsibility of guiding and advising. For a moment I thought that the language of advice should be pleasant and shouting could only mean anger and that all my brother did was to give an evasive answer to his question where his pen was. I was indeed impulsive and irrational when I gave vent to my annoyance, first, by banging on the piano and then slamming the kitchen door. In fact. I should have minded my business and should not have demonstrated my anger.\n\nMy double banging had awakened my mother who was rather indifferent about all that happened and I thought I had caused, with impunity, ample irritation to my already irritated father. But I was sorely mistaken; it was only the beginning of the trouble. By little brother came down to me to deliver my father's oral command to go upstairs immediately and account for my erratic demonstration of anger. Was I summoned to any royal presence was my immediate response. I was quick to run upstairs ready to face the music and if necessary turn the situation to my favor and cause discomfiture to my father. He seemed to ignore my prompt arrival and readiness to enter into a verbal battle: he was rapt in thought. Then, he suddenly turned to me and asked me why I banged. I cannot remember what I said in reply. Possibly he ignored my reply and asked me to write down my reason. The battle for which I thought I was prepared took a different turn:\n\nI: Why should I have to write?\n\nFather: To be fair to you and to provide you the chance to compose your mind and think correctly.\n\nI: I am composed and I can give you the reason in a minute.\n\nFather: Do so then.\n\nI scribbled something to the tune that when one is angry one is entitled to give expression to one's anger. But I thought my father was exacting when he asked if it was not an irrational show of anger. I was blatantly rude to claim my right to express my anger and when pressed for a cogent and logical answer, I made a hurried exit from the room, to the great chagrin of my father. My father conferred with my mother who informed me very shortly that I must apologize for my rudeness. The matter had become serious and I continued to believe that I was right and that an apology from me was totally unwarranted .\n\nTwo days elapsed and I was often reminded by my mother of the responsibility to apologize and admit the mistake. I consulted my bosom friends, John and Eric and both were emphatic in denouncing my disobedience. I was convinced of my error and the need to be realistic. The only thing that prevented me from shouting out the apology was the little vanity in me. I summoned up sufficient courage, dispelled a hit of my ego and apologized.\n\nToday I wonder if it was my immaturity or pride that made me drag the matter. My father has taken it as something not unnatural to a boy growing up and I feel I must subscribe to his view. Perhaps, in future. I would succeed in preventing my emotions from getting the better of my reason. I feel I was to blame."

Again and again I thought of ancient times and myths and Biblical stories about floods. It seemed we were all to be wiped out of existence. Everyone said it had not been like this for many many years, some said thirty one, others said thirty seven. The rain continued unabated. The rivers were heavily swollen by now. All of them Barito. Mendawai and Kutai overflowed their banks. Thousands of people were rendered homeless and still there was no likelihood of the deluge coming to an end.\nThe first reaction to the rain was a wild one. Everyone hoped it would soon end. After all this was a heavy rainfall area and it did rain, so, what was there to worry about? But there were no intermittent flecks of sun and the heavy downpour resembled nothing that we had ever seen. Was this a punishment for some lapses, some sins, some failures? Prayers were of no avail: the rain continued. By the fifth day it was terrible. Life was very difficult. Everything was badly dislocated. No movement was possible except in boats. The whole town had become like so many houseboats. The ground floor of every house had become uninhabitable. People clustered together in safer places. in higher buildings. Earlier there were attempts to salvage something but soon the attempts were abandoned and people scrambled for dear life. The normalcy of life became a long forgotten thing. No milk, no regular meals, no vegetables and no communication with the outside world. No telephone links. no arrival of newspapers! Nothing at all. One only had one's own tiny self and that was all.\n\nThere was reason for concern for by now dead animals floated in the streets and there was no uncontaminated drinking water. A few houses also collapsed resulting in loss of life. Food was air dropped on one or two occasions but the continued bad whether hindered this aid also. Poorer people who had to depend on their daily earnings were starving. They had no food and no shelter and no other means of sustenance. The flood was like a scourge of the gods.\n\nThe heavily laden skies seemed to have shed a great deal of their burden and by the seventh day the sky appeared a little lighter. Gradually it began clearing up, people heaved sighs of relief. The rain stopped and the level of the water started receding. It became possible for rescue teams to arrive and to be organized. It also became possible for food parcels to be air dropped. People were collected from very odd places. hovering between life and death, sitting in limited space, sometimes on treetops, and not getting any nourishment, their limbs were cramped and their bodies emaciated.\n\nThere was every possibility that there would be an epidemic of cholera. The authorities asked for volunteer medical teams. the Red Cross Society also organized rescue teams and some arrived from neighboring areas. Inoculations were given. Other help was also rendered. But the epidemic did break out and many people died. It was soon checked and that itself was an achievement.\n\nAs most calamities come and recede, so did this. The town slowly crawled back to normalcy. Many lives had been lost and also a great amount of property. It took time to repair the damages done to the machines and to get vehicles on the road and to repair telecommunications but human effort is capable of doing anything and it proved resilient enough to recover from the disaster."

For months it would rain. Ching-Yan, the old man living in the small house in the small field next to us had often told me of times when people from neighboring countries had come to us because they had had no rains and their fields were dry and their cattle dead. But we had thick, lush growth and fertile soil. We often had to wade through ankle-deep water and now and then through knee-deep water. We were all used to it. still if the downpour became very heavy, schools would close and some people in low-lying areas would take out their dinghies. So life continued.\nThis year something had gone wrong somewhere. The sky persisted in continuing to be clear and blue; and the river continued to shrink until it was difficult to imagine that the thin trickle had once been a river. First people had merely waited, then anxiously scanned the skies, then prayers were said. The paddy fields were empty and barren and appeared as a stretch of parched land. The trees had an autumnal look and the plantation shrubs were mere stubs. Day after day this continued. Prices which had been gradually rising, now reached new heights. Electricity cuts were introduced and drinking water was being doled out. Then the authorities arranged for wells to be dug. This provided some relief but we were all so unused to the excessive summer heat and the accompanying drought that we were miserable.\n\nPeople started leaving their homes. Life lost all its normalcy. Fresh vegetables were not available at all. It seemed that the land would never be green again and the fields would never sprout. We were without rain, the greenery, the freshness of life and the ordinary necessities of life. Schools closed down, and medical units shifted in. The unprecedented drought had also its victims. We no longer recognized our surroundings; we were strangers to our friends and neighbors. Water became the most valuable commodity and - a bath or a clean change became rare. I shall always remember those dreary dry months when we always hoped for a miracle. Only the miracle simply didn't take place. People came forth with all kinds of explanations and superstitious beliefs and primitive cures. Meteorological experts were bewildered by the way their forecasts were proven wrong. It was a living nightmare. It was as if we all had stopped living. Then all of a sudden the clouds gathered and the blessed rain descended on us."

And I have got a job I'd like to do ! You know that I've been on the look-out for a good job now that my studies are over.\n\nLet me tell you the whole thing. You'd be busy guessing and cursing me for talking riddles. Remember my aunt in Sarawak! I have spent my holidays with her a number of times. She has no children of her own and now when I have finished studies, she has written to my father whether I would like to manage one of their rubber plantations and work towards the ownership. My uncle has expressed his desire that I be as their chosen heir.\n\nThis arrangement is the best possible that could have been made. It is in keeping with my self-respect and I've a fair chance of proving myself worthy of the trust they have placed in me. Had they informed me of their intentions earlier, I might have grown up to expect too much and might not have made the necessary effort towards equipping myself for a good job. I wonder if I can rise to the occasion. But being with them, I'll be able to learn like any other employee and will be able to work upwards on my own.\n\nAs you know, Rahim has already got a good job in the petroleum refinery. So with my elder brother settled, my father's concern was for me. Do you remember the way I used to dream about working on plantations ? I have always longed to have that kind of life but with Dad being an industrialist, there was little possibility, of my ever owning one. This offer is like a dream come true.\n\nI must say I admire the wisdom of my aunt. She has provided me both an incentive and a sense of security. I have to prove myself and yet at the back of my mind I know that I'm striving for my own benefit. She is my father's youngest sister and I have inherited a great deal from her.\n\nDon't you think I'm lucky ? I'm indeed very happy and pleased at the prospect and must offer my thanks giving to the powers above. What about you ? You have been quiet this last month. Do write and let me know what progress you've made in selecting a career.\n\nWhile writing to you, an idea has just occurred to me. Would you like to come with me to the plantation? If you would. I can write to my aunt and find out. I'm sure she'll have no objection. You can give it a try. If you don't care for the nature of the job or for the surrounding, you'd he free to leave. It would be a nice experience. I find the idea very attractive, perhaps because I'll have you by my side. Do think it over and let me know. I'm planning to leave by the first week of February. There is ample time for you to make your plans and preparations.\n\nThe other day I met one of our former teachers, Mr. Tan. He is retiring this year. And as we have had a long association with him, don't you think we all should get together and give him a small reception ?\n\nI am still so thrilled at the idea of becoming independent, of taking up my first job. Its like meeting a challenge. I find it so hard to concentrate on other things! Once I get used to the idea, I should be in a more practical frame of mind. I shall be looking forward to your letter. and if possible a visit.\n\nAll the best and see you soon.\n\nYours sincerely"

        "content": "We had looked forward to the weekend outing for quite sometime. All of us had been very busy these last two months. We had been busy with our examinations and Dad had lots of government inspectors and various trade delegations visiting his factory. Mum as usual, poor thing. had been caught between entertaining and household chores. So we had all decided that it was time we had a break and planned a weekend on the beach. There was a small Rest House where we intended to stay the night.\nSaturday came and we were up long before the sun. Dad took out the car from the garage and we boys started loading our stuff. Swimming trunks and towels, baskets of food, an ice-box duly stuffed with fruit and drinks - all these and our overnight cases found their way into the car. My brother was keen to take his air gun, but I was not inclined. I looked forward to a day in the sun and to an occasional swim in the sea. I also carried a book or two for those leisure moments.\n\nWe were used to similar outings but this one was extra special as it was after a very busy period and we felt we had deserved it and moreover it would be a lovely experience to have out parents relax and be at our beck and call. So we excitedly prepared for it. But just as we were about to start, the phone rang and Dad rushed upstairs to attend to it. It was a call from one of his senior colleagues asking him to attend an important meeting that morning. We held our breath. Would the outing be cancelled? Frustration and irritation were beginning to work on us. But no, he persuaded his colleague to manage without him and we left for the beach.\n\nWe drove and soon reached the open countryside with trees by the roadside and open areas of land. The sea ran all along the road. Suddenly the car swerved to the right and we had to stop. Before we alighted from the car we knew it was a puncture. The sun was already fairly high now and the delay was most unwelcome but it couldn't be helped. We got down and busied ourselves. When we resumed the journey a few minutes later, we had all begun to show signs of the strain. It wasn't as if we felt free or that we had enough leisure. We felt that we were struggling to get some time for ourselves and this spoilt halt the fun.\n\nAt last we were there, our cases in the Rest House and we in our swimming trunks. Mum relaxed with a book and we were enjoying the struggle against the waves. At times their impact was subdued; at other times they came with a great deal of force and carried us before them. We would dive to protect ourselves from their impact. It was great fun! We were soon tired and joined our parents and sat down on the grass mat. We opened the baskets and satisfied our ravenous appetites and disappeared again after lunch.\n\nThis time we decided to join the local fishermen and asked them to take us out to the sea. It was a risky job for we were not at all used to their boats and fell out of them a number of times. Though we were fairly good swimmers, the sea, with all its unending vastness, is a frightening prospect. It took us quite sometime to get used to their unsteady movement, but were thrilled when we helped them haul in a good catch.\n\nThis pleasure was however short-lived. My brother fell out and lost his nerve and he blindly hit out' towards the nearest object. Before I could count to two, he hit his head hard against the boat. I didn't even see what happened next. I was myself of panic stricken. All I could see was blood Rowing out of the wound just above his right eye. I cried for help. The fishermen put him in the boat and took us to the shore. We joined our parents, I supporting my brother all the way. By this time his face had a bluish, swollen look. My mother luckily had some antiseptic cream and with a handkerchief she dabbed the wound clean. They didn't say a word to scold us and I admire my mother who didn't lose her nerves. But the stay had to he cut short. There was a big gash and his eye seemed to hurt him, so we drove back - subdued foursome - and went straight to the hospital. My brother had to be admitted and the gash required stitches. He was given some injections also. We felt awful and were very quiet and disappointed and worried. What an outing! It was more like a nightmare."

        "content": "One remembers Charles Dicken's \"A Tale of Two Cities\" for various reasons - for the characters, for the description of the French Revolution but above these for the escape of Evremonde. Charles Evremonde, the son of an aristocrat escapes from the guillotine for three reasons and none of them of his own making. He reaches the guillotine also because of reasons not of his own making. His escape is an escape from death and from the chaos and revenge prevalent in revolutionary France. The man who helps him to escape is not even a fellow countryman and he has no love for Charles Evremonde himself. He is an Englishman, Sydney Carton, the idlest and most unpromising of men, a man who has willingly accepted a back seat in life.\nWhat leads him to help Charles Evremonde and why ? Is Charles Evremonde guilty or innocent. when he is sentenced to the guillotine ? To what extent is his escape successful ? Evremonde is first put into the prison of La France when he enters France in answer to the plea of a fellow countryman. He comes under the name of Charles Darney. When he is proven innocent and released that very afternoon he is denounced by Madame Defarge as being the son of aristocratic parents and is consequently put back into prison to be marched to the guillotine within twenty-four hours. Therefore he is an innocent person marching to his death simply because of reasons which he could not have helped.\n\nWhen reason fails to prevail, it is obvious that the only way lies in escape. But Evremonde cannot even think of it in a time like that. It is Sydney Carton who comes to his help and arranges everything. He resembles Evremonde; people have in the past mistaken him for the Frenchman. He offers himself as a substitute because he loves Evremonde's wife Lucie Manette and would see her happy. Once he had proposed marriage to her but she had refused. He had then promised her that he would do anything for her and those dear to her. He tells her to remember that there \"is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!\" He keeps his word when such an occasion arises. The escape is successful because he doesn't simply take away Charles Evremonde but substitutes himself for him to walk to the guillotine.\nHe comes to the prison obviously to bid him goodbye, in an obvious state of semi-collapse. There he asks Charles Evremonde to change places with him but when Evremonde is reluctant to accept such a big sacrifice, he cleverly asks him to sit down and write a letter and by using some kind of ether he renders him unconscious. Then he sends him out of the prison. The gaolers think that he has been overcome by this last meeting with his friend.\n\nCarton had already arranged with Jarvis Lorry to escort the family to England and had handed over his papers to him. Charles Evremonde, still in his unconscious state, travels under the identify of \"Sydney Carton Advocate, English\". He is thus safely out of France.\n\nThe real Sydney Carton walks to the guillotine with his hand in the hand of an unknown seamstress. comforting her and consoling her. She had known Evremonde and is thus able to know that he is someone else. He has the supreme satisfaction of doing something that would bring happiness to others and he knows that Lucie and her family will always remember him. Evremonde's escape is thus arranged for him. Had he consciously accepted such a big sacrifice, guilt would have gnawed at him; but he is pushed into it. This escape does not have the heroic quality of an adventure. It is something far more valuable. It is the heroic quality of inner strength and of spiritual courage."

I was alone with myself. It was difficult to listen to the advice being given to me and difficult indeed to keep on replying to the warm, friendly words. Inside me there was a hard knot and a feeling of being left out in the cold. I had signed the immigration papers and had decided to go to Canada leaving behind me the land of my forefathers. Of course there were many of our relatives who had settled in Canada, people who had lived there for two generations or more; yet I hardly knew them. They had made a few trips home in order to see the developments in their country of origin or to meet old relatives.\nLooking out at the dark runway with the line of lights confining it to its proper place, I thought of my future. Was it going to be like this runway ? Would there he limits and barriers and notices indicating to me \"Keep off\" ? I was lost and bewildered. Where was the enthusiasm I had felt when I had set the whole process rolling? What had come over me ? I marveled at my own timidity. Would I he able to make friends, belong to group, be a person in my own right or would I he alienated ?\n\nI remembered the vast open areas of our countryside, the village children playing about lustily. I remembered the time when I was one of them, roaming about half-clad. careless of the breeze and the rain. The village school was more of a playhouse for us where we used to get together. Then we shifted. My mother and I moved to the city where my father was working as an Assistant Manager in a firm. The city was more suited to my growing educational needs. Life was dusty, uncomfortably crowded but very enjoyable and the years at school passed surprisingly fast. Now I stood on the threshold of a career. My parents had used up all their saving in trying to set me up and now it was my turn to help them. Moreover. Canada had seemed so colorful and attractive a few months ago. It seemed to be the beginning of a new life, a window on a new world. So I had decided to go.\n\nBut now it all seemed so final. I could just feel my mother touching me and my younger sister clamoring for my attention. I would miss them more than I had bargained for. Would I he able to make a trip home soon ? The future was so uncertain.\n\nI would be a stranger there. The process of making friends cannot be hurried; it would take its own time. I left so lonely, like a child lost in an indifferent world. How I longed for my childhood when I could have clung to my mother and held on to my father's hand. I decided to look forward and not backward.\n\nI decided to he the comforter rather than be comforted. I braced myself, stood straight and tall and cheerfully smiled at my sister. I promised I would write soon and visit them at the earliest. I put my arm round my mother and pulled her close to me. I told her, \"Be brave, Mama. All will be fine\". I thought to myself \"What will be will he\". I had the pangs of being free of parental care and I realized the importance of responsibility that is allied to freedom."

Look at you, you have the MRT and you complain if the journey is longer than 40 minutes!\" Brian teased me.\n\nAfter three hours in the boat, we reached our destination. After getting off at the pier, the first building that we saw was the village shop. Actually, it was a small shop crammed with canned and dry food. Brian chatted with the owner and we found out that the shop was also the only place in the village where people buy their stamps and newspapers. However the postal service and the newspaper delivery came only once a week.\n\nHe then showed us the direction to the headman's house. The headman's name was Tok Kassim. When we found his house, he invited us in and told us stories about himself and his village. Then he took us for a tour around the village. Since bicycle was the only form of transport, people walked from place to place.\n\nThe village was very peaceful and green. The river was the focal place of the villagers. We saw people fishing in the river and women washing their clothes there. But what struck me most was the way the children enjoyed it. They swam in it, and they rode in rafts which they put together from bamboo poles. Tok Kassim recounted the time when his father and the other villagers rebelled against British rule. The river was often the battlefront between the two opponents. He talked about the river as though it was an old friend. He explained how it had seen them through the worst of times like the starvation they experienced during the Japanese occupation of Malaya, and how the river has helped them throughout their lives.\n\nThat night we had a wonderful dinner at Tok Kassim's house. Many of the villagers came and brought some food. A neighbor even brought fresh honey still attached to pieces of honeycomb. It was one of the most natural food I have ever tasted.\n\nThe next morning, we left on the boat. During the journey, I thought about how strange the life of this village and the surroundings seemed to me and my friends in Singapore. Despite the simplicity of their lives, they are strong people who could weather bad times. But most of all, while we talk about \"green\" living, these people are quietly practicing it."

My mother and I went to Norway to take care of her. That trip was for me the most memorable experience of the past year.\nLena's husband. John, picked us up at the airport. When we reached their apartment, Lena could hardly wait to greet us. Lena had not been back in Singapore since she left. When we hugged, I realized how much I had missed her. She told us that the baby was sleeping. We walked quietly to the nursery to look at her. They had named her Serena. She looked so fragile and her cute appearance reflected the two ethnic groups that she was horn into. She is the first grandchild for my parents, and my mother could hardly hold back her tears. As. for me, initially I could not believe that there was already a new member of the family - my first niece. But soon. I was already imagining myself taking her to the toy shop, the zoo and the fun fair!\n\nMy mother and I almost took over the house to help Lena recover. We feared that John might consider our efforts an intrusion, but he said that he was glad we were there to help them. My mother and I found our way to the Asian grocery stores to buy herbs and Asian cooking ingredients. Lena had missed local food and was eager to enjoy Mother's cooking again.\n\nIt occurred to me that there were three generations of my family in that apartment in Oslo. I remembered when Lena and I were growing up, she would always' recruit' me to play pranks on or father. She was a tomboy who played softball with the neighborhood boys.\n\nNow she is a mother, raising her own family. I still had difficulty reconciling the two images of Lena. But, fortunately, our closeness had not changed. Lena asked me about school and news of relatives and friends. She still teased me and we shared laughs, like we used to.\n\nThose weeks in Norway also made me understand how hard it was for Lena to start a new life in a different country. She had no friends and family around her, and she had to form new friendships. She also had to learn the language. and adjust to a different kind of weather and culture. I admired Lena for her strength in adjusting to her new environment.\n\nJohn and Lena also took us around for sightseeing. We enjoyed going to the lovely lake and parks. Soon, the three weeks were over, and it was time for us to leave. Lena promised to make a trip home next year. The time spent in Norway made me realize how precious my family is to me. It does not matter that Lena and Serena live thousand of miles away from us. We will always remain together as a family."

Many shuddered but pretended to believe that it was only a storm building up. Why then did we all secretly believe that that night something extraordinary was about to take place ? We, picnickers at an isolated seaside resort in the only hotel (or rather building) for miles around voted for a good night's rest.\nSuddenly, the telephone rang. That assured us that we were not in an all-that-deserted neighborhood and we rushed towards it relieved and even surprised to know that there was a phone. A low, husky voice informed me that one of the members of our party was in serious danger in an old castle five miles away. Then it dawned on me that my little cousin was not with us. Could he have been the one mentioned ? The line went dead. No further questions could be asked.\n\nEveryone was reluctant to leave the hotel, so a search party could not be formed. After much persuasion, I managed to find a young man to accompany me. We set off in an old battered car.\n\nThe moon was not up yet and there were no stars.\n\nEverything was still and the occasional sounds made by unfamiliar creatures frightened us. We were convinced that ghosts were lurking. Yet the thought of my seven-year old cousin all alone in a deserted castle kept us going. Suddenly, a scream was heard. I applied the brakes of the car and it screeched to a halt. Curious to know what had happened, we crept out of the car. There in the middle of the road lay a black cat - dead. Although the car was an old one, its headlights were strong and I felt sure that I had seen no cat around earlier. To make matters worse, it was a black one, symbolizing bad luck. What about the scream we both heard ? That had still to be explained.\nDeciding that it was wrong to dither at a time like that, we resumed our journey, We both knew where the castle was situated but has not been there before. How then could a seven-year-old who had been with us all evening have disappeared to this castle, notorious for the mysterious sounds heard at night? Few dared to visit it during the day !\n\nWe reached the strong iron gates of the castle. At its foot lay a small boy, shivering in the cold - my cousin. I rushed forward to get him; he was unconscious. Wrapping him in blankets, we turned to the car, thankful to have found him live and not to have id to enter the castle in the dark. We reached the hotel with no further mishaps and were greeted by relieved smiles. It was the end of our adventure and it had ended well. We were all happy.\n\nThis baffling mystery remains unsolved. How had my cousin found his way to the castle? Even he was puzzled. Who had telephoned us ? What about the scream we heard ?"

Gerald is a seaman, and he is away from home most of the time. I remember his stories about his voyages around the world, and the many fascinating things which he has seen on his long journeys.\nWhen Gerald's twenty-first birthday drew near, both Mother and Father decided to organize a birthday party. We did not have much to spend but we knew that Gerald would be delighted with whatever we could raise. We also decided to give Gerald surprise and vowed that we would not tell him about the proposed party until the last minute.\n\nGerald walked in and out of the house ignorant of what we were preparing. Rita helped mother bake a cake for Gerald while Kenny cleared the house and arranged furniture. Mother promised to give me some money to add to what I had in my savings box so that I could give Gerald something worthwhile. Rita, however, refused to let us know what she intended to buy.\n\nWhen the big day came, we all persuaded Gerald to go and see a film so that we could surprise him on his return. He was surprised by our unusual insistence but he complied. Perhaps he knew all along that we were planning something for him. All of us dressed up for the occasion and waited downstairs for his arrival. Father estimated that if Gerald came straight home after the cinema, he ought to be home any time then. Sure enough, we heard a knock on the door. Rita ran forward and flung it open and as she did, we all shouted \"Happy Birthday, Gerry\".\n\nTo our great surprise, the man standing at the door was not Gerald but some stranger. He could have been a policeman; he could have been a lost traveler, and he could even have been a robber. He looked embarrassed. He apologized for the intrusion and said he had no idea about our party. He also stated that he was looking for a certain Gerald D'Souza. Father went out to talk and when he was fairly convinced that the stranger was well-meaning, he invited him in. Just when the stranger had seated himself and was about to accept a glass of orange from mother, there was a loud noise at the door. This time we knew that it had to be Gerald. Rita went up to the door, Peered through the letter-window and waved excitedly at us. She flung the door open and we all yelled out, louder than before \"Happy Birthday, Gerald\".\n\nGerald Walked in, beaming broadly and hugged everybody. All of us thrust our gift parcels into his hands. He put them all down on the table and thanked us. Then he walked up to the dining exclaimed at the size of the birthday cake and picked up some tarts. It was then that he noticed the stranger. Gerald was having a difficult time trying to recall where he had met the man before. The stranger, however, smiled and extended his hand. introducing himself as John Snewin, a solicitor from Perth.\n\nThe stranger said he was acting on behalf of a certain James Levin, a miner with his offices in Perth. Some two years ago, Gerald had called at Sydney and had been involved in an incident in which he rescued the same miner from some kidnappers. This miner, as the solicitor Levin disclosed, had died some weeks ago and bequeathed a hundred thousand Australian dollars to Gerald in his will. The solicitor had come all the way to settle Gerald's claim."

Now they expected me to complete the negotiations for collaboration with the refinery in Singapore, so here I was in the plane trying to sort out my plans. I closed my eyes. My temples were throbbing with Pain and my efforts to sleep were in vain. Nevertheless the rest did me good when it was disturbed by the soft pleasant voice of the air hostess. She had brought me a hot cup of coffee.\nI took the cup and murmured my thanks. The young gentleman in the next seat also took his cup. I looked at him and perhaps the approval was there in my appraisal of him.\n\nHe was a pleasant faced young man. almost boyish in his appearance. His voice broke into my thoughts:\n\"Are you not well, sir? Can I do anything for you ?\n\n\"Just a bad headache. I never knew it could he so bad.\n\n\"Have you taken any medicines? Perhaps they may give you some relief from the pain.\"\n\nI explained to him that a problem of this nature was so unusual with me and that I had no medicines with me. At this the young man, - his name I learnt was Michael Swartz - opened his brief case and gave me a pill. He was working with a pharmaceutical firm and therefore medicines were available with him. As the medicine calmed me down, we both chatted in a gentle, friendly way and discussed our personal histories and our professional ambitions. By the time we were preparing to land our relationship was on a well established footing.\n\nMichael offered to look after my luggage and took my brief case from me while we waited for it to arrive. My reservations were made in Hotel Yangtse. It was a pleasant coincidence that Michael was also booked there. So I allowed him to do everything for me: collect my baggage and get it through the customs while I waited comfortably in the lounge.\n\nIn my room in Hotel Yangtse, I decided to have a bath and relax before the conference which was scheduled to be held later that evening. I opened my suitcase. Imagine my horror when right on top of the suitcase I found the name of my new found friend written in block capitals. I quickly looked through the suitcase. Nothing was familiar. The suitcase and my briefcase both had been switched, all my clothes and all my papers. I wondered what to do and then quickly I rang up the reception desk. There was no Mr. Michael Swartz. He had left for Bangkok with my luggage !"

He vaguely recollected being hit by something but after that it was blank. He slightly shifted his head to be able to see the door. The injury hurt him terribly. He could hardly open his eyes. He tried to move his legs. He could hardly feel any sensation. He closed his eyes and wondered what had happened. Somebody was coming for he heard shuffling footsteps beside his door. An attendant entered the room and quietly moved about doing his work. Kung I-Chi opened his eyes with an effort and looked at him expectedly. The attendant came closer and examined him tentatively. He smiled, trying to convey to him that all was well with the world.\n\"How are you feeling now, Sir ? We'll have you up and about in a week's time. The doctor is very hopeful about your case\".\n\n\"May I know what is exactly the matter with me ? I am terribly tired and can hardly move\".\n\n\"You met with an accident. It was a case of hit and run. A truck knocked you down and then disappeared and for hours you must have bled when a passing car picked you up and brought you here. You'll be alright soon. Sir. It is mainly loss of blood and fractures in the legs. At the moment you are still recovering from the after-effect of anaesthesia\".\n\nKung I-Chi looked at him as if still dazed. He was straining his memory to remember why he had gone out of the town. What had taken him away ? Nothing came back to him. The attendant chattered on, \"Not to worry, Sir, your friends have responded quickly to your needs. Mr. Lim has been in constant attendance. He was the first to reach the hospital\".\n\nKung I-Chi closed his eyes. The attendant after filling in some charts left the room leaving I-Chi to his thoughts. Kung I-Chi was lost in past memories. He thought of his friend. Lim Hsiang Lin. He had never appreciated Lin who had been a faithful and devoted friend all these years. He remembered when they were at school. They used to sit side by side. Lin was a better student but very quiet and modest. Many a time Kung I-Chi had received his help and many a time he had wrongly got the credit from the teacher. He remembered that when his father had died Lin had come to him and had helped him sort out the papers. When there had been some problems connected with his land. it was Lin who discussed things with him, sought legal opinion and had stood by him. Kung I-Chi remembered that when he, in his newly gained freedom, had invested heavily in the ore market and had lost, Lin had mortgaged his own property to save him. They were both of the same age, but Lin was sober and was a source of strength whereas he himself was impulsive and hasty.\n\nLying here in the hospital, he realized that all these thirty years of his life he had been like a parasite. He resolved he would change, he would strive towards stability. Lost in this self-assessment he made up his mind to begin anew. Lin would not he the only one to give. Kung I-Chi would reciprocate. Once he was well he would be a different man.\n\nIt took days for him to he himself. When he was well he learnt that he had needed blood and Hsiang Lin had been the one to give it: he had needed money and immediately Lin had provided it. Lin had comforted his wife and children and had been always there a source of strength. He realized that he could never repay Lin for all he had done. He realized that though he was not worthy. he was fortunate enough to have the friendship of Lin."

For a moment I had no control over myself and I felt myself trembling. I had a feeling that my face was drained of all blood. I retreated into the corner, praying and holding my breath and wishing something would distract his progress towards me. For a while, I had the feeling of a fly caught in a huge cobweb and struggling to free itself. All the stories of his strange behavior began to knock at my memory in an unintelligible, clamorous way. I had no time to sort out my emotions or reactions. Suddenly. I found him peering and breathing into my face. With great difficulty I controlled myself from screaming; but not for the life of me could I remove my gaze from his face. His hand came forward to hold my wrist and like a sleep-walker I followed him to the seat where he wanted me to sit. Gradually, I realized that his touch was soft and gentle and contrasted sharply with the look on his face. I looked more intelligently at him; my thoughts began to sort themselves out and I began to return to normal. He was saying something to me. He repeated it and now I could understand. He was asking my name. I mumbled a reply. We sat at a table. He placed an order for some tea and I found myself relaxing.\nThe first day we met he only explained that he had been watching me return from work every day and had wanted to talk to me. So today he had met me on my return journey. But, surprisingly, he didn't ask any questions. Instead, he began to talk of himself. He was a sailor and had traveled a great deal and I listened to his varied experiences.\n\nAfter that we often met in the evenings and often had a cup of tea at the wayside restaurant. He was a man in his late fifties and though he looked grim with all his weather-worn scars, and was a huge hulk of a man, he was always gentle in his behavior towards me. As the days passed, I began to get used to his terrifying looks and feel comfortable in his company. He gradually unfolded his past to me. He had lost his parents at an early age and had grown up without any guidance. He became a deck-hand and soon graduated from one job to another. During one of his shore-visits he fell in love and got married. His wife had been a gentle woman and now he longed for a shore job; but with hardly any qualifications he found it difficult to get a job suited to his age and temperament. Years passed. Their little daughter was growing up into an intelligent teenager. And then tragedy struck ! On return from one of his trips, he learnt that their little shack had been burnt in a fire. His wife and daughter had both been caught in it. Since then he had been in this condition of grief. He had never gone back to sea and had roamed the streets like a mad man, mourning his loss. Many stories had been floated about him. His stern appearance in no way mitigated the effect of those stories.\n\nWhere did I come into his story? I looked very much like his daughter. So our friendship grew and one day I took him home. He followed me like a pet dog and I introduced hint to my mother. Ever since then he has been a constant visitor to our house and the agony in his looks is being replaced by a new warmth and affection."

But what they had was just enough for a down payment for a small farm. One day. when Jim was silently eating his lunch during the break, one of his co-workers approached him and told him that a farm was on sale some forty miles from where he was. He believed that the price the owner was asking was reasonable. The previous owner, a rich old miser, had died and his young nephew who had inherited the farm was not interested in working on it. He was an urbanite through and through and knew nothing about soil or plants.\nThere was enough cause for Jim to feel hopeful about it and he decided to take a day off and go and see the farm. He made the journey by bus an then walked the last mile or so. His first feeling was one of disappointment. The farm appeared to be shabby and forlorn with the chimneys lying smokeless and quiet. The unkempt look, the wild growth - all conspired to put him off. But then he remembered his limited funds and Lucy who had waited patiently all these past months. He also remembered his long, unending search for a farm, and, thinking of all these, he approached the farm.\n\nThe care-taker responded slowly to his knock and then grudgingly took him round. The farm house was small with a room and a big kitchen downstairs and two rooms upstairs.\n\nThe doors and windows were hard to close and there were signs of disuse everywhere. The farm was also not very big and there was only one shed to house the animals.\n\nJim was a sad man that evening; but he still decided to go and see the agent. Imagine his joy when he realized that the price being quoted was even less that what he had thought it to be. He could keep clear of debt. He could make the complete payment. So he began to think about it and was soon convinced that this was a stroke of luck. He decided to buy the farm.\n\nSoon Jim and Lucy were married and settled in the farm. One could not say 'snugly' for there much work to be done on the farm before it could be called either decent or dean. It was a long way from becoming a home. They both worked hard. While Jim cleaned the ground and ploughed the fields and repaired the shed Lucy cleaned and scrubbed the floors, hung up cheerful bright colored curtains, looked after a kitchen garden an tended the young lambs.\n\nBut a story that had begun so well, did not end so. The farm was on a hillside and the young saplings would crumble before the onslaught of a wind storm. The soil was not very good and did not respond to Jim's coaxing touch. The lambs died in an epidemic. Year after year the young couple struggled to recover from their disappointments. They borrowed money to buy fresh stock and they kept on hoping for better days. More than two years had passed and still there was no improvement. They had a young baby to look after now. Jim was a tired man after four years of waiting. He decided to give it up. It was not such a good bargain after all !"

We would normally discuss school happenings, plan outings and go out bird-catching and also bird-watching. Soon we were known by the name of 'Young Nature Lovers'. The weekly meeting was a regular feature, it helped to bring together our various activities.\nOne Friday we met as usual. Sheikh was a little disturbed. He was unhappy with the way his new neighbor treated his dogs. He had seen two of them, big Alsatians. But he underfed them and beat them and they would cower under his gaze. They used to be chained the whole day long. Sheikh had been upset for many days now. Earlier he had thought this was just a precaution the man took on having shifted to a new area. but, as the days passed, both his fear and dislike of the man got a strong hold over him. We decided to have a conference and to plan a course of action against the new neighbor. We wanted to teach him a lesson.\n\nHussain was the most agile and alert among us and so we decided to hand over the campaign to him and asked him to plan a course of action. Hussain said he would think over it and let us know the following day. Having fixed up a meeting place, we went to our respective homes.\n\nThe next day Hussain was all eager and bright when we got together and we were all eyes and ears. He had made up his mind and now he explained to us the plan. He felt that the man should he subjected to the same treatment as he subjected the dogs to and the best way was to lead him to a room, corner him and then let the dogs loose on him. But the very idea of cornering him was a little too much for us. How would we do it? Who would bell the cat?\n\nBut Hussain had an answer to this. He would pretend to be injured outside the man's house and thus the man would he compelled to take him inside. Once there, it was up to us to help him. We questioned Sheikh closely regarding his neighbor's habits and working hours. It appeared that he went for a walk every evening regularly at seven. The best thing would be to meet him on his return when in the evening light he would not be able to recognize anyone even by chance.\n\nSome of us climbed some trees just outside his house. As the man returned from his walk at about half-past seven. Hussain was there lying on the roadside groaning away to glory. The man stopped and in his brisk way started questioning Hussain who answered with spasms of pain. He said he was in pain, had sprained his ankle or perhaps sustained a fracture and was unable to walk. He knew no one there. He had come on an errand for an old uncle and was still some distance from his house. He begged for help and said he was tired an thirsty and would the man help him. Very reluctantly we could see the man help him limp along to his house. He looked up and down the road to see whether he could get some other help, but as there was no one else. he was compelled much against his will to act the good Samaritan. Then just when he entered his house, we rushed on him and closed the door. Two of us climbed a tree and peeped through a ventilator and one of us unchained the dogs to lead them in. In the meantime, Hussain got up and climbed the steps with a whip in his hand. The dogs were ferocious and all their pent up anger found an expression. The man jumped up in fear and held on to the ceiling fan with the dogs barking at him all the time. Only when Hussain had told him the whole story and extracted a promise from him that he'll treat his dogs better in future did we help him tie the dogs and let him free. Gradually he has become more tolerant in his behavior. He gives better food and does not beat the dogs any more. They are also allowed to be free for long hours. Now often in the evenings we see them him when he goes for a walk."

I thought I would miss it so I ran all the way from my aunt's house. But when I reached the bus stop. this strange sight confronted me. Where were the driver and the passengers ?\n\nThere was a sandy field behind the bus stop and I went there to investigate. I saw footprints on the sand which were probably made by the passengers. The footprints were all leading to one direction - towards the centre of the field. I plucked up my courage and ran towards it. As I was about to reach it, an unusual sight caught my eyes. There was a big crater in the sand, and a bright light, as though from an explosion, shone upwards. People stood at the edge of the crater, looking into it. I continued to run towards it. Then I felt a hand grabbed my arm, and I screamed. \"Hey, don't be frightened. Don't run to the crater, or you will become like them,\" said a stranger. I turned to face him, and saw that he was an old man whom I had seen in the village.\n\n\"Look at those people,\" the old man continued.\" If you look carefully, you can see that they are not moving. They are frozen like statues.\" He told me that when the bus was about to leave, a glowing, bright object crashed into the field and formed the crater. The pull of the light was so strong that everyone seemed drawn and rushed towards it. Even the young children were not frightened by it. The old man could not keep up with the rest of them because of his weak leg. He noticed that whoever looked at the object in the crater became immovable, as though transfixed by it.\n\nI asked the old man what we should do. I wanted to run back to the village for help. \"Wait,\" he said, \"I think something is about to happen that will save them. The sky is dark. I hope the gods will bless us with rain. We waited for the rain to fall. I could not help stealing looks at those immovable figures surrounding the bright light. It was very eerie.\n\nThen it rained, There was a heavy downpour. The old man and I watched an incredible sight. The bright light grew weaker and disappeared, and at that moment, the people started to come \"alive\" again. We approached them and they seemed not to have any knowledge of what had happened to them. They were all busily talking about the crater, and had no memory that some minutes of their lives had been frozen by an alien force.\n\nI looked into the crater and saw that there was a smooth globe inside it. But when the rain wiped out the light, it lost its power. The old man looked at me, and I nodded at him. We both understood that we would not tell the passengers the truth about the incident. They were better off not knowing, and besides they might not believe us, anyway."

The Caucasian man mentioned the sums that the company was willing to pay. A few people gasped with wonder. He then left, and the villagers started to argue.\n\nA majority of them especially the younger men, agreed with Talib that they should sell their land and, with the money, start a new life. \"After all, what do we have here ?\" said one young man. \"Nothing except goats, sand and mud houses. That remarks angered some of the people. Ben Ahmad, a respected member of the community stood up and said that this was ancestral land which had supported them and their ancestors for many generations. \"How dare you look down on your community,\" he continued. \"Do not be blinded by money. Here we all care for each other, and our culture must always remain strong.\" The whole room was silent for a while. Then it was agreed that they would vote on the matter in a week's time.\n\nFrom that time onwards, the oil field discovery was the main topic of conversation, Some people started dreaming of moving to the city and buying a lot of gold, while others could not bear to imagine leaving their beloved homes. People who wanted to sell their land were constantly arguing with those who did not want to sell. Old friends became enemies over the issue. Then the day of voting came. Those who had decided to sell their land outnumbered those who wanted to stay by a slim majority.\n\nThe American company quickly arranged the sale and purchase of the land, and soon it was time for the villagers to leave. Since it would be their last time together, they put aside their disagreements and bade each other farewell.\n\nTwo years later, Ben Ahmed came back to his old village to pay a visit. He could not believe what he saw. Huge oil rigs had been built on the land. Instead of the music of the desert wind and the rustle of the sand, pounding noises from the rigs fill the air. He realized that the black oil is so powerful that it can change so many lives."

Raymond wrote that he was leaving their home because he was disappointed in his mother. It had been only six months since his father's death and he had seen his mother dating another man. He felt that she did not care for him as well as his younger brother.\nMay Ling blamed herself. She remembered last night when Raymond was sulking in the living room. She had asked him what was the matter. He started to mumble something about a man, but did not continue. She tried to talk to him, but he became angry and left the flat. But May Ling blamed herself even more for keeping the truth away from her sons. She had wanted to surprise them, but it turned out to be a disaster. Raymond had apparently seen her with Seek Whee. She had met him at the restaurant near their home a couple of times. But there was nothing romantic about the meetings. Seek Whee was a car dealer and May Ling wanted to buy a car for herself and her family.\n\nMay Ling thought that a car would help her with her errands as well as cheer up the boys. They had missed their father badly. With the car, they could go to more places together. Raymond had also obtained his driving licence and May Ling wanted to give him the pleasure and the responsibility of looking after the car. But she wanted to surprise them. The last six months, she had been very busy working and saving for the car. She also spent the evenings taking driving lessons as she and her late husband never knew how to drive. \"I was wrong.\" she said to herself,\" I neglected the boys. I should have explained to them what I was trying to achieve.\"\n\nShe had planned with Seek Whee to have the car delivered to them next month. They were going to celebrate Raymond's nineteenth birthday at the restaurant near their home. Seek Whee would then deliver the car to them when they were at the restaurant.\n\nNow, because of the secret she kept. Raymond had left home. May Ling was determined to find her son. She tried to think of all his favorite places, and somehow she felt that he would he at the lake where he used to go fishing with his father. She hurried to the place, and sure enough. she saw him sitting by the lake. May Ling approached him. Raymond refused to listen when she first tried to explain. But when she showed him the purchase contract for the car and explained the situation, his anger cooled down.\n\nMay Ling was thankful that she was given the opportunity to mend the problem. She hoped that they could rebuild their lives and he a happy family again."

The judge walked into the courtroom, and everyone stood up. Soon, the proceedings started. Andy and Beng Lee were charged with shoplifting. They were caught trying to leave a department store with a small radio which had not been paid for.\nBeng Lee's lawyer told the judge that it was Andy's idea to steal the radio. Andy was shocked to hear this. It was, in fact, the other way around. He never thought that Beng Lee. his good friend, would make up such a lie to save himself! Then Andy's lawyer stood up to address the court. I I e said that it was true that Andy had accompanied Beng Lee to the department store that day. When they passed the counter which displayed the radio. Beng Lee suddenly whispered that he was going to take it and see if they could get away with it. Before Andy had a chance to react or protest, Beng Lee snatched the radio. He also grabbed Andy by the arm and rushed him towards the exit of the store. When they stepped out, the store's security guard caught them and called the police.\n\nWhen both lawyers finished addressing the court, the judge studied the papers in front of him before he made a judgment. Some minutes later, which felt more like hours to Andy, the judge announced his decision. He said that Beng Lee had previously been convicted of two other offences of shoplifting. For this offence, he would he fined and sent to a correction school so that he could change his ways. As for Andy, the judge reprimanded him for mixing with bad company. He said that Andy's school record had been good so far. Since Andy had no previous criminal record, the judge imposed a fine on him, and he would he free. But he had to report to a probation officer once a month to make sure that he would stay out of trouble.\n\nAndy was very relieved to hear this. He did not have to go to jail, and could go home after this terrible ordeal. But when he got home, things were not quite as before. His family seemed somewhat uncomfortable with him. He knew that he had disappointed them by being involved in such a situation. His mother was her usual loving self. She kept reminding him to use this experience as a lesson, and to concentrate on his studies.\n\nBut Andy knew that not only his mother, but the whole family loved him. They had given him so much support and hope throughout the ordeal. He realized that he had to be a person of good character to make up for all the trouble he had caused. The court trial was over, but the trial to win back his family's approval and trust had just begun."

He did not have to lift a finger in the house. His mother and the maid did everything for him. He always got what he wanted and sometimes he was rude to people.\nOne day his father noticed how pampered Hamid had become. Even though he was already 16 years old, he was still a spoilt child. During that same period, Hamid's grandfather who lived in the countryside was there for a visit. He noticed the same thing too. The two men agreed that Hamid should be more independent, and they felt that spending his month-long school holiday in the countryside might help him. When they told him about this plan, Hamid refused to go. But his father put his foot down and told him that he had no choice in the matter.\n\nWhen he arrived at the village, his grandparents who lived by themselves told Hamid that he would have to help them with all the chores. They would be too busy to attend to him. So Hamid had to be taught how to wash dishes and other simple household chores. His grandmother told him not to scorn these skills. She said that if he were to go abroad for studies, he would be able to take care of himself.\n\nHamid still looked down at the villagers as 'country bumpkins. But he gradually realized that they worked very hard. They spent long hours tending to the padi fields. At first, Hamid complained about all the bending and the physical work. He also could not bear to be in the hot sun. But his grandfather told him not to be a 'softie'. and advised him to take it as a challenge.\n\nThe villagers also helped each other to build and mend their houses. One day, they gathered to help an old couple build an extension to their small house. Someone had shoved a hammer and nails to Hamid and told him to pitch in. Hamid did not know where to begin or exactly what to do. Some of the young boys noticed his confusion and laughed at his ignorance. Hamid was angry. He had always laughed at these boys for their lack of sophistication. But now they were the ones laughing at him.\n\nHamid made a new friend, Malik. Malik helped his family, and even assisted other children with their schoolwork. But he was still a good student who aspired to be a doctor. This made Hamid feel ashamed because he always used the excuse of his studies to avoid doing any errand for his parents.\n\nThe month went by and it was time for Hamid to return home. Hamid had hated the idea of visiting the village when his family first brought it up. He thought they were being cruel to him. He also thought that it was unkind of his grandparents to make him do all those chores. But now he realized that his stay there had taught him to be independent, self-reliant and useful to others."

Even now with a considerably number of flying hours to my credit, I enjoy the thrill of being in the cockpit, the excitement of going so fast through the air. Driving a car or a scooter gives me a sense of power; piloting a plane surpasses that joy. It happened that I was on night duty on three nights a week and had to do short hops. But one night one of these very short hops gave me the scare of my life. I dare say it has done me a lot of good and given me some valuable experience; but it also gave me a terrible fright.\nIt happened to be a dark night and thick dark clouds jostled with each other like impatient little children squabbling over a prize. It had been raining for a few days, though for the time being there was a lull, and cyclonic pressures were building up in the area. The fishing trawlers had already been warned to be careful of the unruly seas. The sky was equally unruly and I had to steer myself back on the course many a time. As visibility was poor I had to depend rather heavily on the compass. I had begun with a great deal of confidence and with the feeling that I was up to the challenge but now with the responsibility of so many lives in my hands, I began to feel a little apprehensive about my own abilities. I was not alone and that was a saving grace. The co-pilot was with me, the whole crew was there and there were passengers. But how I wished that I was alone and not answerable to anyone else.\n\nThe flight became more and more bumpy and I felt the compression was not adequate. What a time for an engine failure! I looked at the compass and then looked at my watch. We had not yet completed even one-third of the distance. I broke out in sweat. The fear of uncertainty gripped at my heart. I calmed myself and tried again to see whether we could manage to complete the journey. Perhaps I was worrying prematurely.\n\nBy this time some of the passengers had awakened. I could hear soft voices of people. This was possible for them mainly because of their trust in me. I had to take a quick decision. I peered down and could hardly see anything. Then tree tops were seen. I became hopeful. I can remember myself talking confidently and assuredly to others. I heard my voice telling my crew that I was going to land and there was no need for any concern at all. It was not me. but my voice of responsibility that was speaking.\n\nMy co-pilot was not my usual partner. Teck Soon had fallen ill and his place had been taken by Sudakhar who was inexperienced but he was calmer than I was and he told me that we were over a comparatively flat piece of ground. We started flying lower and soon we were just a few feet above the ground. The plane brushed against the tree-tops and then we landed. Luckily our wireless communications had been working. We were thus in touch with the nearest airport though we were off our main route by now.\n\nWe landed and I silently thanked God for having helped us. We had to wait for about an hour when an airlines bus drove in to collect all the passengers and brought the engineers to help repair the craft. We were indeed lucky to have got off so lightly in this brush with disaster."

He had expected the meeting to end early but it had dragged on. He could not call his wife because the meeting was important and the boss was in a bad mood. By the time Don had come home his wife and children had gone. He had been tired so he had just dozed off in front of the TV. His wife had come back and almost immediately had shouted at him. He had begged her to stop, but she would not. Things had come to a head when she had insulted his parents so he had slapped her.\nNext morning she did not wake up early to make his breakfast. Don was miserable; he had never slapped his wife before. He decided to buy her some flowers that day to make up. He would take her out to dinner that night and apologize to her. He looked at her sleeping and then went to work. The day dragged on and finally it was time to go home. Don rushed to the flower shop and bought a bunch of roses; then he hurried home.

The thought that her only child had gone to prison was too much for her. Alice thought Again at what had happened to her. She had been betrayed by Adrian, the man she thought had loved her. Little had she known that the man had merely exploited her and used her to embezzle money from her company. When she was caught, he had promptly disappeared.

        "content": "Man has been cutting down forests indiscriminately and today the trend is not only to save natural forests but to create artificial ones. Deserts are made to bloom! The Imperial Valley of the Sonoran desert in southern California has been converted into a green patch which yields crops all the year round. Forests are not to be considered merely as a direct source of wealth; they are to be considered in relation to the national economy and geography.\nForests serve many purposes. They hold together the soil and prevent or minimize soil erosion. The oxygen in the air is replenished by forests and plankton in the sea. Trees and plants, during photosynthesis, absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Scientists fear that if forests are destroyed indiscriminately, there will be an increase in carbon dioxide and eventually the sun's rays will become hotter, the polar caps will melt and the ocean level rise and submerge much of our land. Vegetable mould that forests supply increases the fertility of the soil. Forests influence climate. The roots suck up sub-soil water and it is expelled as moisture by foliage. Forests provide sanctuary for animals and birds. It is to he remembered that the rich and varied wild life vanishes in proportion to the forest we destroy.\n\nIndustries like paper, rayon. strawboards, matches, insulation boards and wood-panel products are dependent on forests. Indian forests are said to yield 2,500 species of wood, about 18% of which are commercially valuable. Forests are a source of essential oil and medicinal herbs. The lignin and cellulose found in wood are chemically treated to produce valuable drugs like sulfonamide and chloroform. Spruce and fur are used for making airplane and glider parts. Ash and mulberry woods are used for making many sports goods.\n\nGovernments all over the world have taken steps to conserve forests: President Franklin Roosevelt of the USA, alarmed by the massive destruction of forests by man, created a conservation corps of two million men to plant trees, dig lakes and build forest roads and in the course of ten years saved the country's forests. Today the trend is not only to save the existing forests but to create artificial ones. Israel is the classic example of a country where a desert has been converted into a garden. The success of this experiment shows that land can be reclaimed and thus increase the food supply of the world. It stands to Israel's credit that within twenty-five years it has doubled the area of its arable land."

        "content": "We are living in a world which is characterized by change. Generally speaking, the change has been towards progress. Change and progress have created certain problems that confront both the young and old. Old values stand at a discount and new dues are accepted, though with reluctance. Social life has become complex and new social problems have cropped up The change has been so rapid that many find themselves in a state of flux.\nThe head of the family who traditionally enjoyed importance at home, now finds that much of it has whittled away. He has to respect the views of others at home and has to recognize their attitudes and manners. Reason, he finds. has substituted, to a large extent, tradition and obligations. He can no longer impose his will on others and where conservatism has got the better of him, he feels dejected and ignored. This sense of loss of position and importance can have bad psychological consequences.\n\nThe old have to change their attitude towards jobs. They find that in the rat race, they have to learn and equip themselves with necessary skills if they want to compete. The experience that they have gained at a particular job can no longer be equated with security and promotion. They have to compete with those equipped with new knowledge and expertise.\n\nThe old have to accept the changed values, and values prescribe certain principles of personal and corporate conduct. As society changes, values change and thus changed values would imply changed morality. But one must hasten to add that the basic values of the present generation are not different from those of the earlier. Corruption is not justified on the ground of changed values. But our attitude towards elders. jobs, the family etc. have change and the old find it difficult to accept them. With the disappearance of the extended family system, the old family ties an pre-eminence of the oldest members, the old are often left in the home of the aged. The old find it difficult to reconcile themselves to the situation. The old feel that the young do not understand or appreciate their value and attitudes.\n\nYoung people today experience problems which were unheard of before. They are often branded as a generation with no respect for anyone. The information they have gathered about the problems of growing up make them feel more about them and they demand sympathy and understanding. To them the problems art genuine and the old ignore them. In their search for solace and comfort, they value the company of their peer-group more than the affection of parents which is often not demonstrated. They are often driven off their homes, often there develops a conflict at home, the parents enforcing discipline and the children asserting their independence.\n\nThe undue importance given to material wealth makes the parents search it at the expense of their parental obligations. Money becomes an obsession and the children are left uncared for. Parental attention and affection are important in developing well-adjusted individuals. Bereft of these, the children despair and are apt to develop anti-social habits. Parents desire their children to accomplish ambitions beyond their ability and when their attempts are thwarted both the parents and children feel frustrated.\n\nWe are living in a fast changing world. The developments in the last three decades or so have transformed traditional life patterns. The rapidity of this transformation requires man to be adaptable and this need for adaptation creates problems for both the old and the young."

        "title": "Gambling",
        "content": "In a narrow sense, the term. \"gambling\" means playing for money and engaging in wild financial speculations. The moment a person takes a chance on anything, he is gambling. If you are not sure which of the two rope bridges across the river is the safe one, and decide to take any one of them and hope for the best, you are gambling. There are many, many times in a man's life when he has to make a decision, and he finds that he does not know which course will benefit him. I feel that this is the core of the act of gambling - resorting to the element of chance or luck, when all one's powers of reasoning cannot influence one's decisions.\nGambling which most moralists consider evil need not be always evil. I personally feel that moderation in gambling means that you do not risk more money than you can afford. When you find that you have enough money both to satisfy your basic living requirements and to spend on luxuries, you may not mind gambling. But you exceed the limits when you gamble and find that your gambling is robbing you of your minimum comforts of life. The trouble with most people is that they start off with small sums and end up with colossal debts. This kind of excessive indulgence is harmful and it becomes a vice, just as drinking to excess or smoking to excess are smaller vices. Sometimes small sums of money spent by people at games like \"mahjong\" are considered worth it because they provide entertainment.\n\nBuying toto coupons or lottery tickets constitutes gambling. But when one buys these, he is in actual fact helping his fellowmen. The sum of money that one spends on these mass-participation projects is trivial: some of us do not remember having brought lottery tickets sometimes. Secondly, the money that the organizers earn is used for building useful projects or to aid people in need of social welfare. In a small way, it also satisfies the gambling urge in most men.\n\nWhy, then, does society frown upon gambling, and why is it that the police keep such a watchful eye on gamblers and places where gambling is reported to he held? Most of us disapprove of gamblers because we know that professional gamblers often use unfair means to win. We also disapprove of people who make a living out of the miseries of others who lose to them. The police know that heavy gambling involves large sums of money and that large sums of money attract thugs and robbers. Many gamblers who find themselves in irretrievable debts have been known to commit suicide. Others have been known to hire gangsters to force money out of fellow gamblers who have lost and who fail to repay their debts promptly.\n\nSome people refrain from gambling because they feel that it is morally wrong to risk money that has been earned by hard work. Others refrain from gambling because they feel that gambling is motivated by human avarice, the desire to earn as much money as possible with as little effort as possible. The word \"gambling\" has acquired unpleasant connotations largely because gambling can lead to excess. But it is generally convenient to look upon gambling as an activity in which people take risks in the hope of earning more through the element of chance. \"There are two times when a man should not gamble - when he has no money and when he has money\"."

        "content": "The present for us is one of special significance. This is an era of changes. New patterns emerge and new ideals are proposed. The era of independence and the attendant changes have radically altered the context in which the school pursues its aims. Change which symbolizes progress demands an urgent reorientation of the attitudes of the students towards jobs. In the process of mopping up the cobwebs of prejudice against blue-collar jobs and dissemination of occupational information, the school has to pay an important role.\nIn the past in the whole complex and complicated field of education there was no aspect more neglected than vocational guidance. Thanks to the dynamism and foresight of the education authorities, the student has ample opportunities to gain sufficient occupational information to equip him to choose a job that is consistent with his aptitude and general ability. The student who leaves school without at least a vague idea of the job that he would take up is apt to fall into a taste of Flux and there is the danger that he may choose the wrong job and so despair. Today. the school leaver would have at least a vague idea of the job he intends taking up.\n\nEach year, there is a large number of school-leavers. It is important, therefore, that young citizens should be guided to the right career when they leave school. A youth who plunges blindly into a job for which he is not suited, or for which he has no interest, can very aptly he likened to a round peg in a square hole. No country can afford to have such a state of affairs. It is, thus, of paramount importance that every individual is properly guided in the choice of a career so that he can contribute his maximum to society.\n\nAbout two-thirds of a man's life is spent in work even in these days of automation. And, the choice of a career is certainly a delicate issue for him. Making the wrong choice can land him in a world of endless frustration! Very often, the first job that a school-leaver gets is the one he has to stay at throughout his working career. So, unless he is content with and suited to the job he has, he will never be happy. Vocational guidance is thus important as its fundamental aim is to help the individual choose a career according to his aptitudes. interests and training.\n\nThe industries are confronted with the problem of shortage of skilled workers. This shortage of trained than-power to meet our industrialization program is a reflection of the inadequacies and short-comings of a past education which was ill-equipped to prepare young school- leavers with the necessary knowledge and skills for employment in industries. This problem, however, is further aggravated by certain values developed from the colonial era when many were groomed for clerical positions and white- collar jobs. The traditional prejudice against blue-collar jobs is still firmly entrenched. The reluctance to train for blue collar jobs means an inadequate number of skilled workers and technicians. Such ingrained negative attitudes towards manual jobs indeed necessitate vocational guidance in schools."

Overweening ambition can lead to disastrous consequences.\nAmbition, of course, is not confined to physical or worldly matters. In the spiritual realm, too, one's ambition can be realized. One of the best dressed men in the most fashionable city of Paris walked the dusty streets of Goa and Malacca with a begging bowl in his hand. Francis Xavier, the pleasure-seeking youth, was seized by the yearning not \"to suffer the loss of his soul\". His motivation called \"faith\" gave him wings and he soared to great heights.\n\nThe path to our goal is not always strewn with roses. Discovery of truths which we take for granted today brought hardships and loneliness for those who worked untiringly against a mocking world. Louis Pasteur who said that germs cause diseases was scoffed at an ridiculed by \"learned\" doctors. This indefatigable Frenchman had to spend as much time fighting superstition and skepticism as he had to spend fighting pathogenic bacteria. Again unswerving drive helped Florence Nightigale and Elizabeth Barrett to steer clear of the pride and prejudice of the male-dominated world and realize their ambitions.\n\nRealization of ambition comes sometimes at unexpected moments. William Henry David. for example. failed to sell his collection of poems. He published his poems again. One morning, looking down from his cubicle, he found many cars waiting in the muddy lane. He was surprised to learn that the rich people of high social standing had arrived to invite him to dinner for G.B. Shaw had recommended his book. But it should not be surmised that achievement of our aim depends on blind chance. Take the case of the unexpected discovery of penicillin, the wonder drug that has saved millions of lives. True. Alexander Fleming left the bacteria culture carelessly open and this resulted in the discovery. We are, in fact, oblivious of his drive, enthusiasm and initiative which contributed to his success and so to his greatness.\n\nMaterial shortcomings need not stop us from reaching our goal. Abraham Lincoln could not afford books, so he increased his vocabulary by learning the meanings of words from the old newspaper wrappings from the grocer's. Even the past poor examination results need not hamper you. Winston Churchill, a great prime minister, one of the architects of Second World War victory, writer, historian, orator and painter failed in his examinations many times and had the unsavory experience of being detained in the same class two or three years But his ambition made him persevere and finally succeed.\n\nAmbition-sprung actions seem to be very light. Since the work is done in the pleasurable associations of our own desires. nervous energy expended is cut to the minimum. Paradoxically, hard work ceases to be hard when \"ambition- joined\". Consider the willingness with which the Japanese sportsmen undergo the rigorous physical training."

        "content": "Life, both animal and plant, is impossible without water. Without water men die of dehydration About 70% of the human body is water. Of the total surface of the earth, 75 % is water and just below the surface of the land in most areas there is a saturated layer known as the water table. Animals and plants have large percentages of water in their make-up and some animals regulate their movements according to the water sources.\nIf there is no water there can be no life. The moon is a sterile desert because there is no water in it. It is to be remembered that it was water that determined the location of human settlements and without the Nile the Egyptian Civilization would not have developed The Nile provided the Egyptians facilities for irrigation and transport. As Herodotus said, Egypt is the \"Gift of the Nile\".\n\nThe urban man rarely thinks of the importance of water. When he needs water, all he has to do is to turn on the tap. The only time the urban folk become aware of the importance of water is when there is a drought and their water supply is regulated. If water rationing becomes too drastic. they may find themselves in a worse position than the rural man who may have a steady supply of water from his well.\nImagine a day when the taps ran dry: Mr. Townsman would have found life intolerable. He could not brush his teeth, have his shave or could he have his bath in the morning. After lunch, he would have had a very difficult time trying to wash up. He might have used cloth to wipe his crockery. He could not wash his car. At the end of the day, however, our Mr. Townsman would have realized that water is precious and he should not be a water-waster.\n\nScientists find water the most fascinating fluid in the world because of its versatility and usefulness. Electricity is generated by the force of running water. Unlike other substances, water expands when freezing takes place. In ancient Rome snow was used to pack prawns and meat. Ice is used for refrigeration. Water is converted into steam and used as power.\n\nWhatever man eats is dependent on water for its growth. Water can convert whole, barren tracts of land into luxurious, rich and fertile regions, through the use of irrigation. In parts of Spain, diminishing quantities of rain have caused fertile land to dry up in the past years, creating barren deserts. This is turn has caused many men and their families to move to new places.\n\nMost of us who take our daily supply of water for granted. may not be able to fully appreciate the importance of water. Many have perished through lack of water.\n\nMilitary men know that the most effective way of subduing any city or fortress is to cut its water supply."

Efficient dedicated leadership and resources, both natural and human, are requisites for a nation to develop and progress. The days when people could be driven are long gone and today people are led. An educated and sophisticated group of people need an intelligent and forward-looking leader. The students have their teacher to follow, the family, the father, and the nation, its political leader.\nThe leader is the symbol of unity. The British Crown is symbolic of the links that bind the members of the Commonwealth. It is often leadership that strengthens an organization and makes it vigorous and viable. Often, when a leader is discredited, the organization is thrown into a minor tumult and rival leaders vie to checkmate one another. Where the leader is not acceptable to the majority. the members will he divided, and a fragmented organization will be an ineffective one.\n\nIn school. the Principal is the leader of the teachers and the students. Where he fails, the mental, physical and moral welfare of the students will he neglected. The teachers look up to their Principal for guidance and leadership. Having won the confidence of the teachers, lie is able, with their help, to create an ethos which is so vital to the effective functioning of the school. In the church the congregation receive their spiritual guidance from the priest. At home, the head of the family would be able to foster in the children the virtues that he displays.\nLeadership should he dynamic and forward-looking. The leader should be able to adapt his policies to the changing circumstances and find new solutions to old problems. When he is conservative and unwilling to change because of his traditional beliefs, he becomes ineffective as a leader and loses his hold on his members. The smug satisfaction which a leader enjoys when he comes into the lime-light should not make him complacent and idle. By his dynamism, new followers are to be won and opponents transformed into friends and followers. He should be quick to abandon out-moded and decadent ideas.\n\nA Leader should be patient and tactful. A leader in a hurry often fails. A leader should he aware of the susceptibilities of his people and should not jibe at their weaknesses. The measures that he adopts should not run counter to their beliefs and customs for the success of any plan depends on the involvement of the majority of the members. Arbitrary decisions can lead to failure. A leader should be resourceful and must be capable of sound judgment. He must be tolerant of the weaknesses of others and should be prepared to accept criticism.\n\nLeadership should be efficient and intelligent. A good academic qualification is a \"sine qua non\" of leadership. The intellectual acumen that usually goes with a high standard of education is necessary to find solutions to the many problems that he meets with. Almost all leaders have the gift of the gab. With the ability to speak fluently and impressively he is able to win over his members and influence their thinking.\n\nLeadership should not be corrupt. A mercenary is easily spotted and isolated. Corruption precedes decay and disintegration. The leaders that shine forth in the political horizon today are those who have forsaken selfishness and self-interest. To be admired more at home the leader should be admired abroad.\n\nBereft of an efficient, honest. intelligent leader, a nation falls divided and an association or an organization becomes static. Where the very existence is threatened, a dynamic and efficient leader can create calm out chaos and help the nation to progress."

        "content": "The question if advertising is worth it has often been asked. While cynics believe that a large sum of money is spent on browbeating and cheating customers. manufacturers claim advantages, some of which may sound preposterous. Advertising is said to be as old as civilization and today it has become a serious adjunct to commercial activity. The modern world is geared to advertising.\nAdvertising serves many purposes. Distribution has not kept pace with scientific production and, therefore. advertising aims at scientific distribution The ultimate aim of all advertising is to sell goods and services. However, there are some immediate aims that are incidental. Advertising familiarizes the customer with the existence of a product or the availability of a particular service. It reduces the possibility of substitution. Institutional advertising creates goodwill among customers and prepares the way for the salesman. Advertising, generally speaking, enhances the profit of the producer and it provides a wide range of choice.\n\nOne would think that today the trend is away from information and it is towards persuasion. Quite often an advertisement is involved with the manipulation of social attitudes instead of providing information to help the consumer make a rational choice. One wonders if the advertisers consider us as not sufficiently materialistic. It would appear that the cultural attitudes have to be mobilized through advertising so as to be able to do the economic function of selling goods and services.\n\nAdvertising aims at reaching the right audience, employing the most effective appeal. The source of information about a particular article is the manufacturer and the agent of communication is the advertiser who sees us as reluctant consumers but able to make private decisions. One's decision to spend the money one has is determined by the amount one has and his set of priorities. But the advertiser sees our priorities in a different light and by cajoling us and by appealing to our vanity, weakens our sense of differing needs. He turns to areas that are vulnerable; he appeals to social success, established human values and human aspirations. The shampoo can do fascinating things for you!\n\nThere are different media of advertising. Once in the street, one cannot escape advertising: There are neon lights that wink and there are large posters. The painted wall is another medium of advertising. The window display makes a potential customer enter a store. Household goods and consumer goods are advertised in the mass circulation paper. Advertising assaults our ears. Often our radio or television programs are interrupted by advertisements. Then there are the motion pictures.\n\nThough advertising increases the price of an article because it is the customers that pay the expenses involved in advertising, it reduces the price of the newspaper and magazine considerably. Advertising leads to increased demand and increased demand means increased production and increased employment. Increased demand results in a corresponding decrease in the cost per unit. Advertising reduces other expenses. It reduces enormous waste resulting from idle employees and unused facilities such as floor space and machinery. To a certain extent, advertising has been responsible for bringing about social revolution. It has led to the use of such devices as the electric heater, refrigerator, vacuum cleaner etc.\n\nOne may say that about one-third of the amount spent on advertising is worth it. Today advertising has become a profession and there are many advertising agencies. The modern world is attuned to advertising agencies The modern world is attuned to advertising and prudent advertising can he amply justified."

        "title": "The purposes of punishment",
        "content": "There is a tendency in man to deviate from the right path and act in such a way that the interest of another is injured. Society binds its members to a certain line of conduct so as to ensure security for all. It is this function of ensuring safety through right behavior that has given rise to the idea of punishment. Punishment is intended to prevent, deter and reform.\nThe individual is a member of society and he needs society for the development of his personality He has his freedom but it cannot be absolute. His freedom to direct his own share of the common life is balanced by the freedom of society to dissociate itself from his actions which conflict with its interests- Therefore, punishment is essentially disowning by society of acts done by its members when such acts are In conflict with the general interest.\n\nThe theory of retribution has few defenders today. The main objection to retributive theory is that it inflicts pain for the sake of pain. Hammurabi's famous code contained the principle of \"an eye for an eye\". Society feels that the criminal should get the taste of violence which he has inflicted on his victim. The penalty given is to be equated with the seriousness of the crime. Thus, when a criminal is punished, society is expressing its antagonism and this, it is said, is necessary for the preservation of the character of society. Those who oppose this purpose of retribution believe that the aim of penal sanction is not revenge for retribution which is associated with revenge is incompatible with forgiveness. However, it must be observed that the only person who can feel revengeful is the injured person. If A injures B. it is absurd for C to forgive.\n\nWhen a person is sent to prison for life or hanged, he is prevented from repeating his offence. If he is sent for a period of time, he may be deterred from committing further crimes. Punishment can also have a deterrent effect on would- be criminals. It is possible that one who is punished realizes the error of his ways. In prison he may be visited by the chaplain or the psychiatrist and he may decide to go straight in future. But there is the opposite view that when a prisoner is discharged he is charged to the eyes with venom and hatred and therefore punishment cannot have a deterrent effect.\n\nThe modern tendency is towards reform and society's attitude towards criminals today is more humane. Punishment is no longer an occasion for community entertainment. Society, instead of disowning him, tries to understand him because punishing a criminal is like treating the symptoms of a disease. A case study is made of the criminal and psychologists and social workers try to detect reasons for the actions of the criminal. Some of the factors considered to be responsible for crimes are lack of affection at home, the environment, upbringing and frustration. The aim is to remove the factors that make a man deviate from the right path and help him to fit himself into society. In the prison, the emphasis is on reform. He is taught a skill so that his prison term could be profitably spent and he could secure a job on release. The remedial measures adopted are intended to make a criminal a normal person. After all, killing the offender does not revive the life of the victim.\n\nPunishment, in essence, is the method by which society tries to maintain its moral standard. It also enables others to enjoy their freedom. As understood today, it is not revenge. The aim is to guarantee each man to run his own life as he thinks fit until he has done something which gives society reason for invading his freedom."

        "content": "Reading has at all times and in all ages been a source of knowledge, of happiness, of pleasure and even moral courage. In today's world with so much more to know and to learn and also the need for a conscious effort to conquer the divisive forces, the importance of reading has increased. In the olden days if reading was not cultivated or encouraged, there was a substitute for it in the religious sermon and in the oral tradition. The practice of telling stories at bed time compensated to some extent for the lack of reading. In the nineteenth century Victorian households used to get together for an hour or so in the evenings and listen to books being read aloud. But today we not only read, we also want to read more and more and catch up with the events taking place around us. The various courses and classes being conducted in rapid reading support this belief.\nThe amount of reading one should get through is of course nobody's business. There is no end to it for there is a variety of subjects to read about. The daily newspaper or the popular magazine while it discusses topical issues and raised controversies, it also provokes thought and throws light on human nature. It brings the news of wars, rebellions, organizations, political stances, heroic deeds etc., together and helps knit a world of some sort. There is then the serious reading undertaken for research and for satisfying one's longing for knowledge. It may be a subject of scientific significance, or a subject of historic or philosophic importance - varying according to the taste of the person. This kind of reading disciplines the mind and trains one for critical and original thinking. There is yet another kind of reading -reading for pleasure. Though serious reading is also a source of pleasure, reading which is devoted mainly to it differs in one respect. It grows upon one, it gives before demanding and it soothes and relieves tension and loneliness. The only kind of reading which neither stimulates thought nor provides knowledge is one which is approached negatively, with the simple motive of escape and of \"killing\" time.\n\nA person who is widely read is able to mix with others: he is a better conversationalist than those who do not read. He can stand his ground. Reading broadens the vision. it is in a way a substitute for travel. It is not possible to travel as much as one would like to and reading can fill in the gap created by the lack of travel. \"Reading\", as Bacon wrote in his essay. 'Of Studies'. \"maketh a full man: conference a ready man: and writing an exact man\". Thus a widely-read man is a better conversationalist and is able to see the other point of view.\n\nLiterature is a form of art which can cross barriers and if one does not know the language in which a piece of literature is written, one is willing sometimes to learn the language. Even if one does not learn a language one reads the literary work in translation. This contributes to the growth of understanding and tolerance amongst people. Reading also helps one to see the present in relation to the past and the future, and thus develop a historical perspective.\nCare is needed to ensure that reading does not become a substitute for real life. The moment one ceases to enjoy the ordinary pleasures and happiness of life and is content to enjoy them vicariously through fictional and historical representations, one loses all the benefits of reading and loses contact with life.\n\nWith the cinema and television taking up a great deal of attention of children, teenagers and even adults, the habit of serious reading is dying out. People are content to read abridged versions. see films, go through illustrated comics and be content. But just as reading should not become a substitute for the joy of living or drive out the other forms of entertainment, other substitutes should not be accepted for the pleasure of reading which lies in the act itself. One may be selective, may be discriminating but no one can afford to shut himself off from this rich and ever-growing world of literature."

        "content": "Man's ever increasing needs and greed have led him to intrude indiscriminately into the world of nature. He has not only lost the awe and fear which was a part of nature worship in the early religions, but has developed an almost ruthless attitude towards the world of animals. He has felled trees, built dams and has disturbed the peaceful seclusion of the forests. With thousands of men working on dam sites and vehicular traffic moving round the clock, animals are forced to retreat further and further into the fast receding forests. Added to these the rapid industrialization with its accompanying pollution, the use of pesticides and insecticides has made the struggle for survival a losing battle for a large number of birds and animals. Nuclear explosions and even holiday picnickers are driving the fish towards extinction. The lack of oxygen in the coastal waters drives them to their death. Another contributory factor is man's desire to capture animals and keep them in captivity. The idea is not wrong but the unimaginative method is wrong. For lack of space. animals are kept in small, uniform cages, without bothering to cater to their individual needs and living habits. In order to avoid cluttering of their cages they are of even provided with the necessary perches, branches or wooden trunks which they can bore into. They are thus frustrated, unhappy and at times unduly ferocious.\nAll the above factors, it is clear, are detrimental to the growth of wild life. Yet animals and birds are necessary. Man needs them first of all to retain the balance in the world of nature: he also needs them to keep a part of himself alive for the tenderness which birds and animals arouse is perhaps the most unselfish emotion. Medical and scientific experiments have used animals to benefit mankind. Sociologists and psychologists also depend on studies of animal behavior in order to understand human behavior.\n\nPreservation of wild life means preventing the extinction of species no matter how ungainly or unattractive they may be. and cultivating living conditions which may be conducive to their growth and happiness. And the first step towards this is limiting human greed. Instead of felling trees. man should grow them; pollution should be controlled. The disposal of solid wastes into sea waters should be checked and controlled. If nuclear experiments have to be conducted they should be done on a very limited scale and only in selected sites.\n\nIn many countries the old fashioned concept of a zoo has changed and more imagination is brought into play. As far as possible conditions most conducive to their growth are created and there is an attempt to cater to the varying individual needs of the animals. And this is as it should be. Animals need their natural habitat in order to flourish. Wide spaces, ponds and pools provide them this. More and more specialized zoos are coming into being. Those animals which cannot procreate in captivity are being gradually allowed to return to wild life. In Sabah, orangutans are being weaned away from captivity back to a natural existence where they can procreate.\n\nThe worst enemy of animals is man with his superior intelligence and ability to use machines and medicines to help him. It is man's hunting instinct and his desire to exercise power which have led him into this inconsiderate attitude towards animals. Many countries have attempted to curb this by proclaiming various birds and animals either as national animals or as protected animals and by imposing a ban on the shooting of these animals. All these measures are not enough to help preserve wild life. More than these, what is required is a check on man's attitude towards animals. Man thinks of them as raw material for consumption and not as fellow beings. What had helped preserve nature in the past was the attitude of divinity towards them. Today if we cannot have a divine feeling, we can at least cultivate an anthropomorphic attitude."

        "content": "History, in the present century, has migrated from the sphere of humanities to that of social sciences. This itself speaks for the new look which it has acquired and the change in the study and the use of history. Men, in the past, have limited its scope and have derided it. People like Carlyle and Emerson have considered history to be nothing more than biographies put together, and Gibbon viewed history as a register of crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind. Henry Ford once referred to it as bunk, and Carlyle called it a \"dust heap\". Yet history is a part of our world.\nIt is not possible to have objective historical records for human preferences and views are bound to creep in. But it is possible to arrive at what is generally true by comparing versions, records, letters and interviews. Thus the scope of history is not a mere record but much more. They may or may not be an eye witness account and even if there is if may not be objective. The numerous accounts of a war in our own times make this abundantly clear. Therefore, a historian has to find out as much as possible of the truth by referring to various records which may include economic data, memoirs and speeches. All these go to make history.\n\nIt was believed till a few years ago that history was related only to the past and has no utility for the future. At best it is a record of human achievements and at worst it may make interesting reading. This, however, is not the case any more. History has its own utility. It provides an insight into human nature both individually and collectively. it makes it possible to view the mistakes of the past and to try to avoid them in the present. It is also possible to make political predictions on the basis of past behavior for nations and countries normally follow a pattern. It is also possible to study the psychology of a people and to analyze the factors which may have influenced their behavior, at times it may also be possible to artificially recreate these factors.\n\nIt would be wrong to think that history can only be used for the purposes of exploiting past knowledge. History can also inspire, for it is men who are the makers of history. If they are ruthless and cruel, they are also honest and patriotic, capable of making immense sacrifices and capable of intense suffering. They are people of heroic courage and valor. To read about them, to know about them is an ennobling experience.\n\nJust as other disciplines throw light on historical facts. the study of history helps us to understand literature better. It becomes clear what the writer had in mind, what factors molded his personality and what the prevalent conditions of his time were. Poets, philosophers and theorists can be better understood if their work is studied in a historical perspective. History is the philosophy drawn from experience. As long as there is a sense of time and we all do not become transcendentalists, history will continue to have importance. Though in the present century a disproportionate place has been taken up by wars and revolutions, this does not form the totality of history. it also embraces the creative and constructive forces. As H.G. Wells wrote in 'The Outline of World History\", that human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe. It is a struggle between good and evil, between the life force and the death wish."

        "content": "Fire is one of the four basic elements believed to be composing the universe and necessary to human life and the continuity of human existence. The simple word 'fire' has, over the years, acquired a large number of connotative meanings and seems to envelop the whole area of human life ranging from its daily needs like the cooking of meals, and the heating of rooms to emotional and poetical meanings. Fire is required for the purposes of war and peace, for the performance of many religious ceremonies, and for the continuation of civilization. Yet. it is one of the most primitive forces present.\nOne can only guess how man learnt to ignite a fire. Perhaps the use of fire preceded this knowledge of the method of lighting a fire. Primitive man, when he chanced upon a burning fire, kept it burning for long periods. It gave him light and offered him protection from wild animals. Later he learnt that tools could be hardened, metals melted, and food cooked. Gradually he also learnt that fire could be lit in a number of ways - by knocking two stones together or pieces of broken pottery or bamboo sticks. He was later to learn the use of matchsticks. gas lighters and electric lighters. Fire held him in awe. This was partly due to the mysterious origins of fire. And in most of the ancient. pre-Christian religions, fire had a place of worship. The Hindus worship it and it is necessary for the performance of a \"Yagna\" or a religious offering of prayers and for the performance of a marriage ceremony. The funeral pyre is also consumed by fire. The Parsis worship fire and have Fire Temples where they offer their devotion. Coal. oil. wood. gas and electricity are used to keep a fire going. They are all sources of energy and each has its own utility. The steam engine and the early industrial gadgets were dependent on the steam produced from coal. Now oil in the form of diesel and petrol has got an equally important part to play. Central heating and railway services, cold storage and many medical facilities depend upon electricity. But there is nothing to beat a good, warm fire in winter for creating good will and friendly feeling. Civilization has brought in many changes and has almost driven the simple wood fire out. Yet Gypsies and other tribal people still continue to gather around a communal fire and sing songs and dance to their heart's content. Most camps end in a camp bonfire.\n\nIn literature, fire has a dual role to play, as it has in real life. It symbolizes both creation and destruction: it is both a cleansing and an annihilating agent. Robert Burns wrote in a poem \"Epistle to John Lapraik', \"Gie me ae spark o'Nature's Fire. That's a' the learning I desire\". He meant by this that he wanted to feel intense passion and ardor and out of this all good is born, all creative activity takes place. Yet fire also destroys. The Great Fire of London burnt away huge sections of the city. a napalm bomb when it explodes causes burns and loss of life and an immense amount of destruction. A forest fire, as dwellers in the tropics know, is disastrous. Fire destroys and when it dies down. it kills something in man and turns him into a cold, callous human being.\n\nIt is said that the gods did not wish to share this gift with mankind and Prometheus stole fire from heaven for the use of mankind. Though he was punished for this act, the rest of mankind has benefited from his act. It is a divine quality not to be idled with. A fire accident can be a gruesome affair. There has developed the idiom \"He has come through fire\" and also the proverb \"It is foolish to play with fire\". Man must take it in its proper measure: creation not destruction."

        "content": "The abundance of nature's variety is perceptible in the world of animals. There are animals to meet man's requirements in the different regions of the world. Donkeys, mules, horses, camels, yaks, oxen and elephants are some of the animals used for pulling loads and carrying weights. Man's own capacity is limited and he can carry only limited weights for short distances. Other modes of carrying weight are comparatively recent in man's history. Now there are trains and trucks, boats and planes, trolleys and wagons; but this has not been the case in the past. Even when these are available, their utility and mobility may be limited. There are vast stretches of sand and narrow hilly terrains where man must depend on animals and where a motorbike or a motorboat are ineffective. In such cases it's nature's ingenuity which provides the answer.\nMan's dependence on animals has always been there whether he used from them ploughing his field. for ferrying water, for traveling or for carrying loads. The camel is one such beast of burden. The Bedouins of Arabia call it \"Ata Allah\" i.e. God's gift. It justifies this epithet by coming to man's rescue when motors and machines fail man. It is difficult for a person brought up in the lush. rich region of Malaysia or Singapore to imagine the vast endless stretches of sand in the wilderness of Sahara or of the Thar desert. Camels have been carrying weight even since man made their acquaintance. The camel can go without water for long periods -- if it is not working too hard. It can outlast a horse and can carry a load of more than two hundred kilos.\n\nMules are sturdy animals and where donkeys or horses cannot find their way. mules are able to go along. Mountaineers and soldiers find them very useful when moving heavy equipment in the mountainous regions. In areas where the heavy monsoons easily flood the rivers, and boatmen are afraid to ferry across, elephants can he used for ferrying loads and people across the river. With their heavy bulky bodies and tall stature they are able to withstand the strong current and can drift along diagonally to the other bank. In the snowbound areas of Tibet, Yaks are used for carrying loads. Their thick fur provides them with protection against the cold.\n\nThe most well-known beast of burden used by potters and woodcutters, and an important character in many a fairy tale, is the donkey. Dull and stupid, the donkey is a common enough sight in some countries. Associated with stubbornness, the poor beast is often given a bad thrashing for this trait.\n\nThese animals which help man carry loads have been responsible for the beginnings of trade. and merchants have carried their goods and traveled on them from one country to another. They were also used in war. especially horses and elephants. Now man has eliminated and rendered superfluous their help in some areas but it is not possible for him to do so entirely. The bullock cart and the horse drawn carriage have still their glamour and their utility."

Today man is busy keeping up with the Joneses. he is the company of his kind in the rat race that he runs. It is no longer a question of survival but a question of acquisition - acquiring more worldly goods, having more money to hoard and to spend.\n\nMost of us do not feel happy when there is nothing to do. Those who are able to enjoy what they do and those who are able to do what they enjoy are indeed very lucky. But even these people need a change. A person who is doing an office job or busy with books welcomes a walk in the evening, half an hour in the garden, a drink with a friend. And a person who has been working in a factory or in a field would definitely enjoy a visit to a restaurant, an hour to go through the newspaper. watch television. It is not only the nature of one's work which conditions one's choice of recreative activity; intellectual and cultural development is also an important factor.\nThose people who do not know how to enjoy their leisure and do not allow themselves to recoup lose their efficiency. No one can continue at the same rate of efficiency over an indefinite period. Just as the body needs sleep, the mind needs rest and change. That is why the hobbies which one cultivates and the activities which keep one busy are referred to as recreative; they help to recreate something which has been spent and utilized. People who only know about their work and are perpetually engrossed in it do not recreate that part of themselves which is spent. Thus they either break down under the strain or merely tag along automatically. They make very poor conversationalists and do not have well-integrated personalities. Over the years they lose their mental alertness and become confined to the narrow limits of their jobs. This is not to decry hard work. Work is necessary and only those who work hard are able to achieve something. But at the same time one must know how to relax no matter for how short a period. Relaxation does not mean only sleeping or idling; it also means finding something satisfying and meaningful to do. Otherwise life becomes monotonous and dull."

        "content": "Have you ever heard of somebody called Nosey Parker? Or one Mrs. Grundy? If you have not I am sure one day you will. One thing most of us cannot successfully do is mind our own business. If you ask me the truth I would say we are in some measure fond of being busy bodies: people who take interest in what is happening to others and interfering with suggestions and advice. We live under the delusion that we are very wise and capable, while others round us are not. Therefore we are liberal with advice, sometimes genuinely required. at other times not needed and perhaps all the time not heeded.\nThe worst of it is that when our help or advice is needed we are afraid to give it. There may be various reasons. We are afraid perhaps because the person who is in need of it is some person of significance and thus we are not willing to bell the cat even if the cat is raising a storm round its head. At other times we find it convenient to mind our own business if giving advice or help involves danger or the risk of disfavor. We keep ourselves to ourselves and do not extend some friendly human warmth or understanding. Similarly if there has been a roadside accident and someone is badly injured most of us are afraid of being involved in a police case and therefore do not attach importance to the person who may be dying. Similarly, if there is a fight or a theft, or some other episode requiring physical courage, many people stay away. The cases which I have cited above are not the ones justifying the keeping of oneself to oneself. Where courage and support are required we should not find a convenient excuse by saying that we are minding our own business.\n\nMinding one's own business is important in many other spheres. It is no concern of ours if the little boy in the neighboring house has broken somebody's pane, or the boss's daughter is marrying a factory hand. It is no concern of ours if the lady across the street is a year older than her husband or the local grocer is a millionaire. We should not really be bothered if Nancy has failed in the examination. These are insignificant things in life and if we interfere we will only he adding fuel to the fire and causing a great deal of trouble. In such affairs one should be reserved and stick to one's own affairs.\n\nBut there is also a time and a place not to mind one's own business. Emotional or social reserve should not bind one to the needs of the others. In Western society, there is an undue emphasis on strictly sticking to one's business and this has resulted in the loneliness of the old people who live either by themselves or in homes for old people. It is a matter of concern and also of deep regret that men have not yet learnt to discriminate when to speak up for others, when to interfere and advise and when not to do so. For those of us who lack the finer sense of judgment, it would be wise to mind one's own business."

        "content": "In spite of being so strongly rooted in law and its related disciplines, the concept of justice continues to be elusive primarily because it belongs to both morality and law and at times the two may clash. Initially justice was related to religion; peopled lived and died in the hope of divine justice and equity. But man's concern and involvement with the earthly temporal laws necessitated the formation of rules for the administration of authority and to help maintain law and order. Ordinarily justice should be viewed in its double capacity as reward for the good and obedient and punishment for the deviant but unfortunately right from the beginning of human society it has been associated with retributive or punitive punishment. Amongst the ancient Greeks the Greek goddess Nemesis was the goddess of vengeance. This one sided view of justice is also there because the wronged and the deprived clamor for it. Francis Bacon was wise enough to see this; he once commented that revenge is \"a kind of wild justice\". But one must realize that this is not the only function of justice and men should see it only in relation to their wrongs.\nIt is difficult to identity law with justice. There may be times when the law may be strict and unfair or may not cater to the exception. It may not cater to the human emotions involved and the legal justice may appear to be very lopsided to the ordinary viewer. For example the take case of Shylock extracting his pound of flesh from Antonio in Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice\". In this case. the law is being used for vindictiveness and not justice. It is the occasion of Portia's famous speech about justice and mercy where she says \"earthly power doth then show likes[ God's when mercy seasons justice\". And even the law recognizes the place of mercy as the innumerable interpretation of the same law leads one to believe. Shylock clamors loudly for justice but when the bond is interpreted literally as a pound of Rash and no more and no less, and without a drop of blood, he waives his claim. Thus justice is for him a one-sided concept.\n\nAn eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth is the old punitive concept for justice rising out of anger, helplessness and the longing for revenge. This is not justice; it is merely retaliation and does not achieve much for the past cannot he undone. It is true that in some cases it may act as a deterrent for men are deterred by fear of punishment. Men of the legal profession and psychologists are increasingly of the view that due attention should be paid to the factors and the pressures which may have influenced the behavior of the culprit."

        "content": "The October 1973 Arab-Israeli war startled the world out of its sleepy indifference to wars taking place in distant parts of the world. The impact of the war was felt not only by governments and politicians but by almost everyone. For the oil-producing Arab countries enforced an oil boycott of nations not politically sympathetic to them, restricted the supply to many others and raised the price of oil for all concerned. Thus whether one owned a car, or rode in a bus, or transported goods, or cooked food - he was affected by this restriction.\nOil and its related products are widely used all over the world as a source of energy. Petroleum and diesel have become more than a necessity in this world of machines. Gas is used not only for cooking but also for central heating and various other plants. There are innumerable other by-products like bitumen and tar which are required for building roads and runways; vaseline, plastic, synthetic nylon, insecticides and pesticides, and some medicines are also amongst the by-products. Consequently the prices of all these things were affected. Recent research has also produced protein from petroleum. With so many things being affected, the oil boycott created a worldwide crisis for the non-oil producing countries were badly hit. Other countries which were not affected by the boycott were compelled to impose self rationing for no country could afford to continue buying the same amount of oil and upset its budget and payments. War, without sufficient supply of oil, could not also go on. Thus oil is needed for both peace and war for health and leisure and for countless other needs.\n\nBut every cloud has a silver lining and the same is true of the oil crisis. It provide the necessary impetus to man's resourcefulness, and people all over the world have begun looking for substitutes for oil. The oil crisis has been like a warning from nature - if all the known oil resources are exhausted, what is man going to do ? It has also hastened oil exploration in other countries, particular South-East Asian Countries. Offshore drilling in India has been fruitful and rewarding. Indonesia has found new oil wells.\n\nIran, by staying out of the oil boycott, has proven two things : that in business, politics has a limited role to play and that the better businessman is perhaps the winner in the end. It continued to supply oil to Israel, it has also modernized its defense equipment in the process. Other oil producing countries have also benefited from the price rise. Kuwait is rapidly succeeding with its plans for industrialization and social welfare. Singapore's oil industry accounts for one third of its manufacturing output. It can boast of being South-East Asia's largest oil refinery and this has spurred investment in related industries like construction of factories for hunkering and the manufacture of lubricating oils.\nSixty percent of the world's known oil reserves are, however, in the Gulf countries and their use of this as a political weapon has helped restore the balance of power. Industrialized countries like Japan and the whole of western Europe are dependent on them for the oil supply and this has checked any further exploitation of nature's so called raw materials.\n\nBesides oil, diesel and petroleum products. there is also another kind of oil which is not used in machines but it provides the necessary energy and fuel for the human body - and this is the cooking oil. Oil is extracted from peanuts and coconuts. They not only help to cook a delicious meal but also supply strength. Their use is also not meant to he indiscriminate. Man must learn to both preserve and conserve energy."

        "content": "When we think a little about it we notice that of all the creatures in the world, only a few of them mate for life. One such creature is man. Even in the case of humans we see that this idea of marrying and living together permanently is a recent development. Considering that man has been on earth for five million years. the institution of marriage is not more than ten or twenty thousand years old. One thing becomes clear from this: Marriage is a feature of evolution. It is probably something that is the result of experimentation and discovery that this is the best way. Seeing that marriage is an institution among peoples dispersed all over the world and most often a part of their religions, we are also led to think that this is something that is within man as an instinct -- like walking on two legs. It is natural.\nObservation of the system allows us to see some of the benefits. A man and woman who marry, give their children legitimacy. The laws of most lands, established centuries ago, make it very clear that only children from marriage have certain rights - like rights of inheritance. Also, children out of wedlock are despised in most communities. So in order to give the children good lives, couples must marry. It is wrong for anyone to make decisions for unborn children just because it is convenient for the parties themselves.\n\nAs for living together, it is the best way. We learn from couples who live with each other for life that there is a certain closeness and intimacy which they have developed. This closeness is valuable to life; like a long and lasting friendship. They will look after each other during bad times and nurse each other. They will develop what is best in each other through the close support which is usually not available if the partnership is a short term one. They can share properties and build up a family together. Having a home with children and a family is the best arrangement for us.\n\nFrom observation we see that this is what is good for humanity as well. In a home, the father and mother share the responsibilities in developing their families. This has shown that children from such homes develop into upright persons. Children from homes that split up, on the other hand, go through traumatic experiences and are often disadvantaged. For future generations too, therefore, marriage and staying in the marriage is the best thing to do.\n\nHence, marriage and permanent relationships between a man and a woman lead to good lives for the parties involved and for the children born of such marriages. Moreover it is also good socially for the community to he organized in families. This has been found to be the best arrangement. Such being the case, it is very important that people marry and live together permanently."

        "content": "We all would have had some situations in our lives when we had been overly anxious. If we recall what actually happened, no doubt we would realize that at the time of the incident, we were not in control of ourselves. It would also probably be true that if we had kept cool instead of being anxious, we would have dealt with the situation in a better manner. There are some memories we have of people, perhaps of ourselves, who fared badly in a game or in a race because he was not cool. How about the footballer who missed the goal because he was anxious rather than cool, or the badminton player who lost because he was not cool or the man who failed his driving test because he was not cool ? These are common occurrences. The more serious ones are like when a person fails to get a job because he is not cool during an interview.\nAccording to experts, a person is anxious because he is afraid that he might fail. Then he fails because he is anxious. This is a vicious circle. The solution seems to be that a person has a better chance of succeeding in anything if he is confident of success; since that confidence would keep him cool. To get to the bottom of this, it is necessary to see why a person is afraid to fail. The obvious answer seems to be that he has failed before in the same or in a similar situation and is afraid that it would happen again. The solution seems to be obvious: To cure the spell of anxiety, the person should not think of the times he failed but of the times he succeeded. This may not be as easy as it sounds.\n\nThe fact is that a person is anxious by habit and what needs curing is the habit itself. An excellent and practical technique has been suggested by some experts. In order to keep cool, a typically anxious person should list down all the failures (or lack of successes) in his life. For each of these he should find an area of success - preferably greater than the area of failure. For example. the footballer who is anxious whenever he is taking a penalty kick (probably because he had missed on other occasions), should think of the times when he had scored a really difficult goal. What happens is that he programs his mind to think of the successes he has had whenever the thought of failure comes to his mind. He uses the negative to trigger the positive. If he does this several times on his own, he will develop a positive attitude. As soon as he develops that, he is coolness itself. One question arises immediately : What if a person has never known success in the area he wants to ? The experts say that this is easily resolved. The same result can be achieved by just pretending the good experiences. It seems that the mind cannot tell the difference between a real experience and an imagined one. In other words, you will benefit by imagining good things happening to you.\n\nConstant practice is necessary in order to keep cool. After continual practice - perhaps for a few months - a person becomes cool. It is assured by practitioners that keeping cool will give us a richer and better life."

        "title": "Women should be paid the same wages as men",
        "content": "The equality of women with men is a new concept and has been raging for sometime now. It was an article of faith that women were subservient to men and were glad and happy to play their role at home and to preside over the destiny of the household. They were happy to bring up a healthy family and see their sons and daughters well placed in life. They looked after many chores of the house and it came naturally to them. Quite recently indeed when women began seeking career, the question of equality and the equal wages for the same work as men do, has come up.\nWomen were looked upon for long as weaker sex and they were to be protected by men. History has it in abundance to prove this. In peace and war, and in councils it was men who had wedded power though there had been cases of brave and wise women who could decide the fate of a country. But it was far and few between. Now that women have taken to careering; their equality has come up and we find women in factories and offices working along with men. Hence it is only natural that they demand the same wages.\n\nThe case against them is that they are physically weak and so cannot do the same quantum of work as men. But it has not been proved in practice. Whenever women are found to be more efficient and capable they deserve better attention. They do work neatly and quickly too because by nature women are fastidious. As a rule whatever they do, they do it better and in a nicer way. This fact cannot be shrugged off. Another reason why women are preferred to men nowadays is they are not distracted so easily and arc not so argumentative as men. At the worst in bad situations they resort to tears whereas men start fighting.\n\nIf women arc paid less, it may be because people feel they are not as productive as men. It may be because they get tired easily and cannot work longer hours as men. Another reason is the mobility in women from one work to another, or from one place to another. Hence the employer manipulating this situation, bargains to his advantage. The clamour for equal wages for equal work has not only caught the imagination of women but also men and has been gaining momentum. It is only natural they should ask, for their rights to be recognised without any insidious distinction between men and women especially in the matter of wages at public level, i.e in the government. So more and more women are seeking careers which were once the preserve of men folk. But the distinction of the sexes is certainly still prevalent for those in private employment. This, one may hope, is to become a thing of the past. In fact because of their concentration and nimble fingers in certain industries women are preferred to men, for instance in the electronic industry. One thing is certain it should be a case of division of labour and not competition, so that it would not tell on the social fabric of the future society."

        "content": "Private tuition as against what is being done in regular school is resorted to, in certain cases where the pupil is not able to follow his lessons well and wants to improve his performance. In some cases the parents want to make their child sit at his studies and in others it is a matter of prestige.\nWhatever the reasons may be for private tuition, it can certainly complement and supplement the class work provided the teacher and his ward cooperate. It can be complementary when the lessons done in the class have not been fully understood by the student and he may have to be told more than to impress upon, him for the lesson done in the class may not have caught his brain. For this reason, tuition at home may be the answer.\n\nGenerally a class room is not conducive for individual teaching. The teacher-pupil interaction highly spoken of is not possible in the class. A teacher normally tries to avoid a dull student. So, such a student may fail to catch the eye of the teacher. In such cases private tuition may be helpful. The pupil may not only be taught but also be made to work at exercises which they would normally avoid in class. If the tuition master is earnest, the pupils can progress and improve gradually.\n\nSome of the topics that arc not covered in the class or which requires supplementary reading could very well be done in the tuition hour. Additional exercises could be done, better reading is possible which may lead to better comprehension. Discussion and dialogue may lead to better understanding.\n\nPrivate tuition becomes necessary where the student would not be capable of sitting at his studies by himself because he has no inclination or the parents have no time to look at their child's academic progress. Most pampered children need a private tutor as a permanent feature.\n\nFrom the examination point of view some may seek tuition. The students who want to achieve very good results in competitive courses may resort to tuition. This has become a common practice for getting seats in medical, engineering and technological courses. An ordinary classroom lecture does not cater to the needs of such students. For many aristocratic families, it is a prestige to arrange for tuition in music and dancing.\n\nLet us now look at the abuses. Tuition may lead to too much of pampering and may kill the self effort of the student. The student would not touch the book unless the tuition master turns up. Instead of his working and learning on his own he becomes so dependant on the tuition master that ultimately the gain would be perceptibly nil.\n\nThere are also pupils adopting devious means through the tuition masters to get a pass. The poor tuition master makes himself cheap and worries more about the promotion of his ward than about his own children. Often, it is not uncommon to see a boy having more than one tuition master for each one of his subjects. Because he pays for the tuition, he looks down upon the poor teacher who is likely to lose his dignity.\n\nBut one fact that stands foremost is that tuitions cannot be thorough learning and at best there can only be nibblings of the learning process as the student has recourse for likely questions that may come in the examination through the tuition teacher.\n\nIn order to avoid the evils of private tuition, educational institutions themselves may arrange tutorial classes. If the regular teachers cannot attend to the tutorials special tutors may be appointed to attend to very small groups of needy students. Such contacts may help build confidence in the student. Such tutorial classes may be complementary as well as supplementary. The tutorial system when properly organised will go a long way to improve the efficiency of the student."

With its hills and dales, green valleys, murmuring rivers and silence only to be broken by the chirping of birds, and the buzzing of beetles, the attraction will be endless. One must be a seeker and be willing to keep company with nature, be physically hardy and resolute to face hardships have a philosophical attitude and be poetically inclined to enjoy the pleasures of camping in the highlands. It would be to have one or two companions to share the joy and adventures of camping in the highlands.\nFor a city-bred person who is accustomed to noise, dust, smells and all sorts of pollutions, camping in the highlands has its thrills from sunrise to sunset. One may study the habits of birds and animals. One may enjoy the sky at night with its sentinel stars. One also can find time to read, draw or reflect. That is why most of the saints of the world sought the peace of caves and mountains.\n\nTo enjoy camping, one must be familiar with forest craft even though one need not be an expert. For instance, one must enjoy walking, be able to climb trees and hills, be able to satisfy with simple food which he has to prepare, and revere the habitat of animals. He must be able to pitch his tent and know how to go about preparing the camp site.\n\nA tent when properly set up will give a certain amount of protection against wind and rain as well as shelter for sleeping. A provision box should be well provided with necessary things for making food, a few plates, cups and saucers and other necessary items for cooking. One must take pleasure in cooking, otherwise there mustn't be enough food to last for the period of camping. A radio set or a casette player with a selected list of tapes would help drive away the silence and loneliness of the night. Anyway before going on a camp one must plan well to avoid disappointments. Above all what is needed is a mind to enjoy it.\n\nGreat philosophers and writers have praised the value of camping in the great open. For instance, R. L. Stevenson praises such a life in his 'night among the pines'. Thoreau, the American philosopher has a lot to say about such a life far from the maddening crowd.\n\nIt I will certainly enlarge ones views of life and may help one to see the hands of God shaping nature around us."

Everyone is given with certain talents and one should make full use of them for ones future welfare and happiness. Some people desire to make money, some to make a name and some to be useful to society. So I have decided to become a social worker and serve the poor, the suffering and the needy.\n\nThis idea of becoming a social worker has not come to me all of a sudden. In a way it has been the result of reading the lives of great men and women who dedicated their lives to the service of the suffering. From Gautama the Buddha to Mother Theresa I have studied something about their lives and how they suffered and worked for others. Gautama the prince became the Buddha after seeing the sufferings of his people. Much nearer there are instances of Father Damien who lived and died for the sake of the lepers. Dr. Schweitzer obeyed a call and went to Central Africa and served the people by establishing a hospital at Lambarene. Then there is the example of Gandhi who worked to improve the lot of the so-called untouchables who were social outcasts. He called them affectionately the Harijans or the people of God. Then there is Mother Theresa who got the coveted Nobel Prize for peace for her service to the sick, the suffering and the dying in the streets of Calcutta. The more I read about them and the more I thought of them I too was interested in becoming a social worker. After all what is the point of being a human being if one cannot serve his fellow beings. True, good samaritans are rare; but there is nothing wrong in a person trying to become one.\n\nTo become a good samaritan is not easy. One must be prepared and get mentally the necessary training for it. As the saying goes \"charity begins at home\". So I started helping my people at home in every possible way. I would help mother in her kitchen, my father in polishing his shoes, wash and iron the family clothes and other house chores. I also started helping my neighbors once in a way by running errands for them. I began loving the old people, visiting the slum areas and talk to people about their difficulties. I would also go round collecting my old clothes and distributing them to the poor.\n\nIt was not exactly what I did but it also how I reacted. My mental make up was ready to serve, once I erased the self. So as a social worker, I was not on the look out for any personal gain whenever I did something for someone.\nTo become a social worker I began studying some books on sociology to know something about it. Theory was not enough; so I got into touch with several societies doing social work. For example, there is the Red Cross Society doing a good lot of work both in peace and war. There are also other voluntary organizations doing social work.\n\nThere are of course difficulties on the way. My parents never approved because my career as a social worker did not bring any money or fame. Life itself may be hard as a social worker and, until one's work is recognized one may not be regarded as genuine and is appreciated. Even friends may scoff at the notion and even society itself may be suspicious till one's bona fides are proved.\n\nStill after taking all these into consideration, I have made up my mind to become a social worker."

As the place of worship was about 75 kilometres from their homes they had left at 2.00 a.m. in the night. They were about a dozen of them including men and women. Since they were going in their own van they had many trunks and suitcases stuffed with valuables like costly clothing, jewels and ornaments. They belonged to the neo rich, and were a hit showy.\n\nThe road lay through a barren country covered here and there with hillocks. It was a road that did not have any heavy traffic and that too in the early hours it was practically deserted. The area was notorious for daring robberies as the hillocks gave the robbers a good cover. The robbers heard the van on the road and they expected a good booty from it. The moon was not bright as the clouds were sweeping over its face and was ideal for the gang to operate. The gang was made up of unemployed educated young men who had grown desperate. It was master-minded by an old hand who had been convicted several times.\n\nThe gang had placed big boulders as road blocks and were hiding nearby. As soon as the van came near, the driver saw the block. He could not negotiate the road this way or that as it was completely blocked and so came to a screeching halt. When the male occupants of the van got down to see what had happened. the gang pounced upon them. They were told to keep their mouths shut. When the driver wanted to strike, he was given a stunning blow by one of the robbers. The male occupants were then marched to the foot of a hillock and were commanded to stand still or face severe consequences to their person. While two or three of the robbers stood guard, others ransacked the van, took out the trunks and suit cases, broke them open and poured out the contents onto blankets and tied them up. The women were so stunned that they could not even cry out. Their throats felt parched suddenly because of the shock they were in. With a flourish the robbers left the place with their booty and disappeared into the night.\n\nIt was some time before the pilgrims recovered from the shock. The womenfold began to wail. As it happened in such cases each one started complaining that the others was to blame. The van driver lost no time in driving them to the nearest town where they lodged a complaint with the police.\n\nThis was not the first time the police were getting reports about robberies in that part of the country. The higher authorities swung into action immediately when they got a clue from a tea shop in a neighboring village. The net was spread and soon a few of the gang were apprehended. Since they were habitual offenders, it was easy to bring them to book. The press and the public appreciated the prompt action taken by the police."

When a child leaves the school he may lead a useful life.\n\nBut in the traditional school, the child was supposed to learn mainly the 3 R's. So the chalk board and the text books were the main stay of the teacher who was to shape the character of the child. Rote memory was insisted upon and examinations were based on this learning technique. There was not much of a difference from year to year on the way children were tested. The examinations conducted did not test all the faculties of the child. So it was necessary for those who got through examinations to be trained afterwards. In short, children were very rarely taught to ]cam for themselves. This had continued for so Tong and the practice had to be abolished.\n\nOnce this was realized many new methods of teaching were tried and many new aids had been used for a better education of children. Today the school is a very complicated organization; the teacher is no longer the sole arbiter. The children instead of being passive listeners, have been made active participants. They are handling, feeling, planning, creating and learning with newer tools and aids that the subjectivity has given place to healthy objectivity.\n\nIn order to make education relevant and meaningful, children are exposed to almost life like situations. They must know how to five as good citizens and honest members of society. The way the school creates situations with these ends in views is important. The ideal school must be run as a republic, the Headmaster or the Principal may preside over the Republic, the lecturers serving as counselors and councilors, the students being the citizens.\n\nOn the intellectual side the library and the laboratory must play a vital role. They complement and supplement more and more and the use of the library and the laboratory must be encouraged through proper assignments. The playing field, the various camps, the many organizations like the Junior Red Cross, Scouting, etc have to be fully utilized to shape the character of the child. Beside the text books, there are other aids for learning. They must be judiciously used. In fact, there are hundreds of ways in which the audio-visual aids can be used with advantage.\n\nExaminations must not be used to show the weakness but must be a yardstick for proving the all-round education of the student. The questions must be objective and reliable. The examinations must be welcomed by the students. In order to satisfy the diverse population there must he diversity in programs, approaches, resources and aims and room for experiment. Examinations should be a challenge for students.\n\nThe world is shrinking and nobody can feel parochial, so education must equip students for world understanding and world citizenry. Science and technology must find their place in any scheme of education.\n\nAny system of education must help turn out a fully developed and all-rounded personality."

        "content": "We shall call him Mr. X. He was a brilliant young man, an all- rounder and was popular. No wonder he chose to become a teacher and he did become one. He put himself to his tasks with heart and soul and no wonder he became popular very soon. He could be seen in the field, he would be called to address a students' audience, and he would be the foremost in organizing any school function. Thus he became the favorite of the Headmaster, and the envy of some of his seniors.\n\nTo mar his reputation something serious happened. It was the annual examination and the question papers were being set. Naturally, Mr. X being the confidant of the Headmaster was helping the latter in collecting the question papers and sending them to the press.\n\nBut suddenly like a bolt from the blue, two days before the Mathematics examination, the question paper was out and it was in the hands of every boy. At first the news was a whisper and then it became public. There was commotion in the school and the matter reached the ears of the Headmaster. Indeed it was a shock to him and he could not rush into any conclusion. He was a mature person but the teachers began to view Mr. X with suspicion and though they never blamed him openly they spread rumors that Mr. X had a hand in the pilfering of the question papers.\n\nThe rumor reached the ears of the Headmaster. Formally he spoke to Mr. X about the leakage of the question papers and secretly arranged for a fresh set of papers to be also printed through Mr. X. So on the day of the examination the new set of papers was given to the surprise and shock of all.\n\nMr. X had been worried when his colleagues looked upon him with suspicion and the boys too began talking about his alleged complicity in the leakage. The matter didn't stop there. It had reached the ears of the management and so the Secretary wanted the Headmaster to hold on enquiry into the conduct of Mr. X in this affair. Poor Mr. X had been spending sleepless nights and wanted to clear his name.\n\nMr. X started enquiring from the boys how they had got the paper. But the clue was not easily forthcoming as the boys refused to talk. Mr. X would not take defeat. After all he was popular and there were a few boys who were devoted to him. So Mr. X caught hold of one such boy and promised him complete secrecy and protection. The boy was reluctant at first but at last began slowly yielding to persuasion. He told Mr. X how he got hold of the copy of the question paper and also the modus operandi behind the debacle.\n\nIt had all happened this way. The question paper packets had been sent by post to the press to be printed. The packets were sent through the peon to the post office. One of the boys who was poor in Mathematics and who wanted to pass bought the peon with a bribe and got the question paper packets from him. He had it copied and then repacked the original packet and posted it.\n\nThe boy with the question paper could not keep his secret contained. He circulated copies of it to his intimate friends who in their turn gave it to other boys until every student was having one copy of the Mathematics paper.\n\nThe information from the boy was passed on discreetly to the Headmaster who enquired very tactfully. The boy who had actually master-minded the plan refused to speak the truth, but the peon under threat of dismissal admitted his having parted with the question papers to the boy. When confronted by the guilty peon, the boy could not hold his fort. He had to admit his guilt. Mr. X was relieved and now he could go about his duties with a clear mind.\n\nHis honor was restored by the management of the school as well as the public. Thus honesty always pays."

        "content": "Money is the instrument of exchange, helping in buying and selling and also in fixing a value on things and commodities. It may be in metal or in paper. With the market getting more and more complicated there are other negotiable instruments which are as good as the minted coins or the printed notes. Money gives purchasing power but this power is not absolute as it is on various factors. In such a case it is termed currency and according to their purchasing power they are termed hard, soft and weak. Though coins and notes are issued by the Government of the country, there is a limit to their minting.\n\nLet us see why money is needed. Simply because it helps the possesser to buy things. The days of bartering are gone though it is indirectly resorted to at international level. Money is helpful as a standard of price. Money helps the owner to have power, not only in buying things but also in influencing many human activities. Money is used to good things such as using it to build a temple, a church or a museum. Great educational institutions can be built. Students can be helped by providing them with scholarships in furthering their studies. The Nobel Prize would not have been there but for the huge sum of money earned by Alfred Nobel.\n\nMoney can buy men as it does things. Thus money play an important role in fighting and winning elections. Money mars men's and women's morals. It is the evil influence in corrupting peoples. 'Sell out' is the new term used for bribery. There are people who could do anything for the sake of money. Moneyed people can buy many things which the poor cannot do.\n\nWith the power of money individuals as well as states can dictate terms. The Middle East countries have found new wealth because of their oil deposits and they have become a very powerful group.\n\nThis kind of power should not go to one's head. One should remember that the money coming into him was by chance. He must not use it for evil purposes. But wherever there is evil there is usually money involved. Other motivating forces for evil action are jealousy, vengeance, hatred and so on.\n\nMoney is normally the fruit of labor. The question is how one spends that money. Great thinkers have suggested that one who has money enough and enough to spare must look upon himself as the trustee of the money and see to it that it is spent in a wise and useful way. There is nothing good or evil about money. It depends on how one puts it to. The same money which could help bring relief to the suffering millions, can be used to build up armaments. The hope of getting money spurs one into action. The power decides how to spend the money. Money can be used morally or immorally. A morally strong man may not use money in evil ways and vice versa."

        "content": "Gambling is playing for some stake. Gambling may be for fun or for gain but very often it is the latter. Gambling started from very ancient times and it has been a pastime of the rich as well as the poor. In modem times gambling has extended to many fields. For instance, speculation on a football game is nothing but gambling. Gambling at horse races is very common and millions of money change hands in a day's race and for every one gain there may be thousands of losers. Gambling maniac has spoiled many a family and even kingdoms have been lost. A classical case is that of the Pandavas in the Mahabharatha who lost their share of the kingdom in gambling. Since gambling involves sudden profits, it leads to all sorts of malpractices. Hence gambling has been despised and no sensible man would indulge in it because just like liquor, it can ruin those who indulge in it.\n\nHowever, people do indulge in it because more often than not a quick profit is expected. So when a man plays cards by way of gambling he thinks he can make some quick and easy money. In certain instances thousands of dollars change hands. Funfairs arc gambling places and many types of gambling arc there and people crowd there to make some quick money if they can. Horse racing is a licensed gambling. Tens of thousands of people go to the races and bet their money on this horse or the other. There are race addicts, who at the risk of losing all, go and bet. From ancient times the dice has been a form of gambling. There is gambling at established markets, for example, at the cotton market.\n\nThe attendant evils of gambling are many. A man loses all his money to others. He becomes a debtor and is ruined. The gambling maniac can lead to other evils like thefts, fraud and even in some cases murder. The family of a habitual gambler cannot be happy because they cannot say what would happen if the mania loses all his money. A gambler is not at all dependable and hence society always shuns him.\n\nThe question is, can gambling be abolished ? Since gambling nowadays is licensed, it has brought huge revenues for the governments as in the case of horse race, card clubs, fun-fairs and so on. Even raffles run by Governments and private bodies must be abolished on moral grounds because they involve gambling and fraud.\n\nBy abolishing gambling legally it cannot be wiped out completely. speculative tendencies in man leads to gambling. So, unless this tendency is removed gambling would be there and their removal is best achieved by moral and religious education. We will have to strengthen the will of our children through education and in doing so the home and the school and of course the Government have a moral duty."

        "content": "Road accidents are common nowadays because of the fast moving vehicles, congestion on the roads and careless drivers. In trying to overtake or knocking against another vehicle accidents occur. It may be a false move involving collision in which lives may be lost.\n\nWhen one is at the scene of an accident one can help to attend to the victim. If there are cuts and blood is oozing try to arrest the blood. If the cut is deep one can apply a torniquet. If the wound is dirty, clean it with water and tie a bandage. If there is a fracture, try to support it with a bandage or a piece of a cloth. If the fracture is complicated simply tie a bandage. If the victim is about to swoon from bloody wounds give some cold drinks, never any hot drinks. In the case of an ordinary fainting, some hot coffee may be helpful.\n\nFirst the crowd must be cleared so that the patient may get fresh air. If possible the patient's possessions must be secured. Note the number of the vehicle involved. It may be useful later on in helping the patient at the court or to get insurance benefits. The police must be informed. This is very important to avoid complications.\n\nArrange to transport the patient to the nearest hospital for delay could mean a life in danger. Talk to the hospital authorities and see that quick action is taken. In very serious case you can phone up the hospital for an ambulance. If the address of the patient is known, his near and dear one has to be informed. After having seen to the comfort of the patient make a report to the police.\n\nAll that have been mentioned can be done by an experienced hand. It is useful for every citizen to have some training in dealing with accidents. That is why first aid lessons are taught in schools, in scouting activities and Junior Red Cross Classes.\n\nIf people are indifferent it is not because they do not want to help but the difficulties involved in going for help. An accident may involve going to the court several times causing a lot of inconvenience, especially of time and work but, it is the moral duty of every citizen to help victims of accidents and not to be a silent and helpless witness."

If this is done ably then that paper is popular. There are very many great newspapers in the world like the Times of London, New York Times, Manchester Guardian, Le Monde, The Times of India, The 'Hindu' and so on. These papers depend on the reporters and its representatives for the news.\nA reporter may be permanent or special. Big papers have their permanent representatives in important cities. A reporter must be well qualified and must be proficient in the language he uses and must have a university degree, especially in literature and humanities though there arc reporters who are proficient in sciences. He must have an eye for news and report it in attractive language. He must have a taste for many kinds of arts too to be able to give a critical view.

        "content": "The weekend or holiday is a concept which came up with the observation of Sabbath as a holiday by Christians who regard it as God's Day. The idea is kept true to form and so the weekend has come to stay with all nations and countries with the exception of the Islamic countries. There Friday is the weekend instead of Sunday. Whatever the idea may be schools and other institutions observe Sunday as a holiday.\nWhether there should or shouldn't be school on Sunday is a matter of opinion. Let us first see the case for the school working on Sunday. Most of the parents may be for it. For children at home on Sunday make life a hell for parents. They neither revise nor do their homework. They make a lot of noise and there is no end to their mischief. The parents find it difficult to concentrate on their work because children come in the way. Hence for all these reasons they feel that the school should work even on Sundays.\n\nSince education is a continuous process there need not be a Sunday. Just as our organs work continuously, the process of education must also be continuous. The break upsets the course since very often no useful work is done and when they come to school there is the feeling of Monday blues. Rest does not mean break from work. Very few children will be bent on any serious work during holiday. There is a lot of idleness. Rest period in between work is desirable rather than a day long of rest. The stiffness of the limbs which goes with the long rest can be seen with the stiffness of learning process after a Sunday. Hence people argue schools should work even on Sunday.\n\nBut there are people who insist on the weekend because people need rest after an Arduous and taxing week. The rest will refresh them, and some freedom from the frame of time tables and discipline is desirable for the young minds.\n\nTeachers need the weekend off to do serious preparation for the coming week. They also need some time to attend to their personal needs. They may even engage themselves in leisure activities in which even pupils may take part.\n\nSince parents are also having a holiday they would like to spend sonic time with their children. It will help them to look into the books and notebooks of the child or perhaps help the child to do some holiday homework. For instance, there is the weekend washing. It may be worthwhile to visit places or friends that day. Hence the weekend is a necessity."

        "content": "With the fast growth of civilization there is also an ever mounting need for energy. Energy may be in the form of fuels or electricity. The world appears to have reactivated energy to a liquid fuel like petrol. This is likely to be exhausted in the course of a few years at the rate man is using it. Electricity depends on oil or water resources and when oil goes, water resources cannot keep up with the demand. Everybody is caught up with the problem of conservation of energy.\nTo meet the challenge various methods have been suggested. One Is to suppress the demand. Rationing has to be brought in by means of legislation so that non-essential consumption may be brought to the minimum. In fact this is being done when the power supply becomes chronically short. There can be a power cut. During certain hours of the day the power supply can shut down, thus power is saved or conserved for better use. Energy conservation is possible through modernization of plant and equipment. In fact where obsolete equipment is in use it can be replaced by modem, energy saving ones. Energy can he saved at domestic level by better house keeping. Modern gadgets consuming energy should he used only when they are absolutely necessary. Luxury items like the television, radio and record player can be used sparingly. Wasteful usage of lights can be avoided. Meaningless illumination must be given up. In industries through adopting quality control measures, energy can be saved. It is also possible by reorganizing and streamlining systems through structural changes as in modernizing equipment. For example by adopting a better design in electrical motors, efficiency can be improved.\n\nEnergy can be saved on transport by the following methods. People should commute by the rail rather than by cars and vans. Animal drawn vehicles may be encouraged for very short distances. This is being done in countries where there is a village economy and animals like bullocks are not scarce. The transport system must be improved with a view to sparing the energy. Cities must be planned in such a way that the commuting distance is minimized.\n\nIn industry many things could be done to reduce waste of energy or to economize energy. The maintenance may be tightened; waste heat must be utilized properly. If systems arc streamlined, economy in fuel could be obtained. Instead of using materials requiring higher energy, those which require lower energy can be used. By effecting minor changes in the existing plants, economy in energy could be achieved.\n\nEnergy question is a major global problem and is drawing the attention of all. But we can hope man with his ever rising urge for existence will cope up with this major and the most urgent problem and find alternatives."

        "title": "\"To overeat is as great as the evil to starve\" - Discuss",
        "content": "Eating is a matter of habit and upbringing. What one eats and how one eats depend on various circumstances. One may overeat when there is variety and abundance to go through as in a buffet dinner where people tend to overeat.\nThe evils of overeating are many. The organs arc overtaxed. The stomach and the other digestive organs have to function beyond their capacity to help in digestion. As the digestive system is overtaxed, the needed energy does not reach the brains and so the person who always overeats is like a python. The efficiency will be low and slow and a person is not able to sustain long hours of concentration. Obesity may be the result which again tells on the efficiency of the limbs and their movements. An obese person is again uncouth and ugly and becomes a laughing stock in public. Obesity leads to diseases like heart failure. Then take a look at the cost of overeating. Because one overeats his bill of fare will be high. Again by overeating one deprives another of his legitimate food. This is an important factor to be remembered by certain people who because of affluence do overeat. The excess food may conveniently be shared with those unfortunate ones who are not having enough food. Humanitarian societies help in the distribution of food to the needy.\n\nOvereating is only a matter of habit. The parents have got a duty in teaching children to form good eating habits. They should not be given beyond their need. We have got a lesson to learn from animals which do not overeat and hence they keep up their energy and efficiency. We should not become a slave to our taste because our systems do not require so much of food.\n\nIf overeating is an evil, starving is equally bad because the organs don't get the necessary food for their efficiency. So we find people who are starved or semi starved not as efficient as the well-fed people. This is economically bad for a nation, because starved people will get fatigued very soon and the quantum of work which they turn out will be less and so detrimental to the economy of the country.\n\nStarved people suffer from anaemia, malnutrition and diseases connected with malnutrition. Semi-starved people continue to be a feature even today in certain countries where women and children suffer from malnutrition. They cannot resist diseases as the body's natural resistance becomes poor. So it is a drain on the nation's exchequer which has to meet a heavy bill in the form of hospitals. Death due to starvation has not been unknown. During famine millions of people have been wiped out but now with the advance of science and a better transport system, death by starvation is reduced.\n\nStarvation tells on the growth of children. Where children are starved, infantile mortality is very high. Starvation during pregnancy and post natal period affects both the mother and the child.\n\nWhile a person should avoid overeating, there must not be any ghost of a chance for starvation either. Providing enough food for people is every government's concern and all its economic machinery must be geared to that end. Dietary education is a must if people must be saved from overeating."

        "content": "Agriculture one of the most ancient occupations of man ever since the birth of civilization had been a rickety business till recently. The poor farmers had to depend on bullocks, buffaloes and horses for plowing. In some countries they used even camels. The plough was very crude. Traditionally the farmer knew the kind of seed and soil but when things went wrong he was helpless against natural calamities. He was following crude methods to store his food grains. The lack of proper transport was a problem. So against odds the farmer had to struggle hard.\nNow thanks to the advance of technology, a number of agricultural implements have been put into the hands of the farmer. They help him in extensive and intensive agriculture. The bulldozer is a powerful machine which helps in leveling the ground in a short time whereas in the past it would take several days of manual work. Then there is the tractor which helps the farmer in plowing. Different types of plough shares can be attached to the tractor and deep, plowing has become possible. With the traditional or drawn plough, plowing was not efficient. Even for planting the seeds like grains, potato and sugar cane, there are different types of equipment facilitating efficient performance. In vast areas harvestors are used for harvesting which can harvest and separate the grain from the dry stalk. Mechanically the grain can be taken to storage bins, or 'SILOS' which are rodent proof.\n\nChemical fertilizers have become the order of the day. Since the nature of the soil can be tested and the kind of manure a crop may need is available, a farmer can choose a suitable fertilizer to get a bumper crop. The deficiency or the weakness of the soil is known and duly corrected. Plants suffer from various diseases and there are pests which prey on them. These are being countered today with powerful pesticides and insecticides and as such the diseases are kept under control. Good seeds have become possible because of research. Hybrids which resist diseases and at the same time give high yield are now available to the willing farmer. This knowledge becomes available to the farmer through the media and agriculture department.\n\nSoil conservation methods are used so that the nature of the soil is preserved. So too in the case of water conservation. Water is not allowed to go to waste. By putting up dams across rivers, water is being stored which can be economically used and because of this, millions and millions of hectares of land have been brought under the plough increasing the production of food grain. Deep well-pumps have come to the rescue of the farmer. In the traditional method man and the animal had to sweat and labor with poor returns but, with pump sets, well irrigation had become very efficient and areas which were once almost deserts have become productive.\n\nModern methods of transport have also come to help the farmer in finding a distant market. Wheat from America can be transported to countries where people are starving.\n\nSo we find science has made agricultural inroads which is a viable contribution to the economy."

        "content": "To be greedy is to own more than what one can legitimately claim. This is very well illustrated by the parable of the greedy dog which wanted to have the bone seen in the reflection. It lost the bone thereby. That is greed. All people are greedy; it is not only the poor who are greedy but also those who are very rich. When Alexander and most conquerors went on expeditions, it was their greed to extend and expand their empire. Muhamad Gazini invaded India allured by its wealth. European nations went to the New World in search of gold and silver. Even in the United Stated people went west in search of gold. There are many instances in fact the pages of history books are replete with wars fought for this reason. Even now the super powers are not exempt from greedy expansion motives.\nTo avoid being greedy, the child must be educated. The parents at home have got a great responsibility in this respect. Children must not be allowed to have more than what they need, whether it be in food, toys or clothes. Greed and jealousy go together. Hence to avoid being jealous one should overcome greed.\n\nLet us see if the twentieth century is an age of greed. The First World War was the result of Kaiser's ambitions to build a German Empire. He was itching for it and the murder of the prince at Sarajevo was only a pretext to start a war. Then came Hitler. From the beginning he wanted to continue from where Kaiser failed. Slowly and steadily he built up an army and thus the rape of Czechoslovakia followed. At the same time Mussolini invaded Abyssinia. All these culminated in the Second World War. Japan followed the Axis partners and it started on an expansion spree. After the Second World War many small things happened which, viewed in their proper perspective, was nothing but greed. Only the offending parties gave them different names just as once they looked upon African countries as the white man's burden.\n\nGreed in modern politics appears in different guises. Look at the latest Afghan debacle in which Russia has deliberately invaded that country and has created a political unsettlement there. Russia had adopted subtle ways to expand its hegemony.\n\nLooking at modern day individuals, we can say they are in no way worse than those who had lived in previous centuries. One thing we can say that in this century which is becoming more and more materialistic, moral forces are on the wane. The influence of home and church does not seem to turn out good citizens. When man's needs were few chances for his being greedy were also minimal. Now that there is more for material possession and man growing ever greedy than before. Temptation and greed are the two sides of a coin. To overcome them moral education and a very disciplined way of life is essential.\n\nSo it can be concluded that this century alone is not an age of greed."

But circumstances changed and I had to take an irrevocable decision. I had to go where there were opportunities of employment with a good pay. I have specialized in oil engineering for which the opportunities of employment and promotion are far and few between in my country. So it is natural that I want to seek employment elsewhere. For my qualifications no other country could offer as much opportunity as the Middle East countries. Since there is an oil boom there, it is not difficult for me to get an appointment. So I embarked for Dubai to seek employment.\nNow there are a few days left for me before I leave my dear country where I was born, bred, educated and spent nearly twenty three years of my youthful life. To leave here is almost a wrench. I am proud of my country because of its climate, evergreen surroundings, colorful people, rains, sunshine and the fruits which we have in plenty. Then there is my home in the midst of a rubber estate. My neighbors are lovable and friendly. Our larder has always been full with plenty to go through. We used to go about fishing in our streams. Our markets have been filled with nice things. I cannot forget the rickshaws which plies everywhere.\n\nWhere I am going, is a desert country and but for the oil wealth, the parching climate and the blazing sun will take away one's energy. Thank God, because of my position, I can enjoy an air conditioned offices and apartment. Water is a rare and costly commodity. Given the chance the Arabs would willingly exchange their oil for a spring of water. Rain is a rare phenomenon so water is so scarce and daily baths and wash is a luxury. In Arab countries water is one of the costliest commodities. The very atmosphere is unpleasant with its petroleum smell and the horizon is dotted with oil rigs and oil refineries. The food which I am accustomed to gives place to processed or canned food. so I will have to change my food habits.\n\nThe lure of money is high. When you are promised of a bumper pay packet it compensates for many inconveniences of life. Money can buy many of the comforts. I can make a happy home, educate my children well and see a wider world because I can afford to take vacations and travel. One may be tempted to ask if money is everything, but it is the thing that counts nowadays. I am prepared to go there even though other comforts of life may be missing. So I look forward to a life of adventure in the new country. This alone can prove whether I have been right in my choice. Wherever I am, I cannot forget my dear country."

        "content": "Tradition is some ancient practice built into the fabric of any society. Every nation and every society has got its tradition. Thus when a Westerner shakes hands with a friend or an acquaintance, or a musalman says 'salam' it is in the best of traditions. Traditions may speak of good breeding. Tradition is reflected in one's manners. Traditions help in the free and unobstructed flow of life. Traditions are almost an unwritten code of life. Thus if a good Christian family says the Lord's Prayer before taking food, it is a good and fine tradition.\nTradition is found in all walks of life. It is found in the market, in the assemblies of people, in the councils of governments and so on. Traditions are carried down from generation to generation. The mother or the mother-in-law is the jealous keeper of the tradition at home. We speak of parliamentary tradition and every parliament has set up very healthy traditions.\n\nTo keep up traditions means following rituals which have become part and parcel of life. Rituals make life more meaningful. There is no human activity without rituals. People guard rituals very jealousy. Some rituals may be meaningless but they make life enjoyable. Even putting on a button or combing one's hair has been reduced to a ritual.\n\nTraditions and rituals are very common among militia. Every regiment, every rank in the army has some tradition. What is common in the navy may not be there in the army. The traditions of the Air Force are different from those of other wings of the defense forces. Traditions help to identify people. Thus one can easily identify if a man is a Hindu, a Muslim and so on since beliefs and traditions go together. But there is no denying the fact that these traditions are slowly disappearing with the advance of civilization, modem modes of travel and life in flats.\n\nThere are some good traditions which should be saved on all accounts. For instance, the Hindus have the tradition of decorating their houses with beautiful designs and it may make others jealous of them. Observing Sabbath among the pious is a very good tradition though one should not confine to observe only Sabbath. Any discerning man can see and observe good traditions among others. For example, a pious Muslim who has returned from Mecca would never lend money on interest.\n\nNot all traditions are good. For instance, attributing chicken pox; measles and smallpox to evil spirits is to be condemned. Very often traditions smack of superstition. Walking under a ladder, spilling of salt from a jug, and throwing shoes for luck are all meaningless. Even discerning people carry mascots as a protective force. Where traditions verge on superstition, they must be done away with. But those who help in the upkeep of beauty or any significant culture must be preserved. Traditions of honesty, truthfulness, straightforwardness, and integrity will have to be built and cherished. Traditions are like the colour and fragrance of a flower. They either attract or repel people. However traditions keep coming and going though, good traditions may stick on. After all when all has been said and done, traditions are essentially a human institution."

        "content": "This is a strange world occupied by strange creatures of whom man is one. He alone can think and act, weigh things for himself and do acts which may not pertain to his welfare. In other words, man alone feels committed socially and given good sense, he can do wonders. He can help the members of the society in many ways. Some feel it is their duty to help the members of the society to which they belong. They may even go out of the way to help others and wipe tears from the eyes of the suffering and bring them succor.\nThere is a good story in the Mahabharata to illustrate the greatness of being kind. King Yudhishtira was performing a great sacrifice and the hall was full of the great and the noble of the land. Then a mongoose came there and rolled all over the sacrificial place. It was asked why it did so. (Remember the mongoose in the story can speak!) The mongoose which had half of its body in gold told the gathering thus. \"It was coming from a forest where there was a big deluge and food was scarce. An old couple with great difficulty had gathered some grains and made flour out of it. When they were about to cat a beggar came asking for alms. The couple gave him whatever flour they had. Some of the flour fell down and when the mongoose rolled on it half its body became golden. That was the greatness of spontaneous kindness. Hearing a lot about Yudhishtira's sacrifices, it has come there with a view of getting the other half of its body golden.\" But it was disappointed. It said it was all done for personal glory. Of course the story has a moral.\n\nIn fact genuine kindness is a rare commodity but still there are and have been persons who go even out of the way to help others. Mr X was a kind man. People did not know much of his kindness. At the time of his retirement he got a sizable sum by way of gratuity. Had it been any other person he would have invested it in some bank or other institution from where he could get a good return, but he didn't do that. He had a distant relative of his who was a good cycle mechanic and also a shrewd businessman but he had no money of his own to start any business on his own. Mr. X met the mechanic relative quite casually and learnt that he needed the capital to build up a fine business. Without hesitation he offered him his life's savings to the relative saying that he could use the money for starting his own business. The other hesitated and said, \"Suppose I fail!\" But the kind gentleman would not balk out. He said that he would look upon it as his having lost the money himself and would not worry about it.\n\nThe other man received the money gratefully and started his own career as a cycle dealer. The war came and with his acumen, he not only built up his industry but also made a name and finally built his won factory employing thousands of workers. Till today he remembers very gratefully his relative Mr. X who gave him the money so magnanimously for a start in life."

It passed through farming country and it mainly carried farm produce, although passengers were often using it too. At every station on the way it loaded and unloaded involving quite a lot of shunting which took a lot of time. Remember it took nearly four hours for a distance of 60km.,\nI traveled once by that rain. At first I could not believe that a train (in this age) could go so slow. I had to put with it. The train moved at a snail's pace and one could almost get down and get back on it. I did not try it because it was not safe for such foolhardy experiments.\n\nThe train stopped to pick up baskets of eggs, hens, vegetables and other farm produce. Naturally those who travelled by this wonderful train were faun workers moving either from one estate to another or going to town for a change. The train was not clean. The familiar sights of newspaper and magazines were not found at the stations. The stations on the way were manned by a skeleton staff, the station master, and the pointsman doing all the duties. There are only two trains for the whole day and life for them is boring.\n\nThe journey was interesting for me and I got down whenever the train stopped to load an unload. There was no milling crowd or colour I could see. There was not even a soft drink to be had. I could see how they shunted the wagons. It was interesting to see the people who came to take their goods. There were all sorts of baskets, hampers and baggages. Once the loading was done the train would start again and go on.\n\nSince the train ran through farming country I could see farm steads all the way, with their gardens, poultry, cattlesheds and granary. I couldn't see any tall buildings. I could see a calf looking with fear at the steaming train; a half naked boy not very goggling at the passing train and people engaged in farming activities.\n\nAfter a while it all got very boring. Anyway it was good to relax from a hectic city life."

        "content": "Hippism has grown as a cult among both young men and women. These people dress, eat and live as they like. They feel they have the right to defy the established social order. The fact that most of them belong to the upper class of society is no comfort. Some of them are well educated and want to see the world.\nSince they have enough money to spend as they like one cannot imagine the life they lead. Hippism is a revolt against the established way of life and according to them against the hypocrisy of the older generation. Whether hippism is the answer, one is never sure.\n\nThese hippies wear tattered clothes. They appear to be unkempt and unwashed and are unashamed to show their untidy beards. They live like poor people on the streets. Hippies resort to all sorts of drinks. They are a menace to law and order. Both men and women mix easily with no sex inhibitions. They believe in free sexual relationships. Though they live strangely they are careful not to rub the law on the wrong side. For people belonging to the last generation and having been brought up under strict discipline the very sight of hippies is disgusting.\n\nThese people find nothing worthwhile in their lives. They find that education is shallow and meaningless. They find formal learning in which classes are conducted by half baked professors and lectures disgusting. Most hippies are of high IQ order they find nothing to contemplate or discover in the educational institutions. Again modem homes especially in the west are not conducive for the moral growth of the youngsters. Parents are not an influence in building their characters. Broken homes may be one of the reasons which drives away the youngsters from home to seek pleasure outside. They develop wrong notions about sex and marriage. The influence of the church and religion has weakened such that the youngsters cannot turn to the church. The sermons sound shallow since those who deliver them do not follow what they preach. In short the basic influences to help youngsters keep their mental, physical and moral values in tight reign has crumbled.\n\nHippism is not prevalent in countries where the family unit is not shaken. Parental example is very important. Children who are neglected in their childhood tend to pick up bad habits, neglecting household responsibilities and encourage hippism among their teenage children. Educational institution can play in structuring  the character of youth. If teachers are really what they profess to be and practice what they preach, they can guide and mould the character of the children under them.\n\nThe youth today need direction and who else but parents and teachers can wean children from taking to bad habits."

The most popular mode of convenience is the motor car but today the motor car is a great contributor of atmospheric pollution. Even antibiotics which were hailed as miracle drugs are not entirely free from bad side effects. The discovery of 'N' energy has left the world on the brink of a nuclear disaster and certain annihilation. So too, the invention of Television.\nTelevision was invented following the principle of the movie and the radio. In movies one sees a picture and hears the sound when the film is projected with the help of a projector. The film will have to be made before hand. In the case of a Radio broadcast one hears the sound alone. In combining the effect of the two the television has practically brought the world to one's drawing room. It is no exaggeration. When the 25th Olympic was being conducted in Barcelona one could see the colorful events in his television set. The lively actuality of the scenes and sound makes the television very welcome.\n\nThere are many kinds of programs one can enjoy seeing on television. It may be a live telecast of great events of the world, a cricket match between the West Indies and England, a football match between two internationally famous teams, boxing match or a chess match between two stalwarts of the game.\n\nMany political events may be telecast like the party conventions in the USA. to select its candidate for the future President. Events like the opening of Parliament or the last march for a great national leader. In many of these things the television easily and effectively displaces the morning newspapers and it is more effective than written words. It is both visual and aural and creates a greater impact on the minds of viewers.\n\nHence the worth of television as an emotional tool has been high. With pre-planning lessons could be broadcast effectively. It is useful for teachers because it can help them in the reorientation and furthering of\n\nchildren's' knowledge. Many subjects could be made more lively with a natural effect. It is a boon to the medical student because he views intricate surgery with the help of television. As an entertainment it is excellent.\n\nBut television has also its disadvantages. Unless the light effect is in correct frequency it will affect the eye of the viewer. The television program has fixed hours and one has to tailor time to it. There is also no free choice of programs because channels are limited.\n\nCertain programs may have a corrupting influence on young minds. Cartoons which arc telecast have cruelty as a theme and is a bad influence on the young minds. There has been instances where youngsters have shot their teachers or parents. Television has reduced the influence of discipline in the classroom.\n\nIt is quite likely that the happy relationship between the members of the family is likely to be corroded. However, when the history of inventions of this century is written, certainly television shall find a prominent place there along with the X Ray, nuclear bombs and space flights."

There was a man who envied the King. Somehow this news reached the ears of the King. So he called the, man to him and agreed to allow the man to play King for a day. The servants were duly informed. The man was served as a king. He enjoyed the joke of dressing like a king having recourse to all kingly activities. He was taken into the banqueting hall for breakfast where he sat at the head of the table. The real King was also there at the table. When the man looked up he saw a sword hanging from a thin thread above his head. He could riot eat his breakfast nor could he take a morsel of the delicacies spread before hint. When the real King asked him the reason he pointed at the sword which was self explanatory.\nI too wanted to be someone else for a day like the man in the tale. I wanted to be a lazy, doing nothing and simply whiling away the time on a bridge or a park. I wanted to be a citizen of the world viewing things from a position of detachment.\n\nI started the day with a relaxed and unhurried breakfast. Then I went to the newly built fly-over. I took a comfortable seat on the ledge. There were others too like me on this flyover which has become a haunt of lazy fellows. As time progressed the flow of traffic increased. I could see vehicles carrying all sorts of people and luggage, commuters hurrying to office, school children carrying heavy satchels and going unwillingly to school, petty shopkeepers began to put their shops on wheels exhibiting many kinds of wares and handful of shoe shine boys plying their trade. How they tackled their customers is a lesson in persuasion.\n\nAs the morning wore away the crowd subsided. During the lunch hour again there was some stir. I had a happy afternoon siesta on the ledge.\n\nWith the coming of the evening the crowd increased again. I could see men and women with their shopping bags, newly weds trotting along hand in hand enjoying their newly found companionship, a large crowd emanating from a neighboring theater and another queue forming to get their tickets for the next show.\n\nThen from my perch on the bridge I moved into a park. A few lazy people there were looking at the sky. I decided to join them. Groups of children were running about the ponds and playing hide and seek, lovers sitting in lonely places waiting for stolen kisses, the ubiquitous ice seller was there too selling his candies and iced fruits and of course the peanut man was also there.\n\nBy dusk I got tired. The mad, meaningless rush of the world had no fascination for me. Man with all the facilities appears to have become an automation. Nature's beauty was lost to many. I couldn't but agree but more with the poet that life is not worth the while if one cannot stop and stare. I would rather be one to enjoy nature than one who makes every minute pay in terms of money."

        "content": "The classroom is a noisy place and when the master is not there the children have a tendency to indulge in all sons of mischief. Childish pranks are good but often children tend to quarrel and fight. The more healthy and vigorous the children, the more chances of these fights occurring. To keep the class under discipline a prefect is appointed by the teacher. He becomes an understudy of the teacher only that he doesn't teach. He can order and command the class. Other students are afraid of him because he can make a report to the teacher or the headmaster and punishment is sure to follow. A prefect need not be a strong hefty fellow. He can even be small built but the teacher knows he is capable of controlling the class. A prefect must be a boy of character, doesn't take sides, must be assertive and stand by his word. The prefect system has been working well in schools in England and it has been introduced in schools in other parts of the world.\nA prefect can help the teacher in many ways. He can bring teaching materials like maps, globes, charts and books to the class. He can collect and distribute notebooks, library hooks and exercise books.\n\nI was chosen prefect. I was reticent and had no gang and was attentive in class. When at the beginning of the term the teacher announced my name as prefect there was hush and silence in the class and dozens of pairs of eyes peered at me. I stood up and marched to the teacher's table when he made the announcement. There was a mild cheer and I bowed my head and returned to my scat.\n\nAs a prefect I made it a point to be regular and punctual. Thank God I was enjoying good health, so there was no need for absenteeism. I chose four of my classmates as my helpers. One to look after the register, the second to look the tidiness of the class, the third to be in charge of the field and sports equipment and fourth was in charge of helping the teacher. I was in over all charge besides looking after the library books and aids. We had many types of audio-visual aids and I took a keen interest in them. I looked after the Bulletin Board to make it lively with news paper cuttings. I would ask a friend of mine who could write in a decent hand, to write the daily news. Thus I tried to make the class a beehive of activity.\n\nWhenever two boys quarreled and fought I tried to reconcile between them by finding out who the first offender had been and making him apologize to the other. There were cases of petty thefts but I always tried to trace the culprit and restore the lost article to the owner. The culprit himself would get his due punishment.\n\nIn short I liked the post in which I fared well."

        "content": "I can't understand how and what I did when I was younger could interest anybody. Since it has been asked I can try to recollect.\nMy first recollection were about my living in my uncle's house. Those were the days when family ties were strong and relatives mingled as often as possible. I was the first grandson to come into the family, hence I was a favorite. I had nice things to eat and children of my age could come to our house and play all sorts of childish games. We used to dress in simple clothes.\n\nThe monthly ritual of being given castor oil by my grandmother brings bad memories even today. I used to rebel at it but my uncle and others would force the cupful of heated castor oil down my throat of which half would have spilled on to my body. So the whole day would be spent purging. Modern children are never subjected to this awful ritual.\n\nThe next event I remember is going to school for the first time. It was a play school and the teacher coaxed me to sit and learn the mystery of writing. We started writing on sand. The child feels and the finger learns. After all we spell with the fingers. There were very few books. Learning the tables in Arithematic was common and the copy books were universally used. There were not many of the aids of today in the classroom. The teacher rarely used the board because rote memory was insisted upon. We were having only indigenous games and since the school closed by 5 o'clock in the evening, games were very rarely organized at schools. The day when the Inspector visited used to be very important but I can't exactly remember the things that might have happened then.\n\nMy going to the high school was an event by itself. I was called as they say to fit myself into the high school. My uncle took me to the school and presented me to the Headmaster who was an august personality. I almost shuddered when I stood before him and looked like a liliputian.\n\nThe headmaster was The Gulliver who gave a dictation and a few sums in arithmetic in which I did well. So I was admitted.\n\nI never forgot the old teacher who pushed us through the complex ways of English Grammar. Verily he pumped it into our poor heads and those who were slow had a tough time. Corporal punishment was not frowned upon in those days for they did not believe in the dictum. 'Spare the rod and spoil the Child'. With the cinema not in the advent we spent our time between the home, the school and the play field.\n\nWe were not that innocent either; we had our share of pranks but we never broke the law. One funny incident was that we drew the figure of the teacher on one side of the board which could be rolled and the other side had some problems. We rolled the problem side to the front -- When the teacher came in and rolled the board to use the cleaner side he had a shock to see his caricature. The class roared but nobody admitted who had drawn that picture. One of the boys who was a hit timid gave the name. The furious teacher thrashed the culprit but we boycotted the informer for a few days until he tearfully apologized.\n\nNow I look back on my young days with nostalgia."

One is not mature at this stage to decide upon a future course. Everything is tempting and attractive and it is tough making a decision.\nA career depends on many factors. The occupation of one's parents, a successful neighbor or even an imaginary ideal, may influence the kind of work which one hopes to do. If one's parent is a doctor or a lawyer one may decide to follow the same path. A book one had read or a popular movement may also influence one's future.\n\nI have made up my mind to become a doctor. With all the science's achievements man is not able to overcome diseases. He has found out medicines and ways to combat diseases but there is no way to eradicate them. As far as humanity is there, there will be diseases. Rich or poor, man suffers from diseases and the number of hospitals is a glaring witness to the presence of diseases. So there is more pleasure for me in serving the suffering humanity.\n\nI got the inspiration from Mother Theresa who got the Nobel Peace Prize. What a glorious service she has been doing for the sick and the dying in the streets of Calcutta. I may not rise to that rare height.\n\nA medical man is not merely a man who can prescribe a few tablets and give a shot here or there. In one sense he plays the role of a helper of the creator saving as many patients as possible. To be a good doctor requires a lot of insight into the patient's constitution and mind. A medical man must be careful in dealing with individual cases and he must be sympathetic. When a doctor replaces a heart or kidney he saves a patient. It is a challenge which is worthwhile. Since a medical man deals with humanity, he must be humane. Another fact is that a medical man is always intimate with his patient so it is also ethical not to divulge a patient's sickness to anybody.\n\nWithout fleecing a patient a doctor can cam a tidy sum of money if he has created a good name in his special field. So for these reasons I am attracted to medicine."

Last week, there was a very good program of a famous play.\nThe story is simply this. There were two friends. They loved the same girl without being aware. The girl loved only one of them. As the story progressed the lovers found out that the girl he loved was also loved by his friend and that the girl also loved his friend. So he sacrificed his love, for the sake of his friend. Thereafter he looked upon the girl as his own sister.\n\nThe play was a dramatic expression in musical terms. The 'sacrifice' was described in effective words, which conveyed a sense of reality so much so that the characters seemed to emerge as real people. The emotional discords in my mind were removed by the power of harmony in the play and established a sense of tranquility and peace. Such programs will certainly enliven the daily routine of the average man with a much-needed break. It was a heart-warming program.\n\nThe choreography has been provided by some famous cine artists of Malaysia. The dialogue had been written by a famous director. The tempo of the theme was kept up. The light music had been entertaining. One could enjoy the play very well without seeing it on film. The one hour entertainment was soon over; but its magic spell remained."

He was talking about his problem to my father. Then I told my father that we could have one of the puppies; though reluctant, my father agreed. That was how Rosy came into my possession.\nWhy, it was named Rosy, I can't say. It is an Alsatian. It is of medium height, grey in colour with dark spots near her belly, a bushy and glistening eyes. It grew into a beautiful and magnificent dog much to the envy of others.\n\nRosy can be seen about our house when she is not engaged in playing or when she is not sleeping. She takes pleasure in sniffing about the comers when she has nothing particular to do. She is as docile as a deer in our presence. When we arc not at home she will be at her mettle and no one can easily come near our gate or house. Though she doesn't bite, she will bounce on the person baring her teeth so much so that she can paralyze any intruder. She recognizes the postman as a friend and so does not do him any harm.\n\nI give her spartan food. She takes some biscuits and milk in the morning, rice and curry in the afternoon. Usually she is not given any food in the night. When we are at our table, Rosy keeps company with me but she shows no eagerness to touch even a crumb unless offered. So my father likes it. Rosy cries in a peculiar way. It is between barking and howling. Sometimes, she raises a cry like moaning. That means she wants to go out for toilet.\n\nWhenever I go out in the evening, she accompanies me. My friends are afraid of her because she doesn't like silly mischievous boys. She shows her displeasure by barking and that is enough to unnerve the boys. My father says, Rosy would soon become a mother. Then I will have a litter of nice puppies."

My mother prepared the usual medication she used to give me and made me go to bed early. The next morning I could not get up at all from bed. I was running a high temperature and more severe pain in the joints. People in the house suspected that I might be coming in for small-pox. Still, they did not send me to the hospital. I was kept on a sparse diet. The same condition continued for three more days. So our family doctor and friend advised my parents to get me admitted to the General Hospital. After the formalities, I was given a bed in the general ward and I was kept under strict observation.\nThe experience was a novelty to me but it was very irksome after a few days when a number of doctors, one after another came and examined me. So I felt very much annoyed when I had to stick my tongue out for these doctors. In between there were the nurses who strutted about in their starched uniforms. A chart was maintained about my health. My blood was examined and then my stools too. Many were the surmises about my condition. Some said it was a strange fever that started in Pahang. Some said it was paratyphoid. So they were prescribing different types of injections and pills. By this time, the novelty of being in the hospital wore away. I got fed up with the smell of dettol, the cheerless look of the ward and the very scene of different types of patients lying there. Somehow, the medications began to work and finally temperature came back to normal. I was advised to go home and take a long rest. What a relief that was from the boredom of the hospital after a fortnight's stay there."

        "content": "To buy an old thing requires some prior knowledge of the thing itself. When a man sells away an old thing, there may be two reasons for it. One, the man may be in distress, secondly the thing he wants to dispose is not in a working order. It is better to know the condition of the item offered up for sale. Let us see what should be done in the case of a used bicycle.\nFor a bicycle, the frame is the most important thing. There must not be any sign of weakness in the frame nor in the forks. The brakes must be in perfect working order. The gear wheel and the chain must be free from defects and should not be loose or tight. Pedalling must be easy. The condition of the wheels and tyres must be good. That is to say, the rims must be free from rusty blemish as the spokes must be in order. The axle and the bearings of the wheel must be in perfect condition. The tyres and the tubes must not be too old. The mud-guards should not be dented. If the paint is still on it, well and good.\n\nThen there are the accessories. The seat or the saddle must not be torn and have loose springs; otherwise it will not be comfortable to sit on. If the cycle has a carrier, a stand, lights and a bell it is worth buying."

        "content": "Being an elder brother or a sister has its advantages as well as problems. In a big family, the elder one has to share some of the responsibilities of both father and mother. This can be looked upon as a necessary difficulty which one cannot avoid. For the smooth running of the family, such a service of the elder child, is always expected.\nNow let us see some of the problems of looking after the younger ones. They have to be kept away from the kitchen where mother is busy cooking. If you prevent them from going into the kitchen they will cry. This will disturb mother. If one or two slaps are administered, they will start screaming. The elder one is asked to dress up the younger ones and this is really an ordeal. They become very rebellious and choosey about their clothes, make the task very hard and one loses all patience. Quite often, they have to be coached in their school work. They won't come at all for studies when called. The elder one has to be infinitely patient. If the elder one were to lose patience, only he or she will be blamed.\n\nAnother difficulty is that the elder one cannot own anything new or attractive; the younger ones too want to have it. It may be a pen, an instrument box or even a pencil eraser. The elder one may protest but to no avail, it will be the younger ones who will get their way.\n\nAnother trying occasion is when mother goes to a theater or visits a friend. The younger ones make a hell of that time. They will pick quarrel among themselves, fly at each other's throat, want to cat something and if they are given what they want, they will demand more of it. If they are refused they will complain to mother. The younger ones always spy on the elder one. They want to accompany the brother or sister wherever he or she goes. They will always be ready to carry real or imaginary tales to the mother. They want to be with their elder brother or sister but at the same time they want to have their own way, they would not want to listen to their elder brother or sister.\n\nThese kinds of situations are very common in large families and only in rare instances can we find families where the children are loving and close to each other."

        "content": "Sometime back I visited the National Cement Factory. Cement as a building material has become very popular and every year, millions of tons of this material is being manufactured. Since cement has very many uses, the demand for the material is ever growing. The factory which I visited, is a premier one and produces 1500 tones of cement every day.\nI obtained permission to visit the factory. At the entrance, the permit was checked by the security personnel. Then one of the watch and ward men was asked to take me round. The factory itself is situated on a vast area of nearly 400 to 500 acres. We started at the first point where cement actually got manufactured. Huge dippers bring in boulders from the neighboring quarries. They are crushed into small pieces by the crushing machine. The crushed pieces are then conveyed to the wet mill by a conveyor belt. Then I went to the wet mill area. The crushed stone with a measured quantity of clay is fed into a revolving cylindrical mill. They have steel balls inside them. Water is fed into these. So the stones and clay arc crushed into a paste like substance which flows out. This is called the slurry. The slurry is taken to a tank where it is kept constantly churned; otherwise it will settle down and harden up. The slurry is then pumped in measured doses into a long revolving kiln. It is nearly 200 to 300 feet long. As the slurry moves towards the furnace end it is baked. The furnace uses coal or furnace oil. As the slurry reached this point, the baking is complete and the baked material, called the clinker, falls in the form of small globules. The clinker is conveyed to the dry mill. There it is mixed with gypsum and crushed to fine powder. So, this is the cement which is stacked in big silos.\n\nThen we went to the packing department. There I saw both mechanical and hand packing. The mechanical packing is very interesting to see. The finished bags are taken to the godown or straightaway to the waiting railway trucks.\n\nOne hears a huge oppressive noise within the mills, It is dusty everywhere. Overhead cranes do bucketing and shoveling work. It is indeed an experience to visit such a factory."

        "content": "This is a very tricky question. Eyebrows will be raised at this very controversial question. The question aims at equality between man and woman. It cannot be blind equality. Nature had endowed man with certain capabilities and endurances which are not found in women. Man also cannot claim some traits that are peculiar to women. Thus we speak of manly strength and feminine grace.\nNow late in the twentieth century to say that man should lead, is absurd. In what he should lead lies the answer. Then there won't be any controversy. It is a man's duty to hard work involving physical strength and physical endurance. Women, as a rule arc denied this physical strength. Man has been a fighter all along and these fighting qualities have always been in demand. So man came to be a leader. Exploring, pioneering, climbing, fighting and all these require manly courage, bravery and guts. When society needed them badly man became the leader.\n\nBut where simple intellectual qualities are called for, it is difficult to choose between a man and a woman. In the finer arts women excel. Thus there are woman poets and woman artists. A man competes with them and if he excels it is because he gets better chances.\n\nWomen as a rule, are the best homemakers. Their sense of duty, humility and patience make them really the authority in the house. Their feminine touch has a lot to do in bringing up children. If a country needs good youth it has to look up to its mothers. The hands that rocks the cradle rules the world.\n\nMan and woman are thus complimentary and supplementary to each other and it will be useless to argue as to who leads whom."

        "content": "Homework is a bitter pill for many students. Teachers always give homework. They are given to help students to revise what has been done in the class and also to finish a given task set in school which the pupil could not finish on time.\nEducation and mastery of knowledge, is a matter of skill so the more practice one has the better skill. There are skill subjects and knowledge subjects. Both these categories require drill and repetition. The teacher, to some extent, drills the student in the class but in the classroom each individual student cannot be expected to do the same amount as skills of students vary from each other.\n\nHomework need not necessarily be repeating what has been done in the class, it may be more study. The student goes through references and acquires more and better knowledge. The world of knowledge is so wide that the class alone cannot bring everything into the grasp of the student. So the student must take up some initiative of his own. This is one of the purposes of homework.\n\nThe school also must see that the students are not overburdened with homework. The teachers must see to it that the homework is distributed evenly throughout the week. Still there arc subjects like mathematics or transcription in the lower classes which require daily attention. There are other aspects of school work which can be attended to during the weekend, for example, map making and drawing diagrams.\n\nSimply because some boys find homework too much to cope up with, it cannot be abolished. The school should provide some facilities, so that the boys can conveniently attend to their home work and the teachers can come willingly forward to help such boys."

        "content": "This is a very interesting question indeed. It is something like asking which of the two eyes serves better. As there is nothing to chose between the two eyes, so too in the case of the teacher and the farmer. Each of them contributes to the welfare of the society.\nNow, let us see how each one serves the society. Let us take the case of the farmer first. The farmer feeds the country, with different kinds of foods. He is held in respect in literature, as others are dependent on him. This is really true. Whether the farmer works for his own selfish ends or for the market it is ultimately the society that gains.\n\nThe farmer's lot is a humble one. His difficulties are many. The place he works in is always dirty. He has to spend long hours tilling the soil, looking after his animals and tending to his vegetables, fruits and crops. He may not be an intellectual but he is a student of nature. He knows the weather conditions, the history of his plants and the diseases of his animals. He knows how to raise a good stock. He keeps the machinery of life and industry in the land going. He has to feed the industrial centers with raw materials like cotton, jute, wool and so on. In short, he is a mighty contributor to the welfare of the society.\n\nThe teacher contributes in an intellectual way. If food is essential, knowledge is even more vital. Without knowledge, man cannot progress. So the progress of a nation depends on her teachers. They carry the torch of knowledge and culture to inspire and educate the young of our country. In ancient societies the teacher was held in very high esteem and regard. They were given high positions in the ministry. The future of a nation depends on her teachers. Modern and advanced countries pay great attention to education which means their teachers do great help in nation building. So the teacher also serves the nation and if his contributions are not so tangible as that of the farmer nevertheless his contributions are really lasting and enduring."

        "content": "This is a question which may be viewed from different angles, the parents' point of view, the couples point of view and then there is also the commonsense point of view.\nA parent wants his son or daughter married because he wants his species propagated. He wants his son or daughter married to a healthy person who would prove a good life mate for his children. The parent cares also for the stock. In other words he wants to assure himself that the person with whom his son or daughter settles down with does not suffer from any disease. They must have a good name in society. Very often, the financial position of the parties concerned gets top priority. All alliance is made when there is a financial gain thrown in. Sometimes, the youngsters may not like such an alliance and so the marriage ends in unhappiness and disaster.\n\nYoung couples these days want to be free to choose their life long partners themselves. It may be the personal qualities of the girl he likes that he is attracted to, so much so that in the first freshes of love, he is likely to overlook many other factors and because he is not experienced and worldly-wise, his choice may not always be correct. Such wrong alliances contributes to more misunderstanding and divorces in western countries. Under the wrong notion of love there have been more illicit connection and children born, out of wedlock. So wise youngsters would better think twice before they get married. They would not lose anything by consulting their parents and getting their advice, blessing and approval before getting married."

        "content": "Every generation is the torch bearer of culture and tradition and it must pass it on to the next generation. This is a sacred duty and for the continuity of culture, this becomes essential. Cultures depend on various traditions. Some of them are well founded on reason while others are meaningless. Some of the latter block the progress of a community or even a nation.\nLet us see in what ways some of the traditions prove an obstacle to progress. Look at the purdah system. How it started history alone can say. But today it is meaningless. Is it out of jealousy or suspicion that a man keeps his woman under purdah ? They are denied the benefit of sunlight and fresh air. Some purdah women suffer from skin and even pulmonary diseases. It is high time people revised their notions about being in purdah.\n\nUntouchability is prevailing in some form or other in many countries. It is a pity that some of our own brethren should be considered untouchables. There was a time when their proximity was supposed to pollute water and vitiate the air. It was because of certain work that they did, that they were considered untouchable.\n\nLook at the colour bar in certain countries. It is sheer accident that some are born white and others are colored. It is by sheer accident of history that some negros became slaves and the whites became their masters. To base one's judgment on such a tradition and to deny the colored one his legitimate rights is atrocious and unjust.\n\nThere are many examples of tradition and culture which stand as an obstacle to progress. Bad traditions and cultures should be got rid of in order for a nation to advance and develop."

There was half-moon in the west and many stars were burning bright in the firmament.\nWhile I was absorbed in this lovely night scene, I became aware of a moaning sound from the next flat. I listened for a while. I thought at first that somebody there was snoring or crying in his dream. But no, it was distinctly a moaning sound. It was soon followed by other sounds. They were of people talking loudly. I could not make out as to what they were talking.\n\nThe quarrelling noise increased. Now and then, I could identify a voice that appeared to be begging. Very soon, I heard the noise of blows and a shrill cry of a woman. Still I hesitated to move out of my cozy bed to see what the matter was. The neighbor was only an acquaintance of mine and at that hour of the night I was reluctant to go and interfere.\n\nWhile my thoughts were running along that strain, I heard a sudden crash, as though something heavy had fallen. This was followed by a fearful shriek, and then silence followed. I feared something horrible had happened. So, I went to the neighbor's door and knocked at it. It was opened but my neighbor, who appeared a picture of dismay and bewilderment. After some excuses, I enquired of him what the matter was.\n\nHe took me in and showed me a scene. There lay his wife curled up on her bed. One or two chairs had been turned upside down. Things were in a disarray. The neighbor showed me the chairs. After seating himself, he told me that his wife had been a hysterical patient and would now and then create scenes in the night. The voices had been theirs when he had tried to quieten her. She had pushed the chairs which had caused the crash. And after shrieking, she lay down in a swoon. It was a frequent occurrence. While I sought his excuse for disturbing him, he begged my pardon for having disturbed my peace at night. I bade him good-night and returned to my room."

I was in a dilemma, I could neither go for rescue nor cry because that would be futile.

Most ordinary people, would have known little about documentary programs about foreign countries, instructional programs on engineering, science, medicine and so on. To add to the knowledge of the pupils, in some parts of the world television has been introduced in the classroom.\n\nTelevision provides good entertainment, the greatest excitement and creates an interest in the arts. Very good plays are to be seen nowadays on television. A piano recital or an orchestra, a grand ball or a clandestine love affair drama keeps the home audience glued to the television.\n\nTo the old people and the sick, the television has become a companion.

Photographs can now be relayed to earth from space by means of television.\n\nUnfortunately, it also has its disadvantages. People spend too much time in front of it. Children are likely to neglect their studies. If television has too strong a hold, even elderly people are likely to neglect some of their important work. When too much emphasis is given on violence, vice, and crime programs it has a disastrous effect upon the young.\n\nBut if this medium is used properly it can become an advantage and not a disadvantage to mankind.

        "content": "Advertisement is highly developed nowadays. To some extent nature itself advertises her wares, for instance, the colour and smell of flowers is nothing but advertisement to attract the attention of insects and birds and the promise of honey is the gift.\nAdvertising is one of the media to draw the attention of the public and to educate them regarding a particular product. This is called the psychology of persuasion in converting people to a way of life or thinking. For example, to introduce a new drink, it is not enough if the product is good, the public should be made to realize its existence. The manufacturer adopts subtle ways of advertising. It must appeal visually. Since advertisement has become very important and the methods used are many, it has become a very professionalized trade today. In fact advertising agencies do good business. Since they employ specialists like artists and script writers, the advertiser can have expert service at a price.\n\nThere are hundreds of ways of advertising. Generally they may have visual, audio and audiovisual appeal. Leaflets and brochures are produced describing a colorful product. Free samples are given, so that new customers may be found. Calendars are quite common and there are very plain ones to pictureque ones. Some fine calendars are being preserved. So calendar manufacturing during the end of the year season is a big business.\n\nPerhaps one of the most popular medium of advertisements is the newspaper, since they reach a very wide section of the public. Some products are advertised throughout the year and they generate a source of income for the newspaper. Here the picture and the script play a very important part. Nowadays small gifts like key chains, purses, table wares and so on are used to advertise.\n\nIf the same advertisements are issued for too long they become boring. The advertiser knows this, so he changes the mode of advertisement from time to time. Either the pictures may be changed or the script. Sometimes subtle sex appeal is thrown in by advertising agencies. Whether this is ethically correct is a debatable point.\n\nAny advertisement cannot be useless. It has got a purpose. An advertiser can use a ton of paper for printing his advertisement and distributing it to various houses to get the message of his product across. Throwing to the public just like throwing some mud on the wall, some of it is sure to stick. So too with advertisement which brings the prospective buyer and the product man nearer. With a complex market with dozens of products competing, advertisement is one of the ways of winning the market.\n\nOf course there are advertisements which are really misleading. Some medicines that are advertised claim to be panacea for all bodily ills but very few products claim that honor. Some of the products are not of that high quality as claimed by the advertisement. Take for instance, some of the advertisements for toothpaste. They claim to give all protection to the teeth but they are proven otherwise. In USA this subtle way of persuading the public has been questioned and number of products advertised did not stand the test of proof.\n\nWe can conclude here that in spite of its limitations, advertisement is a powerful media that has come to stay."

        "content": "The given statement might have been correct long ago, perhaps till the end of the last century. In so far as the family was the unit and the bringing forth and rearing of children rested on the women's shoulder her place was always relegated to the home. She played many roles, none of them demanding. She was the housewife, mother, manager of the household and the first educator of children. Her minor role as a knitting woman or a washer woman was recognized but not mentioned.\nThose days are gone and nobody who is educated and civilized looks upon woman as a doll to be kept at home at the will and pleasure of men folk. Of course there are exceptions in certain societies where the in-laws play a dominating role. With the education of women and the change in economic status, women are enjoying a lot of freedom. There are many up and coming women in the world in recent times. Women are in polities today and some have gone to become prime ministers.\n\nThere has been strong resentment among the women, about the way they have been treated. There is the women's liberation movement called Lib Women. One of their major platforms is equality of status, equal pay for equal work and the security.\n\nSome old societies still treat women as chattels who could be easily disposed of. In very primitive societies even today women are treated as a commodity which could be bought and sold and even loans are raised on the security of women. These are far and few between. At the other end of the scale some women want complete freedom to live as they please. They want to have freedom of sex and don't want to be bound by wedlock. This is only an extreme view and not so common even among those who vociferously cry for women's freedom.\n\nWomen have all along been treated as a weaker sex. The connotation changes from person to person. Physically of course they are not as hardy as men but that doesn't mean they don't have a strong heart. In fact they are stronger than men in certain aspects in that they are able to stand physical hardships. In their make up they are equipped for certain nature's ordeals which men are not subjected to. Whether they like it or not, generally women have more to do with children especially in their infancy and early childhood. This makes women distinctly different from men; their being soft and kind need not be taken for their weakness. If they appear weak sometimes it is to maintain the dignity of family life, so that children do not become a bad copy of the mother. Motherhood is so sacred that trying to tamper with it in the name of the lib movement would make society wild and disorganized.\n\nWomen's finger of accusation in the matter of employment and security is correct. There are jobs and jobs but only a few of them are really suited for women. Take for instance, mining, lumbering and fishing. These are definitely men's areas. But where women can be employed let them have their chance. Where they are employed they have definitely proved better than men.\n\nWhat makes women appear in bondage is the tradition and culture. Man is the only animal who has got the institution of marriage. Marriage is not for simply the propagation of life but its main aim is the preservation of stock, safety of children and their upbringing. Marriage is not a contract which can be dissolved at one's whim and fancy. Unless it is looked upon as a bond of love for life, children will suffer first and society ultimately. Some of the western societies are paying the price heavily for their free notions of marriage.\n\nMenfolk themselves are not so free. Wherever they work they find opposition, injustice and exploitation. The mental strain which they bear is heavy, which women at home are spared from.\n\nUnder the present laws of the world, no nation bars employment to women in the name of sex. Nowadays we find women in many walks of life which were once the preserve of men."

        "content": "At first when I thought of purchasing a house, I wanted one that was neither too far nor too near a town. If it was too far, I may feel lonely and then there was the question of transport. Finally I chose an elevated, land enabling easy drainage and firm. The site is spacious allowing ground for the house and a decent big garden. I wanted an elegant look for the house I wanted to build.\nThe house has four rooms with a well furnished kitchen and modem bathroom facilities. The living rooms are comfortable. The furniture has been chosen with great care. The walls have been painted with soft colors to match the curtains, the materials of which had been bought from the best textile manufacturing company. Each room is fitted with a radio so that one can enjoy programs from the bed. The drawing room is elegantly furnished with sofas, chairs and a central table. The walls are lined with built-in-cupboards, a library to house well chosen volumes by master novelists. There is a niche for the television and the room can be used for viewing programs. All the rooms are airy and air conditioned.\n\nThe kitchen is beautifully done up. It is fitted with electric grills and things can be stacked neatly away in specially designed cabinets. It is provided with modem gadgets for grinding, pulverizing or cutting.\n\nIn front of the house there is an artificial pool with a fountain spray. One or two fish tanks are kept in the big porch to add the beauty of the place. There is a garage at the side of the house for my car, cattle and a poultry. There I keep a few fowls of the high breed like the white leg horn, Black Monorca, and Rhode Island from which I get a supply of eggs and meat. I have two jersey cows in the shed which supply the milk for the family. In the backyard there are a few fruit bearing trees. On the margin of the house there are some coconut trees. In front of the house there are certain bushes of crotons and exotics plants. The well-kept lawn with luscious green grass is very pleasing to the eye. There is also a small playground for my children with a swing and a see-saw.\n\nI have a couple of chandeliers in the drawing room showing rainbow colored lights whenever light falls on them. I could specially mention the marble Buddha I got from Siam and a bronze Nataraja from India. There are a few selected pictures by masters in gilded frames.\n\nThus I am surrounded by beauty and peace."

        "content": "Being an only child, the parents can spend well in the upbringing of the child. The child can be provided with better nutritious and well balanced food which may not be possible in a big family. The child can have fruits drinks, and nice things to eat like biscuits and chocolates. The child can have better clothing of good materials and new fashions.\nBesides these the child can enjoy a good education. He can be sent to a good school from the beginning because the parents can afford to meet the expenses. Good education means good books, good teachers and good learning tools. For instance, where there are many children an average parent cannot find means to provide even a good atlas and instrument box. Picture books and story books will be out of question. Because of better attention to his education, the only child can hope to reach high rungs of the ladder provided, of course, he had the brains.\n\nAnother signal advantage is the parent can attend on the child personally. This will help the parent to shape the child in the fashion he likes. Barring, petting and pampering, the parent can be helpful in the mental and intellectual growth of the child. There can be an intimacy which will help in later years.\n\nThere are also disadvantages in being an only child. The child feel lonely, companionless and no one to share his joys and sorrows. The parent cannot take the place of a brother or sister because of the age gap. Being the only child he may be petted and pampered and so will easily become a spoilt child. He will develop more negative qualities like selfishness, pettiness and obstinacy. He won't have the opportunity to develop many human qualities. Love, affection, kindness, sympathy, appreciation and many such qualities cannot easily develop in an only child. The chances for development of these qualities will be far and few between. There will be few opportunities to give expression to these qualities. When they are not developed, he can't have a healthy growth and he cannot become a well rounded personality. He cannot understand the value of give and take which is very important in life. He will become so selfish that he would like to have everything for himself. He cannot understand the importance of loving and giving for others.\n\nIn a corporate society each member has to live with others. This means adjustments and a lot of give and take. A big rope is after all a combination of many straws and its strength depends on how well it has been twisted. So too unless the society is made up of well seasoned members, it cannot stand the onslaught of bad powers and influence. So the lonely child with many a minus points cannot easily fit in. So taking all these into consideration I would like to have brothers and sisters than be a lonely child."

        "title": "The evils of drug addiction",
        "content": "Our ancients have spoken of five cardinal sins which must be avoided by all means though they may appear to bring profit or pleasure for the time being. They are gambling, stealing, murder, unchastity and drugs. The history of humanity is replete with examples where people have been ruined by following the path of one or other of them. A whole nation was brought to disgrace because of opium.\nWhy then does man take to drugs ? Some think it adds to pleasure, some others think that it takes away physical weariness. Still others take it to forget their worries, while others take it in order to please the company they keep. In cold countries they take it to keep themselves warm. While in very small doses drugs act as medicines, they can only bring harm in large doses. They have a doping effect and hence at the spur of the moment the person may act more vigorously but only to find himself weaker later. Sustained consumption of them in large quantities will lead to dependency and addiction.\n\nFrom time immemorial man has known to make drugs. Today, various kinds of addiction like wine, brandy, whisky, morphine heroine, cocaine and opium are prevalent. These drugs affect the nervous system especially the brain which controls the voluntary action. So a man under the influence of a drug is unable to walk properly and he staggers. It deadens the senses so a man under the influence of drugs does not know what he does or speaks. Very often the influence of a drug, he can do shameful acts. Continued addiction upsets the digestive system, especially the liver, leading eventually to death.\n\nThe mental faculties will be numbed. In order to forget worries people take drugs but that is not the answer to one's worry. Drug addiction brings moral degradation. The addict himself knows it and so he consumes them only in secret and no addict openly will come forward to say he is an addict. It is against all religious sanctions. It leads to immoral and evil activities. Socially also an addict is looked down upon and people would try to avoid a drug addict. He would be a nuisance wherever he is, at home or in company. He would bring untold misery to his people and those around him. Except in the company of addicts, he would be looked upon as a leper. His family also will share the ignominy because people will point the accusing finger at such a family. Financially it ruins the addict. The money would go down the drains as it were for what could be spent for the betterment of the self or the benefit of the family could easily be wasted on drugs. So considered wisely, one should avoid drugs.\n\nNowadays drugs like marijuana, L.S.D., opium and others are being taken by youngsters under false pretences. It is really unfortunate they don't realize the harmful effect. Certainly the drugs will not and cannot add and bring pleasure. If one thinks in that way it is only an illusion. So it is best to avoid the company of those who have recourse to drugs or peddle them. Remember the physical ruin, mental upset, moral degradation and social and financial breakdown. So for God's sake one should never be tempted by them."

        "title": "It generally appears that a high standard of living is closely correlated with a high degree of industrialization. Discuss this statement in relation to any one country and its economic problems",
        "content": "One of the aims of any modem government whatever may be its form and colour, is to raise the standard of living of its people. This is one of the forerunners on which the fall and rise of a national party depends. In any modem government which is run by the elected representatives, one of the major points to note in the election manifesto is the promise to raise the standard of living. The more underdeveloped a country the more attractive this promise becomes.\n\nWhat is this standard of living? What is the norm by which it is calculated ? Without going into the financial aspects, standards of living can be defined as an economic condition. There is almost full employment, people get not only their needs but also the best in food, clothing, shelter and other comforts. They may be enjoying some items of luxury like the automobile, television, telephone and radio. Their children may be sent to the best schools, and save something out of their pay packets. Comparatively speaking, economists calculate it in terms of calories of food consumed by the average citizen the type of cloth he purchased, or quantity of milk consumed. For instance, in USA, they speak of the standard of living in terms of motor cars owned by individuals.\n\nHow is this condition made possible ? The answer is very simple. It is by means of industrialization. In primitive societies agriculture has been one of the major industries. Their Gross National Product (GNP) in short was very limited as they produced mainly for their own consumption. What little they could spare they exchanged for the simple comforts of life; thus in such societies barter system was in vogue. But industrialization means much more than that. In industrialized countries all the natural resources like coal, oil water power, and minerals are exploited to the full. One industry calls for another industry. Thus they become supplementary and complementary. With the establishment of one industry other industry comes up. For instance, the building and transport industries are the concomitant of any major industry. Utilizing the by-products becomes a major industry. In a highly industrialized society industries grow on ever widening circles. As all these involve the basic laws of production and distribution, the industrialized society becomes very complex. All is not so rosy as painted here, for in the wake of industrialization very formidable problems of labor, political ideologies and unrest may crop up.\n\nNow looking at Japan, one of the most modem of the industrialized nations, one cane see what strides it has taken within two decades. Beaten beyond redemption in the last war, she has built up her nation magnificently and is one of the few economically strong ones. The Japanese have mastered modem technology unlike many of the Eastern nations. Her currency is strong and her exports show a favorable balance over imports. From a nation of toy makers, she has become almost the foremost nation in electronics, electrical motor and optical industries as well as ship-building. There is very little unemployment and thanks to her sound economy, she is able to stem the waves of communism. Many weak nations have turned to communism after the war hoping that it would solve their economic ills. It must be said to the credit of Japan that her people's indefatigable industry is her boom.\n\nTo conclude, if the post-war Japan is any the index for an industrious nation's prosperity, it is safe to conclude that the standard of living is directly linked with industrialization."

        "title": "Education makes people easy to lead but difficult to drive, easy to govern but impossible to enslave Discuss",
        "content": "This is a statement based on the values of education but it refers to one aspect of education, namely, the citizenship value. Education has of course many aims like earning bread and butter, shelter . clothing and a good life. The last concerns man as a member of a society. Except in a dictatorial society, the ordinary citizen is, theoretically at least, equal to every other citizen and enjoys equal rights. This equality enjoins equality of justice and equality of opportunity. No position in the public life can be said to be far from his reach because of his birth or creed provided of course he deserves it by education and qualification.\n\nIn every enlightened modem government, emphasis is laid on the education of its citizens. Up to a certain age education is made compulsory so that boys and girls get the benefit of it. They get enlightened and they are willing to obey and, given the chance, are ready to rule. Since almost every government in the world is governed by the representatives of the people, these representatives must be educated enough to shoulder the responsibility that falls on them. That is why one British Minister said, `Let us educate our masters' meaning that the people who vote their representatives for the highest legislative body of the country must be educated.\n\nEducation helps them realize their responsibilities while they appreciate their rights. They will be able to weigh their opinions before jumping into conclusions. They will know how to respect the opinion of others while they may stick to their own. They will remember there is always another side to a question when they differ. They have a right to say 'I beg to differ'. That is a sign of a civilized man. At the same time he will never allow himself to be treated as 'a dumb, driven cattle'. He does not like being driven. In whatever station he finds himself, the educated man can easily fit in. Real sign of education is that when he reaches an exalted position in life he never loses his head, when he is in a humble position he never breaks his head either. Thus an educated man shows equanimity. He will sail in fair weather or foul.\n\nThey know the value of leadership in any set up and they too know that to become a leader one must have certain desirable qualities. When a right leader is found, it is easier to follow him. Thus history is replete with examples where a down trodden or fallen people have followed a leader.\n\nPeople may follow a leader with almost religious fervor but if the people are not educated enough their loyalty shakes and wavers. There is a glaring example of this type in India where people followed Gandhiji's footsteps and when he left the scene he has become almost a legend only to be worshipped at times. His erstwhile followers have changed loyalties. In this case it is the miracle because of a faith akin to religion and not because of education. Had the people been properly educated, the present debacle would never have been there. In other words, when people are educated it is easier to lead them because they know the directions and they walk where others may limp. It is easy to lead an enlightened mass of people than a mob. The Roman mob wanted Brutus tragically enough 'to be Caesar' and later on when Antony worked on their minds, they called the same Brutus 'traitor'.\n\nAn educated person would follow, without being driven. He knows his limits as well as that of others, so if he senses that he is being driven he revolts. No force of government or the shackles of law can break his back. Physically he may be paralyzed but his spirit would be strong. Since democracy is a government by consent, the people should be well educated so that leadership among them may become possible. Here we should not confuse between an educated and a literary society. There are examples where such a paradox exists but it is only an exception rather than the rule. A really educated man is glad to follow but he would certainly resents being forced to follow.\n\nIt is easy to govern an educated group of people for they know the need for such governments for the smooth functioning of the society. They know the value of give and take. They know the value of the rule of the law. They know there must be somebody to govern, even though the authority comes from the people. They will never allow themselves to be enslaved. Their rights are sacrosanct and anybody encroaching it is not tolerated. Still there are some societies where in spite of education, allow themselves to be enslaved. These are historical accidents and the future historian may be able to find a clue to it. How long this state of things can continue, one cannot prophesy. It is safe to bet that such an artificial condition cannot continue to dominate forever.\n\nOne can conclude finally that education must be there for leadership qualities and good governing."

        "title": "Describe your ideas of complete mental and physical relaxation",
        "content": "Man is a bundle of nerves and muscles and due to the coordination of these all his movements become possible. One beauty about man is while he has the same nerves and muscles of other animals he is not one, because he has a unique faculty. The seat of those activities being the brain. The brain involve a man's life considerably. During the wakeful hours and to some extent during sleep, the brain, the nerves and the muscles do not stop functioning. These activities arc not merely mechanical and they involve biochemical changes in the body. That means in the tissues food particles are burnt and the end products are acids, carbon dioxide and water vapor. Though they are being periodically and regularly removed, they still linger in the tissues reducing their efficiency. This condition goes by the name of fatigue and the fatigued tissues refuse to function normally. They may be strained like the last straw on the camel's back.\n\nNow the symptoms of fatigue are the following; inattention, yawning, wandering of thought, lack of efficiency, feeling driven, restlessness, lack of interest and insomnia.\n\nTo do away with fatigue, relaxation is very important. Relaxation is usually secured by means of rest, recreation or change of occupation. When we relax the overworked part gets the needed rest and the toxins are cleared. Relaxation like the pursuit of a hobby, taking long walks, spending time in the company of books and with those whom one loves and changing occupation is certainly desirable. Swimming, painting, fishing, and playing games are physical recreations. Reading, singing folk songs, and community singing are some mental recreations. So the nature of recreation depends on whether fatigue is physical or mental.\n\nWork - fatigue - relaxation - this cycle is only nature's order. There is nothing to worry about. One should relax to work and work to relax. Life cannot be all work; nor can it be all relaxation, for 'All work and no play makes a boy dull and all play and no work makes a boy foolish'. So definitely work periods must be followed by relaxation out his time between work and relaxation. Even in the midst of work one may find ways of relaxation. Keeping the eyes closed for a few minutes, or stretching the limbs or lying flat, is sure to bring the needed relaxation. Noise is one of the things that brings about fatigue and so noise reducing methods are to be adopted. For instance, in cities big offices are insulated from noise and heat. Employees are provided with facilities for relaxation like shower bath, snacks and tea. Even the very decoration is calculated to ease tension. To this end furniture is designed to cause less fatigue.\n\nMentally one must know how to relax. One must run one's brains on light gear. Worry gnaws at the brain's efficiency and hence tension is created. One should practice how to switch off' thoughts for a while and relax. Mental relaxation is often secured by viewing life in its proper perspective.\n\nLast but not least adhering to proper sleeping hours is one way to relax both the body and mind for 'sleep is nature's secret restorer'.\n\nThe modern man with all life's complexities has every reason to learn how to relax if he wants to lead an efficient, healthy and useful life."

        "title": "\"Ease of communication in the modern world has become a disruptive influence\" Discuss",
        "content": "From the spoken language to the television everything comes under communication and the media therein is growing faster and faster. Communication includes the modes of transports as well. From the good old bullock cart to the Boeing 747 which is a super flying giant, there is a variety of communication depending on the nature of the country and the raw materials available. The people in a desert area may still use the camel for transport whereas in the icy tundra the Eskimo may depend on the sledge drawn by the reindeer. Communication facilitates easy movement and the spread of knowledge. Let us consider these two aspects separately.\n\nNow looking at communication, meaning mode of transport, man has made a tremendous headway. It has made movement of men and goods from one place to another very, very easy. No two points on earth can be said to be of any great distance. With the coming of the jet plane globe trotting is no more a dream. One can have his breakfast in Singapore, lunch in Tokyo, evening tea in San Francisco, dinner in New York and wake up the next morning in London. So what took nearly months of travel has been reduced to a few hours. So too with the movement of goods. Important medicines are flown across continents in urgent cases. Goods which are not too heavy are air lifted, for example fresh flowers are being flown daily to distant markets and cities, all over the world.\n\nThe automobile with its different versions has become ubiquitous and is a good competitor with the train. Wherever there is a road the motor car goes,. But for the omnibus, the life in a city would become awful. For a few pieces of copper or nickel one is able to travel fairly long distances to Ns place of business and back. The movement of goods in lorries has grown very popular. Because of its mobility, the automobile is indeed a blessing to man.\n\nThe railway train and the ship continue to serve though they have lost their glamour. It is not steam that gives the motive force. The oil has taken its place and thereby speed and efficiency have been added. The diesel-electric engines have a mighty pulling power and so long distance express trains now use them on their lines. Big ships are still used for hauling oil, food grains, machinery and timber. Where bulk is involved in transit, the railway train or the ship is the answer.\n\nComing to the communication of news and ideas, the radio and the television stands top ahead of the others. The radio works round the clock and so news is updated every hour. Television is used more for entertainment and to some extent in education.\n\nThough the radio and the television are in the field they cannot oust the newspaper easily. The newspaper is rightly called the fourth estate. The newspaper is not simply a news media but is also the shaper of views. The morning paper is as much welcome as one's morning cup of coffee. In the list of vehicles of communication, books have a respectable place. From the time man learnt to picture his ideas and give them shape in writing, books have been moulding men's thoughts and actions. There is no denying the fact that books have been silent companions and moulders of men. Examples are not wanting where a controversial single book has upset a whole nation. The film again is a powerful mass media of communication. It brings about audio and visual impressions.\n\nSo far the good aspects of modes of communication have been discussed. While their advantages easily out-weigh their bad influences, the latter are too powerful to be brushed aside. A few points would make it clear. The airplane, for instance, is used for spying. The bad influence of books on young minds is only too well known. The radio is often used for party purposes and to corrupt people. The television is not at all a blessing for the horror films shown very often have such a demoralizing effect on the teenagers. The automobile with its poisonous exhaust is polluting the atmosphere. The newspapers are not always fair and when they indulge in giving a banner headline for some sensational news they become the tools of disruption. The frenzy of a people is often whipped up by newspaper and this is not unusual.\n\nNevertheless one should not hasten to conclude communication is disruptive. True they have got influence. Some of them are good influences and some are too corrupt. One thing can be said without the fear of being contradicted and that is modem communication has helped to drive away ignorance."

        "content": "Whichever country one goes to there are class divisions. These classes are based on many factors, like religion, wealth, caste and colour. Even habits have created classes. In certain countries they speak of the Northerner and Southerner. Even in the major religions of the world we find class distinctions. Among the Christians for example, there are the Catholics and the Protestants; and there again they arc divided into a number of denominations. There are also divisions among the Muslims and Hindus. Wealth naturally, divides man into two classes namely, the 'haves' ant the have-nots'. In certain religions, notably among the Hindus, the caste System is very rigid. There is colourbar even in an advanced country like U.S.A. So we find the society, perforce has been divided into a number of classes.\n\nTo have a classless society is a modem idea. Thanks to the Communist philosophy the idea. of a classless society is being talked of, and in some cases, even worked out. To understand what it is a few words about the Communists Society will not be out of place. There they deny the existence of any religion. For them the State is the religion and the ultimate authority. Production and distribution are completely controlled by the government but, in fact, by the Communist Party. They see to it that no other party raises its head. All the needs the people are looked after by the government and so there is no need for class.\n\nBut ideals apart, in practice, it is rather the party than the government that controls everything. Party bosses are like demi-gods. When they deny to accept any religion, communism has become their religion, the Communist Manifesto their bible and Lenin, their Saviour. The party men control everything and highly technical people are in the good books of the party.\n\nThe peasant continues to be poor in spite of so much propaganda. So in the communist country, the party is the monolith with its own high priests and people as serfs.\n\nSo one can conclude that a classless society is impossible in the near future. Man with his difference in talent, intelligence, efficiency and health are bound to be divided by class.\n\nIn a classless society there should be an attempt to abolish all classes. Classes should not exist. Society must be conducted in such a way that the evils of classes are liquidated. Privileges should be enjoyed by everyone. Society must aim at social justice where all will enjoy the equality of opportunity and will be equal before law. By wisely handling taxation laws the accumulation of wealth by certain individuals can be avoided. Thus the evils of classes can be overcome.\n\nIt is clear a classless society is only an Utopian dream which can never be achieved."

        "content": "Currency is the easiest from to settle bargains in trade and commerce, whether it be in a simple, elementary level between a seller and buyer or in a complicated level between one country and another. Each country is having her own currency and it is valued in terms of an international currency e.g. pound sterling or the American dollar. This linking is purely a matter of convention and convenience and this helps in carrying on international trade directly with Great Britain or U.S.A. or indirectly with other countries through them. The importance arises in settling payments for exports and imports and for services.\n\nThe financing authority of a country can change the value of their currency in relation to other currencies according to the strength or weakness of her balance of payment. This is a jugglery and requires a lot of tact and prudence. Let us take an example. About two decades ago an American dollar was worth about S$3 which means a dollar worth of goods was equivalent to three Singapore dollars worth of goods. Where there was a normal condition and one country was not enjoying more advantages than the other this exchange ratio continued. But the dollar was devalued and it has become equivalent to S$1.75 today.\n\nWhy did they do it? Though it is more complicated it can be explained this way. Suppose there are more foreign goods going in, then in terms of the US dollars the in things will become costly and so it will discourage people from going in for foreign services. That would mean the internal economy may be geared to better production. If it is luxury goods people are getting from other countries, than the increase in cost will discourage them from going in for the foreign product e.g. the motor car. The internal prices will become costly but production will rise. While this may discourage internal consumption, a foreigner may find it cheaper to buy in his currency; thus the effect of devaluation may be to boost up exports and, in fact, the monopoly items may have a facelift and this will encourage an expansion of export trade and so there may be new markets established. The foreign investor will find it advantageous to invest in the devaluing country. His investment will get an artificial, boost. Thus devaluation would encourage the flow of foreign money into the devaluing country. In terms of foreign currency it would not be advantageous to take money out. That money would, perforce, be ploughed back into the country's economy.\n\nIndirectly it would mean the people would have to work hard. Foreign goods may become dearer. It would mean incentive for more production. But devaluation is to be handled very carefully; otherwise it would wreck the economy of the country, shake the confidence of the foreign investor and also the prestige of the country concerned."

        "title": "Select three outstanding contributors in the field of medicine and outline the special contributions each has made",
        "content": "There are many contributors who have done something significant in the field of medicine. Thus let us consider the contributions of Edward Jenner, Louis Pasteur, Fleming, Florey and Chani.\n\nJenner is remembered for his smallpox vaccine. Before his time thousands upon thousands of people became a victim to this scourge. Besides those who died, there were people who were deformed and those who lost their eyesight. Now with vaccination, the disease has been defeated completely. Smallpox is a viral, airborne disease and very difficult to control. The best way to combat is to build an immunity within the body.\n\nJenner noted that people who were dealing with the cows with pox did not suffer much even when they had smallpox. So he concluded that the cowpox had something to do with the lowering of the rigor of smallpox. He drew the lymph from the sores of the cow affected with cowpox and vaccinated ordinary persons. The result was wonderful. Those who were vaccinated had some fever and that was all. When they were exposed to smallpox, they never got it. So vaccination with small pox lymph has become universal and all countries have made vaccination, especially of babies, compulsory. Since vaccination as such cannot give life long immunity, periodical vaccination is recommended. The civic bodies who are also responsible for the health of the people have been authorized to vaccinate.\n\nLouis Pasteur is remembered for his antihydrophobic vaccine. Hydrophobia or rabies is caused by the bite of a mad dog or wolf. It is a dreaded disease. The victim develops a fear of water and in extreme cases howls like a mad dog and finally dies. The poison is passed through the saliva of the biting animal. Now Pasteur discovered that by injecting the brain tissues of a mad dog in small measured doses, the body can overcome the effects of a dog bite. Pasteur took the calculated risk and tried his vaccine on a boy and for fourteen feverish days he examined the blood of the boy. It did not show any positive indication of the presence of hydrophobia. Now Pasteur vaccine is available in big hospitals and none need to suffer from hydrophobia.\n\nNo medicine in recent times has made such a headway as Penicillin which is the forerunner of many antibiotics. This has ushered in a new world of medicines and has become almost a household word. Alexander Fleming found a sort of a moss like substance in his culture dish. Where this mould was formed, the culture was clear. He separated it and found it to have a very powerful effect on organisms by deterring their growth. He named it penicillin. But this knowledge was kept private for nearly ten years or more and only during the Second. World War of 1939 - 1945, was penicillin thought of and in 1940 Florey and Chani tried it on persons suffering from Syphillis and other similar diseases. They found excellent results and penicillin was used in the treatment and control of diseases caused by organic infection. At first it was found difficult to manufacture and preserve. Now alternate methods of manufacture have been found, so it costs almost nothing and refrigeration is not required. It is not an exaggeration to say that penicillin has opened a new era of medicine and for this discovery Fleming and his associates were awarded the much coveted Nobel Prize."

        "content": "Ever since the first atom bomb was burst in the Arizona desert, scientists have become aware of the radio active fallouts from the bursting of megaton bombs by Nuclear nations and subsequently the pollution of water by nuclear reactors. But this it not the first time that air and water are being polluted. For quite a long time it hat been going on, especially, since the coming of the petroleum to be used in the internal combustion engines. Oil in whatever form consumes the life-giving oxygen of the air and the end products mainly carbon dioxide fills up the atmosphere. The green parts of plants clear up this debris, consume the carbon in the process of photosynthesis and bring back the oxygen. There it a limit to this reaction. When the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere grows beyond tome tolerance level even all the green plants of the world will not be up to the task. Add to it the careless denudation of forest and wooded areas which are destroyed for the take of industries.\n\nThe results of such pollution are something like this. The atmosphere gets heated and the average temperature may go beyond what it is; at a result ice in the oceans may melt increasing the level of the teat and to the low lying areas may be submerged. The water in the teat get evaporated sooner and upset the balance.\n\nAnother thing that pollutes the air it dust particles. Dust particles and smoke in the air act at nucleus for the water vapor in the atmosphere to condense and form what it called 'smog'. This causes poor visibility to the motor car drivers and it a great handicap for airplanes to land and take off.\n\nThe pollution of water it equally serious, still it it growing at a rapid pace. Chemical wastes from factories and nuclear reactors are drained into rivers, lakes and teat. At first the water becomes unfit for drinking. Where the water hat not been properly sterilized, it has led to serious epidemics like jaundice. Furthermore it tells on the aquatic life, both plants and animals. Fishes die or they carry small doses of radio active elements in them that those who consume them may die; so too in the case of plants.\n\nThis has caught the eye of the public in the U.S.A. that recently the Americans observed what is called the Earth Day or Environment Control Day. They have become aware of it and the government, the labor force, students and artists arc involved in fighting against such pollution. In many of the States, they raised loud voices that the government has come forward to do something. For instance, in his State of the Union address once President Nixon said: \"The great question of the seventies is, shall we surrender to our surroundings or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, land and water.\"\n\nThere was much talk on Earth Day about closing the loop. The terms will have much significance in the future as science and technology turn more attention to progress that will take man's waste and recycle it into the system thereby making better use of what already had been taken from the earth and conserving the resources that are left.\n\nIf man does not act now, the ecological systems will breakdown creating diseases man cannot resist, loss of food supplies from lakes and seas, the necessity of gas masks whenever one goes outside. Can it happen? Obviously, it can and will, if man fails to act right from now."

        "title": "\"Demonstrations are acceptable, even admirable, provided they are not accompanied by violence\". Do you agree with this view ?",
        "content": "If analyzed, the spirit of the question is whether collective bargaining should be allowed and, if so, to what extent.\n\nWhat is the philosophy behind collective bargaining ? When the capitalist was hard and heartless and exploited the labor force, mistreating them and overworking them, sympathy went to the worker and, by degrees, the workers' right to form, unions was legally established. Not only were these unions recognized but also their power began to grow and to be felt. Thanks to these unions, the labor could bargain and drive the capitalist to yield to demands whenever they were reasonable. They made the capitalist realize that the unions had come to stay and hence had to put up with them, however irksome and unpleasant it may be. This right to form unions has helped the labor force in getting welfare measures and several benefits like bonus, compensation against accident, gratuity and other perks. So it can be said confidently that the position of labor is not what it was a century back, rather they hold the upper hand.\n\nBut one can see that labor force is not always satisfied. In spite of the benefits there is always the cleft between the capital and labor and the latter feels that they arc being exploited while the former feels that the labor is always a disgruntled lot. Situations are bound to arise when there cannot be absolute agreement between the employer and the employee. Where such differences cannot be solved in an amicable way, the labor resorts to many types of coercive steps, of which demonstration is one.\n\nDemonstration goes to show to the public what grievances are there and how they are in the right. The demonstration may be one-sided sometimes. Whatever may be the grouses, demonstration serves one purpose; it helps create public opinion. Demonstration may take many Dorms. There may be posters, public meetings, processions with slogans, mass petitions or virulent strikes. Demonstration is a sort of an agitation and the public may be affected immediately directly or indirectly. Strikes call for the attention on the part of the government and a solution may be sought. So chains of negotiation and arbitrations may go on till some sort of solution is arrived at. Very often it is the labor who benefits in the end.\n\nThere is no guarantee that demonstrations may always be quiet and peaceful. Where numbers are concerned, more often than not, demonstrations are likely to turn violent. It may be due to an inadvertent remark or imprudent act. It depends largely on the leadership and education of labor. Where the leadership is in safe hands, things may not go out of control. Very often trouble is caused because some one in the crowd feels he is an injured party and begins to act violently. In all these cases the stateless and addressless mob jumps into the fray. It is not often those who are having grievances that cause trouble but the mob. From this view point demonstrations are not wholly acceptable.\n\nPerhaps human society will have to evolve a new method of settling disputes without resorting to demonstrations. It is time that the ideas of unionist are changed, the sooner the better for all.\n\nThough demonstration in relation to labor has been discussed, there are other demonstrations especially students whose causes are different. So for all demonstrations a suitable solution ought to be found.\n\nDemonstrations for even minor complaints are popular today because everybody wants to assert his right without remembering his responsibility. This kind of demonstration is unacceptable."

        "title": "\"We are in the midst of a second industrial revolution\". What does this statement mean, and what are likely to be the effects of the revolution ?",
        "content": "Every student today knows what is meant by the 'Industrial Revolution' and how it was brought about and what its effects were. When we speak of the Industrial Revolution, we mean what took place mainly in England during the course of the last century followed by other Western countries.\n\nThe main seed of the Industrial Revolution was the use of the machine instead of manually operated tools. These machines used mainly steam power which was followed later by oil power and electricity. This change in the use of machines brought about very radical changes in the methods of production and commerce. There was mass production and things were produced for a market rather than domestic consumption. Mass production resulted in the factory system with its concomitant changes. The rural set up was almost, if not completely, changed. Agricultural laborer became the factory hand; independent aritsans lost his traditional market. The coming of the Industrial Revolution brought many a social problems in its wake. A major effect was that labor became conscious and got united and, in due course, became a force to reckon with. Today, labor is more powerful than the capitalist. Again with the coming of mass production trade and commerce became complicated and communications got improved.\n\nSomething similar is happening today. Especially after the war much water has flowed down the bridge. Efficient and faster modes of communication have, come into existence. To quote examples, there are jet plane, supersonic plane and the radar. The assembly line, though it was brought in at the beginning of the century, has become more streamline and is being adapted in many departments. Pure science has given away to applied science ushering in an era of technology. Computers and electronics have taken over many hard complicated and sensitive jobs from human hands and, for the matter are more perfect, reliable and efficient. Technology has helped in polymer chemistry, physics has helped in rocketry and space travel. So business is being managed scientifically. It is no more a simple question of production, distribution, supply and demand. Psychology is being applied to business problems. In short it is actually a Technological Revolution.\n\nThis Revolution has helped man to plant his feet on the moon. More machines do the job means many people would be thrown out of job. There is a genuine fear that the computers, for example, may create unemployment, though they who advocate the computers argue the other way. They say that some such fear was expressed when the railway lines were laid. But it was not so. So it may be with the automatic machines. newer type of jobs will be created; perhaps better qualified men will be called for and that would create more new openings. This would result in lesser working hours and more hours of leisure.\n\nReally that is the crux of the problem. How to provide for the leisure hours of millions. When man ceases to work with hands, there may be organic changes brought about in him, almost amounting to mutation. A number of books have been written about what man would be in 2000 A.D. and many of them include the works by great scientists."

        "title": "\"Technologically man is a giant, morally a pygmy\" Discuss",
        "content": "Man does not live by bread alone'. This is a popular maxim. If man does not live by bread alone, what else does he need to make him live a man ? That is the crux of the discussion.\n\nWho is a giant ? Literally giant is a person of huge physical proportions and extra-ordinary powers and strength. Fables say that there were such persons having the strength of hundreds of men. Thus Hercules was a famous epic figure with immeasurable strength that he could lift a mountain on his shoulders. Swift speaks of such giants of Borbdinnag in his 'Gullivers Travels'. Children's stories are very often replete with the exploits of giants.\n\nNow, how is technology a giant ? Well just look at the super fortresses going at supersonic speed and carrying hundreds of passengers ? Consider the giant power houses producing millions and millions of watts of power. Even the earthmover, the tractor, the excavators and so on are all instances of mechanical giant. Modern production depends on this mechanical giants.\n\nThe knowledge and possession of these machines have made man a giant indeed. Technology is the off-shoot of applied science and with technology, man today commands limitless power. Otherwise how can man go and land on the moon? The power behind the Apollo Spacecrafts is something stupendous and breath taking. Man is adding to his power by a very large measure to the extent that humanity is afraid and apprehensive of the future because of the technological man.\n\nMan has grown technologically, but not grown in his moral stature. That is really lamentable. To be moral is to be concerned with right and wrong conduct or duty to one's neighbor and to conform to conscience if not the law in the matter of practicing virtue. Man stands apart from other creatures, not because of appearance or strength or beauty but because he is moral and hence spiritual. Man knows his duty to others and in his evolution from primitive nature into what he is today he has grown morally. Various institutions are in existence and do\n\nfunction because they are basically moral and confirm to the moral code. When the dictum says 'Thou shall not steal' or covet another's wife' it is morality that is involved. All the religions of the world enjoin on man this conduct.\n\nThe Sum and Substance of the Sermon on the Mount is nothing but a directive for moral conduct. Every language of the world has some books or others prescribing moral conduct. But, does man heed to them ? What do we see around us today ? Have we grown wiser and saner ? Has the past history taught us the right behavior ? When one considers questions like this one is forced to face the sorrowful conclusion that man continues to be barbarous. Two great wars were fought in the course of this century, still man has not given up warring. Look at Southwest, Asia. Where the world is almost sitting on a powder keg and the smoke there can develop into a huge conflagration and consume all that are very near and dear, One will simply shudder to think of such a possibility. What does all this mean ? Man is a pygmy morally.\n\nThe Pygmy is the shortest of human beings and pygmies live in Equatorial Africa. Just as a pygmy is short in physical stature, so too is man in moral stature. The more one looks at the contemporary world and how governments and, individuals behave, one will agree with the wise crack who said, \"that the apes might one day disown man as being their successors\". To win physical power over nature's forces, man has lost Heaven and morally the degeneration has set in and the Promised Land appears to be far, far way. With the degeneration in morality all the institutions which man has striven to build in the course of several centuries would be lost in the morasses of immorality. The world should realize that man does not live by bread alone. Once he loses his soul all his achievements will be like jewelry on a dead body."

        "title": "What part should the teaching of crafts have in the school curriculum ?",
        "content": "The curriculum comprises of what the pupil is supposed to learn and study at the school. As knowledge expands, the curriculum also grows. The aim of education is to prepare the pupil for life such that he or she can settle in life as useful citizens, to themselves and to society at large. In order to be useful one should be trained to use his faculties or talents in the best way possible. The faculties are physical, mental and intellectual. There should be a sort of co-ordination between these faculties and they should be integrated in the course of education.\n\nIn ancient days and even quite recently education meant only training in the three R's viz. Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. But those days are gone. Many, abilities other than that will have to built in the child so that he may leave the school prepared to face the challenges of life.\n\nSuch abilities include the use of the hands as well. Man is not all brain. The curriculum must provide opportunities for motor activities. They can be conveniently called doing activities. These doing activities involve muscular co-ordination.\n\nMan is an aesthetic animal, he can appreciate and admire good and beautiful things. Given the chance and training man imitates nature and creates beautiful things. Man is the only creative animal. What we are today and all that our culture stands for, we own man's spirit of creation. Man has created a lot of beautiful artifacts. From the ordinary pin to the much sophisticated supersonic planes and computers, man has shown his ability to create and even to surpass nature.\n\nThis spirit of creativity involves what is called craft in the school curriculum. Whenever the pupil uses his hands and fingers in doing and creating beautiful pictures or things, it is called art and craft. Art and craft can be learnt for its own sake or it can be also applied to science and technology.\n\nCraft work pleases the person who practices it. From the child who makes castle in the sand to the designer of complicated machinery there is the pleasure in creation. Not only from the utility point of view but also from the point of view of pleasure, crafts must find a place in the school curriculum.\n\nAnother psychological factor involves the importance of teaching crafts. A normal child is active and wants to use his hands and feet. This is evidenced by many a child activity. This instinct to act is being channeled in useful ways in the teaching of crafts. So crafts can bring about a psychological transformation in the child. In fact it is the expensive medium for a not-too-intellectual.\n\nThere are many crafts like drawing, painting, carpentry, weaving and bookbinding. Some of these crafts have a professional value as well as recreational value. Realizing their educational value Gandhiji introduced his famous craft centered education which he called 'Basic Education'. Some of the crafts can be taught in the curriculum of special schools. Crafts have some value later in life for the student. He can practice crafts peculiar to a locality. For grown-up boys crafts with utility value like watch repairing, electric wiring and radio repairing should be taught. This may mean extra work for the staff and additional expense to the society but it is worth the effort."

        "title": "Why has the rate of scientific advance been so much greater in the twentieth century than in earlier centuries ?",
        "content": "One notable thing about science after the advent of the Industrial Revolution and indeed quite recently has been that science began not only knowing about the truth but also doing and creating things which could be consumed by people. It began with the advent of inventing machines for all sorts of purposes. Things which could be made by hand by a few artisans and consuming time and energy were being made by machines in a very short time and cheaply too.\n\nThere are several factors contributing to this rate of growth of science. One of them is the quicker mode of transport and communication; second is the widening of the market; the third is the spread of education and the fourth may be attributed to political reasons. The last is the technological advancements quite unheard of.\n\nThough the railways came at the beginning of the fast century, it didn't make such a spectacular progress as the internal combustion engine. With the discovery of petroleum the petrol driven motor car became almost ubiquitous. Its easy operation, not too cumbrous mobility, its tractability and its cheapness made it very popular soon. Thus road transport became efficient and quicker and as a result no place in a country had been remote. Men and goods began to move quickly.\n\nThe air-age which was ushered in by The Wright Brothers has brought in a mode of communication where seas and mountains are no bar. This again helped man and ideas travel far and faster. The mingling of cultures helped in bringing about a market for different things and hence scientific knowledge in creating and improving things was sought after. From the Wright's plane to a supersonic plane it is a long way indeed and science has been the hand maid dishing out the necessary technical information. Here one could see the truth of the saying 'necessity is the mother of invention'.\n\nEvery one knows that today the space crafts are part of the world communication system. From V1, V2, rockets of the war period to Lunarcraft a good lot had been done in space travel, both manned and unmanned. Now the satellites, are doing many useful functions as in weather forecasting, TV broadcasting and live telecast programs.\n\nUnder communication radio and television have to be included. Here is a field which finds use in civilian as well as military purposes. Their educational and entertaining value has been accepted. Thus with each field of communication opening up, science advances faster.\n\nWith the ever widening market there is a demand for a variety of goods. As somebody has remarked about the scientific advancement that an English lady shopping in a supermarket can get all the things which even King Solomon couldn't command with all his treasures. Most of them, if not all of them were created by science. One industry creates the need for another and thus science spreads and advances. Many goods used by ordinary people today were not there a generation or two ago such as terylene, ball-point pen and detergents. In fact, with the coming of the space Age, a newer food technology has sprung up. So one need not wonder if one takes his lunch in the decade to come like the astronauts did. In fact, there is a move in the direction.\n\nAnother important factor is the spread of education which is no more the preserve of the privileged few. With the spread of education scientific knowledge has also spread fast. If knowledge is strength, greater strength is given by scientific knowledge. With his knowledge countries get to know and try to increase their wealth. A fine example is the case of Japan. She is highly advanced scientifically and she is far ahead of many countries in technology.\n\nNecessity also has quickened the pace of advancement of science. For many reasons the help of science is sought and deliberate research is carried on in particular fields. Herein governments and big industries play an important role.\n\nPolitical rivalry is, to a great measure, the cause for the advancement of Science. This is more obvious in the case of the USA and the USSR. They vie with one another in being the first in many fields. This is so particularly in science or in defense production. One should only look at how this sort of rivalry has led to the proliferation of atomic weapons and transcontinental missiles. This has given the necessary impetus to science and each government is spending millions of dollars on research and production.\n\nWith the advancement of technology many wonderful tools have been invented, and the most note-worthy one is the 'Computer'. This is becoming so universal that it is being used to solve problems which could have been looked upon as ludicrous a few decades ago.\n\nThus there are many contributory factors for the rapid advance of science in recent times."

        "title": "Discuss the advantages and disadvantages to a developing nation of receiving economic aid from other nations",
        "content": "The spirit of giving aid is magnanimous; it blesses the nation that gives and the nation that receives. An aid cannot be equated to alms giving nor it is a doling of charity. An aid assumes that the receiver can be sustained at the right time. It also assumes an equality sharing of the products not in the economic sense but in a social and altruistic sense.\n\nAfter the World War II, the USA found the wisdom of helping under-developed nations and those that were battered by the war. By virtue of her position, the USA could help. Of course willingness was there and Marshall Plan under which the USA helped the European nations has become a classic example. The USA had a surplus of many goods which she could easily part with. This, of course, had an economic advantage for her for otherwise she would have to face a glut of goods leading on to recession.\n\nThis is an example only to show how economic aid had become a necessity in the modem world. There are nations which have had an advance start and so their economy has been sound. But there are many nations of the world who have to start almost from scratch. If these nations were allowed to starve by the most favored nations, the former may turn to ideologies other that democratic. All the things cherished by enlightened nations would be blown to pieces. This had happened despite the aid given to nations on the brink of starvation.\n\nAdvantages of the aid: The aid takes many forms. It need not be financial aid. It can be in the form of food, technical know-how and basic machinery to build industries. Most of the developing nations have a chronic shortage of food, dairy products and medicines to fight diseases. The USA has been supplying milk products, cotton seed oil and wheat products. This has helped the developing nations in more than one way. Their new formed energy need not be merely wasted in creating food but could be used in building her economy solidly. The nation's needy may be kept satisfied as otherwise it would lead to internal strife and revolutions. One of the main objectives of food aid is to help the nation's children with healthy and supplementary food, so that they can in turn be productive.\n\nThe Technical know-how helps the receiving nation to build suitable industries. Thus India built three major steel industries with the aid from Germany, the USSR and England. Atomic reactors have been built with help from Canada and the USA. Again under the technical aid program exchange of experts is being arranged to overhaul her industries and thus improve her economy. This exchange of know-how is perhaps the best form of aid.\n\nAid in the form of machinery to increase production is welcome. For example, farm machinery to developing countries does go a long way to increase production. This may include the supply of good farm stock in the form of seeds and so on. High yielding varieties of paddy have been thus introduced in rice growing countries.\n\nReceiving aid has also its pitfalls. The donor nation may attach strings to her aid which will make the receiving nation dependent on the donor forever. Instances are not wanting to illustrate this point. Airplanes were supplied to a country and adequate spare parts were never supplied.\n\nA major disadvantage is that such aid kills the initiative on the part of the receiving nation. They think they can depend on the donor at all times and they take aid given for granted. They forget that the donor nation had to struggle hard once to reach her present level of prosperity. They forget to set their house in order and very often expect the other country to come forward to help in their economic woes.\n\nAid is not after all charity. The aid will have to be returned at some time or other. When the receiving nation cannot produce goods or services, the aid is kept up and the receiving nation has to face the humiliation of having a debt in the form of aid loans. This is a sore situation and any self respecting nation would resent it. The psychology of indebtedness to another for any kind of service received is there. When the receiving nation, for reasons better known to her, does not support the donor nation in her policies, it is resented, and more often than not, a threat is thrown of revising the quantum of aid or abolishing it completely.\n\nAids cannot be avoided as the economics of different countries are not the same. Some had an early start and are naturally endowed with resources and some countries have been handicapped for exactly the opposite reasons. So the best form of aid will be to share the know- how so that relationships of one country with another will not be lopsided."

        "content": "Patriotism is a loyal feeling which one has about his own country. In the words of Scott when he said 'this is my own, my native land' he must have a deep and passionately loyal feeling for his country. According to this a man without this feeling dies unsung and unhonored. This feeling had kindled many dormant nations into actions. It has made people fight against tyrants and deposed them. It has shaken the very roots of empires. In every nation and in every language the bards have sung about the greatness of patriotism and they have called upon patriotism to brook no delay in throwing out the conqueror. History is replete with instances where patriotic people under an able leadership rallied round and resisted aggression and saved their land. Joan of Arc, Simon Bolivar and M. K. Gandhi are some of the famous names who fought for the freedom for their countries, with a burning patriotic zeal.\n\nOne must take pride in the culture and beauty of one's own country. The rivers, mountains, hills, valleys and dales must inspire his patriotic feeling. He must fight against the forces that tarnish the fair name of his country. Given the chance, he should encourage the art and trade of his country. He must support his country as his duty. He will never do anything that would bring down the fair name and image of his country.\n\nOne must live for his country and even be prepared to sacrifice all for the sake of his country. Today, unfortunately after the Second World War we find acute-nationalism wrongly identified with patriotism.\n\nNationalism is a phenomenon mostly seen today in many countries. These people become militant and are against foreigners who had come and settled in one' country. There may be legitimate fear warranting such action as in the case of 'The White Australian Policy'. This is patriotism laced with self interest. This is the cause of much misunderstanding and bickering among nations.\n\nIn the present context of the world narrow patriotism is really outmoded. No country today, however, powerful or rich can stand aloof. The world is shrinking with the coming of faster modes of communication and no country is too far away. The complex economy of the world had every country depending on one another. What affects the people in Pakistan may affect the people in the U.S.A. This interdependence cannot be overlooked. Self contained condition is only a thing of the past. Every culture today is what it has rowed from other cultures; no culture can boast of being pure. So there is no meaning in narrow nationalism.\n\nIt is safe to conclude that fanatic patriotism is bad though loving one's own country and contributing for its betterment and good ideals is a noble act."

        "content": "The first part of the statement can be easily argued out; but the second part requires some consideration. It is partially true and partially false.\n\nThe first part says that ease of communication is of doubtful advantage. This is not so. Communication involves mechanical movement as well as verbal communication. Mechanical communication involving movement may fall under three broad categories namely, land, sea and air. In all these there had been phenomenal advancement in the last two centuries. Progress has been by leaps and bounds. The steam and the railcar brought distant places much nearer. This was followed by the motor car with its various shapes and sizes. It has a signal advantage over the railway in that a motor car is very convenient for going anywhere. Whereas a train only goes to certain towns. Wright brothers with their invention opened up a new era in air travel. Today we are entering an age of supersonic planes and rockets where two places on earth will not be distant. Thus sea travel, perhaps the oldest of the three, has been left behind for faster modes of travel.\n\nAs they bring different people together for business and fun, there is a mingling of culture and no culture can be said to be in its virginity today. This brings about better understanding among different peoples of the world. There is more appreciation today of different cultures than it was a few decades ago.\n\nLooking into verbal communication the spoken word and the written word call our attention. The spoken word is heard not only from person to person but through the radio, tape recorders, cinema and the television. Books, magazines and newspaper represent the written word. the literature in any language is a reflection of a particular culture and as such when people read and hear from another they partake the beauties of the other culture. Sometimes they have a devastating effect as in the case of yellow culture and horror comics. But that is only far and few between. So case of communication had brought about the spread of culture and to some extent international understanding.\n\nThe second part of the statement, 'it might kill a culture worthy of preservation'. No culture can be safe against the onslaught of time unless it has the seeds of change in itself. After all culture represents the way life lived, and no static culture can hope to survive. The readiness with which a culture could change shows its dynamism. Nothing can illustrate this better than comparing Japan and African countries. Both have come under the influence of the West. Keeping its basic character intact Japan could readily absorb the good from the West. But many of the African countries though they were ruled by the Europeans could not absorb the Western culture as fast as Japan did and so the difference between the said two cultures are obvious.\n\nDespite case of communication good things in a culture can be preserved. It is up to the people to preserve it. In this jet age people cannot sweat by the bullock cart which may be there but all too soon it would meet with a slow death as it has happened with the Maories and Red Indians.\n\nIn the fabric of culture the material may remain the same though the dyes and designs may change. But if the people were blind to this basic fact, naturally, their culture will suffer. So the blame must be on the people rather than on communication."

Education is not merely getting certain diplomas and degrees. Education is to civilize the man and to draw the best in him.

His morals are only superficial.\n\nThe fruit of his knowledge does not normally filter to the ordinary level. So the fruits of his knowledge are no more fruits since they do not reach the common man for further propagation. This snobbery is seen even among the members of a family especially when the son educated in a college begins to look down upon his own parents and their ways of life. The life in a hostel does not normally improve the character of a student. Hostel is after all a place where one pays for the services and having enjoyed certain conveniences the educated boy or girl returns home only to find things very different. He cannot adjust himself to the common surroundings since he has had a taste of the artificial world outside. Thus the educated man is an alien in his own home and familiar surroundings.\n\nIn most countries the type of education given is only to fit the student for a particular job; very rarely is education given to fit him for life outside. Very often a student going to a western country tries to ape the habits, way of life and puts on artificial way of talking.\n\nIn order to overcome this lopsided development, educationists from Rousseau downwards have recommended methods where the child will learn in a natural atmosphere instead of being pulled out of it. The glamour of studying abroad is always attractive. There is a need for change in the philosophy of education so that the life's purpose may be made clear and the objectives or goals reached."

        "content": "From the nature of the question it goes without saying how to test the given statements. Items (a) and (c) are very, very easily tested and can be proved. The second one might not be easy, but not that space vehicles have gone to the moon and man himself has set his foot there, that too can be proved.\n\nThe phenomena of interference and diffraction prove that light is a wave motion. The experiments of Dr. Young and Fresnel prove that light behaves in the form of waves to produce diffraction. The brilliant colors sometimes noticed in the light reflected from thin films of oil, very thin pieces of mica or glass, soap bubbles and the like arc due to interference between the light reflected from the front and back surfaces of the film.\n\nIt is much easier to test for the presence of carbon dioxide in a bottle. When a rod dipped in lime water is taken into the bottle the lime water turns white showing the presence of carbon dioxide. Again a burning candle may be taken into the bottle when it is put out. So the presence of carbon dioxide is verified.\n\nSo far as the atmosphere around the moon was concerned, till recently people were only having conjectural evidences. Now that every sensitive instrument has been sent to the moon and from its readings it has been proved beyond doubt that there is no atmosphere as such around the moon.\n\nIn the three instances given there is an obvious degree of difference in their provability. In the case of the bottle with carbon dioxide it is by far the easiest. Any student in the secondary class could prove it. In the case of the light as a wave motion, it requires a sophisticated apparatus to prove the phenomenon. In the third case it is extremely difficult for an ordinary man to visualize it. But since it has been proved so by others, one has to accept it.\n\nIt is safer to conclude that while facts are propositions, they be verified. It is good to experiment and prove because science as it stands today does so on this solid foundations of proof."

        "content": "It all depends upon how one takes the word 'alter' to mean. It means simply to change. Then change what ? There are many types of changes and 'change' is used in many contexts. We speak of the change of weather, change of ministry, change of timetable or change of mind.\n\nThen what does the statement mean ? It means that historians change history and give it new interpretations. Events have happened and cannot be changed even God himself cannot change the past, but historians can look upon past events in history from different angles according to their convictions. Thus the way Gibbon wrote history is different from the school of Toynbee.\n\nHistorians lay stress and emphasis on history in different ways. What had really happened may be disapproved and a new light could be thrown on past events. A few examples will illustrate the point. There is a popular episode in the History of India, known as The Black Hole of Calcutta which was only a myth, so blame was foisted on the poor Nawab of Bengal by the English in order to make him look like a scapegoat.\n\nAnother leaf in the Indian History is the Sepoy Mutiny. British Historians love to magnify the horrors of the Mutiny, but modem Indian historians look upon it as the first struggle for Independence, which was completed almost a century later by M.K. Gandhi. Thus we see the meaning of how man can alter the past even history if God can't.\n\nAnother example is Joan of Arc who fought against the Black Prince. In her days she was subjected to inquisition and was accused of witchcraft and was burnt at the stake. History has altered the past and Joan has been canonized to become St. Joan.\n\nEven in current times when one country attacks another to liberate it from a conqueror it is seen as a rape. This is the case in the Middle East, South Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\nThus we see the statement is true to some extent that historians are able to change history; that is to change the meaning of an event which occurred without changing the event itself.\nAnother aspect of history was that it was looked upon only as a chronicle of events, a catalogue of genealogies, a course of events, leading to battles and war and their settlements. Here a great emphasis was laid on the dates and personalities. But a new school of historians is coming up headed by Professor Toynbee. He looks upon history in a more scientific way and to them history is nothing but a mass social movements in which the events are only milestones."

        "title": "More scientists and technologists are coming to know more and more about their own specialist subjects and less and less about anybody else's. What are the causes of this change and what are its dangers ?",
        "content": "The growth of knowledge leads to compartmentalization and specialization. In its general aspect knowledge is a unity of the various topics studied. The tree may be one for the purpose of study but it is composed of many distinctive parts with particular functions. Even no two leaves are alike. So too in the case of science. As scientific knowledge develops fast, each branch of study becomes distinct and comprehensive. Those who study medicine to qualify as doctors after a number of years, become general practitioners before they branch out into other fields of medicine to become specialists.\n\nWith the growth of different branches of science, specialization becomes inevitable. Look at the wheelwright of the olden days and a modern motor foreman in a workshop. In the former case he knew all about wheels. He was the master of all the processes. From the time of selecting the raw material to the finished product he is everything. But in a motor workshop, there are several specialists connected with the car. There may be an expert in engine, another in the electric circuit, a third in gears. While each one may be competent in his own field, none of them will be competent to deal with the motor car as a whole. This is perhaps the difference between industries of old and modern technology.\n\nSpecialization goes for efficiency and rapid growth. Quicker results become possible. For example, we are not astounded to hear that every two minutes or so a finished car rolls out of the Ford Plant. This is the result of combined effort of thousands of specialists along the production or 'Assembly' line. Given all the tools, even the best of a craftsman would not be able to assemble a car even within a year. Thus technology has enabled mass production.\n\nThis is true of science. Each major branch of science has dozens and dozens of sub branches. So in chemistry there are many branches; e.g. the man who is a specialist in biochemistry does need to know much of fuel chemistry. So too in physics. As knowledge advances this division becomes necessary. It is like a book of knowledge; the book is one but each page contains something different from the other.\n\nIf things move smoothly, no difficulty is seen, but once difficulty starts, one has to hunt for an expert. If he is not available the whole unit stops functioning. When one is a master, he can shoot troubles easily.\n\nFor instance look at the commercial air ways of a country. Those who are employed are the pilots, air hostesses, engineers, ground engineers and other technical personnel. When there is some trouble in the air craft the whole organization suffers. This is true of any big scientific or technological organization and this leads to many social problems, sometimes to willful obstruction of work and the consequent suffering as the technologists are in a bargaining position.\n\nSpecialization may also lead to other problems especially in the field of production. More technologists, means more production. Unless there is a market to absorb all that is produced the vicious circle of economic crisis may come. So far as there is an expanding market this difficulty may not be felt. But, with restricted or preferred market, the above difficulty becomes unavoidable and may, in extreme cases, spark a war.. That is how, they say World Wars got started.\n\nSo one can safely conclude that specialization is not such an unalloyed blessing."

        "content": "Science fiction as the name implies deals with certain scientific facts which are woven into the fabric of fiction. If the novelist is careful in depicting the scientific fact the fiction becomes really interesting. It is not necessary that he must be thorough in his facts but if he can make one believe that story is probable, then he has done a good job.\n\nThere had been several writers of such a kinds of science fiction. They are Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and others. 'Around the World in eighty Days' and 'A Trip to the Moon' by Jules Verne are very popular for what he prophesied have become true. It does take not eighty days but eighty hours or even much less today to go round the world, so with his trip to the moon. The launching site which Verne mentions in his book is almost very near Cape Kennedy and Verne's moon men landed on the Pacific on their return. Only the fact that Verve's men did not land on the moon though they went round the moon goes to prove that these writers have some knowledge of science.\n\nThe present moon trips have revived the interest in Verne. Many journals have praised the work of Jules Verne. It is a wonder how he could have been so correct in launching and getting back his moon men. The appeal is limited because it is merely of fictional value with a lot of imagination. The emotional value is wanting. One shall agree with this remark when one reads Verne's 'Around the World in Eighty Days' There is enough adventure and several scientific facts are utilized. All modes of transport known in those days are mentioned. Even the geographical fact that as one travels East the time is advanced is being deftly used at the end. We may race with the adventures but once the 'END' is reached there may not be any urge to take the book again unless there is a need for reviewing the fact. The human element of romance does not play a major part in such kinds of fiction.\n\nH.G. Wells has written some famous science fictions, the most famous of them being. 'The Time Machine'. 'Frankenstein' is another science fiction and has been notorious for its evil that 'Frankenstein' has become almost an idiom for evil and cruelty. It is, in short, the story of a doctor, (scientist?) who wanted to create a man of his own choice. He believed he had found out the way for it. But a mistake committed by his assistant changes the course of the experiment. Instead of creating a superman, the experiment ends in the birth of a demon Frankenstein who revels in murderous aspects. Finally he tries to kill the scientist himself but the demon was burnt by people. It is a horror picture with a moral; it was a parody on science's claims.\n\nA similar story we see in Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'. It may be taken as a big allegory where evil when allowed to grow, kills the good. Again this story has given the idiom 'Dr. Jekyll' and 'Mr. Hyde' to the English Language.\n\nWhatever may be their merit, those stories or fictions are not for ordinary man who cannot follow scientific implication."

        "content": "When girls dress like boys and young men look like women there is something deeply wrong. Going deeper into the root of this, it maybe worthwhile to note why men and women dress as they do. From simple nakedness into which man is born he began to dress himself. At first he had to dress against the rigors of weather especially cold. As long as clothing served it basic purpose he never cared whether it was soft or rough the material from which it was made. As knowledge of weaving, dyeing and much later, the knowledge of tailoring developed, man began dressing and woman draping herself in fashionable clothing. This change was more rapid in western countries than in the East. In Europe, they held on to a dress of a particular fashion because they were conservative.\n\nBut the change in dressing has been at a fast pace in America. The War (Great World War II) accelerated this trend. For the sake of convenience and economy certain types of dresses became a regulation dress and the civilian also took to it because it was found to be comfortable and convenient. The 'slack' may be cited as an example. The cinemas set up new trends in fashion and youngsters began clamoring for such dresses. Thus the tight pants and beach dress in the case of girls became a fashion.\n\nThe way youngsters dress was a revolt against the established order and norm. Many of the movements got started in America and today because of it's permissive society the dress has become too short and is now only a micro mini. They do it in bravado spirit of 'What can you do ?'\n\nYoung hippies dress like women, grow hair and sometimes appear like mendicants. They lead a life of their own. They want to live like 'Adam and Eve' indulging in free love. Nowadays it is common to see men wearing chains, bracelets and ear rings like women. The opposite way of dressing is taking place.\n\nIn the case of some girls they want to get noticed and seek attention so they wear clothes that are worn by men like tight jeans that are torn at knee caps to make a statement of their dressing.\nBy dressing this way both sexes are trying to defy each other and veering away from established fashion trends."

A porch conveniently becomes a garage.\n\nA modern house has a garage, a covered shed for dustbin and a large utility room which contains the central heating system. Bedrooms have bathrooms attached. The kitchen has a number of modem appliances like the range and dish washer. Even in the cheapest house the layout of the kitchen is planned to save time and labor. Cookers, tables and shelves are grouped conveniently to reduce walking, bending and stretching. Windows have good light coming in. Walls, floors and ceilings do not absorb dirt and grease and are therefore kept clean.\n\nModern houses have a comparatively smaller area. All amenities are built in. There are no cumbrous projections and ill-lit passages. There is not much difference in the floor level of the different rooms of the house. The colour of the wall, the furnishings and even the furniture are selected to add to the beauty and elegance of the house. It must have comfort and convenience. Modern life requires many appliances like the refrigerator, washing machine and grinder. There must be suitable recesses found for them so that they are placed neatly without being an eyesore. Even a small house must have a small space for a garden with a few pots of flowers and crotons. The house must be airy.\n\nThus the modern architecture of the house contributes to the beauty, utility and elegance of the home especially in advanced countries."

        "content": "The statement deals with two aspects of art namely photography and painting. They are complementary to each other. Photography, nowadays has supplanted painting because it is a more faithful reproduction of the model, person, thing or scenery.\n\nPhotography is based on a scientific principle, and provided the mechanism in a camera does not fail, excellent results are produced. The camera has been improved to a very great extent so that more life like pictures could be taken even by an amateur photographer. Photography saves time. In a matter of minutes pictures are taken. Nowadays colour pictures are taken. Fast films and powerful lenses make it easy to take pictures even in the darkness. The cine industry has added a momentum to the growth of photography. If the chemicals are properly treated on a film a photograph can be kept to the end of time. That is why great documents and books in the national archives are being photographed. Whereas paper spoils too soon, films do not.\n\nWith all its favorable points, photography cannot score over painting. The latter is something personal and in great masterpieces, we see the personality of the painter. The painter sets the tone in colour, creates moods and he is a student of emotions in that he could reproduce them in his paintings. In order to do that he must be a student of human nature. Every facial expression, every movement of the muscle, every twinkle in the eye or the contortion of the lips catches his trained eye. The expressions in the human face are kaleidoscopic, still once the painter catches an expression, he will never forget it and given the chance, he immortalizes it in his pictures.\n\nIn short the painter is a creative artist. He knows the value of his colors and he is master of every stroke of his brush. He is an actual creator. One or two examples would illustrate this point. In Mysore, India, there is a picture of a women with an oil lamp in her hand. The flame illumines her face. Unless you look at it twice you won't understand it. But if you look at it from a distance a whole world of art is before you. What a lovely expression. This painting has won the appreciation of the whole world. After all, this painting has no riot of colors. Still it can bring out a whole world of emotions.\n\nThe camera may do the same job but it is devoid of emotions. We get a feast of good photography in famous cinema pictures. A cameraman must wait to take particular scenes. The shots may come up or may not when developed. There are chances for mechanical failures. A photographer may spoil a picture which cannot be caught at that precise moment again. He may bring about distortions by taking at wrong angles.\n\nPhotography cannot displace the painting for a painted picture is a reflection of the personality of the painter and subject. The same can never be said of photography. That is why we speak of `schools' of painting and never schools of photography."

        "content": "The actor and the dramatist are like the man who eats the food and the cook. The cook can create delicious dishes with all available materials and ingredients. He may have already made a name as a great cook. His hand will be seen in the dishes and his culinary art is famous. In spite of all this, the food must be eaten by somebody. As the saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Otherwise it will be like the wealth under the sea.\n\nThe actor is the man who eats and serves. He advertises the food and make sure it reaches many. He shares the food with them. He shows how enjoyable the product is. In fact this sort of advertisement is the one we see where they advertise a variety of sweets. As a food advertiser he interprets and, he acts.\n\nThe dramatist provides the raw or basic material. He is seen only in his writing and through his writing. One should read to know him. If it is read for pleasure, the reader, more often than not enjoys the beauty of the sentiments or the felicity of the expression. The chances are remote when he waits to visualize the scene and get into the spirit of the character. Of course a critic may do all these things and a critic is not an ordinary reader. He reads with a purpose and assesses the flaws and not to get into the spirit of the playwright. So the playwright requires some other person to make his play come alive and this is where the actor comes in.\n\nMany a play has become popular because of the actor or actors concerned. The dramatist says but the actor acts. There is a world of difference; the actor gets into the spirit of the character he is depicting. He must swear or laugh, he may kick or fight, he may behave like a silly fool or a wise philosopher; he may be a tragic hero or a villain. In all these the audience sees the man or woman in the story in his or her true colour, not the person playing the role. They have the sympathy or the contempt for the character. They laugh or weep with the character. They are swayed by the same emotions as the actor. For them, the actor stands for a person whom they have seen in their daily life's transactions. Only they enjoy and suffer vicariously what they do in actual life.\n\nIf the actor is very adept, he acts the lines of the play, instead of simply mouthing the lines. He takes the audience along with him as the Pied Piper with his magical flute. The audience needs no explanation; they are alive to the puns, jokes and digs and they enjoy the play. To see and enjoy a play doesn't call for as much intellect as in the case of reading the same play in print. The characters are in flesh and blood and the context is brought clearly. We may even say the audience identifies themselves with certain neighbors or contemporary figures on the stage; not so much in physical identity but in having some similarities. A situation is made meaningful with music, lights and scenes.\n\nCertain Shakespearean characters have become classical not because they have been read about but because generations of people have seen them on the stage. This is true of stages in all the lands which have kept up the culture because the drama enacted could reach even the ordinary man and not the written play as such.\n\nThus the actor provides what the dramatist cannot."

        "content": "Enjoyment is something sensuous, that is, the enjoyment comes through the sense organs. For example, we enjoy food when our tongue recognizes the taste and then mind registers it. When either of the two is not functioning, we cannot enjoy food. This so happens when the tongue is dull because of cold or indigestion or when the mind is occupied elsewhere as when one is angry or sad. One enjoys music because he has trained his ear to do so. Where there is no experience there can't be real enjoyment. An unpleasant experience can in the same way drive away enjoyment.\nWith the above as an index let us see how one reacts towards a novel. There are personalities, life situations, human feelings and conflicts of interests and so on. In these the reader may, perhaps, see a projection of the world he has seen and known. If he is familiar with many of them he enjoys the novel. He may be interested in following the course of action, the plot, the climax and end. Here he is like a spectator who follows the career of a sportsman. His emotions are highly strung in so far as the sportsman is in action and once the man retires, the spectator almost forgets him or remembers him only when a similar situation crops up. So just as one enjoys a cup of tea or a whiff of cool breeze one may enjoy a novel. At a higher level one may enjoy the art of the novelist, how deftly he creates and caricatures his characters, how he mocks at the ways of the world and so on.\n\nNow what is education ? Education, draws the best powers in the individual and trains him to desirable levels and degrees. In fact, this is the real meaning of education which means to draw forth. Man is born with instincts, emotions and sentiments. These will have to be properly channeled and developed. So situations are created in which education takes place and capabilities are improved.\n\nIn this sense a novel does not educate. Novel may bring wider experience but cannot claim to develop capabilities. The language ability may develop but not in all who read novels. It does so only when a novel is read with a purpose, as a piece of literature in connection with a course of study; otherwise the novel doesn't educate. Novels may again make a man reflective and that is because of experience and not because of education.\n\nStill a student of literature may study novels for his education. People were educated even in ancient times but the novel is a comparatively new-comer in literature. So this makes it clear that novels are intended for the enjoyment of the reader and not for his education."

        "content": "Good dressing adds to a person's personality. When an ordinary man goes in for something costly, people think that he is in borrowed glories even though he may have bought those things out of his own hard earned money. The opposite is also true. When a rich man appears in really borrowed garb or ordinary clothes people think highly of him. We have a certain measure of standard by which we appraise things.\n\nSo too in the case of designs. Its value is enhanced when it is transposed on to a good base. A statuette of fine workmanship in clay may not be so much appreciated as one done in ivory. The value of the design appears more because of the material used. In the same way an idol in bronze or alloy may be valued more than if it is done in stone. Even there we apply a different scale. If the stone is marble instead of granite, the statue is highly valued. This is only to show that the same design in different materials has different values.\n\nNow let us take the case of jewelry. Many kinds of materials are used and the value varies from a few cents to a few thousands of dollars. In making a jewel the artist uses the material according to the price he can get. Thus the costume jewelry used by cine artists is cheap. In front of foot-lights they glitter like expensive jewelry. Cheap metals and polished glass are used in them. Beautiful items like necklaces, bangles, pendants and so on are made like the original pieces but their value is very low. On the other hand, we see beautiful and magnificent designs in gold and silver but because of the material used the design is appreciated.\n\nThis has a moral. One is known by the company he keeps. If he is found among ruffians, scoundrels and villains he is also one of them, though he may be different and may be a good one. There is a saying, 'If one drinks milk under the plamyra tree, he is taken to drink toddy'. So too in the case of designs. Good design and good material should go together."

Thus many artificial things have been put in the market adding to the aesthetic taste and comfort of man. So we have terylene, plastics, many kinds of alloys and other things. Man is able to create hybrid varieties in plants and animals which can yield more and, at the same time, resist diseases. He can travel at supersonic speed. He can use specialized light rays like LASER for medical and industrial purposes. Many other instances can be quoted to show how far man has mastered over nature because of his scientific knowledge.\n\nBut when man tries to imitate nature in creating new life or by tinkering with the life principles such that a tailored life can come out of the laboratories, it is going too far. In recent times the knowledge of genetics has developed very much and man is in a position to say what is taking place within the human cell, what is responsible for sexes, and what carries the characteristics of heredity. True he has the knowledge of DNA and RNA which are the brains behind the cell activities. He knows also about the genes and the chromosomes. By experimenting with these chromosomes 'mutations' can be brought about and new types of life may be created. In all this the chemist, the biologist and the medical men work in close cooperation and steadily and surely increase man's control over his own life.\n\nWhen man can order life, there are many dangers and questions involved. Apart from the question of morality, the foremost problem will be, when things go wrong 'Frankensteins' may roll out of laboratories. This possibility cannot be brushed aside. In science 2 x 2 is not always four. Where life is concerned, some unknown factor may work upsetting the whole calculation. For instance, small creatures develop a resistance against pesticides and so a new generation capable of resisting the pesticides comes up. So too when man begins to tinker with the genes such that he may create a superman or a dull one. This would tremendously upset the balance in life and usher in chaos. There is a balance in nature which, should not be upset. For example, man pumps out millions of barrels of oil from the bowels of the earth and burns them away with the result atmospheric oxygen is consumed at a rate that it cannot be replaced by green plants and pollution is ever on the increase. This only goes to show that man cannot control when he tinkers with nature which may bring a chain reaction leading to major tragedies.\n\nThe scientist along with others, with his superior knowledge must defend eternal values and should not betray humanity and let it run after the golden calf of demagogy and materialism. Science can give a diagnosis of what kind of a universe we live in but it cannot provide the treatment."

Great, wonderful and dangerous things from the point of view of humanity have happened. Great is the founding of the UNO which was raised from the dust of war. Wonderful has been man's achievements in the field of space probe. Dangerous has been the unleashing of the atomic energy. Great empires were dissolved and many free nations came into existence. One can't say whether the process has come to an end. Colonialism of old became a thing of the past and a new sort of colonialism under the aegis of communism is rearing its head. Its progress is received with mixed reception and it is too early to speak anything final about it.\n\nThe first World War left the world gloomy, the victorious nations having an economic set back from 1929 onwards and the vanquished nations, especially Germany struggling to come up. The League of Nations was there but it proved itself unequal to the task on more than one occasion. This encouraged Germany under Hitler to think of Germany's supremacy and a probable German Empire. His rape of Austria and Czechoslavakia were seen without protest by bigger nations like Great Britain and France. Encouraged by such victories, Hitler invaded Poland on 3rd Sept, 1939. Then the whole world was stunned. Hitler found partners for his devilish activities in Italy under Mussolini, and in Japan. Of course the latter came a bit later into the war. By a stroke of diplomacy Hitler entered into a pact with the USSR and this at least for the time being saved Germany from worries from the East. In the meantime Hitler invaded Belgium. Later Holland and France fell below the well trained German Army like nine pins. Hitler wanted to invade Great Britain and his air force pounded London which had never seen direct war for many centuries before. This was called Blitzkrieg and the Englishmen stood the trial valiantly. It was the blackest hour in the history of England. But it also found the man of the hour, Sir Winston Churchill. He became the champion premier of England. In spite of Dunkirk Great Britain was able to retaliate and stem the German attack.\n\nTwo things happened now which changed the course of the war. Germany invaded Russia and Japan attacked Pearl Harbor which brought the U.S.A. directly into the war. Japan progressed fast and went as far up to the Burmese border overthrowing the countries on the way. But Germany had many reversals, her earlier victories were nullified and she came to be on the defensive. The Big Three namely Great Britain, the USA and the USSR found a common enemy in the Axis partners comprising Germany, Italy and Japan. So they joined hands and once the USA landed her marines in Brittany in France, sometime in 1942 the tables were turned against Germany. Mussolini was shot dead as a war criminal and the Germans could not stand before the pincer movement of the Allies and as a result after a bitter struggle Berlin fell to Allies in May 1945.\n\nIn Eastern Sector the USA was fighting successfully against Japan and pushed them back to Japan. Still they would not yield. So President Truman ordered the release of the Atom Bomb on 7th Aug, 1945 on Hiroshima. Two days later Nagasaki was bombed and Japan surrendered.\n\nThe end of war saw the birth of the United Nations which sincerely attempted to establish peace on the earth. The American Atom bomb had led to what is called the atom diplomacy, for, other nations also came to have atom bombs. The two big nations of the world namely the U.S.A. and the USSR began looking up at the skies. The USSR stole the thunder when it put her Sputnik into the space in 1957. The USA followed suit and has had many creditable performances up-to-date, the last one being her three astronauts sent to the moon for a second time. Quite a good lot of things have happened in the field of technology.\n\nThe mention of a few would be enough to justify why this period in history has been so exciting. It saw the coming of many man made fabrics, the transistor, the ballpoint pen, the Jumbo Jets and supersonic planes, the space flights, the computer and many other things as well.\n\nThere are areas of conflict which if not handled wisely may explode into another world war."

        "title": "The importance of a university education for women",
        "content": "The university education as compared to the general education in the secondary school stands as a class apart. Whereas the aim of the secondary school education is to give a general knowledge to all, the university education, helps specialization in various faculties. Besides this, of course, there is the life which is lived by the alumni which goes to improve the character and outlook of the life of the student. It was the tradition of great universities like Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard that their dons received not only a degree but also a hallmark of quality.\n\nTill recently university education was the preserve of men folk and to see a woman in the university was strange. But now the universities have opened their doors to women students. There is no department of study where women do not compete with men. Even in faculties like engineering and law which were entirely men's preserve, have yielded to women. Women have understood the need for higher education and there has been an awakening among them.\n\nIt will be worthwhile to study the importance of a university education for women. There are many influences working in favor of women seeking higher education. First and foremost is the political awakening. In all countries women have been enfranchised and so women are entering politics in large numbers. There are women Prime Ministers today. So politics gave incentive to the impetus for women seeking higher education. Politics helped them, in fact, shake off the feminine reserved nature and they came out of the cloistered life.\n\nFurther, old customs and traditions that kept women bound to their kitchen and thought that sewing and stitching were their occupations were broken. Mingling with young men in the colleges was no more a hindrance or an anathema in women seeking higher education. Women have begun to seek career and marriage was no more the be-all and end-all of their lives. To be successful in a career, naturally higher education was sought after. Further the value of higher education for women began to get recognition, though slowly.\n\nA university education for women has its own values as it renders them useful citizens, helpful wives and mothers and very often useful neighbors and sometimes good social workers. Since women are equal to men according to any modem constitution, they form the major bulk of the electorate. They, more than their menfolk exercise their franchise wisely and independently and can also occupy seats of importance.\n\nAny day an educated wife and mother is an asset to the family. They may lighten the burden of the husband by taking off his shoulders some of the financial commitments. They may give him good company by discussing intellectual topics and share the finer things of life. Children are the ones that gain really; for, an educated mother looks after the education of her children. Her influence will be really greater than that of an uneducated mother. Even in the matter of running the household she will be found more rational than the uneducated mother.\n\nYet there is another value which is derived from their university education apart from entering a career in times of need, such as the desertion of the husband, when the woman can stand on her own feet and look after her children.\n\nBut wisdom calls for a different type of curriculum for women. The education which women get at the university should be complementary to what men folk get there, rather than being a rival to them. So far, this aspect has not been fully appreciated, though it is so apparent."

        "content": "Man is by nature conservative and it is very difficult for him to change quickly. This nature is not so bad after all; for it helps in the continuity of the race and also their identity. Thus by customs and manners we are able to distinguish the different people in different parts of the world. The European nations are not so tradition bound, but among them there are peculiar customs and manners which help to identify the French from the German and the Italian from the Spaniard. How these customs have grown comes from historical, geographical and ethnical conditions.\n\nWith the coming of science these customs and traditions are fading. People are able to mingle easily and customs are getting universalized. Look at the expression, 'Thank You'. Wherever English is spoken and understood, everybody knows the value of this phrase. But the same may require different expressions in different languages of the world.\n\nIn spite of the growth of science, customs and traditions still linger on. It is very difficult to obliterate them. In a small group they give the `we' feeling. They make things much easier within the group. Take the marriage customs among different peoples of the world. They are so different as to make them meaningless or even silly in the eyes of others.\n\nThere are certain customs which positively harm the health and welfare of the people. There are people in the world who still believe that: smallpox is caused by the evil deities or forces. They would avoid getting themselves vaccinated, if they can help it. There are people who' think that their food can get polluted it someone looks at it. So these people would starve while traveling by train because other passengers might see their food. Some people would willingly draw water from a dirty river or canal for drinking while the clean water from the tap is ignored because others are taking water from it. Some people keep their sick in dark and ill ventilated rooms not knowing the value of healthy air. To add to the misery of the sick they sometimes keep an oil lamp burning in the room and shut the windows, quite unaware of the fact that the burning lamp will consume quickly whatever oxygen is available in the room.\n\nIn the disposal of waste and garbage, people are quite careless and follow the traditional way of dumping them somewhere near the house such that rodents and flies can multiply. Even in the case of the so-called educated classes the old customs still linger. They shut their eyes to hygienic principles.\n\nNot all customs and traditions can be branded as harmful or detrimental to progress. Customs which cannot stand any scientific scrutiny must be discarded for good."

        "title": "\"Never leave till tomorrow what you can do today ? How do you explain this golden maxim ?",
        "content": "One of the many weaknesses of which man must be warned is procrastination or putting off things that can be done today till a later date. There is some natural inertia in man which makes him lethargic. He knows he must work but he doesn't want to unless he is goaded, very often leaves things where they are. If it doesn't affect him personally he doesn't act immediately. He would rather bask in idleness. To make him work and act many incentives are offered. Thus we see in business, what is called an incentive bonus. In regular services they are offered increments.\n\nMan knows that putting off till tomorrow what one can do today is bad. So there are many maxims like 'time and tide wait for no man'. 'Take time by the forelock'; 'Make hay while the sun shines'. These idioms go to show how society realize the value of time and doing thing in time. For time lost is a loss forever and it can't be brought back. Hence the proverb 'procrastination is a thief of time.'\n\nTime is a factor which is very important, the more so nowadays. In the jet-age or the 'Supersonic-age' everything takes place at a speed which the ancients would never have dreamed of. A generation or so ago it took many days to reach Malaysia from India. Now it is a matter of less than four hours. In order to keep pace with the speed with which things move, man also must know how to act quickly. Suppose one has to fly on a mission or business to a distant place he has to be at the airport very early. A delay of even five minutes would see the plane taken off and his whole program would be causing a lot of chain reactions. Suppose a man fails to turn up at the hour he has fixed for an engagement he would not only lose his face but it may also tell on his future with which his whole life is tied up. The more complex and technological the society grows, the value of time grows equally acute.\n\nWork falls in arrears, means he has to work harder and even faster the next day. This is found among students who often postpone doing their homework and wait for the weekend holiday to come. But when the holiday comes they find it difficult to sit and do their homework while their friends are playing outside. The next day they have to think of ways and means to deceive their teachers when homework has to be passed up.\n\nThere is a sense of fulfillment for those people who are punctual and regular in their work. They enjoy a guilt-free conscience. A forcibly true example is the case of health. If there is any ailment one should attend to it immediately. Some people hide their ailments only to suffer later, when it is too late. When one is regular and punctual it adds to his dignity and brings him peace at heart.\n\nIt requires principles, discipline and will power to do one's duty on hand at once. If only one were to keep a record of idle hours it would be astounding to see the sum total of the time. One must develop the philosophy of life quoted in the 'Village Blacksmith', 'Something attempted, something done, earned him a night's repose'."

        "title": "What is the importance of study of civics in a democratic country ? Can it make intelligent, enlightened, wide-awake citizens ?",
        "content": "Civics is the science that refers to the rights and responsibilities of citizens. It tells how a country is governed. It speaks of the units into which the country is divided like the states, districts, municipalities and village units. It describes the powers of the units and their inter relationship. It gives an insight into the working of the constitution and how the three major wings, namely, the Legislature, the Administration and the Courts function. It explains how the money needed for the administration is being raised, in other words, the various sources of income to the government. Naturally, it tells also of the various types of state expenditure.\n\nNow how does the study of civics become important in a democratic country ? Democracy, according to the famous definition given by Lincoln, is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. In short, in a democracy it is the people that count. They elect their representatives through whom the government of the land is run. If they want an able, efficient government they must elect wisely and in order to elect they must know whom they are electing, whether they will be able to deliver the goods or whether they will be able to give a good government. Since in democracies representatives are elected on party basis, the elector should know the philosophy, policies and capabilities of the various parties. Again since the representatives are elected through elections where the citizen exercises his franchise which is a worthy possession and birth right. he must know its sacredness. In order to exercise wisely he must also know how elections are being conducted, for there are many ways of electing a representative. Theoretically at least any citizen can aspire to the highest elected office in the country. That is why the study of civics is important in a democracy.\n\nBesides the part the citizen plays in the governing of the country, the citizen has other civic responsibilities; for example, it is incumbent on him that he must keep his surroundings clean, gets himself and the members of his family vaccinated against small-pox, report to the proper authorities whenever there is an outbreak or epidemics. Unless he acts properly his health and others' health may be affected. He must know the laws governing the preparation and sale of foodstuffs. If he contravenes the rules, the public health may be affected. Thus a citizen should know that adulteration of food stuffs is a serious crime. For effective citizenry, civics must be studied.\n\nCan the study of civics make intelligent, enlightened wide-awake citizens ? Mere study alone does not go to make a good citizen. How far one puts things learnt in civics into practice depends on its success. \"Black market\" is against all canons of civics. Tax evasion is another major crime indulged in by many a knowing citizen who deliberately defrauds the government.\n\nAgain take elections. No election can be said to be fairly fought or won. Honesty may be the best policy but in elections honesty is one of the major casualties and still elections are said to be sacred; no vote can be asked or solicited or given. Does it happen anywhere ? The people who run the elections know how to win.\n\nJust as the study of history has not made the people wise in shunning war, so too the study of civics cannot be said to make intelligent, enlightened and wide-awake citizens. Study alone cannot help him unless he has the moral courage to practice what he has learnt or what he knows to be correct. People would not be warring if they were civic conscious. Ending on a skeptic note the study of civics has not succeeded in making intelligent, and enlightened wide-awake citizens."

        "title": "What is your opinion about \"commerce as a profession\" ?",
        "content": "In all organizations commerce has an indisputable place. Where there is buying and selling commerce begins. Just like the producer, the commercial group is one of the important pillars of society. Without this group things cannot move from place to place and find a market. The producer will not be able to find a suitable market for his goods and wares. The consumer is assured of his product in season and out of season, thanks to the commercial people. So commerce as a profession is a must in any society.\n\nTo be successful in commerce it requires a lot of training and shrewdness and common sense. A successful commercial man knows when and where to buy and where and how to sell. He knows also the taste of the people; may be, nowadays, he creates a taste by intelligent advertisement and marketing operations. He takes a certain risk in stocking goods and for which he gets a return called profit. So far as it is within a reasonable range, to get and make profit is quite legitimate. The morality of huge profit is being discussed subsequently.\n\nCommerce as a profession is rather risky as mentioned above for the simple reason that money in the form of capital will have to be ploughed in; it must be properly utilized in buying and selling. Otherwise it would be a dead capital. There is a period of waiting in between production and sales. Even in the course of production, it may mean a long time of waiting. Raw materials will have to be handled, labor wisely managed, things produced up to the standard and the customers pleased. In between the commercial man must keep his body and soul together. So to be a successful commercial man it requires a lot of training, background and, believe it or not, a stroke of luck.\n\nAs mentioned earlier if one knows how to buy and sell, he can choose commerce as a profession. Psychologically he must have a mental equipment for success in this career. He must be a successful mixer, a good conversationalist, and one who could argue his way without wounding the susceptibilities of his customer. He should be a good contact man and must be able to pinch without making the other fellow feel it. He must be aware of the possible competition and know how to pilot his wares. He must have the horse's sense. Thus to become a successful commercial man one must be naturally endowed with the qualities mentioned; other than the required training. That is why today, business management has been raised to the level of high, sophisticated science.\n\nBecause the commercial man makes a profit he has always been looked upon with suspicion; much more so after the publication of 'Das Capital'. There are two opinions about it and it is very difficult to reconcile between the two. But where the government themselves have taken upon production, there is nothing on record to say they have done spectacularly well. The profit motive is not such a crime provided the profit is out of all proportions. The profit motive acts as an incentive and there is rapid expansion of production. Suppose either Great Britain or the USA were to have become a communist country in the middle of the nineteenth century they would not have achieved many of the things they had.\n\nCommerce, appears to be a jealous profession and unless one is clever to navigate safely in turbulent waters, Commerce should be given up. Governments must realize that some freedom given to the commercial people will ultimately do good to the country. They should realize it it the commercial man who feeds the coffers of the government much more than any other class in society."

        "title": "Describe your ideas about the question as to whether students should take part in politics or not",
        "content": "Should students take part in politics or not is a question of quite a modern origin. Till the beginning of this century nobody would have thought of this question. That was a time when students simply obeyed their parents and masters. Parents never even discussed matter as important as the marriage of their son or daughter. Teachers were absolute monarchs of their classroom. Children remained in awe and fear of teachers. Politics was quite young and it was the privilege of the few in the higher rungs of society. The man in the street was never in the picture and his voice was never head at all.\n\nThe beginning of the century saw the spirit of nationalism rising up in many colonial countries against the ruler. The leaders of such movements called on the youth of the land to join them. They knew that it would be futile to address their energy to the middle age group. Their appeal for action went straight to the hearts of the youngsters. They were a bit rash and reckless for they had not much to lose but the promises for their gain were there. They left off their studies, deserted their classes only to join the front rank of politicians who were trying to make their voices felt. The youth had the energy and could make good noise. Mass movements required them. Thus there was a revolution in politics when the youths began to make their presence felt. Many a leader of the forties and fifties belong to this category.\n\nSo we see with the advancing of the century the part played by the youth in politics intensified. Politics in many countries became a mass movement and youth leaders were in great demand, because they could muster strength easily. Once the part played by the youth became significant, the youth began to assert. They wanted their share in the government of the country and their voices to be heard.\n\nThat is where we stand today. Forceful leaders who knew the power of youth in politics began to voice their concern and started telling that students may study politics, the manifesto of various parties but not to indulge in active politics. But that was never to be. Once the youth has been roused it is very difficult to control them and unfortunately many elections are fought with the help of the youth. So in principle, let us concede there is nothing wrong in the youth taking part in politics.\n\nBut if the ultimate goal of the politician is to enter the legislature of the land and take part in shaping her destinies then the youth must wait in the 'Q'. Their youthful enthusiasm and emotional outbursts are not quite the thing that the government of the country needs. It required maturity, wisdom and forbearance. Politics is not mountain climbing. Hard training may make one a good mountaineer. To be a politician one must be groomed from a young age, be intelligent, wise, mature in outlook and have vision and foresight. He must be dedicated towards a mission and the people. Despite all their enthusiasm, the youth is not qualified on this score. His very youth is a disqualification. They cannot be said to have emotional maturity. So like the young seed that waits to become ripe, the students must wait.\n\nA word of caution to the professional politicians here may not be inappropriate. Let them beware of what dangerous powers they are playing with. The very mass strength of the youth might destroy the citadel of politics like Samson in chains. It may be cheaper now but surely it is going to be costlier in the long run. Let the youth of the land gather knowledge, pick up the intelligence and grow up in wisdom so that they may be fit to shoulder the responsibility. So one should look at this problem from a historical perspective. In all humility one may conclude that the student should never take part in active politics."

        "title": "\"Some books are to be tasted; others swallowed; some few to be chewed and digested\"  - (Bacon). Discuss this statement",
        "content": "Thanks to the German genius of Gutanberg, printing became possible and the Englishman Caxton improved on it with the result that printing of books had become possible and today train loads, nay ship loads of books are being printed. The litho press, the halftone, the electropying and the mechanization of printing books have made it possible to print millions of books at a cheap rate. So every year hundreds of new books are being sold in the market and they cover almost every subject under the sun.\nThis is not to say that all the books that are printed and put into the market are worthy of note. There are books and books and to categorize them is really a librarian's job. It is highly doubtful whether the highest executive in a big public library knows all about the books he handles. He knows them only through the catalogue. So to categorize the books according to the subjects may be difficult. But in each department there are three categories of books of which Bacon speaks; books to be tasted, books to be swallowed and books to be chewed and digested.\n\nThere are certain types of books which can only be tasted. To have a taste is just to have some sensation out of reading it and it stops there. One does not pursue it nor cling to it. The taste may be good or bad. When it is good there is a further attraction and where it is bad there is only repulsion. Suppose one had never tasted a cup of good tea but once he gets it he may have further urge to have more cups of such a fine tea. But to him tea is not the thing; only its taste just attracts him. He can carry on definitely without tea. To this category belong the novels, dramas, short stories, newspaper articles and so on. One reads a novel but not to sear by it. Nowadays youngsters read a lot of Perry Mason or Agatha Christie. But there the taste may stop. It is doubtful whether many of them can even remember the story after sometime, so too with the other items mentioned. This, of course, refers to the general reader and not to the specialist who may study them deeply or in the words of Bacon 'Chewed and Digested' to submit a research paper. In short one who has tasted them simply knows them and nothing beyond.\n\nComing to the second kind some books are to be swallowed. One swallows a medicine capsule not because he likes it but because it is necessary that he should take it as per his doctor's advice. Very often he may not even know its contents. To this category belong the blue books, treatises or dissertation, law books, and various types of hand books. Not that they are not useful. Only one does not seek them to bring comfort or seek companionship in them. It is not for pleasure one reads them. Such books are like multiplication tables to a child. Many that can be included in this category even Bacon could not have thought of. These are the short professional books which litter the tables of different experts.\n\nThen comes the third category of books of which Bacon speaks that they must be chewed and digested. At least a modem school boy knows what a chewing gum is. To chew calls for the work of the teeth. There is no hurry, every bit is chewed. Say one chews a tasty lozenge. It must be chewed to be enjoyed. One feels through the stuff, enjoys the flavor and with half closed eyes can go on chewing because it is so tasty. The chewing gum stops with the mouth for it is nothing to be digested. But in the case of good food, not only should it be chewed; it must also be digested only to be assimilated into the body.\n\nSo too there are books which must be chewed and digested. To this category belong the great classics, the great religious books, dramas of Shakespeare and great poetry. They never grow stale through the lapse of time nor are they dimmed because of age. There are the great epics of the East which have sustained the culture. Time can't defy the virility of the Bible, the Koran, the Bhagvad Gita and so on. Nor can humanity ever afford to forget Socrates or Homer, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Tolstoy and a galaxy of many others. Wherever they are one is always in distinguished company. They can be read and re-read and they have influenced the life and thoughts of generations of people. As somebody had cryptly said, 'Read Shakespeare for the seventh time, you will find a new meaning'. Such books are not confined to geographical borders for they are universal and a wise man would have chewed and digested them.\n\nBut there is a place for all these categories of books and this is n a library so that they may serve the needs of different kinds of readers. Even a serious reader may look for a book just to be tasted while traveling. So a discriminating reader can choose the books according to his needs."

        "title": "\"I count him greater who overcomes his desire than he who conquers his enemies; for the hardest of victory is the victory over self.\" Do you agree with Aristotle's view ?",
        "content": "Aristotle's view given here has a big philosophical impact. This is to say that to overcome one's desire is more difficult than to defeat one's enemy. The battle against desire is difficult because it is inborn.\n\nLet us now look a bit closer at the origin of desire because one wants to own something, desire is born. One does not desire for things one has not seen, tasted or experienced. Take a child, it desires to have a thing which another child is having. It may be the instinct to own. A drunkard wants to have more drink because he has tasted it already. One who knows the value of money desires to own more. Foretaste is the motive force of all desires.\n\nA desire to show off, own material things, acquire wealth and for an ostentatious display of power and grandeur is wrong. On the other hand, the desire to learn, to serve one's own country, and to serve one's own fellowmen can never be wrong. Desire to excel others in one's own field of specialization is not to be deplored. Otherwise humanity would not be progressing and would never have reached the level it has come today. The Taj Mahal could never have been built, had Shah Jahan been satisfied with the Fort at Delhi or Agra. Siddhartha could never have become the Buddha, the Enlightened one, if he had not desired to know the cause of the ills of the world. It is a paradox in his case, more than in any other, that he could lay the blame on 'desire' for the ills of the world. It is a paradox because the very desire forced him in the path of penance. So desire for great and good things cannot be condemned outright.\n\nDesire is a double edged weapon and can lead a man to hell or glory. Only the first aspect is being notified by Aristotle and he opines that it is the hardest to overcome such a desire.\n\nIt is easier to defeat one's enemy when one can commandeer all the forces and direct them against the enemy. The enemy's strength may be known, his strategies are understood and the sources of his supplies are known. Then it is easier to defeat the enemy. That was how in the course of history several wars have been fought and won.\nBut in the case of desire, the fountain head of it is the self. How it develops is a mystery. Why should one steal, covet another's wife, do heinous crimes, the blame can be laid at the doors of desire. Psychologically the ability to desire cannot be wiped of. They would be an act of folly. But the desire must be turned to good directions and use.\n\nSimple cases of desire can be solved, like a child stealing because it wants to have the same thing as its neighbor or friend has. The parent can buy the same thing the child desires then the child would leave off stealing. But in the case of grown-ups, it is by education, by persuasion, and by appeal to the value of good conduct, one should be made to give up wrong desires. In psychology, they call it counseling. So, where desire surfaces to the detriment of one's name and fame, counseling by friends and religious preceptors can help a great deal. Appeal may be made to one's conscience. Will-power to resist must be built up. In public offices, the officials make cheap money by what is popularly known as graft or bribery. Desire is at the root of it. But if the person concerned can be made aware of the pitfalls and the odium that may be attached to him, more often than not he can be redeemed.\n\nIt is easier to write about the dangers of desire and the need to conquer it, but to overcome it actually requires great willpower. All religions of the world have condemned this kind of enemy.\n\nIt is very difficult to draw the line between useful desire and bad desire. One can get to know it through proper education, company and conviction. Still one feels how difficult it is to conquer it and in so doing shares the views of Aristotle."

        "content": "Longfellow deliberately distinguishes between the countryside and the town and wants a wedding between the two so that the result may be enjoyable. Let us see how far this is possible and whether Longfellow can be approved of for the statement.\n\nA lyric is a musical poem. Then one is tempted to ask what is music. It is the art of expressing or stirring emotion by melodious and harmonious combination of sounds. Let us see then how the countryside has music in it. Perhaps the country which Longfellow had in his mind was a thing of the past but still one can visualize it.\n\nThe brook, the fields, the church or the temple, the workmen, women and children of the village the herds of cattle and sheep, the hound, and everything about the village stirs our emotions and there is harmony in the life of the village and hence it is lyrical.\n\nLet us see how these things could stir our emotions, may even our imagination. Look at the meandering brook with a house here and with a mill there in its bank. There are thrush and reeds overgrowing the sloping banks. There are flowering bushes here and there with their multi-colored butterfly and cricket visitors. Here and there one sees a bird stirring about. There are the beautiful kingfisher and the woodpecker with their unmistakable hues. The innocent squirrel looks on without fear from a tree nearby. The brook seems to say, 'men may come and men may go, but I go on forever'.\n\nAgain there is an all-round attraction about the fields through the year. Whether they are luscious green with crops, or brown with the mellow gold of ripe corn or fallow after the harvest, there is something attractive there. Who has not enjoyed the smell of the unripe corn; Who can forget the wind moving across the fields making ripple after ripple for miles around the lush green country side, The ripe corn bowing down reminds one of the humility of a mature person.\n\nThe people of the village uncorrupted by the town culture (almost a thing of the past today) with their unsophisticated manners and plain speeches and laughter attract one's attention. They go about their work in a leisurely way. Their motto is to help others and they never stand on formality. Helping each other, and sharing the pleasure and pain of the neighbor or the innocent, plain villager just carries on. The village craftsmen also have a moral to teach. Everyone should have enjoyed reading Longfellow's 'The Village Blacksmith'. Several other popular poems may be mentioned; for example, \"The Daffodils\", the \"Solitary Reaper\", \"The Skylark\" and others. We can easily see how the countryside could be a lyric.\n\nNow looking at the town what is it that is dramatic about it. In a drama emotions come into play. Through the characters of the story one sees the play of the emotions; how they work at cross purposes, how they bring about the culmination. So too in the town one clearly sees the play of emotions, the move as fast as in a drama. If one wants to see the drama of life, one must go and stand as an onlooker at any busy street corner in any big town. He may see the pick pocket jostling against a victim who is careless about his purse. He may see the bravado youngster trying to brush past a young woman. There may be a funeral procession as well as a marriage procession. There is bargaining going on. There are all sorts of people dressed in all kinds of costumes. There are all kinds of vehicles some heaving under their load, and some like a new limousine passing by swiftly. One sees a whole medley of crowd, many kinds of noises and everybody in a hurry. Scenes change from hour to hour in a town as in the case of a drama. The morning scene, the office hour scene, the evening scene, and even the midnight scene are all different whereas in the case of a village there is an all-round calm, free from the noise, bustle and hurry of the town.\n\nNow Longfellow wants to mingle the good things of the village with the facilities of a town. In fact, this is the spirit behind modern townships which have all the facilities of a town and at the same time smacking of a rural, peaceful, calm, quiet atmosphere."

        "title": "\"Every man has his own ideal of human greatness.\" Do you agree ?",
        "content": "\"Some are born great; some achieve greatness; some have greatness thrust upon them.\" So wrote Shakespeare in one of his plays. One is common; everybody wants to become great. Why great ? The answer itself is obvious because the greatness has its own rewards, name and fame, ovation and applause, red carpeted welcome and wealth. There is practically no field where one cannot achieve greatness. From the great minister to a great cook in all ranks there can be greatness.\n\nHow great? There are degrees and shades of greatness as there are shades in colors. Greatness in a particular field cannot be equated with greatness in a different field. So each one in his specialized field has got his standard or ideal of greatness.\n\nOne thing common is that greatness cannot be achieved so easily. It is not made to measure or order and it is true also that it is not always the deserving that becomes great. To achieve greatness a lot of perspiration and hard work is needed. One may have the genius in him but he would have to use it. Even a diamond must be polished and faceted in order to sparkle; otherwise it would continue to be a crude lump of gem. So too in order to become great, one has to work for it. Shakespeare is not fully right in his above quoted statement. It may be true, some are made great but real greatness is the fruit of hard labor.\n\nNow each one in his own peculiar field has his ideal of greatness. Take a politician. If he has taken politics as a career his ambition is to become a Minister one day or a Prime Minister. Whether, then, the country would gain or suffer under him is a different question. As far as the person is concerned his ideal of greatness lies in becoming a Minister.\n\nLook at the sportsmen. Whether it be football, hockey or cricket if he can rise and represent his country in international meets he is considered great. He must wear the colors of his country and become the cynosure of the fans.\n\nAn artist wants to become great through his performance. It may be music, painting or sculpture. If he is recognized as unique and masterly then he is pleased. They hunger after recognition and a few of them want to leave behind a tradition. In the fine arts the idea of founding a 'school' is prominent and that is the ideal of greatness for most artists.\nGreatness lies in the recognition which people bestow on the person concerned. Until the recognition is achieved the hungry soul can never rest satisfied. Some like Captain Sentry in the Spectator's Club could never move forward though he may have the recognizable merit. Some simply spring up and fade away as quoted in Gray's famous line 'full many a gem of purest ray serene ...' In conclusion everyone wants to become great in his or her own way."

        "title": "Why is it that the utility of reading history is great whether it is imaginative or factual ?",
        "content": "What is history ? History is the chronicle of events but it speaks of various forces explicit and implicit that engineered the course of events and it also speaks of why and how events came about. It speaks of the dramatic personnel on the scene at a particular period of history who shaped the destinies of nations. It speaks of the turn of events which completely changed the course of history. It is a part of social science with nations as centers. It is how modern historians look upon it. As physical sciences speak of cause and effect relationship, it is quite possible to find the cause and effect relationship in history; how the foibles and strength of human nature of the personalities concerned shaped history. Churchill's part in the World War II is too early to be forgotten or how Roosevelt straightened the economics of the USA with his New Deal.\n\nA close look at the preceding paragraph will in a way give the answer why history must be read. It is the story of humanity itself and hence everyone is entitled to know the history and to know, one must study. Because there is a unity among the various events, now emphasis is laid on the study of the world history as such. To reach another place one had to travel. So to know how humanity reached its present position, one had to read all about the road it has covered or trodden. There one realizes that such a road is not a high road, macadamized and well laid. With what human sacrifice, with what blood shed, with what turmoil and difficulties the course history had taken, one may realize.\n\nA real student of history becomes a part of it. He struggles, enjoys, and is confounded according to the events. On the surface, it is only a chronicle but where personalities are concerned, it is surcharged with emotions. The trial of Socrates, the battle of Thermopylae, the fortunes of Roman consuls, Shivaji's struggle with the Moghuls, at a nearer period, the struggle for freedom in various countries, and the various Revolutions of the last two centuries have all changed the face of earth. These and others make the student of history believe in the inevitability of certain events which go against all calculations. He does not become a cynic but he becomes wise. That is the greatest aim and gain of reading history. Why after knowing so much of history and futility of wars and so on man again and again should go to war or prepare for war? It doesn't mean that there haven't ever been wise men to guide the affairs of countries concerned. But when and where their voices were heard, humanity prospered and there was peace; where people faltered, and neglected the danger signal, naturally humanity was pushed into the holocaust of war. It is a wonder man does not learn from history; hence the saying, 'history repeats itself'.\n\nThe aforesaid pertains, not only to factual history but also to imaginative history. Imaginative history is the historical novels and plays. Certain event is taken around which the story may be built. Scott specialized in this sort of novels. His 'Kenilworth' and 'Talisman' deal with real personalities and genuine events which have been turned to profit in the novels mentioned. Another famous instance is 'The tale of Two Cities' which deals with the French Revolution. So too Dumas's 'The Three Musketeers' makes use of a period in French History when Cardinal Richlieu was very powerful. 'Gone with the Wind' connects the period of civil war in the USA. Similarly in different languages then world history is made the backdrop in their novels and plays. To understand the customs, manner and the philosophy of a particular period, these novels and plays help much more than the actual pages of history. Whereas in actual history the personalities concerned do not speak. It is only a report. But in the novels, and especially in plays the personalities reveal themselves so mightily that one cannot forget them. Who has not, enjoyed Antony's oration ? Can anyone give a holiday to pity and sympathy when he sees Cleopatra in her last and momentous hour? What a tremendous scene it is where young Prince Arthur pleads to Hubert to save his eyes and when the latter says 'live to see and see to live.'\n\nSo the study of history, real or imaginative, is highly rewarding and none can be said to have been really educated unless he has studied history."

        "title": "To what extent would you say that the methods used by scientists are applicable to the solution of social problems ?",
        "content": "The method used by the Scientists may be termed the Scientific method. Though it is called the Scientific method, it is not peculiar to Science only. Yet it is predominantly used in Science, hence the name for the method.\n\nThere are certain peculiar elements of the method, or characteristics. First of all the problem must be identified. The problem must not be isolated but must be universal. Once the problem is identified a tentative solution is thought of, then this solution is tried in the laboratory, both analytically and synthetically. Here a good amount of logic is used, both induction and deduction. They change the variables and see if the solution still works. If it works it is good; if not a new hypotheses is formed and put to the test. Unless it is ten percent correct the solution is not admitted. This is the major part of the operation and the laboratory plays a vital role. Once the solution is known then it is applied to practical situations. Out of all this are born the theories, laws, principles and hypothesis which the Sciences abound in.\n\nOne or two illustrations will make the aforesaid clear. A very simple one is this. Suppose the key is lost. What do we do then ? We get a bunch of keys from friends or neighbors and try them one by one until perhaps we get the correct key. Still we may not be sure of the key in the bunch. Then one has to go in for another bunch. This is what is called the trial and error method. In fact the whole science ought to have gone through a trial and error. This is the method used by the detectives. If you read any good detective story you can easily see how they work on certain hypothesis.\n\nA classical case is the discovery of Anopheles, the mosquito that causes malaria. Sir Ronald Ross gathered various species and finally discovered the fact that the female of the Anopheles alone caused malaria. There he adopted a clean scientific method. Then again there Was Louis Pasteur who discovered a vaccine for dog bites. He followed exactly a scientific discovery method. In fact this method had paid very high dividends in exact Sciences. But the question is how far can this method be applied to social problems or human affairs. However, let it be accepted that this can be applied to most human affairs. We shall consider the shortcomings later. In most of the social problems there is a missing link which could easily be supplied by science or scientific methods. Take the case of Malaria which appears to defy all attempts of eradication. Since malaria is caused by the Anopheles mosquito and the species can be destroyed completely there will be no occurrence of Malaria. So extensive study of the life of the mosquito has to be studied and preventive and prophylactic measures have to be taken. Thus there are many common problems solved in a scientific way. How else then to appreciate the coming of the ball point pen? What a long way from the quill to the cartridge filled pen ?\n\nThen why not adopt this method to all social problems? The difficulty is many of these problems have the human element. It is not always two and two make four in human affairs. Take for instance the question of apartheid in South Africa, the Negro problem in the USA, untouchability in India and the Jewish question. In all these there is predominately an emotional element and no amount of argument based on Science can find a solution. These and other problems will continue to be there in so far as man continues to be human with all his likes an dislikes, with all his predilections and bias, and with all his fears hatred."

        "title": "What restriction, if any, should there be on what an author writes ?",
        "content": "An author writes in various ways on various things. An author may be a poet, novelist, dramatist or a critic. A journalist is also an author in his own right but usually when we generalize one as an author, the journalist is not included. If a journalist writes in journals which can stand the test of time as in the case of great writers like Dr. Johnson and Goldsmith they can become classics.\n\nSo an author whatever category he belongs to writes and lives by his pen. He may write for pleasure or for his livelihood. A few write seriously because they think they have a mission to fulfill, to cleanse the society or to propagate their own philosophy. Still another category of authors write biographies of the heroes of their choice. There have been and still there are a few who write their own autobiographies. This is not the end of it. There is a wide field which authors can choose to write about.\n\nWhatever one writes it must not be defamatory; in other words, one must not write ill of others. To write that way requires a lot of courage because the consequences may not be pleasant. Sometimes authors indulge in this sort of writing once they feel they have the material on hand to prove or vouch what they write. These things have happened and poor authors have been dragged to the court. Cheap journals alone indulge in this cheap tactics. By doing so they think they arc exposing the wrong-doer to the public view but they should also be aware of the consequences. So defamatory writing must be avoided.\n\nThen there is the fiery writing where the feelings of the people are roused to the boiling point. Some of the writings during the pre-revolution in France were of this kind. Hugo's \"Les Miserable\" is a good example. The first part of the story speaks of the very harsh French Laws then. Simply because a poor man stole a loaf of bread to save a child he was put behind bars for a long time. During a turbulent period in the history of a land such fiery writings are common. But there is a great risk for the author because the government of the day and sometimes people may not stand for such hot stuff.\n\nThis type of writing may include critical views of the author about people's manners and customs. If this is not written in a forth right fashion, this writing pays good dividends. A lot of examples could be found in the novels of Charles Dickens who was critical about the nineteenth century Industrial England. The author makes his creations his mouth piece and through them he broadcasts his views about people's manners, customs and foibles. This requires a lot of observation and a dexterity of the pen on the part of the author. Here the author must not make things appear personal but what he writes must be indicative and easily identifiable.\nAn author must avoid obscene writing. But unfortunately such things do happen and books containing writings which cannot be mouthed by any civilized person are being published. Even great authors indulge in such undesirable stuff. So it is for the public to treat such writings with contempt and not to encourage such writers.\n\nAn author must not be too critical of the government of the day. The government will try to get the man away from mischief. In fact, in turbulent times governments bring forth laws prohibiting such writings. So an author to avoid defamation, public anger and being blacklisted must write prudently."

        "title": "Write a short essay on \"The harvest of the sea\"",
        "content": "Ordinarily harvest refers to the return or income which a farmer gets from the field. There may be a bumper harvest. Nevertheless the harvest is the end product of long waiting, back breaking operations, involving a lot of skill and patience. In the case of the sea also there is a similarity connected with the harvest in the field; the only difference being there is not a question of plowing, preparing the field and sowing. But a good harvest in the sea means a great deal of risk and danger. It means pluck and courage on the part of those who take to sea life.\nLet us take a look at the exact harvest of the sea. The foremost thing that comes into the mind is the fish. Fishing in the seas is a major industry of the world and maritime countries and their people depend on fish for food. There are major fishing grounds of the world, notably the North Sea, off the coast of Newfoundland and British Columbia and the sea of Japan. In these countries they have mechanized fishing. Fish is caught on a large scale and canned to be sent to the markets.\n\nBesides fish, the whale is hunted for its flesh and blubber as well as it's bones. Whale hunting is a dangerous job because that mammal, yes, whale is not a fish in the real sense, can destroy a boat if it strikes. A whole novel 'Moby Dick' had been dedicated to whale hunting.\n\nThe floor of the sea has not been exploited. There is a belief that the deep floors of the seas must be rich in minerals. When the minerals on the land is exhausted, perhaps man may turn to the sea bed for his resources. There is, of course, mineral oil found in some places in the sea bed. Already some countries have taken up the idea and have started prospecting for oil in the sea.\n\nBeside the economic value of the life from the sea, children enjoy picking the beautiful shells deposited on the shore by waves.\n\nThe sea too can be used for producing food. The green plankton which produces starch can be exploited to stem the hunger of the world.\n\nIf the harvest of the sea is taken to mean in a wider sense, water transport then can also be the bloodstream of the world's commerce. Wide arteries of shipping lines have liners loaded with the world's merchandise. Till the advent of the airplane the ship was the only link connecting countries divided by the seas. For transporting heavy cargo there is nothing better than sea transport.\n\nAnother important item of harvest is the energy that could be produced by using the tidal waves. There are countries where these tidal waves play havoc. But these waves could be suitably harnessed to produce power. This possibility has not been ruled out and there are attempts afoot to tap this source. This is how man gets a good harvest from the sea."

        "title": "Why do some occupations and professions command more money than others ? Is there a case for greater equality in remuneration ?",
        "content": "The question is an obvious one. We find there are professions which command more money than others. That is not the whole truth. Even in the same profession some get much more than others. The disparity in wages is so vast, that it has led to ideological war. This disparity is the main plank of the communist argument. In fact pointing their accusing fingers at societies where this disparity is highly pronounced, the communists are able to win the confidence of workers.\nGranting there is such a vast disparity let us look for the causes which are many indeed. The following are the relevant causes. The qualification of the person, both academic and professional, name and prestige of the person, can be recommendations he could command.\n\nNo comment is needed on the qualification. The higher the qualification both academic and professional, the greater the chances of earning higher wages. A post graduate may be preferred to a graduate and a Ph.D to a post graduate. Theoretically speaking the higher the degree the greater the chances and hopes that the individual may know better. Hence the high wages. This we see in law, medicine, engineering, consulting, sciences and other professions.\n\nExperience always counts. An experienced person is better any day than the fresh one from the school or institute, however high his academic distinctions may be because the field knowledge or first hand knowledge pays more than bookish knowledge. That is the reason why freshmen are apprenticed to an experienced person. The experienced knows where to look for trouble and knows also how to shoot it. In medicine, experience is to be preferred.\n\nNow that there is so much of specialization and diversification, one who has specialized in a particular field is preferred. Thus we have many specialists. Lawyers specialize in several departments of law; so too doctors. Even among tailors there are specialists. If their services are needed one will have to pay more.\n\nThere are again special preferences. All lawyers do not make a grade; so too all doctors do not come up to the expectations. Naturally one chooses to have one who is famous. This is the case with many professions and jobs, so there is a special price to be given to the person chosen. In this sense everyone has his own tailor, cook, barber and washerman. If the choice is for best one has to pay more.\n\nThere are reasons when higher wages will have to be paid. Then as mentioned above recommendations decide higher or lower wages. If one is an MD's relative or kith and kin he is paid a better salary than the one who has no such relatives.\n\nIs there a case for greater equality in remuneration ? Ideally yes; but practically very difficult to reach the ideal. For equal work, equal wage may be easy to preach but equality in remuneration is a far cry. Certain types of profession which demand strenuous preparations on the, part of the incumbent will have to be paid. A doctor doing a heart surgery and another opening an abscess cannot expect to receive same remuneration. An ordinary woodcutter and a carpenter though both of them may engage themselves in cutting wood must be paid differently because of the skill and intelligence involved.\n\nThe equality of remuneration is not obtained even in socialist countries. But one suggestion may be worthwhile trying. Every worker must receive a basic wage or salary and then an allowance may be paid according to the post one holds. It may not be agreeable. Some such thing is happening today, for what are perks if not special allowances for, merit or responsibility. Anyway the disparity between the highest paid and the lowest must not be high."

        "title": "\"Discipline must be the basis of all achievement - Even of learning.\" Discuss",
        "content": "Discipline is a word often used but the least understood. Discipline refers to a system where actions are controlled by certain almost fixed rules. So wherever there is systematic work, we find discipline. This way anything having a system of rules and regulations is looked upon as discipline. In this sense even subjects are considered disciplines. Every branch of knowledge is supported by a system of rules. There is no question of denying them. The grammar of a language is a good enough example of discipline. Without understanding grammar one cannot become a master of that particular language. Again mathematics or science has its own discipline. Because they are so well disciplined they have become exact Sciences. The law of the land is again another discipline.\n\nDiscipline or norms have spread to human affairs. In every walk of life there must be discipline. Thus if everyone is asked to keep to the left of the road and the people follow it then they are disciplined. In behavior also we speak of disciplined behavior. People at all levels have a way of behavior. If the outcome of such behavior is good for all then such people are said to be disciplined. This is often used to judge school boys. If they behave well in class, in public and at home, then we say the boys are disciplined. There can't be a better example of a disciplined organization than our body. How the various parts and organs of our body function is something wonderful; it is a marvel of discipline. So we can easily say the end product of discipline is efficiency; whether it be our body or a people there must be discipline.\n\nNow the question speaks of discipline being at the basis of all achievements. What is achievement ? You try to do a thing and after many trials and errors you succeed. That is achievement; for instance an acrobat does something wonderful; it may be a physical act of a few seconds but for achieving it he must have worked hard for hours on end. A famous example is to run a mile within four minutes. The first man Banister to do it practiced it so vigorously and regularly that he did it. Now following his foot-steps many are able to run a mile, in fact within four minutes.\n\nFor such an achievement the mile runner ought to have a disciplined body. The astronauts have to go through a vigorous discipline before they can be put into space.\n\nTake an example from the humdrum world. A man of business house becomes a successes. They cannot achieve anything by sitting and chanting a verse from the Bible. Thy work in a disciplined way. They know their goals, they know the loopholes and they know the pitfalls. Having known all this they work in a disciplined way and achieve success. This is true of an empire. When the machinery of government is highly disciplined, the government achieves best. The achievements of the English nation are worth remembering.\n\nSo this scene of discipline holds good even in learning. Take for instance learning to ride the bicycle. You have to follow certain rules strictly if you want to master cycling. Every young man who has learnt cycling knows this best. Discipline in learning may involve doing the right thing in a right way using the right tools. Learning very often involves humans and the learner must go to the right person. People who have studied chemistry do know this. In qualitative analysis there is what is called systematic analysis. If one follows it, very rarely will one miss; but if one adopts guess work, more often than not he will be wrong. So in learning also discipline is necessary.\n\nTo conclude, discipline makes life easier. It makes for achievements in all walks of life easier. Last but not least, it makes learning efficient, effective and lasting. But the best discipline is that which is developed within and not forced."

        "title": "Patriotism is a dangerous emotion. Discuss",
        "content": "Many a student of English would have studied the famous poem on Patriotism by Scott which begins this; 'Breathes there the man with soul so dead' and he concluded that such a person will not be honored nor recognized in his country.\n\nThe feeling of patriotism that this is my homeland, has done wonders. For the past two centuries we find one country after another struggling hard to assert its independence. Practically two centuries from now in 1776 the United States of America waged a war of independence against the British and got free. That was the turning point in the history of the world. From then on we find countries struggling for freedom and practically wrestling it from an alien ruler.\n\nThe classical case is that of India. The Indians under the leadership of Mahatma Ghandhi put up a tough struggle for freedom. Then the British Raj which was very powerful at that time would not yield. After a long struggle of nearly 25 years the Indians got their freedom.\n\nA number of African countries have fought to get their independence from foreign rule. The unending fight between Israel and the Arab countries is yet another case of struggle for freedom. In South Africa there is a ceaseless fight against the white rule. Wherever there is foreign domination or some colonial power having control, there is an awakening and the people fret and fume for freedom.\n\nIn the name of freedom against the Spanish rule Simon Bolivar did wonders. Once an English statesman called his people to save the freedom of the land. He gave the cry 'England expects everyone to do his duty'. Churchill during the Second World War had his V sign for victory with his two fingers raised. In that way he galvanized the people into action forgetting all the sufferings and humiliation they faced during the Battles of Britain and Dunkirk. Bala Gangathar Tilak of India with his battle cry of 'Vande Matharam' was able to rouse the spirits of the people who were till then like dumb driven cattle. Even Hitler appealed to the sense of patriotism in his people and within six or seven years prepared the people ready for a war for their fatherland. From all these we find patriotism not that bad, because it is an emotion in the right direction and is certainly a unifying force.\n\nBut patriotism becomes dangerous when it is stretched beyond a certain limit. Then it ceases to be patriotism but fanaticism leading to danger. We saw it during the throes of partition in India when that land was divided into India and Pakistan. Pakistan called it the Jihad and there was death to the tune of millions on both sides. Now some Arab as well as Israeli terrorists play havoc sometimes even on innocents.\n\nPatriotism just like any other good thing in life has its own limitations. When it passes the bounds of sensibility and turns out to be fanaticism then it is certainly dangerous. Leaders use this not for national betterment and solidarity but for aggrandizement and out of hatred of their neighbors. In such instances patriotism stands condemned.\n\nThe world is passing through a crucial phase in her existence. The time has come when no country, however big and powerful it may be, can rule over another country. This may be found not true in certain areas of the world but time will set in motion, forces, quite unexpected, when even those countries under foreign sovereignty will shake off the shackle. For the good of the country, for the solidarity, for national integration, patriotism is the best foundation stone."

        "content": "To get along is to accommodate with others. To go along is to proceed with the task on hand. To proceed confidently and to reach the goal, it requires certain qualifications and make up. They are not only physical but also neutral and emotional. It refers to the mental and social aspect. To go along implies a company or companion. It may be for then individual, a group, a country or countries at large. No man is an island. So far as man is a part of a society he has to live in it which means he must be able to get along with others. This requires a mental set up such that getting along may not be a problem.\n\nWhat is the mental set up ? One must recognize there is place for everybody under the sun. Theoretically at least that is the fact. Circumstances may change but still everybody expects to live and make the best of one's life. He needs food, clothing and shelter. He may need some more comforts. In trying to acquire them or secure them there is the clash coming. Because all are not endowed with the same faculties and capacities and there is always a perennial clash. To avoid such a clash one must know how to give and take.\n\nViewed closely this is a matter of environment, upbringing and education. All these play a vital role. Children must be taught how to live with others; how they should not be selfish, how they should be able to share what they have with others; and how they must have their emotions under control. In this the parents and the school play a vital role. Of course, other movements like the Scouting for boys and Guiding for girls go a long way to help them in getting along. As the saying goes \"Charity begins at home\", once the children have learned quite early in life in their homes, there may be no problems. When they grow old they will practice it in their lives, whether it be in the mart or the senate.\n\nTo go along is not only true of individuals but also of States. The world as it is today is a package of different countries with different strengths, economically and politically. But all these countries must get along if the world has to avoid another catastrophe which cannot be imagined what with all the military hardware piled up these days.\n\nCountries must learn to be good neighbors. Look at what is , happening is West Asia. Israel and the Arab countries are at each other's throat. It is a dangerous situation which may explode at any moment. The creation of Israel after the Second World War was perhaps a great casualty. But the Arabs must know how to put up with that. Thy must have the historical perspective. The claim of the Jews to their ancient land cannot be overlooked. The best thing should be an understanding and adjustment on both sides.\n\nThis is true of countries of different ideologies. With the rapid growth of science and technology, the world is moving towards the concept of one world. No country can sit in an ivory tower and close it eyes to what is happening elsewhere. Natural calamities in one area will have their repercussions in another area. If there is draught and famine in one country, another country which enjoys favorable conditions must come forward to help the other nation. Otherwise complications will set in which will have a chain reaction. Now than at any time, no country can live in isolation.\n\nPolitical divisions must be forgotten for the world to prosper. So to get along is to go along, whether it be in the family, or within a nation or among the nations of the world. This is the type of things great men like Welland Wilkie, Bertrand Russell, Jawaharlal Nehru, Poet Tagore and perhaps Kennedy were dreaming of."

        "title": "Money is a stupid measure of achievement but unfortunately it is the only universal measure we have. Discuss its importance",
        "content": "In life there must be a measure of achievement. In ancient society achievement was measured by the head of cattle one possessed, by the acres of land he owned and by the battle he had won. Among the cannibals by the skulls he had won; very grotesque and cruel indeed. In these examples we find it was never the money that counted in measuring achievement. Instead of money some societies had different measures, for examples, it may be the cowries or even salt. There are areas where the achievement cannot be measured numerically because of the uniqueness of the achievement, for instance, in the case of conquering Mt. Everest or landing on the moon.\n\nHowever, today it is money. It can command a measure of achievement. If he has a big bank balance he is looked upon as a man of success. How he got them and at whose cost he got them are not questioned.\n\nBut the real worth of money is its exchange value. When money was there, of course then too there were transactions. They exchanged one commodity for another, called the barter system in the olden days. If one had a cow he may exchange it for wheat; if one had wool he may exchange it for finished product. With the complexities of the market and the multiplicity of commodities, barter is not possible. We can't say it is completely out of fashion for in international trade a kind of barter is still going on. A country exporting wheat may in turn get sugar. A country exporting tin and rubber, may import motor cars. But as a measure of value money is the best. As such it has brought many good things and bad things too.\n\nTo measure the achievement money is also used as a standard. The achievement of amassing great wealth has to be looked into. Has it come by honest work or dishonest means ? This moral side is very often eclipsed by the ostentatious show of the wealth. People are dazzled by the riches, the limousine a person drives, the brilliant gems his wife wears and other items of luxury.\n\nLet us see why it is a stupid measure. How can one get money ? Can he get by inheritance, by being the owner of some natural resources e.g. petroleum, good land speculation or having a good market for products ?\n\nStill we want a measure by which other things can be valued. Money is the greatest common factor and the genius who thought of money as such must have been a very brainy fellow indeed. It makes marketing and accounting easy. It is easy to carry. Intangible becomes tangible.\n\nBut all is not well with money. The value of money is only relative. It depends on how much a particular unit of currency can buy in the market. Some currencies are backed by good economic strength while others are weak. That is the picture we see today. To decide achievement by money alone is a very poor yardstick."

        "title": "The tragedy of life is what dies inside a man while he lives. Explain",
        "content": "What is death ? Death is a very common phenomenon of every day occurrence and we face it and see it but we can't exactly say what it is. It can be explained only through the result. The life that has been pulsating is gone; there is no breathing and the senses stop to function. So the body which has been active is now cold and stiff. Death is the condition when all that is connected with life is absent in the body.\n\nWhat is a tragedy ? Anything which ends unhappily for all concerned is a tragedy. Thus in a tragedy we find the major actors dying and the play will end on a sorrowful note. What is there inside? What had Dr. Schweitzer in mind when he said this ? It is used not in the physiological sense but in the moral and ethical sense. When we speak of heart, it is not the heart which is the storehouse of blood pumping out regularly so that there is life in the body. It is meant as a seat of goodness in man. From a modern medical point this may not be correct. But for a long time scholars, poets and even ordinary people have viewed the heart as a seat of goodness in man.\n\nSo when Dr. Schweitzer speaks of something inside man he means only the goodness. Mainly it refers to love, compassion, charity and kindness. These are the divine qualities which make man human. Bereft of them he ceases to be a human being. Other animals have them only instinctively. The mother in any species loves its offspring. But there it stops; man alone is capable of having the said qualities and he can also develop them and put them into practice.\n\nThe factors which help develop these human elements in man are many. First and foremost is the family unit, where we learn to love one other. We learn to live for others. We are ready to sacrifice for the sake of the other members of the family. We learn the value of charity as there is a lot of give and take. The members of a family support one another such that the family tree can withstand all onslaughts from outside.\n\nThe next factor helping to cultivate the sense of love is literature. Through poetry, drama, epics and others we learn the value of the good qualities of life. We imbibe those qualities by vicariously playing our part. Folk tales help to strengthen these qualities in children and impress them on their young minds. Since they are at an impressionable age, such tales and stories have a very great value.\nNow with man if he is not capable of putting forth all these qualities of heart it is death for him. Death symbolizes in action so also in the case of a person without the qualities of heart, though he may be living, that is, breathing, eating and procreating; he is not better than being dead. As he cannot show love, he is not compassionate; as he is not charitable he loses all the good values of life.\n\nFor Dr. Schweitzer 'Reverence for life' is the greatest thing. One cannot have reverence unless one has love at heart. Love is the fountain head of all good activities towards our fellow beings. If man becomes heartless because of lack of convictions and forgets the welfare of the fellow beings he is better dead than alive. Dr. Schweitzer practiced it in his life. His service to the Africans especially in the field of medicine is legendary. He sacrificed all for the sake of the suffering humanity. In his case it was almost a call. Naturally he looked upon the presence of love as life and its absence as death.\n\nWe see the same moral in the poem, Abou Ben Adhem. When his name was not found in the list of those who loved God, he asked the angel to enter his name as one who loved his fellow beings Lo, his name topped the list of those whom God had blessed. So we see, to live is to love others. Otherwise living, we may be dead."

        "title": "Many a man would reach a greater height if he had more depth. Discuss the view",
        "content": "To understand the meaning of height and depth we have to study them separately. Let us take the question of depth first and see what it consists of. The depth here refers to the depth in faculties. Physical faculties are just as desirable as mental faculties. Mental faculties consist of intelligence and intellectual abilities. While these faculties are naturally found in some, they can be nurtured in many.\n\nIn the nurturing process of man, education plays an important part. Education is exactly drawing the best out of one. Good education provides opportunities for developing one's intellectual faculties. The more one learns from his teachers and books the more one becomes intellectual. The quick grasp, the ability to digest and the capacity to integrate the new with the old, are the intellectual faculties. Newton saw the apple falling just like anybody would have done but his enquiring mind did not stop there. In this he could find and answer why the planets and other orbs are kept in position and so he gave the law of gravitation. Fleming saw a mould in the culture solution which was inhibitive to the growth of microbes. This led to the discovery of Penicillin which revolutionized the whole thinking in medicine and became the forerunner of many antibiotics. With the growth of an enquiring faculty, depth in knowledge grows.\n\nKnowledge must be applied and that is intelligence. This faculty is inborn but surely it can be developed. Without intelligence mere intellect would be like a body without life. One should learn from examples and to act intelligently. It requires quick perception and decision. Only those who could decide and act can become leaders. If such decision is for the good of many, then such leaders become great indeed. Great decisions have changed the course of history. Washington, Lincoln, Gandhi and others had made historic decisions which have made them near and dear in their countries.\n\nKnowledge of men, material and manners, knowledge of the working of mind and knowledge of how one would react under certain circumstances, are some areas where one must have competency to become great. We may add the depth of understanding. This makes one human. With understanding one can avoid conflicts and one is able to resolve difficulties. This human element is very often found in great people.\n\nNow we shall discuss what is height. The height here however does not refer to physical height. It is the height of glory, fame and name that is meant here. The way to such eminence is not paved with soft, well ordered stones. The path is hard and one will have to work to reach that height. If one has the many faculties mentioned above and applies them in the right place at the right moment, one can reach the height. Some having the depth do not reach the height because they fail to take the tide. There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at its height will take him to eminence; failing which he will be lolling in the trough of despondency. Dash and drive are needed to reach the height.\n\nSo with proper development of one's intelligence and intellectual faculties one could hope to reach great heights."

        "title": "Voltaire said. \"All men are equal; it is not birth but virtue alone, that makes the difference\". Do you agree ?",
        "content": "The statement is clear and easy to see as the palm of one's hand unless one is stone blind. Before arriving at a conclusion let us examine the statement in greater detail and depth.\n\nAll men are equal in what ? They are all equal as an organism. From the way they are conceived until death, in the physical form and growth, the man follows the same time table. Differences there are; but they are only quantitative, for instance one may be taller than the other, the second weigh more; the third may eat more. But basically there is no difference for they eat alike, breathe alike and the functions of the body are alike. His faculties are almost alike; given the chance and training all can use his or her hands and feet to the same advantage. What a white man can do, a colored man can do with equal grace. In creativity man has shown the same aptitude in all climes and countries. So, as a creature, men are all equal.\n\nBut birth makes a difference in this world. We find the rich and the poor, we find the forward and the less developed. This difference is being brought about more by circumstances rather than by the physical act of birth. The same child will behave differently in different places according to how and under what influence it has been brought up. Two children of the same parent will grow and behave differently if they are separated from birth and are brought up in different environments. The differences brought about thus are sociological. Children brought up in an ideal classless society may not feel the difference created by birth or circumstances. Color of the skin or hair may be looked upon as something useful for identity as birth marks.\n\nDifferences created by birth have always led to conflicts. The high and low, the haves and have-nots are some such differences we see today in our society. The law of inheritance, the law of property and the ownership rights all create problems. In a world where man is free to think and act, these differences are explosive in nature and are at the bottom of social upheavals. History is replete with such instances. The so called civilization is nothing but the tidal waves caused by such upheavals on the sea of humanity. Anyway there is no meaning in differences caused by birth.\n\nBut there are real areas of difference among men. Sociologically we may try to put all men under the same roller and flatten them all out of shape. We may give them equality in every aspect of life; there may be no rich or poor; there may be no classes, the owners or the owned. All men share the fruits of their labor equally. This society is possible theoretically.\n\nBut there is an area where differences do exist and in the long run they count. This is what Voltaire calls virtue. Virtue, briefly means, the good qualities of head and heart. It is a strange phenomenon of nature that these qualities do not develop in the same way on all. Even in the same family the traits do not run the same way. One is noted for virtue while the other is far from it. Even in twins the differences persist.\n\nHow are these differences brought about ? Still we are probing to find the answer. Nature and nurture have been found to play a prominent role in the formation of these virtues. Nurture much more than nature has a great part to play in developing the virtues. Chance and circumstances go a long way in developing the virtues. Uproot a child from its bad surroundings and transplant it in an area where it will come across virtuous men and their deeds, then it is quite possible the child acquires all virtues. The exception is also possible but the exception only proves the rule.\n\nCircumstances develop the virtue in men as could be seen in the great lives of the Buddha. Jesus Christ, Emperor Asoka, Emperor Akbar and so on. In the great story of Les Meiserables by Hugo we find how the virtue of a man can be completely reformed by fortuitous circumstances.\n\nOnly the differences of virtue will sustain. The other differences of birth, caste or creed will be forgotten because only the men aryl women of virtue stand apart like stars in the firmament guiding the fate of men and nations. They are like the beacon of light in the surrounding gloom; their lives, their words and deeds bring solace to millions. They shape the course of a people and they alone in the right sense make history. History is not the battles won or the treaties made but it is the battle between vice and virtue and good and bad, where virtue ultimately wins. The cross has a greater meaning than the Taj Mahal. At all times and in all climes virtues have led people from destruction to salvation. So it is not birth of men but it is the virtue that makes the real difference."

        "title": "\"As a profession, advertising is young\" says an American writer, \"As a force it is as old as the world\" Discuss",
        "content": "It is a truism to say that advertising is a veritable force today and no product, however good it may be, can hope to succeed unless through the medium of advertisement. It cannot be gainsaid that man is more led by the advertisements in choosing his requirements whether it is a tooth paste or a fridge or a TV set. The advertisement meets him in many forms and the mass media is fully utilized for the purpose. A sizable percentage of the value of the world's commerce is spent on advertisement.\n\nAdvertisement takes many forms. There are a hundred and one ways in which a product may be advertised. It may be through the newspaper where in many thoughtful and suggestive ways advertisement is inserted. In fact no modern newspaper can survive but for the pages and pages of advertisements. In some countries they widely make use of posters, especially the cinema trade. There are the Radio and the TV advertisements and these have become very popular especially with the younger generation. Then there are the mementos and presentation articles.\n\nSince advertisement has become a powerful media it has come to be specialized. It is being studied as a science and degrees and diplomas are being conferred by universities. There are advertising firms of national and international reputation who see to it that beautiful advertisements are made about products. They make the write-ups, create pictures, and coin ear-catching slogans to popularize a product. A good lot of psychology goes into it. So as a profession, it is becoming more and more scientific.\n\nIt gives employment opportunities to different types of talented persons. Photographers, graphic artists, writers and even poets find a job. Where the rich patronage has failed, perhaps the advertisement trade does it in that it could employ many types of artists. Naturally any person or company who wants to launch or introduce a new product sets apart a sizable amount of money for advertisement. They have to be advertising lest the public should forget. Thus products which have already made a name are being continuously advertised; for example 'HORLICKS' is being advertised in season and out of season though it has become almost a household name for a homely drink.\n\nBut the question is whether advertising it old or recent. The answer is an emphatic 'no'. Let us try to answer this question. If the spirit of advertisement is to attract and draw the attention of others as the quotation says, it is as old as the world itself. Then nature herself provides ample examples both in the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom alike.\n\nTake the case of the color and smell of flowers. Some flowers are beautifully colored and still others are white. The colored ones easily attract the insects and the bees. The latter make them their homes for the sheer beauty of them and also for the sake of the honey. The poets have gone so far to say these insects make the flowers their beds. The smell again attracts the birds and insects. Most of the night flowers are white and sweet smelling. The white color and the smell easily show the location of the flower. This is the the mutual advertisement of the flower and the insect in that, the former is helped in pollination and the latter gets the honey as a wage.\n\nAmong animals, we find birds and animals are colored and so attractive. These colors help them in mating and choosing their partners. The love dance of the bee is well known. The male of most of the animal species is more attractive than the female. It is true of the cock, the peacock, the lion, the tiger, the bull and so on. Perhaps man has got a different opinion about himself. The colors and the attractive appearance help the male of the species to conquer his mate. Sometimes the color of the animal is a warning as in the case of poisonous creatures.\n\nThe color and smell of a fruit is a sure way of advertising their presence to man and animals to get at them. Can anybody avoid the smell of a mango or a jackfruit ? So we see the whole world has a way of advertising itself. So we feel advertisement is a way of life, though the modem man has developed and built it on a Scientific basis. What the temple fair or carnival did in olden days, the modem advertisement does today."

        "content": "The success of a society depends on the coordination between the various components which make up that society. This involves some command from some which has to be carried by some or many. As the saying goes no man is an island, nor is everyone having the same talent in the same way. It is nature's order while a few could think and plan while others must execute. Then can society be stable and function for long.\n\nIt is a question of leadership. There are very few leaders but most of them are developed. Accidents find them in positions where they could develop into leaders. But in those positions they should learn from others until in their own day they could bloom into leaders.\n\nGreat men of industry, great doctors and great lawyers have come up the hard way. Usually they are all apprenticed to a big one from whom they learn the art of their respective trade. They may have the basic knowledge and they may know all the fundamentals but these do not make them leaders. They have to work under a senior and gradually they evolve.\n\nThis apprenticeship calls for humility, hard work, sustained interest and above all obedience. Obedience is to obey. So the apprentice has to obey his master. Juniors under as lawyer plod long hours so that they can master the intricacies of law. Young doctors have to sweat and labor in an operation theatre such that they may become successful surgeons later. Great soldiers learn the first lesson of obedience as soon as they wear the uniforms and for them obedience is the first and the last word. There is no profession like that, of a soldier where unquestioned and unstinted obedience is called for. The great generals then and now ought to have learnt the value of obedience the harder way. Leadership needs discipline and dedication.\n\nThese people know the value of obedience. They know how thing may go wrong if obedience is lacking. It was said of a business magnate that he insisted on all those who worked under him to be punctual. If anyone was late he used to fine them. If he himself was not punctual he would pay the fine from his pocket and thus he was able to set an example.\n\nThere is a great story of a King. Once he was on his rounds in the night in disguise to see that miscreants were not on the prowl. He heard a man and woman talking in a house. He had prior information that the man of the house was away and that the fidelity of the woman was questionable. He knocked at the door of the house and to his surprise he saw the man of the house there. Apologizing, the King returned to his palace. The next morning the man came to the King and complained that a man came and knocked at his door the previous night and requested the King to punish the offender. The punishment, according to the law of the land was to cut off the hand of the culprit. The story goes to say that the king cut off his hand immediately. That shows even a king must obey.\n\nIt is clear from the above that those who would command must know how to obey before they can expect others to obey."

        "content": "The major aim is to become and be a citizen of the world. One may be a citizen of a town or city or country. That is easy because the spirit of the place grows into one's own blood as it were. Thus one can be easily a Malaysian, an American and so on. But to be a citizen of the world it calls for a much more broad outlook, deep understanding and a judicious appreciation of other cultures. Very few people could claim to be a citizen of the world. But there have been and there are people who have reached that height. If we analyze and study their lives we could see how their education, interactions with others and writings have made them citizens of the world. So let us see the role played by reading, interactions and writing in the make up of the citizen of the world.\n\nFirst of all take the case of reading. One reads for pleasure or for understanding or for improving his stock for knowledge. What we read in the school or college or professional institutions is only the beginning and they show and guide what and where to look for. For example specialists like doctors, lawyers or engineers cannot be content with what they have studied in their colleges. Unless they study professional publications later they cannot be up to date. Thus a lawyer may study law reports; a doctor may study professional magazines and monographs. For pleasure we read a lot in our own mother tongue and in other languages as well. The companionship of books is the best that one could look for. Books may please you but never offend you. The reading may be light as a weekend magazine or it may be a master piece. One may read materials pertaining to his profession or personal interest; he may also read books on other areas for fun. Thus one may read books on dozens of different interests and this reading surely goes to make him a full or an all-round man. Such people of wide knowledge are really useful.\n\nVery few people are good conversationalists though there are many well read men. To be a good conversationalist one requires certain qualities. Basically one must be a good mixer; in other words one should like to socialize and have the gift of the gab. He must be a good conversationalist and listener and must never be offensive or must not wound the feelings of the other. At a higher level when a man meets others in conference he learns a lot from them. To be a success at a conference one must have the ability to put forth his arguments forcibly and logically and convincingly. He must have the patience to hear the other man. He must grasp the other man's point of view quickly and reply. This makes one a ready man.\n\nComing to writing, we write when we cannot directly converse or talk to. In writing words are recorded and once the writing goes out of one's hand and reaches the other person it becomes a record. The right word in the right place shows the depth of knowledge of the writer and his penmanship. One may write simple, loving family letters, serious stories, poems, dramas, business letters and short articles. What ever is written the flow of words shows the man. You must write what you want to express in plain, straight forward language avoiding redundancy. In conversation one may be wandering; digressions are permissible but in writing each word or sentence must take you forward. We can see this in the great essays of master writers. The power of the written word has been proved in the great books of the world. From the Bible to the Communist Manifesto we find the effect of the written word. The compactness, the exactness, the sequence of logic, all these make good writing. The more one writes the more chastened he becomes like the polishing of a precious stone.\n\nSo to be a good citizen of the world one must read a lot, one must learn from companions and one must write. Then can he become a full, ready and exact man."

        "title": "\"This is true liberty, when free born me. Having to advise the public may speak free\" (Milton). How far do you agree with the sentiment expressed in this quotation ?",
        "content": "The quotation taken from Milton refers to the freedom of speech which is cherished by all freedom loving people. In fact, it is enshrined in a few constitutions of the world. Some people argue it is the birth right of a citizen to enjoy the freedom of speech. Before actually trying to establish a case for freedom of speech, it may be worthwhile to look into what Milton is having in his mind.\n\nMilton assumes that having to advise the public he may speak free. That is true liberty according to him. Now the question may legitimately arise who is he to advise the public ? Advice is to give direction regarding the course of action or conduct of oneself. Advice must be sought and given; otherwise it may lose its force or in extreme cases it may even antagonize the other as in the story of the monkey and the robins. Some people assume the role of advisers and some have it thrust on them. In the first instance it lands the adviser in trouble but in the second instance if the advice is good, the adviser may get the benefit of it and if the advice is bad, he may even go unscathed.\n\nTo be an adviser requires a lot of knowledge and experience. Thus experienced lawyers and medical men are in great demand because of their experience. Some expertise is expected of an adviser, hence senior workmen who have a thorough knowledge of their work are always respected.\n\nMay be the poet knows a lot because of his erudition. Because of his studies and reflection he feels confident he could advise. This has been the role played by the poets in many lands from time immemorial. Their writings used to influence the life of the people and pull them up morally and ethically. The literature of the world abounds with such writings. That is why in ancient days kings and emperors had their court poets who advised them whenever they went wrong. They were also ambassadors of peace bringing about union among rival kings. This had been very common in oriental countries.\n\nThe poet claims the right to speak free. To speak freely there must be a listener. But the poet does not care whether he is listened to or not. There is also the danger of a poet leading people astray. Then the government of the day may find it convenient to put the poet behind bars or exile him. Truth is not palatable and as such when a poet, or writer who takes the liberty too far as to expose the mistakes of a ruler, or government is treading dangerous waters.\n\nFreedom of speech now means freedom to speak freely of the grievances or the ills done. In this spirit only well meaning people look at the freedom of speech. This right cannot be denied in a free society and it is one of the corner stones of democracy.\n\nThe assumption that the poet is born free and must have the freedom of speech is a fallacy. One is not exactly born free; in a society one has got as much responsibilities as the rights one can claim. So the freedom of speech cannot be taken for granted at all times. In the name of freedom of speech there is so much of mud slinging and it sometimes leads to undesirable ends. Without absolute freedom of speech one can still enjoy liberty; and can appreciate the poetic vision of Milton."

        "content": "Men have been willing to fight and die for freedom. Yes; that is the essence of history. Where freedom fails or is denied man is willing to fight and die; history is replete with examples. The countries which have found freedom newly have had to fight against the erstwhile colonial rule. The fight is still on in some countries even today.\n\nWhy is this fight happening ? This is a psychological question. A boy does not allow another boy to sit in his place in the classroom; a casual traveler in a bus or train claims his place; a child does not allow another child to touch its playthings. At the bottom of all this lies the sense of ownership, temporarily or otherwise. Ownership and acquisitive tendency go together. What has been acquired and owned must be saved and protected and when the ownership is in danger fight ensues. This is a basic animal instinct and man has not reached a magnanimous stage, in spite of his long sojourn on earth, to overcome this basic instinct. The ideal socialistic state is only a pipe dream and whether the world will reach that stage at all is anybody's guess.\n\nAnother factor that leads to this sort of fight or revolt is the opposition to the imposition of authority from outside. We see children singing or playing on their own accord. But when someone asks them to do it again they feel shy or don't want to do it. In the case of a country it may even do things leading to its own destruction. Even then it would not like an external interference. In the name of human sympathy some Western nations deliberately impose their will on another nation and are now paying a heavy penalty for it.\n\nFreedom is very precious. It cannot be decided on the battlefield. Freedom is essential for natural growth. A creeper always moves towards light and air. However much one tries to turn it the other way, it will always strive to seek light; so with people. They want to be free as the bird in the air. The spirit of 'Who are you to tell me?', is always within us.\n\nThe sense of being and feeling free is fundamental to make life worthwhile and hence man has always been fighting for it. But there cannot be absolute freedom."

        "content": "The answer to the proposition can be a big 'NO' though there may be quite a few who take the opposite view, still the truth will prevail. Man hungers for adventure for it brings him the excitement and the resulting satisfaction. Excitement and anticipation make life worthwhile. If everything is as cheap as dust or as free as air there can't be any excitement and life would have no meaning and man can at best be a cabbage going through a vegetative growth.\n\nIt may be enough for the purpose of this essay to confine to adventurous acts though there are others which may be equally exciting.\n\nWhy does any person go through the hazards of an adventure? It is because of their psychological needs. We see it in children. They explore and get into difficult places because they like excitement. This sort of thing is quite common among school children. Their mischief and frolic have got them into trouble. The youth does dangerous things because they have the elements of adventure in them. While there is attendant self satisfaction, it also ensures public recognition. One climbs mountains where others have never gone; one jumps long distances for the sake of recognition. To get the excitement of standing on the victory stand and getting the applause of the crowd one goes through months and months of hard training. What an excitement we get to see the star artist in the circus on the trapeze! Crossing the Channel or climbing Mount Everest has its own excitement. Climbing Everest and crossing the Channel have been done by successive generations of adventurers nobody now looks upon these as a challenge; so too with space. The news that man had landed on the moon was exciting in those days but now it is taken for granted.\n\nMan's desire to try the impossible challenge and win is at the bottom of so many success stories. If these adventurers had not taken the challenge there would not have been any human progress, whether it be in the field of sports, science or medicine. Could it not have been exciting for Alexander to march his army all the way to the Punjab? Was it not adventure that forced Columbus to seek a route to India by going West ? Had not Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India round the Cape of Good Hope, the history of the Far East countries would have been different. It is not foolish nor childish to look for adventures. Then only can one cross the uncharted seas and be happy as Ulysses. Only the weak-kneed will look upon anything calling for excitement and danger, as foolish."

        "content": "Jealousy is one of the human weaknesses which is very common. It is very doubtful if animals have got jealousy; they may not for they don't have the feeling as we, humans, have.\n\nLet us suppose that two friends start on a similar mission. But after sometime one returns successful and wins the Kudos. The other is a miserable failure and so is crestfallen. When the latter meets the former glowing with recent success, he is jealous and would not freely talk or even would not have the mind to congratulate the other. He keeps himself morose and tries to avoid company. He doesn't even enjoy the old jokes. He avoids to speak of the other's success and does not like others speaking of it.\n\nHe may even go to the extent of thinking that the friend has kept certain things that led to his success a secret from him. That means he suspects of the fidelity or sincerity of the friend. He may sometimes openly say that the friend has let him down because of his selfishness. He would slight the success saying that it was only chance that made his friend successful. As a friend, while it is natural to expect of him to celebrate the success and to lead the party, he would avoid it and whenever there is such an occasion he would quietly hang at the back.\n\nHe would assume that he is being neglected because his friend has been successful and may even voice it out. He would go on saying now that the friend has been successful and he doesn't care for him like the old days. What need has he for him now ? He would even go to the extent of thinking imaginary contributions he has made for the success of the other. If it had not been for him, his friend would not have been successful.\n\nThis is all because this fellow cannot reach the same height as the other fellow. If the other one is as enlightened and outgoing he can easily make up; otherwise the jealousy may lead to a permanent rift. This sort of jealousy is more common among women folk than men folk."

        "title": "A good woman inspires a man, a brilliant woman interests him, a beautiful woman fascinates him but a sympathetic woman gets him. Do you agree with this view ?",
        "content": "The question deals with women of different accomplishments and how man reacts towards them. The qualities of woman categorized here are goodness, brilliance, beauty and sympathy. Apposite to them are put inspiration, interest, fascination and getting or winning respectively. To know women of these traits, one must have a wider experience which is rather difficult but the lapse could be made up by a knowledge of history and literature of the world. On the world stage, there had been and there are still women of different accomplishments and here and there mention will be made of them.\n\nIn general the question deals with man's relation with women but for a single man to have contact or relation with the different women mentioned here, the chances may be rare unless he is a great figure who has a galaxy of women hovering around him. To inspire is to give life, to fill life with hope, to pull up the crestfallen one from despondency to optimism. When we take in air we say we inspire because we are taking in the life giving, blood purifying oxygen. So the action or the words of woman may be inspiring. The one may be the wife or a good friend or as sometimes happens a mistress. To inspire, such persons must basically be good. Their words and actions must have a soothing effect on the soul and result in goodness to the recipient. Quite recently and during our times we have heard of Florence Nightingale or the Lady of the Lamp and Mother Theresa. They have given their love instinctively for the sick and ailing; how their work has inspired many to follow their footpath. A husband or a son must be really blessed indeed to have a good woman as the wife or mother; for the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world.\n\nTo interest one is to make one think of the benefits that may accrue. One may be interested in a proposition because it may bring one some benefits. The benefits need not necessarily be material; it may even be mental, say a speech. Brilliance relates to the dazzle in appearance, speech and manners. The brilliance in appearance may incite jealousy, the brilliance in wit and humor attracts and interests. It was said of late Sarojini Naidu that her conversation was full of wit and humor and so she shone among her friends like a brilliant star in the firmament. So people were interested to hear what she would say in general and in particular.\n\nTo fascinate is to attract. The fascination may be real or false, the fascination may be for good or bad. The fascination of the moth for fire is a classical example where it is attracted by the light of the fire only to die. The beauty refers, may be, only to the external, a woman may be beautiful to look at and as an opposite sex, man is fascinated by her but if the inner woman is not as beautiful as the outer then the man having to do anything with her will be ruined beyond measure. There are stories of beautiful women who have fascinated men only to destroy them. That is why beautiful women are used as spies. In World War I, Mata Hari was used as a spy to destroy the morale of army men in the allied ranks. While it is true a beautiful woman fascinates there are stories in which the beauty of a woman was responsible for the destruction of a country or an empire. For example, the beauty of Helen was responsible for the fall of Troy and in the Ramayana the fall of Ravana was caused by the beauty of Sita.\n\nTo get is to own. To own means also the power to command over. When I own a horse I can ride at my will and pleasure; What I own I can easily dispose of but it is beside the point here because the question deals with the sympathy. Sympathy is to have the same feeling for. When one sympathizes with another, it means the latter has the same feeling as the former, that is why we often say 'in sympathy with you'. In sympathy we see the identical views. When a woman has the sympathy she can naturally get the other. In fact the getting may be in different degrees. Some explanations will make this point clear.\n\nTake for instance the sympathy of a nurse for a baby or a patient. In both cases the getting may not be exactly by owning but it is getting a permanent place in the heart of a baby or the patient. The sympathy shown by the mother, helps her get the child. Where children are brought up by others, the sympathy of children for their mothers is very thin indeed. A good wife must have the sympathy for her husband to get him. A classical woman is described that way. She is everything for her husband. She is the wife, the cook, the counselor and the friend. Where she fails to have sympathy for her husband, he looks elsewhere. Kasturbai Gandhi was such a good and sympathetic woman she was able to rule Gandhiji. But to see a woman of all these qualities is rare and such a one is a rare phenomenon."

        "title": "John Milton says, \"Children show the man, as morning shows the day.\" To what degree do you think it is true to say so ?",
        "content": "The famous quotation from the pen of the famous author speaks of the importance of children. To understand the full implication the simile must be understood. The implication appears to be that the early signs and symptoms are the pointers to future growth. How far ? That is the purpose of this essay.\n\nWhat the morning is may be the indicator of what the day is going to be. If it is bright and clear, a warm clear day may be indicated it will be otherwise. If it is cloudy, dull or foggy with chill winds blowing. So it is common to judge the day from the morning.\n\nThis need not be the whole truth; for what promises to be a bright day may suddenly become windy and cloudy followed by rain. Perhaps Milton's knowledge of weather is confined to England for his prophesies would prove false in the tropics or near the Equator where the clouds, rain and sunshine can play havoc. The conditions of the morning may prove deceptive and change from being bright to dull and vice versa. So one cannot lay hope on the signs of the morning for what may follow in the day.\n\nThis is true in the case for children. There are cases of children who were dull in their childhood days and later on proved to be brilliant scholars. The opposite is also true in the children who proved brilliant in their childhood and had gone on to be dull. For instance, Napolean was never so brilliant as a child nor was M.K. Gandhi and both of them became notable figures in history. Robert Clive was dull as a boy but later in his life he was able to build an empire.\n\nEarly brilliance is only an indicator that the child may prove to grow great and brilliant. But circumstances may so change and environment too which will tell on the growth of the child. It may be a physical ailment, a bereavement in the family, a change of circumstance in the fortunes of the family and many others which could intrude upon the growth of the child. In the adolescent age, the bad influence of parents and the company in which the child finds itself may corrupt it.\n\nA case in point is the refugee problem. Tragedy is played that way sometimes and children who have witnessed horrors at their doors get hardened and change their characters.\n\nThere are other influences nowadays like the television, books and magazines, companions and prevalent thought. Due to the bad influence and example of companions a youth may turn out to be hippie throwing away all decorum. The brilliance of youth will have no chance of free growth and sunshine in totalitarian states. Witness the world today. The free movement of men, thoughts and manners nowadays have a great influence in the molding of the character of youth. In a traditional society things went on smoothly. Now the changes brought about by science and technology are cutting asunder the roots which bind the society together. With the rift in the society, the youth is the first casualty.\n\nThough it is true to say that the seed shows the tree, how healthy and well the tree grows depends on many other factors. So too in the case of the child. The signs of brilliance seen in one's childhood may not ensure bright manhood or womanhood because life is subject to mutations over which very rarely the individual may have any control. Thus the statement is only partially true."

        "title": "The need for keeping one's temper under control",
        "content": "Temper can be defined as the mental vibrations in consonance with the external events which touch our senses. The reaction may be calm and quiet or violent. When one is subject to sudden conclusions of mental reactions to externals he is said to be temperamental. In such cases reason which helps one to keep poise is either absent or fails to help the subject.\n\nTemper is a matter of training. It is the domestic environment that is responsible for the development of temper in children. The child may be pampered and wants to have his will and when he is not satisfied he flies into tempers. There is much more so in the case of a child who is lonely and who has no brothers and sisters; or again the child may be petted by all those around him he may become a spoiled child subject to tempers. This is how man grows to be temperamental.\n\nTo keep up one's temper requires a lot of insight into things. Simply because certain things happen in certain ways not to the liking of the subject, it is no reason why one should fly into a temper. There are innumerable occasions when things go wrong in spite of perhaps careful preparation and so on. To quote an instance, one may be in a hurry to open a lock; in spite of the key being there it takes some time before the lock is opened. In between, the person may lose his temper. Very often we find people standing in a queue getting bored and so losing their temper. Unless one applies his reason calmly to know why certain things are happening the way they do, he is likely to lose his temper. When we say 'he' it includes 'she' also. Of course she is more subject to tempers than he. Those who are in the higher rungs of society appear to be more subject to temper than those at the lowest rung. It may be because the former assumes that things should be as they please simply because they command. One very common instance would suffice to bring home the point. One is in a hurry to dress and to go and attend a function or meeting. At the last minute he takes out a shirt from the cabinet and finds out to his chagrin either the shirt has been torn by the washerman or the buttons are missing. He could have avoided the problem had he but given thought to it before.\n\nWhen one loses one's temper it leads to many undesirable consequences. One is easily upset, with the blood circulation going quicker using angry words and offending others. In extreme cases it leads to a nervous breakdown and it may be sometime before the subject comes to the normal self. Such a person may lose friends, lose the sympathy and cooperation of servants. He may upset the peace and calm at home. He may prove a poor executive and in the mart he may create enemies. A man of temper is prone to commit crimes.\n\nThen how to control oneself and keep up the mental poise ? This requires training in introspection. No use of fretting and fuming over spilt milk. Reason should dictate how to avoid it the next time the unexpected does happen, then there is no meaning in losing one's temper. In routine affairs, with regular planning, things may be made to move smoothly without jolt or hitch; everything in its proper place and everything in its proper time. If one were to follow this there may be few occasions for losing one's temper.\n\nOne should develop his faculty of reasoning; then he could easily keep his temper under control. It is also a matter of philosophy as in the case of stoics. There is a classical case of temper under control. In the Battle of Philippines, Brutus and Cassius quarreled and Brutus called Cassius names. That was quite unusual of Brutus. Cassius himself felt that it had come to that extent. Then some friends nearby whispered into the cars of Cassius that Portia, the dear wife of Brutus had been dead. Any one other than Brutus would have burst into tears, torn his hair and so on' but he never did any such thing. When Cassius heard it he could only say 'sorry.'\n\nBy keeping one's temper under control one saves a nervous breakdown. His friends and relatives would like him. He is saved from wrong judgment which he arrives at when he loses his temper.\n\nA man who can keep his temper is a sweet person. He is happy and makes others happy. He illumines the company where he is found. He will never be subject to a nervous breakdown So let us learn to keep our temper under control."

        "content": "Of all the species man alone can enjoy many things in a variety of ways. Other animals also do enjoy but only in a very limited way. All animals enjoy food, all animals enjoy sex life and they also enjoy being in the group of their species or herds. There is no limit to what man can enjoy, from the very low, basic enjoyment he can reach the supreme level of enjoyment that is the spiritual bliss about which the sages and mystics have sung.\n\nNow what is enjoyment ? We get a pleasant feeling through our senses which satisfies desire. Scientifically speaking our senses are supported and abetted by our brains. For example if the visual centre of the brain is damaged, the eye by itself cannot help us enjoy, it has to coordinate with the brains.\n\nMan creates many things, for his enjoyment. That is the story of civilization. He has built cities and palaces, temples, mosques and churches. He alone can cook his food and many varieties of dishes to please the gourmet! He goes on creating, adding to the stock of things such that his life may not become stale and insipid. Whether it be in music or in art wonderful things are happening. Man can make use of the rare materials and recast them or reshape them for the sake of his enjoyment.\n\nNow suppose man is not able to create, what will happen ? He will be leading a vegetative life. Then the very life itself would have no meaning. Life becomes worthwhile because man can enjoy it and get the best out of it by working hard. There is none who refuses the best and in fact everybody aspires to have the best in life. When we speak of the best it implies there are many to choose from. What nature provides appears to be not sufficient. Take the case of the mango. Man enjoys eating the mango fruit; but if it is the same variety, one may not enjoy it. So he goes in for different varieties of mangoes. This is true of very many things of life. So man looks for variety such that he can enjoy.\n\nWithout change life becomes dull and monotonous. Can we enjoy the croaking of the frog ? We enjoy the sky because it exhibits a variety of color in different tones. Man on earth can enjoy his sky but if he is transplanted to another planet he can't enjoy the sky for it will be utterly dark there. The same thing may bring different degrees of enjoyment to different people.\n\nFor enjoyment there must be variety. All our senses bring different enjoyment. Whether it be taste or color or sound or smell, we want variety. Man's genius consists in his adding to the variety. But for this ever-growing variety life would become unbearable and the very earth would become a prison."

        "content": "The press is a modern concept and the modern man can be said to be molded by the press just as once he was said to have been made by his barber and the tailor. It means today man's opinions, may be even his philosophy can be said to be shaped by the newspapers and magazines he reads. Thus we see the press has become so powerful that it has come to be called the fourth estate.\n\nArthur Miller called the newspaper the mirror of the world because it reflects the various happenings in different parts of the world. Modern man cannot afford to be ignorant of what is happening around. Though be may get the news hourly through the radio today, the radio cannot be as comprehensive as the newspaper. The newspaper covers a very broad spectrum of news as to cater to the individual needs and taste.\n\nThe democratic system rests upon the assumption that the citizen has access to a wide range of news and views. Only then can he form independent opinions on many important things like the foreign policy of his Government. Ultimately only this can ensure that his vote is based on fair judgment rather than determined by the coercion implicit in being forced to read and hear only the official view point.\n\nMuch more than the news, it is the views that are more important. A good newspaper interprets, comments and criticizes many things that are happening. Some of the dailies are so respected that to quote from them is to quote the Bible. The 'leaders' as they are called, educate the public on vital issues and present them in a nutshell as they should be. Thus they save the reader's time and also help mould his opinion. For instance, a good newspaper may weigh the comparative merits of a candidate for an election and thus helps the voter.\n\nBecause the newspaper is so powerful governments are afraid of it. Naturally therefore Governments, given the chance would like to control the paper. They bring forth banning orders such that the press cannot publish certain things. The press is banned from releasing certain news and thus pressmen are prohibited from being present. The news in the paper may be highly censored so that what the Government feels is detrimental to its existence is not allowed to go into print. Certain governments have their own news agencies through which alone the press can get the news. This is the rule in the dictatorial countries and so a curtain is drawn over the window as it were. Except in really democratic countries this control of the press is a matter of routine.\n\nThe press as we have seen is so powerful that various political parties in a country run their own newspapers. In England, for instance, there is the labor press as well as the liberal press. In communistic countries, the party controls the press, so that no other wind except that of the party is allowed to blow. The idea behind is quite obvious. Each party wants to propagate and broadcast its views through its paper.\n\nThe control of the press by the Government though it may be desirable in times of emergency, is not so viable in normal times. The control will kill the liberal growth of ideas and people will cease to grow. Just as the free air is desirable to keep a people healthy, today a free press is much important. A free and fearless press can expose individuals and groups when they err. They may even chastise erring officials and criticize the shallowness of certain government actions or policies. They may suggest a line of action and put forth proposals in schemes and projects of national importance. In short the free press can act as an accelerator or sometimes as a brake.\n\nProvided the press does not inflame the feelings of the people as to cause upheavals and does not write libel, the freedom of the press will have to be nourished and cherished."

The earth heaves and at its wake brings about untold misery. There are landslides, typhoons and tornadoes, cloud bursts and so on. These are unpredictable disasters though nowadays we try to forecast with the help of sophisticated instruments. One such disaster which hit my country recently was a tidal wave. That particular coast of the country is always subject to the ferocity of cyclones and the ravages of heavy rain that follows. But this time something unexpected happened. The usual warning was given by the meteorological department. The meteorologists said that a big and forceful cyclone was heading for the coast. Heavy rain and high winds were forecast but the people, who were living on the coast never heeded the warning. There was casual mention of it on the radio but not a serious warning.\n\nIt was almost midnight when the cyclone hit. Huge waves several meters high were whipped up and the huts and dwellings on the coast were simply carried forward and flung like pieces of wood. The rain simply poured non-stop and men and women were buried in the slush and water. Power had failed and in the dark that prevailed, there was nothing but a huge eerie silence interspersed with the cry of those who struggled for life.\n\nWhen the morning dawned the wind abated but what an awful scene lay in the aftermath. Thousands upon thousands of trees were uprooted. In the flood that followed huts, dead bodies of humans, carcasses of animals and huge trees floated. There was no land mark that could be identified. Those who were spared looked dazed and dumb having lost all their belongings and loved ones.\n\nAfter a day or two there was a stink of the dead. Voluntary organizations came forward to bury the dead and help the survivors. To find clothing and shelter for them was a big problem. Call for help was heeded to by sympathetic nations. Clothing, food and medical aid was rushed to the suffering. Rescue work was taken up by the military and the Red Cross units. Temporary houses were put up and rehabilitation was done with utmost difficulty.\n\nIt was a holocaust that could never be erased from our memory. Had the media like the radio, had given ample and serious warning in time, much of the misery could have been averted. Here it is not a question of prevention but is a question of taking the warning by the forecasters seriously. To be forewarned is to be forearmed."

Since the village is served by a river which supplies enough water almost throughout the year, agriculture is a profitable occupation here. There are luscious fields of green paddy around and normally people raise two crops a year.\n\nSince they are agriculturists following traditional farming, there is a set pattern of life among them though modernity has recently invaded their homes. Thus most of them own a radio and their houses have electricity. Their children go to the neighboring town for their education. Most of them own bicycles and a bus service connects the village with the neighboring town. In fact, my neighbors are actively interested in the politics of the country and most of them read newspapers and discuss politics. They are no more the innocent rustics, they were once believed to be. Some of them aspire to hold offices in the village councils.\n\nThese people are looking forward as agriculturists. Some of them even own tractors and almost all of them know the value of good seeds and fertilizers. For them agriculture is no more a shaky gamble of the unknown. They use pesticides and insecticides and have built a marketing federation to sell their products at a profit. They make use of the bank facilities so that they need not be a pawn in the hands of the village pawn broker and money lender.\n\nPaddy growing is the major occupation though some adventurous farmers have switched on to cash crops like sugar cane. They employ casual labor when there is an intensive operation as in the transplanting, hoeing and harvesting season. But for those who actually own no land, the life of the casual laborer is very often uncertain. In an agricultural economy this can't be helped.\n\nThe people when not employed go about in a leisurely way. There is a tea shop in the village where people gather for gossip over a cup of tea. If you sit there for some time you can learn all about the village.\n\nBesides that, the cinema and films seem to be the most favorite topic with the villagers since they love frequenting the theatre. There is a small school which is not a hot favorite with the affluent villagers. The affluent villager prefers to send his children to the Convent or English Schools in the neighboring town. The village school has its strength of students drawn from the lower strata of the society. The chapel is visited by the parish priest once a week on Sundays. The Christian community in my village is a minority group."

For one thing there is not enough space and as such the worst sufferers are the children and the old people. If free space is limited, free air is also not to be had. The air is highly polluted and so one has to pay heavily in terms of health.\n\nHaving lived in this neighborhood for quite sometime I yearn for a rural atmosphere which the poets have sung so much about."

        "content": "When considering the distance a train journey ought to have been preferred, but my family decided this time to go by car. Our family friend offered his Sedan at our service. The car was a well maintained one and could stand the long journey. We wanted to avoid the morning rush on the road and so we started early morning after having tea. All our luggage was packed in and the four of us left. Besides ourselves there was of course the driver.\n\nEven before we were on the road the day was breaking. There was not much traffic on the road, except for stray animals and the early risers. We sped along the road for nearly 50 km. We stopped at a hotel where we had a hearty breakfast with hot rolls, cheese, fried eggs and muffins. By the time we left the sun was up and the day was becoming hot. We talked of many things, from the latest film to the forthcoming election and many joke to cut the boredom.\n\nThough we were a family we had different views and opinions on a number of things. If one could swear by the hippie cult, another could equally speak about the value of transcendental meditation. It is a wonder that such a disparate group could occur in a family.\n\nAfter sometime we switched over to the cassette player and enjoyed the song, hits of some famous musicians. This invention is a great boon to a lonely traveler. Unlike the record player, the cassette is handy and the tape has a longer space and can be erased and recorded.\n\nWe stopped at a way side petrol kiosk for refueling. The road we took was the national highway and so travel was not particularly tedious. We drove past many vehicles, lorries, buses, vans and trucks. One the way we saw a coconut vendor. It was so tempting that we stopped for a few drinks. The cool, sweet drink was like ambrosia.\n\nAs we were nearing our destination, we just stopped to get out of the car in order to tidy up. After that we continued our journey till we reached our hotel where rooms had been reserved. We were happy that we were able to cover such a distance in a car without any event."

        "content": "Just like every year, the education week was celebrated in our school with great joy. As part of the week the mother's day was celebrated.\n\nThe theme is to highlight the role of mothers in the proper upbringing of children. It is the mother who can help shape the character of the child. The mother's role in the development of the child is of varied nature. Not only should she look to the physical growth of the child but also to its mental and spiritual growth. She creates and shapes the proper environment in which the child can develop. The manners and behavior of a child are only a reflection of the home in which it has been brought up. The aim of the day was to make mothers aware of their place in the upbringing of the child.\n\nThe Inspectress of schools presided over the function. One of the Secretaries of the Mothers' Association of the school welcomed the gathering and introduced the chief guest. Several speakers spoke on the various aspects of a mother's role.\n\nOne of the speakers spoke about the nutritional aspect. She emphasized the need for providing a balanced diet to children and on the methods of preparing wholesome food at home. She touched on health of children as being important for a nation as a whole and stressed on environmental cleanliness. She observed that from a health point of view children should be allowed to play freely and the dangers of living in crowded areas. She wanted the government to see to the sufficiency of space for play in every school. Yet another speaker emphasized the need for moral education in which mothers could play a signal role. A friendly, loving and, affectionate atmosphere at home helps to shape the character of the child.\n\nThe chief guest expressed her joy at being present at the occasion and would endeavor to help the school in every way possible. She observed that mothers could help in making the midday meal scheme a great success. She asked the mothers to supplement the work done at school. She emphasized the importance of a happy home in the shaping of the character of children.\n\nFinally the Assistant Secretary of the Mothers' Association proposed a vote of thanks and the meeting ended on a happy note."

There were several families living in the flats.\n\nThe fire started in a paint go down on the first floor. How it all started nobody knew. The fire was noticed only when it began to rage. It was an ungodly hour when the fire broke out. The fire was noticed first by a night watch man who raised an alarm. He phoned up promptly for the fire service and police. It was sometime before the fire engines came to the scene. By then the fire had spread to the other floors. Between fire and smoke there were cries of anguish and despair. People were at first rescued with the help of ladders and lifts. In the confusion that prevailed nobody knew who was rescued. In such circumstances people tend to be very selfish.\n\nThe fire fighters thought they had rescued all. Then suddenly a lady remembered that her child who was sleeping in the cradle had not been rescued. One can understand her anguish and pain. She began beating her breast and wailing, thinking that her baby would have perished by then in the fire. One of the firemen did not lose hope. He told the lady assuredly that if the child was still alive he would go and surely save it.\n\nHe drenched himself with water, got up the ladder in spite of the warning given by his colleagues. Walls were crumbling down and beams were falling and tongues of fire were still to be seen. Worst of all there was a thick pall of smoke. The man managed to get a foothold on a window. He got into the room and with great difficulty he was able to locate the cradle. It was a miracle that the fire had not done much damage to the side where the cradle was located. He took the screaming child rolled it in a wet blanket which he had brought. He quickly strode to the window and called his colleagues who were waiting anxiously below with a foam mat. He threw the valuable bundle down. His colleagues caught it with dexterity and the child was moved to a place of safety. No words can explain the joy of the mother.\n\nIn the meantime the fireman slipped down the ladder. In spite of the precautions he had taken, there were burns on his body. He was promptly taken to the hospital and given proper treatment. In appreciation of his service the highest civil authority rewarded a sum of money to him. That was the proudest moment in the life of the fireman . Everybody was saying that he would get the President's Medal for his courageous act."

        "content": "Man needs food to live. Food can be classified into two groups -- vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Man perhaps started as a non-vegetarian because we know ancient times man hunted for food. Then he learnt to eat fruits. Much later he mastered agriculture and began growing grains, to make food and these were used as supplements to meat. In most of the countries even today non-vegetarian food forms the major part of the normal diet.\n\nPure vegetarianism may be said to be a product of the East. With the coming of Buddhism and Jainism some twenty five centuries ago animal sacrifice was looked down as cruelty to animals was condemned. Great emperors and kings, like Ashoka preached love for all animals and slowly men began turning to vegetables for food. The knowledge of cooking might have encouraged vegetarianism because different tasty dishes could be made with vegetables and food grains.\n\nBoth types of diets go to build the body and supply the necessary energy. In certain aspects the non-vegetarian diet may be better in that it supplies the necessary protein and fats required by the body easily. Liver content from non-vegetarian food may be helpful to keep the liver functioning well and supplies certain types of vitamins. Those who argue in favor of non vegetarian diet point to milk which is in every sense non-vegetarian and which every vegetarian takes without objection. But extreme vegetarians like Gandhi were against even milk. In fact for a very long time Gandhi went without taking milk though later he took goat's milk on doctor's advice. Why milk is tolerated is because it does not involve the cruelty of killing, though milking the cow at the cost of the calf may involve cruelty.\n\nA vegetarian diet can supply all the necessary food items needed by the body except that it may be deficient in the required amount of protein in our food. Vegetables are harmless to the body compared to a non vegetarian diet. For instance, meat, if not carefully kept and handled may carry diseases. A vegetarian diet is definitely deficient in Vitamin B and C for which the a vegetarian will have to depend on a supplementary such as pills and tablets to keep up his strength.\n\nAnother point in favor of vegetarianism is men's denture and the long intestines point to the fact that man could best be a vegetarian. Economically vegetarian food is cheap; vegetables and fruits end greens are delectable and beautiful to look at.\n\nThe argument that non-vegetarian food makes one strong is shallow. There are great intellectuals among vegetarians. Gandhi and Shaw were great vegetarians. It is a matter of habit if one could overcome being e slave to the tongue, vegetables can do as much good as a non-vegetarian diet."

Average people can surely succeed in examinations with positive help. It is something like oiling the wheel. One may know the answer but how it is put end present it makes a lot of difference. Experienced people may show the way. Hence nowadays people seek even outside guidance by having private tuition at home or joining an institute giving expert tuition.\n\nOf course in my case I am lucky that all along I have been helped by my relatives end friends. To begin with I can't forget the help my mother used to render in the primary classes. She was ready to help and so I never worried about my homework. Not only did she use to urge me to do the task but patiently helped me along.\n\nWhen I came to the higher classes I could confidently depend on my brother and sister. They would teach me mathematics and help me do the problems. Since they always wanted me to do well in the examinations they not only gathered question papers from other schools but also patiently saw to it that I completed those papers by myself.\n\nOne of my teachers used to help me whenever I approached him. He knew that I wanted to score first in the examination to get into a professional college. Unless one is really competent, one cannot hope to enter the professional college easily. So my teacher showed me the way how examinations should be tackled. We used to discuss in a general way about various problems both national and international and I can say it has stood me well in competitive examinations. That again has helped me in viva voce examinations because I had e first hand practical knowledge.\n\nLast but not least I can't fail to mention that some of my friends really helped me. We used to compare notes and help each other when one was not attending the class. We used to take down notes from reference books and discuss them. We formed almost a team and with a competitive spirit went for the examination. There was no jealousy among us and in doing practical work one always helped the other. When I look back I am grateful to all of them who helped me ungrudgingly."

It appeared they wanted to divert the attention of the people from the main issues and that they wanted to spoil the youngsters. Their main aim was to attack the established order and that was why they called themselves rationalists; whether they were rational is for others to say. One thing is certain, their meeting had destroyed the peace and tranquility of the place. People got divided on issues, and as the general law is every action generates an equal opposite reaction. That was the result of the said meeting.\n\nThe so called rationalists went on a procession. They carried placards criticizing the practice of people. They had slogans condemning rituals and observations. They met at the municipal hall and the meeting was addressed by some self-styled leaders who spoke at length about the rituals, festivals, places of worship and other things. They spared no people, or any institution. They claimed freedom under the freedom of speech principles. Since they had a well paid army of volunteers, there was no lack of noise and applauses. They passed resolutions not only condemning the practices and customs of people but also asked the Government to bring in legislation to stop such practices. It was rumored that these people had a powerful lobby in the State Assembly where their voices could be heard. But the newspapers were very cautious in reporting the proceedings of the meeting.\n\nThe meeting brought about a sharp reaction among the people of the neighborhood. Most of them could not exactly see what these people meant. So they also brought out posters condemning the rationalists. They brought together all the people and held meetings to chalk out a plan of action to counter the influence of the rationalists.\n\nThe meeting of the rationalists had one effect. It had stirred the erstwhile dormant people into action. Youngsters have taken up the challenge and have come forward in large numbers to carry on counter propaganda against the rationalists.\n\nSensible people fear that the rationalists have unfortunately raised the hornets nest and it may take quite sometime for the bitterness to die down. Whether it would lead to further strained feelings and outbursts, is anybody's guess. Anyway well meaning people are not happy over the turn of events."

The elders played all the important roles and the youth was made legally responsible only after they attained the age of twenty one. In many matters the decision of the elders was final.\n\nBut now times have changed. The youth appears to be revolting throughout the world. In so far the youth was following the occupation of the parent, the youth was subservient and he had to learn from the elder. But with the spread of education and diversification of jobs and the facility in travel which takes people away, family ties get slackened. When the youth was living with the parent under the same roof he was sharing the joys and sorrows of the family. Once the youth gets away from home he is not so much attached to the home.\n\nThe youth today succumbs to various influences. In those days it was the home and the school that influenced the youth. Now there are forces like the newspapers, the radio and the television, the cheap magazines and the cinema and the politicians too. The youth very rarely has any firm ideas. They sway between extremes, for example, religious fanaticism or various political ideologies. Where they are disillusioned with society they become extremists believing in terrorism. While others turn hippies throwing all the social norms to the winds.\n\nThe formal discipline to which their parents were subject to is an anathema to the youth. As they want more direction, the more they are in a disarray. They have wrong notions of freedom. The formal education that they get, does not guarantee them any job. Their ambition is high and what life and society can offer is comparatively low. While many may resign to their fate, some rise in revolt. That is why there is unrest in the campus.\n\nYouth, the cream of the society, must not be allowed to move on the path of destruction. The home and the school have a tremendous responsibility in shaping the character of youth. The youth need people to advise them guide them and to lead and show them the path of righteous, fruitful and enjoyable activities. The correct directions given to youth can help them to be good and useful men of tomorrow."

        "content": "Challenge is a word made familiar today whether it be breaking a record at the Olympics or getting solar energy to work for us. Everything is a challenge. Betting is also a challenge. Here one uses one's sense of speculation. From time immemorial betting has been in vogue. Betting for fun and profit is not uncommon. In gambling betting is usual especially in horse racing and in international football. Sometimes there are occasions of unusual betting. There was once a musician who was a tough guy. When it came to a matter of challenge he would rather break than bend. So people who knew him did not dare get into an argument with him. This man had a problem with his roof which was leaking. The tiles had to be removed and replaced and some minor repairs made. So he called a mason and discussed the problem. The mason agreed to do the job provided he was given a certain amount by way of his wages. It was exorbitant and there was a lot of haggling and both parties were stubborn, one demanding a higher wage and the other for reducing it considerably.\n\nIn this zigzag affair the mason threw a challenge to the professional musician. He said that the other might know something of music but he didn't know anything about a mason's work and so couldn't do his job. The musician rose up to the challenge and said that he would show the mason how well he could do the job.\n\nThe next morning the erstwhile musician was seen on his roof. He had tucked up his loins, bared his shoulders and was removing the tiles. His fingers which used to keep time now lifted the tiles, which was a hard job indeed. But the musician would not back out. He removed the tiles, cleaned the roof, replaced the tiles in their place with a professional touch and applied cement and mortar to keep the tiles in their place. Thus he toiled and moiled for three days and had done the job to the wonder of his neighbors who were watching the man at his job. People who were at first pessimistic came forward vociferously to congratulate him. They said he was indeed a nut and had showed that he could do anything once he made up his mind. The mason admitted his defeat and thence forward he became staunch admirer of the musician. He had lost his earnings by throwing a challenge to a man who meant business."

        "content": "Given the choice I would choose the school out in the country for reasons which I put forth below.\n\nBefore actually stating 'Why' I shall say 'Why not'. Let met first state my case against a city school. Schools in cities are usually crowded and in crowded locations. Except for a few schools many city schools are housed in drab, old houses with a slovenly atmosphere. The noise from outside will be abominable and since the school is crowded there cannot be much cordiality between the students. The question of transport from school to home and vice versa will be time consuming and at the same time sickening. One will have to start quite early and travel by crowded buses or trains and return home late. By the time one returns home, there will not be time for play or relaxation. This almost mechanical life for six days in the week would tell on the nerves. A city school boy may have a swelled head figuratively, but his health and knowledge may not compare with a boy in a village who enjoys the rough and tumble of life.\n\nIn a small town the scope for learning outside the class may be little. The chances for recreation may be limited. The chances for wandering and to get lost may be limited. You are nobody in a city but you are easily recognized in a small town. So the scope for indulging in play and recreation may be limited unless provided by the school. There may be variety lacking in such schools. Different strata of society may not be represented there and the scope for knowing people at large will be limited. Usually the students from these schools are like second class citizens. They have neither the knowledge of the country nor the variegated experiences one could have from a city.\n\nMy preference is therefore for a school in the country. What I visualize is a school in the country neither too far away from the city nor too near. The school must have proximity to a main road, so that mobility will not be a problem though it should not encourage travel often. The school must have natural surroundings, may be a hilly land or green fields with a river nearby. There must be plenty of space to move about and play. One must be able to go about fishing or swimming or if one feels like it he must be able to wander. When I write this I have Thoreau's 'Walden' in my mind where man could live free and feel one with nature, enjoying the cooing of birds, and rustling of leaves. If there is a school like that in the country I shall certainly go there."

        "content": "Normally parents tend to treat all children alike. They are given the same food, sometimes the clothing and very often the same time of schooling. There is nothing unnatural about it and it is as it should be. Where the family shares to a common table all shall be served the same food. Similarly in the matter of clothing children are dressed alike. This in fact helps to avoid a quarrel among the children. If say John is not given the same type of clothing as Charles he frowns and may cry and quarrel. Where food and clothing are concerned there need not be a separate treatment.\n\nIn educating the children, the same treatment may be all right in the lower classes. But when it comes to a matter of higher education the difficulty comes in. Children of the same parents are not alike. Even in the case of identical twins the difference is perceivable. In the case of normal children there is bound to be vast differences physically and intellectually. In the same family we might come across highly intelligent children as well as muffs.\n\nSo certainly there should be different treatment for different children. A wise parent should never try to put all children into the same mould. The children vary in their attitude to work, study and play. One may be physically strong and prefer physical rather than intellectual work. The second may prefer sports, games and active open air life rather than classroom work. Still a third may like to read a lot. So it is for the parent to observe closely and study the attitude of individual child. Accordingly he must choose the career of the child. It is easily said than done. There are many problems in choosing what type of education the child must be given. The difficulty may be in the means. All facilities cannot be provided by the parent. That is why most parents choose the line of least resistance and send children to the public school or grammar school. Since these schools cannot cater to the individual needs for children, many of the children leave school as misfits or with an aversion for the scholastic life.\n\nEven a discerning parent cannot theoretically speaking treat children differently according to their talent and capacity. Where the parent fails the Government must step in. For ideological or political reasons this is not being practiced in democratic countries. Whereas in totalitarian countries, the State takes a stem view of the education of children and makes them fit into the groove in which they can set themselves in. The question of a square man in a round hole may not arise. This is a very delicate question and unless the parent treats children intelligently there may be more harm than good."

        "content": "The world today faces many problems despite the fact that it has taken long strides in science, technology and knowledge. One such problem is over population especially in developing countries. The population is growing so fast, that it grows in geometric progression whereas economic goods grow only in Arithmetic progression that demographers say there will not be literally any standing space on earth for her teeming millions. Let us find out the causes for such a growth, the problem or problems such a growth causes and the possible remedies.\n\nThe fast growth in population can be attributed to good health, lowering of mortality rate, combating famine when and where it occurs. With the knowledge of science many killer diseases have been literally conquered. For instance, smallpox which used to take a heavy toll of lives has been eradicated from almost all countries, so too has cholera, plague and so on. Even Tuberculosis is kept under control. The wave of flu which accounted for millions of death in 1919 was nothing but a common cold. Infant mortality has been reduced considerably by taking pre-natal and post-natal care. Child mortality is kept under check by protecting the child against Tetanus and Polio. Thus while the number of deaths is reduced, there is no control on birth as a result the population is increasing at a runaway speed.\n\nAgain periodic famine in certain countries used to take away the lives of thousands of people. Now with the better management of the world's food, in the matter of production, storage and distribution, no part of the world needs suffer from famine. Add to this the better methods of producing more food that are being adopted. By using better manures and fertilizers, high yielding seeds, by pest control and water management there has been a revolution in food production. These are some positive conditions which contribute to the growth of population.\n\nThe growth of population has its problems as we shall see. As there are more and more mouths to be fed, there comes a great strain on the resources of a country; this is real in the case of developing countries with the result they are unable to push ahead economically. As food is not sufficient there is chronic malnutrition in these countries especially in women and children resulting in weaker population who would only economically be a drain on the country as their productive years will be short. As health and education are the State's affair, they affect the country's finances. So in developing countries health and illiteracy continue to be the problem. The unwieldy growth of population leads to the problem of housing and sanitation. In many countries the slums are a sore to the eyes. Slums grow round big cities and are found with all the drawbacks. These are the areas of disease, filth and crime.\n\nNow people have realized, the dangers of over population. Every country is caught up with this problem and population growth control has become an economic necessity. In fact it is a survival necessity. Family planning has become a household word. Though there has been objections on religious and other grounds, people have come to accept family planning as a fact of life. Some countries have taken it seriously that it has become a national effort. Through mass media people are being warned and educated. Inducements are made in the forms of free treatment, earned leave and cash gifts. Men and woman in their productive age can get themselves sterilized. Vast research is going on to introduce simpler methods.\n\nStill the world may be saved from population explosion. May be there are more Green Revolution miracles up the sleeves. May be birth control miracles in the next ten years may save us. Right now the whole world seems bored with Family Planning. Can the world afford the luxury of such boredom ?"

        "title": "The absence of sporting spirit and its consequences",
        "content": "The world from the dawn of civilization has been enjoying sports. One of the pastimes of the rulers was to arrange for periodical sports. It may be hunting, chariot race, horse riding, wrestling and boxing. Organized sports were popular in Greece, especially Olympia from which modem Olympic games have derived their names. Sports were for fun and frolics. In the middle ages sports were very popular in European countries. Sports are supposed to develop many good qualities. There may be healthy competition and rivalry and never enmity or bitterness. It is and should be for the sports' sake and not for winning the laurels. This is the real sporting spirit. There are rules and regulations in play and games. The sporting spirit implies the following of rules whether one wins or loses. The outcome or the result is not the important thing but how the game is played.\n\nA real sportsman takes things easy. Take for instance, an angler sitting by the river side from morning till evening, casting his line into the water. He may not always be lucky to have a catch. Still he whistles back home happy in the evening when the night sets in. It is not the catch that is the point but the angler's attitude. He cannot grow angry and break the fishing rod. Then he has lost the fun. So too in any game the winner or the loser, much more so the latter must be able to take things easy. A real sportsman does not lose his head when he wins nor is he bowled over when he loses.\n\nThe crux of the problem is whether a sportsman plays the game; in other words if he strictly follows the rules of the game and never adopts foul means to get a win. But unfortunately this point is missing. In certain modem sports, games like horse racing, they dope the horses. The Olympic games where one expects the ideas to prevail seems to be no exception. There are instances of doping and impersonation and hence vigorous tests are given and the competitors are checked seriously.\n\nWhen the sporting spirit is absent or missing, naturally very unpleasant consequences can ensue. Very ugly scenes are more often the rule in football matches. Referees are manhandled and the crowd become partisan. Cricket was a king of games where such behavior was unheard of. But of late, even in cricket unpleasant things do happen; when a player is signaled out by the umpire, he loses his temper and grimaces at the umpire and so on and makes a show of his unpleasantness. Bowlers are being very often warned. All these result from lack of sporting spirit.\n\nA good sportsman knows his game rather than the rules of the game and follows them willingly. In whatever position he is placed he plays his part. He cooperates with all the members of the team and works always for the good of the team of which he forms a part. He develops espirit de corps and in and outside the field he shows this sporting spirit. He never plays foul though there are few who turn mercenary and wreck the fortune of their team for the sake of money or other considerations.\n\nThis sportsman's spirit may be developed in ordinary life. In whatever walk of life one finds himself he must be able to do his duty. Material gains apart, he must be able to deliver the goods. He must be reliable and a good companion to his comrades. He is faithful and obedient to his superiors. He goes about his duty without gossiping and scandal mongering. Then people call him a good sportsman. Such people are scarce but they are assets wherever they are found.\n\nIf people do know the value of the sporting spirit why then the rarity or the absence of it ? Simply it is because of selfishness. For personal glory or ownership or name, one grows selfish. The selfishness gets started in early childhood. Jealousy and rivalry and sometimes even lack of security lead to selfishness. Very often children do not want to part with their play things or share them with, others. When this selfishness grows into life, there will be absence of sporting spirit. Such people keep themselves in isolation and they never mix freely with others. Temperamentally they are non-companionable and they are never happy nor add to the happiness of others. So we see that this sporting spirit must be developed even when they are children. Here comes the Cubs, Girl Guides and Boy Scouts movement which develop in their incumbents all the good qualities of a sportsman."

        "title": "What measures have been suggested to deal with the rapid increase in the world's population ? Which of these, in your view should be encouraged ?",
        "content": "One of the greatest of scourges for man's undoing is the growth of the population of the world. This is called population explosion and people who know say that if this explosion continues at the rate it does there may even be no standing space on the earth by the end of this century. With the conquest of diseases, better environmental conditions, measures of social welfare and better mother and child care, the balance of the living over the dead is improving; hence the great number of people on the earth.\n\nPopulation explosion has brought about a strain on government because the responsibility to feed the teeming millions rests with the state. In spite of all the advances in farming and agriculture the production of food cannot keep pace with the requirements. The modem state is in charge of the many welfare activities and as such a vast percentage of the national revenue has to be spent on welfare activities like education, medical care, roads and housing. As such money will not be available for economic betterment. Many Governments are caught up with the problem. The question now is how to contain it. In principle all are agreed that it is better to mend the roof before it rains. There are, of course, differences of opinion on religious grounds but even then they are coming to an agreement.\n\nVarious measures have been suggested to control population growth. They are the pill, the loop, sterilization of both men and women and the rhythm method. Now the pill for females only are available though the time may not be far off when the pill for the male also will be in the market. The pill taken by the female as advised by the doctor would help her avoid pregnancy. But there are some side effects in taking the pill like blood pressure, over weight and sometimes even cancer. Such incidence is far and few between. The medical opinion is divided on this question. Perhaps it may be sometime before a fool proof pill may be put into the market.\n\nThe loop is another method. A tiny gadget in the form of a loop is inserted in the uterus and this helps the female avoid getting pregnant. This is said to be a comparatively cheap and convenient method. The loop itself can be removed when the need arises. Even here there is some danger in that some people develop complications after the insertion of the IUCD as the loop is called.\n\nThe rhythm method follows nature's calendar. Between the monthly cycles there is a period in women when they can conceive. If that period is avoided by the couple, then there is no chance of conception. This is good but man being an animal, his ability to self control is very limited and any intimacy may lead to conception. This method is highly ethical, provided there is a strict agreement between the husband and wife. The problem is one cannot always be remembering the calendar.\n\nThe next best and most fool proof method is sterilization. Vasectomy in the case of the male and the tubectomy in the case of the female, when properly done, will help them avoid conception permanently. Vasectomy is much easier and a few men are willing to undergo that operation. The majority fear that they may go impotent but according to medical opinion there is no ground at all for such a fear. Tubectomy is better done immediately after a delivery.\n\nThe next method is abortion and this has been legalized by almost all governments though once it was looked upon as a sin. They call it medical termination of unwanted conception. Once it was resorted to when the health of the prospective mother didn't warrant a conception. Now very simpler method of aborting has come and under competent hands abortion is not dangerous. It raises a moral question because this may encourage pre-marital conceptions and immorality among careless youths. Postponement of marriage is one of the methods suggested but it does not appear to be an answer.\n\nWeighing the pros and cons of the various methods, until a simpler method is devised, sterilization alone seems to be the answer today. Hence governments are bringing in legislation to make sterilization compulsory. Whatever opinions one may have, whatever objections one may raise on moral or religious grounds to save humanity from self destruction, family planning is a must."

        "title": "What qualities would you consider necessary in an international language ?",
        "content": "The need for an international language cannot be gainsaid and its need has been felt more now than before. But such a language must have certain qualities so that it could be accepted as an international language. The purpose of this essay is to discuss some of those qualities.\n\nAny language must have its own alphabets. The Roman Script in which most of the European languages are written is very convenient as it has the smallest number of letters. It is only twenty six and compared to the thousands of letters of Chinese, it is very easy to master Roman Script. But even here there are certain difficulties because all sounds could not be expressed in the Roman Script. That is why experts like Bernard Shaw suggested a forty script language. So an international language must have a small number of simple scripts and must be useful to express any sound.\n\nSecondly it must have a rich vocabulary. There are dozens and dozens of highly developed languages in the world with their beautiful vocabulary. Some of those words, if they are already popular and could be easily understood, must find a place in the international language. These words must have the respectability capable of being used in the newspaper, in conferences and international meets. Those words must be acceptable to the people of the world, at least the educated who would be using them very often.\n\nThirdly it must have good idioms and expressions. Only these make any language virile and the international language must absorb those idioms into it so that it will be better understood in suitable form. Since in an international meet, all kinds of people from different countries would be present the idioms must be acceptable to all and intended only for international usage. All that is peculiar to a particular tongue need not be there. The language must be capable of being spoken and written by many, neither too hard to understand nor to simple too be forgotten.\n\nIt must not have a cumbrous and difficult grammar. Each language has its own rules of grammar, some of them not very logical on the face of it. For example, in English we say `I read, you read and he reads'. This has proved a headache to many a beginner of English. In fact in almost all languages these peculiarities are also found. So the international language must have a simple grammar.\nThe language must be capable of being used in the august assemblies of the world. But that is not enough; it must be capable of being used by the man in the street as well; otherwise it will become dead soon. It has been the fate of some great languages of the world, for instance, Sanskrit, which continued to be the court language and the language of the elite and so it became dead. To attain an international status, it must be the language at that level. It must be used in world bodies so that translation could be avoided.\n\nSince the international language will have to be evolved it must avoid the pitfalls in other languages. Newspapers of repute can have their edition made in the international language. Great books of the world must be translated into the international language. The whole trouble is a language has to evolve and is never made. So the birth of an international language may have its birth pangs but it may be worthwhile to make an attempt."

        "content": "Science makes sense. What is sense ? Knowing, understanding, applying and appreciating, all to go to make sense. Man alone is endowed with this capacity to know while other animals live by mere instinct. Man alone can modify his environment while other animals when they cannot adapt to the changing environment simply perish. Not only does man modify his environment but he creates also an environment where he can live comfortably. Thus man today can live in the hottest part of the world or the coldest part. This achievement he has been able to get by his knowledge of Science and by his mastery over forces and by his ability to adapt them for his own ends.\n\nWhether one is going to be a scientist or not, one should be able to use the products of science. There are innumerable gadgets science has placed in our hands; man enjoys using them. There is no time in the day when man does not use some product or other. At home stoves are in common usage. Watches are used as though a man is born with them. Bicycles, motorcycles, scooters and motorcars are commonly used for transport. Transistorized radios and stereograms have come to stay. They are looked upon as important second only to food and clothing. Television is catching up too. In the office many contrivances are used like the intercom telephone, the transistorized calculating machine and computers. Man is affected by all these. Directly or indirectly he has to deal with them. In most cases one has to use them. This requires a rudimentary knowledge of their working. So we see whether it be at home or in the farm or in the office, a knowledge of science would go a long way to enjoy the fruits. Otherwise it would be like a man who bought a gold watch but could not tell the time because it had Roman numerals.\n\nThe next stage is to know how things work. One must have a fundamental knowledge of science. An idea of various laws connected science, a knowledge of energy and its various causes and effects are fundamentals to be learnt. One must have the knowledge of the world of elements to know and understand their reactions. One may handle a camera efficiently without knowing the physical and chemical actions involved. To understand them is by far better than simply following instructions blindly. Besides the physical world there is the world of living things. How organisms live and multiply, how they affect our lives, how best to make use of them for the betterment of our lives are some of the areas of biological sciences in which man must be interested. Now that scientific farming has come to stay, man must know all about the tools of farming, manures and fertilizers and enemies and friends of plants.\n\nWhat the ancient man looked at with awe and fear, the modem man is able to appreciate. He can measure the skies, probe into space and dig deep into the bowels of the earth or ocean for minerals. Science is not only for material benefits but also for the progress of mankind. The landing of \"The Viking \" on planet Mars may be a costly project today but the knowledge gained from it is useful. The appreciation of the world of colour and sound is something to be cultivated. This had led to the great poetry of the world.\n\nKnowledge of Science has helped man to create. The creative activity is not confined to scientists alone but the knowledge of basic science has helped many to create. This is evident in various fields and we come across ordinary artisans without any scientific knowledge doing a bit of creative activity.\n\nTherefore, a knowledge of Science to an ordinary man, even though he may not become a scientist is as valuable as his knowing the fundamentals of civil law."

        "title": "How would you prove to a non scientist that (A) Infectious diseases are caused by living organisms and (B) Electric currents are caused by the flow of particles ?",
        "content": "Man as any other organism is subject to disease and decay. When a person is ill and diseased there is something wrong in his or her system, that is quite obvious. When he is not able to go about his duties properly the various organs do not function well and the person is ill. We know it through symptoms like headache, fever, cold and cough, rashes on the body and wrong bowel movements. These symptoms are not diseases though very often in common parlance, people speak of them as diseases. They indicate there is something out of normal in the body. When the body is healthy the functions take place quite normally. So the body itself could not have created the difficulty by itself.\n\nThen there must be something from outside that ought to have got in. Since the infection grows there must be some living organism involved. If the foreign body entering the body is lifeless like a particle of dust in the eye, the symptom may be localized. But in the case of infectious diseases, it is not the case; the whole body is involved. A little reflection will show there is growth of the foreign body within , with all the concomitant results. The foreign body multiplies in conducive conditions and in so doing produces toxic materials which enter the blood system or other tissues to play havoc sooner or later. The higher temperature, headache and motions are only symptoms as mentioned above and they give the warning.\n\nNow it has been proved beyond doubt these diseases are caused by micro-organisms, very microscopic in nature; some of them are, in fact, ultra microscopic. With the invention of powerful microscopes, man's knowledge of these organisms has grown and today, thanks to the work of great pioneers like Louis Pasteur the nature of these organisms has been known, with the result that man is able to fight them back. Really speaking, he has succeeded in completely eradicating most of them.\n\nWhen a piece of zinc and copper is placed in dilute sulphuric acid or acidulated water, it can be shown that an electric current flows.\n\nIn the reaction bubbles of hydrogen can be seen moving. It can also be seen that when the flow of hydrogen is stopped or blocked there is no current. So naturally there is a relationship between the flow of current and the flow of hydrogen particles. Hydrogen particles carry power or in scientific parlance they are charged particles. As they go and attack the copper , charge is set free from copper.\nTo understand this one must know the nature of conductors like copper and other metals. The are elements and their electronic (atomic structure) has been studied. They have electrons moving in their outer orbits. when a charge of the same nature comes into them there cannot be any chemical reaction, the extra charge overflows. Thus the flow of electricity is nothing but a flow of particles."

        "title": "Discuss the importance of other kinds of history than political history",
        "content": "Normally when we speak of history, people take it to mean the political history because all along it has been the impression created in the academic circles. So when a student says he studies history, more often than not, he means only the political history which deals with the rise and fall of a nation, the various dynasties that came on the scene, battles won or lost, treaties signed, territories gained or lost and so on and so forth.\n\nHowever it is worthwhile to remember there are histories which are as important as political history. Thus there are social history, constitutional history, history of literature and history of philosophy. Man's knowledge and achievements have grown so fast in the last few centuries, literally speaking, there is no faculty which cannot boast of a respectable history of its own.\n\nAfter all history treats with the beginning, stages of growth, agents of progress, or otherwise, the personalities on the scene, the action and reaction both within and without and so on in a particular area. Man has to know a lot today because of the complexities of life. A non-scientist may as well be interested in the Martian probe by Viking as a specialist in the field. In helping him appreciate the achievements of Viking he may learn the history of space probe.\n\nLet us look at the social history of a country. This will be woven round society as the nucleus. This will deal with the social forces acting on them, religion, industry, the social set up of the family, the ruler and the ruled, the force of law and in general how the life flowed at that time. It may reveal how a particular incident, discovery or invention changed the course of history and as such the life of the people in general. Thus the coming of the steam engine changed life, in England; the opening of the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal changed the course of commerce. The discovery of Petroleum and invention of vulcanized rubber completely revolutionized road transport.\n\nSimilarly a student of constitution studies the history of constitution. He could compare and contrast the various constitutions of the world, their historical bearing and the social forces that went to effect certain constitutional changes. Whatever may be the form of the Government, a student of constitution must have a competent knowledge of different constitutions to evaluate the constitution he is specializing in.\nThen take the history of literature. This is as vast as the political history. Each language of the world has its own history. This will deal with the progress of literary thought of the time as reflected in the writings of poets, dramatists, novelists and so on. This will help to appreciate the social history of a time because literature of that time may throw lucid light on the persons, manners, customs and the prevailing notions at that time. For example, if one studies Shakespeare he can easily appreciate Elizabethan England; so too if one studies Dickens one can have a clear idea about the England immediately after the Industrial Revolution. The 'Tales of Two Cities' for example, portrays France during the Revolution and the horrors of the guillotine can be vividly seen in the fate of Sydney Carton.\n\nThen there is the history of science. Perhaps many are not aware that science too has a charming history of its won. From the time man learnt to make fire till to date, the progress of science has been steady and in recent times it has been so fast that is has overstripped the grasp of ordinary man. There had been great giants of science whose names are a household word today. Which student of science does not know the name of Newton? One peculiarity about the history of science is, unlike the case of political history where conflicts and ruin are common, here it is one of construction still better knowledge of things and forces around man. The history of science is charming indeed. The importance of studying various histories can be appreciated."

        "title": "Why study history ? Is it perhaps to learn from past mistakes, to yearn for lost glory or for some other reason ?",
        "content": "What is history ? History is the story of men and women on the face of the earth at a particular period of time who played their part to make up something like a story. Individuals may influence the course of history, but history as such is the sum total of all the actions put together culminating in some shape which the historians conveniently call the period. History may be looked at as the story of the growth of a people or peoples. History may again reflect the interaction of human emotions ending up in a certain form of society. History may indicate how societies were formed and how they grew. If certain societies survive the onslaught of time while others disappear altogether, history helps understand the forces at work. In short we may not be far from right if we say that history traces the growth of human society.\n\nThen why study history ? The above mentioned ideas of history have the answer to this question. There have been periods in history which shows the rise and fall of societies, where great men and women play their part. Each country boasts of a certain golden era when a great personality, a king or queen or an Emperor had so much power that he was the centre of the picture. To know the picture is to know the person. Just to quote an example, take the period of Queen Elizabeth I in England. It was a period of expansion for England, it had its moments of glory, it saw the flourishing of art and so on. To know the period, we learn all about the life of the actors on the stage.\n\nIndividuals may influence the course of history. The great religious founders like the Buddha, Jesus Christ and Prophet Mohamed had influenced the course of history. Quite recently we know how the writings of Rousseau and Voltaire and others influenced the course of the French Revolution that was to follow. In recent times we know how the works of Marx and Engels brought about almost universal revolution and the course of which has not stopped. To know the growth of a people we read history. This is best illustrated by studying the History of the USA. How a few religious people who ran away from their mother country to avoid prosecution went in waves to colonize and almost a powerful country was born. Here one is easily aware of the accidents of history.\n\nHistory of the Industrial Revolution and the consequent labor movements and many other things which have been the off-shoots of the Revolution are very interesting to know.\n\nTo know the growth of societies, one must look into history. Thus a study of ancient societies throws light on how such societies were formed and grew. Some forces act as destructive ones, some forces act as incentives and some others go to consolidate the society. A classical example is Munroe which helped the uninhibited growth of USA for nearly a hundred years. History traces the growth of society. This seems to be a major idea today; the old insistence on dates, acquisition, battles and treaties have been relegated to the background.\n\nIt is said that history repeats itself. That means human nature being, it repeats the same mistake without learning from the past. If we know the past mistakes perhaps we could have avoided them. That is what the United Nations has been trying to do. Its predecessor the League of Nations had been built in weakness. But it cannot be said that the UNO is a completely revised version because one or two of the basic mistakes which the League of nations suffered from. It is a great pity that humanity cannot learn from the past mistakes.\n\nThe next proposition is whether the study of history is a yearning for past glory. To some extent this is true. In oriental countries which have been under colonial rule, they really look back for some glory. They cull it from the past art and literature and have a sense of fulfilment. The invention of printing has revolutionized the world of thought. The invention of the Mariner's compass has helped navigation to such a great extent that all the seas have come under the control of man. The invention of gun powder, the discovery of coal and petroleum, the invention of the motor car, and the splitting of the atom, almost all of them have changed the course of history. Now there are two great questions staring at the world; one is the atmospheric pollution and the other is the population explosion. Now that man has a knowledge of their presence and has the tools to tackle them; he can to some extent shape his future."

        "content": "There is more truth in the statement than what appears on the surface. When reformers are mentioned very often the names or pictures of social reformers come first to vision readily. But the pictures must include the great religious reformers as well.\n\nThese reformers had visions themselves before they could pass them on to society. They thought and worked out the reforms and preached them without fear or favor. They had a lot of suffering in the form of ostracism, privations and physical attacks. Still we could see they themselves were the schools where they practiced the reforms. The tremendous success of those reforms which they conceived and gave birth to is even in usage today.\n\nLet us take a few examples. We can start with the Buddha.. He was born a prince and was brought up a prince. But when he chanced to see the sufferings of life his heart melted with compassion. He relinquished his wife and child and went in search of `knowledge'. He found the truth and hence he became the 'Buddha'. He preached what he himself had lived through and thus a great part of the then known world came under the influence of Buddhism. The languages and climates were not a bar to the spread of Buddhism.\n\nThe next picture which comes to our mind is that of Lord Jesus Christ. He preached love, good neighborliness, service to the poor and the diseased and finally his surrender and the forgiveness he gave to the mankind. The Roman Government sentenced him to die for preaching. The personal example of Jesus is worthy of note.\n\nThink of Mahatma Gandi as the modem apostle of non-violence, though he himself had admitted that he was greatly influenced by Jesus Christ. An important weapon in his repertoire was Satyagraha or civil resistance. He learnt its importance while he was in South Africa. He suffered a lot form the hands of the Whites there but he put up with them very gallantly and upheld the standard of non violence. Even Smuts was converted to his way of thinking later on. When Gadhiji returned to India he used the some weapon of non-violence and Satyagraha against the British and was able to see that India got independence. The greatest thing in India was to uplift the untouchables. He gave them o noble name and called them the 'Harijans'. He proved himself what o great reformer he was. To the lost he stood for the Hindu-Muslim unity which cost him his life just like Jesus Christ.\n\nMartin Luther King, the Great American Block leader was influenced very much by the teaching of Gandhi and he practiced non-violence against the Whites. He was able to open the eyes of the American Government and like Gandhi he was tragically murdered. His mortal person may not be there but what he did for the American Blocks will stand for ever. What Martin Luther King did in our own times was attempted by Abraham Lincoln a century earlier.\n\nTurning to social reformers, Florence Nightingale or \"The Lady With The Lamp\" as she was popularly called, may he mentioned. During the Crimean war she did o great lot to lessen the sufferings of the soldiers at Scutari. Quite rightly she is recognized as the mother of modem nursing.\n\nThen the name of Dr. Schweitzer comes to the mind. He went to the heart of Africa and started his hospital for the Africans at Lamberene. It was gargantuan task which would hove broken even the bravest heart. But the great doctor looked upon it as a life's mission for him because life was so sacred.\n\nThere had been o number of less worthies but they too had spent their lives for the sake of reforms."

        "title": "Discuss the difficulties that arise from the existence of more than one language in a country",
        "content": "The essay implies there are real difficulties existing in a country where there are more than one language. The way out is not sought, so let us confine to the difficulties alone.\n\nThe first difficulty will arise regarding the court language or state language besides, of course, the language to be chosen of international communication. Each language may compete for the coveted post of becoming a court language. When may languages are spoken by different people in one country, to pick out one of them and say that is the state language will lead to conflict and more often then not as witnessed in some countries. The safest course would then be to have all the contending languages as court or state languages.\n\nThough this arrangement is possibly the best, it is wrought with practical difficulties, In the offices more forms will hove to be printed, more officials will have to be appointed, very often proficiency in more than one language will be insisted upon. In that case people who learn languages easily may get into the offices to the chagrin of others. Since all records will have to be in all languages, more paper work will be involved. Many useful hours will be spent in translation, though simultaneous translation has become practical with the advancement of technology.\n\nIn official business each language may claim superiority to the resentment of others. In legislatures such controversies may surface very often and this is detrimental to the unity of the country. Though simultaneous translation has obviated the difficulty today, still translation may not be correct because the idioms and nuances peculiar to o language will be lost in translation.\n\nPerhaps the greatest difficulty that may arise refers to what is called the linguistic minorities. In any area the people speaking different languages may not he of the order of percentage. The number of those speaking one language may out number those speaking another language and thus they claim numerical majority. Those who speak the minority language are looked down upon. Very often feelings get strained and there may flare up language riots. To keep the people speaking different languages under restraint and make them live amicably is difficult. What is called the linguistic chauvinism has not become a thing of the past.\n\nThe real difficulty will be with education. Any government or state cannot brush aside the claim of a section of her people to educate their children in their own mother tongue. That means more schools, more teachers and above all more text books in different languages. The question of language comes up in conducting public examinations, As many papers will have to be set up in different languages, this adds to the administrative burden.\n\nIn such a country the study of literature becomes hard, because each language may be having a good literature and unless due recognition is given to literature it may not grow. A practical difficulty will be felt in travel and communication. A person from one area of a predominant language will find it difficult to go and do business in another area having a different predominant language.\n\nWhen all these difficulties are viewed dispassionately one must agree there must be one national language. It is worthwhile to think of a national language. Purists may quarrel but the national language may absorb good words and idioms from other languages. This is a way out of language difficulties."

        "title": "Why is it that a play can tell a story in far fewer words than a novel ? Illustrate your answer with reference to particular plays and novels",
        "content": "The fundamental difference between a play and a novel is that in one the actors present themselves and act and speak what is en the play. In a novel except for the contrived conversations et is only a narration. The flesh and blood have to be supplied by the novelist to create an atmosphere. In a play emotions are almost seen (even while reading) but in a novel they are not specially displayed. In a play, the events are not isolated islands; one sees the direct link. In a novel one has to go about looking for the events. If a single illustration could help, it is like this; a play is like being at a shop and the novel is like going to a shop. The things are there in the one instance and in the other one has to visualize and wait to move. The play has a more direct appeal to our senses than the novel.\n\nThere is a famous lore in 'Julius Caesar'. The conspirators struck Caesar and among them was Brutus, the one time friend of Caesar. When Caesar saw Brutus striking him he said, 'Et tu Brute! Then falls Caesar'. He dies so saying. These sex words describe the whole world of relations between the two and the emotions involved. If it were to be a novel, the whole situation may require not six words but six pages. At the hands of say Scott, Hardy and others it would have taken even a whole chapter.\n\nAgain let us look at the pitiable Othello who had murdered his wife out of jealousy. Having killed her, he says en self pity, 'I have no wife'. Those who have been following the play thus far can easily understand Othello's mental torture. These words would be meaningless in a novel unless description followed as to how he wept, howled and tore his hair. The play shows the act but the novel only describes.\n\n'Oliver Twist' is a powerful novel indeed and Dickens has shown his deft hands there; but the same in the form of a play is more powerful. Just imagine the scene where Oliver asks for more. Dickens has, in fact made it more dramatic; but the scene in a drama can be shorter and more effective. The play allows you to visualize and almost you are a party there but it is different in the case of a novel.\n\nSatires, puns and jokes are more poignant in a play than in a novel. We enjoy a Falstaff, a Touchstone or a Jaques in their flesh and blood in the play. There is some identity and there is sympathy. In the play you are not told certain things but you are an unconscious actor, never so in the case of a novel.\n\nIn the novel the climax is worked out very quickly and one need not wait for hours to see the end coming. You sense it and is ready for the end to come. In the case of the novel the climax and the end are far apart. This can be seen in 'Hamlet', 'King Lear' or 'Macbeth'.\n\nIn a novel small things do not play any role at all as in the case of a play. A kerchief, a chain and a flower may be almost a character. Thus the kerchief plays a role in Othello, the chain in 'As You Like It'.\n\nComparison and contrasts are brought out efficiently in a play not so easily in the novel. Characters small and big are there to see side by side, one acting as a foil to another. Thus we find in Adam, the old servant of Orlando who is faithful and the treachery of Oliver.\n\nIn short, a play while it economizes on words can illuminate the characters much better than the characters in the novel. While a novel is like an intricate canvas with all its magnificence only an art critic can appreciate and comprehend. A play is like the laughter of a child or a tear in the eye of one's beloved which requires no explanation."

Suppose I am fortunate enough to win a lottery of millions of dollars, I will try to spend it in the most appropriate manner so as to derive the maximum pleasure out of it.\n\nMy colleagues advise me that at the very outset, I should endeavor to improve my lot. I should have a huge mansion to live in and a car for the family. But my idea of life is quite different. Rather than improving my lot, I am much more interested in uplifting the condition of the poor masses of the country.\n\nMy country is poor. There are people in my country who hardly get two square meals a day, what more to speak of enjoying the comforts and luxuries of life. They are semi-fed and semi-clad. Most of these people are living in villages, where the main occupation of the people is agriculture. I will offer them a loan at a very nominal interest to enable them to purchase tractors, fertilizers and better seeds. This scheme will save the villagers from the village money lender.\n\nI will invest a good portion of my money in constructing a hospital with all the modem amenities. I will employ highly qualified doctors. This hospital will be run free of charge for the poor masses. Charities will always be awaited from the rich classes. This will save people from the jaws of death.\n\nMany people, particularly in villages, have no means of recreation, I shall spend a part of my wealth to provide means of recreation for the Many people, particularly in villages, have no means of recreation, I shall spend a part of my wealth to provide means of recreation for the poor. I shall open various social and educational centers at various places.\n\nSince there is no adequate provision for the support of orphans and widows, I would, therefore, lose no time in opening new centers for widows and orphans. They will work and earn their livelihood honorably. This will certainly help in the cause of country's advancement.\n\nThere may be people who will jeer and mock at my utter foolishness of spending millions of dollars in this manner. Probably they do not realize that a man gets inner happiness in helping the poor, which is much more than the sensual pleasures that a man can get from the money he possesses. To spend money like this, will be my dearest hopes and aspirations."

        "title": "Memories of childhood",
        "content": "The memories of childhood have their own kind of nostalgia. With the passage of time, one feels more attached to this childhood, the best period of a man's life . A child has no worries, anxieties and no work. He is free from the dirty and filthy noises of the world. His motto of life remains: eat, drink and be merry. The charm of childhood cannot be forgotten. These memories have everlasting impression on one's life.\n\nWhen I recollect the days of my childhood, I feel very delighted over that pleasant period which I spent in high spirits. In my childhood I was carefree, having no worries at all. I used to wander like a deer in the open field and enjoyed the natural beauty in the gardens along with my other companions.\n\nCertain incidents are still fresh in my mind:- For instance, at the age of five, I got a severe attack of typhoid. In those days medical science was not so advanced, so in the absence of a proper diagnosis, I was reduced to a skeleton. After taking medicine for a long period, I was cured. The doctor advised me to go to some hill-station. So my father took me to the Cameron Highlands. Due to this attack in my early age, I became very weak and I still have not been able to recover my health.\n\nThe other incident was about a juggler who came with two monkeys. He exhibited a show with the monkeys. The male monkey fell in love with the female monkey. The female refused to marry the male. The male went to his father in-law's house -- the father-in-law was the juggler himself. After some persuasion the female agreed to many the male monkey. They were dressed up in a colorful costume for the ceremony which was performed by the juggler. The juggler and his show with the monkeys stand out in my memory.\n\nAnother thing which I still remember is my swimming accident. It was on a Sunday that I went with my friends for a picnic at Port Dickson. Some of us were expert swimmers but unfortunately I did not know much about swimming. My friends plunged into the sea in order to swim and persuaded me to do the same. Soon I was caught by the swift current in the water and was carried away. My scream of panic was heard by my friends who rescued me from drowning. I was really very grateful to them for saving my life.\n\nIt is this period of childhood which has been described by poets and writers. To recollect the past is to plunge ourselves in a state of nostalgia. Wordsworth, the immortal poet of England, and a great worshipper of nature, describes in his poems his childhood period, which, to him, was full of pleasant memories. I too miss those good old days which had flown by so quickly."

        "content": "Everyone in his life experiences some incidents good or bad. There may be the happiest, the saddest or the funniest incident in one's life.\n\nOne Sunday morning I received an invitation from a friend of mine Mr. Sudhir, as I had come from the U.K. back to my native land. I got up early in the morning and started preparing myself. My sister gave me a cup of tea early in the morning. Then I took my bath, and got ready. My sister then again asked me to take some snacks and tea but I refused to take as I was very anxious in getting to my friend's house. She kept insisting me to take a heavy breakfast but I did not care for it. I walked out to the Bus Stop. Soon a bus came and I got into it and asked the conductor for a ticket for Babar Lane. The conductor frowned at me saying \"This bus is not going to Babar Lane. It s going in the reverse direction, you can get down at the next stop and catch another bus.\" I was baffled for some time at this sudden bit of information. Then I alighted from the bus and again waited for the next bus for Babar Lane.\n\nI boarded the bus and reached 15, Babar Lane. But when approached my friend's house, the door of his house was all locked up and closed. I was wondering whether I had come to the right place. As I was gazing and pondering, a neighbor of my friend came and asked me, \"Why are you standing here? Do you want to meet someone?\" I replied. \"Yes, I want to see Mr. Sudhir living in Quarter No. 15\". He replied \"He has moved house on Wednesday and has gone to Changi.\"\n\nFrustratedly, I came back to the bus stop. I was feeling thirsty and hungry. Soon it started drizzling. I was now in a fix as I had no umbrella. My confusion became worse with the pouring rains. I thought for a while that I had refused my morning breakfast in the hope that I would take it at my friend's house. At this stage my anger was mounting. I was cursing myself as well as my fate, I was soaking wet and instead of going home, I made up my mind to meet Sudhir, come what may.\n\nAn idea hit me. I telephoned the Enquiry Office at Changi. The operator told me his address. So I made my journey to Changi. I reached the Address given to me by the operator. I rang the door bell. Tapan, a tiny tot (Sudhir's youngest brother) came out and greeted me with a \"Hello, uncle.\" The moment I entered the drawing room, I saw the parents of Sudhir sitting on the sofa. They offered me a seat and I sat between them. As I was going to ask about the invitation extended to me by Sudhir, Dolly (Sudhir's sister) came with a tray of tea. She was a pretty and vivacious girl. I remembered that I used to love Dolly during college days and had written to her many love letters, proposing marriage. Now Sudhir's mother began to talk very politely. \"Look son, the invitation to tea was a joke, as you know today is the First of April\" But you are fortunate in the sense that your proposal of marriage has been accepted by all the members of the family.\" I was thrilled to hear this news from Dolly's mother.\nMy joy knew no bounds. My spirit felt lifted. Dolly was looking at me silently, her eyes expressing her love for me. We had tea to our heart's content. I rushed home to give the glad news to my parents. This day, indeed, is the most funniest and happiest day in my life."

        "title": "Are scientific inventions making us happier ?",
        "content": "One of the most popular questions which is often asked is: \"Are scientific inventions making us happier ?\"\n\nScience today has given us such comforts as were unimaginable years ago. Today we switch on the radio and listen to music, We have electricity, telephones, televisions, washing machines, refrigerators, air-conditioning plants and a host of other gadgets. All these things have made the life of man very easy and comfortable. The flush-lavatories, shower-baths, electric fans, cinemas, cars, trams and \"planes\" are among other scientific inventions which have increased the ease and happiness of, mankind.\n\nScience has made traveling easy and efficient. The world has become small for us. But those exciting adventures and romances which traveling gave us in the past have all disappeared. Modem traveling is a dull business.\n\nPeople who live in big cities like New York or London have benefited in some ways and lost in many other ways. The city people do not have any leisure. Their life is so busy and mechanical that they do not have any time \"to stand and stare\" as well as to see and appreciate the beauties of nature. Their lives have become artificial, devoid of charm and delight.\n\nModern age is an age of science. As science is advancing it is at the same time thwarting our civilization. In the world of science, the words love, emotion and sentiments are quite foreign. So what is the use of science to man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul ? Spiritualism is on the wane while materialism is on the increase. Philosophy, culture and love are rapidly fading from the surface of the earth because of the advancement of science.\n\nOn the destructive side, science has invented weapons which are dreadful and disastrous. The invention of U-boats, Rockets, Atom Bombs, Hydrogen Bombs and other harmful nuclear devices have increased the chances of human destruction. Thus, if these weapons of science are misused. they would spell disaster for entire mankind. This is the peak of scientific civilization.\n\nThus the opinion generally remains divided on the above subject. No one can claim that science is beneficial or a complete curse. While a scientist makes inventions, a politician misuses them. Mainly, it is this wrong application of scientific inventions by the politician which has brought humanity to a bad state. In this respect science has dehumanized us. Nowadays we have better drugs and surgical instruments but men are becoming weak constitutionally. What an irony of fate it is ? Today, we have a sensitive 'heart', a sensitive 'lung' and a sensitive liver' due to fast speed, smoky atmosphere and dusty roads. Thus science, while it makes mankind happy by its latest achievements, also makes it unhappy when it shows its destructive power. But, broadly speaking, science can be used for happiness but the mad mind of the man and particularly of the politician misusing the discoveries of science, makes us unhappy."

        "content": "Dreams are the products of our subconscious state of mind. Dreams are of many kinds. But the dream which I had last Saturday was the most interesting I have ever had. I was transported into a fairy land where beautiful fairies were dancing and singing.\n\nI dreamt that I had gone to Paris. There I went into night club and saw many exciting happenings. Twist, Ballroom and Shake dances were going on in full swing with the music blaring away. As I was watching the spectacle of dance and drama, a beautiful girl gazed upon me. I was attracted by her rosy cheeks, alluring eyes and sweet smile on her face. I at once recollected the famous poem by Keats known as \"La Belle Dame Sans Merci\". Her silent expressions of love enthralled me. I was really captivated by her charm and sweetness. She was really communicating with me with her silent expressions of love and her eyes. I thought I must respond to her facial and other expressions.\n\nI walked up to her, introduced myself and talked to her. She also passed very lovely and witty remarks. We then both took our cup of coffee, while sipping our coffee we had a long talk to our heart's content. At the same time I was remembering and recollecting the eternal lines of Shakespeare:\n\nLove is not love that alters\n\nWhen it finds alterations;\n\nOr bends with the remover to remove,\n\nNow I was in two minds. Whether her love was true or false. But I tried to be true to her. I sincerely expressed my love to her in the most unambiguous terms. We ultimately promised to marry and live as life long companions.\n\nSoon the dance and music came to a close. With that she got up and went somewhere, saying that she would be returning soon.\n\nBut she did not turn up. I was repenting for falling in love. I was thinking that I had been betrayed by this girl who had deceived me. As I was pondering over this heart-stricken subject, my eyes opened but my mind was still groggy. I thought I was in Paris but to my surprise I found myself still in Kuala Lumpur.\nIn this dream I have come across a woman who has been well described by John Keats in his profound poem \"La Belle Dame Sans Merci\" i.e. \"The Beautiful Woman Without Mercy\"."

        "content": "This world is full of many wonderful and lovely things. Man is trying to utilize the maximum resources of his intellect for finding out various types of inventions and discoveries and thus endeavoring to make the things more lovely and worth enjoying. The process of beautifying the world is a continuous process. There is no end to it. Since there are many beautiful and lovely things, it becomes very difficult to pick and choose. Somehow, with great care, I have selected five things I would like to adopt in my future life.\n\nFirstly, I love nature. I am fed up of this artificial and momentary pleasure which we derive from the city. I would like to settle in some village where I would be able to enjoy nature. Nature can be a true friend and guide for man. Wordsworth, the great lover of Nature, has also acknowledged this fact in his poems. I am very anxious to go and enjoy the scenery of steep hills; greenery of the own valleys, cool breeze and other natural things. There I would find people who will be quite different in nature from the city dwellers. Their motto of life is \"simple living and spiritual thoughts\" Thus I will have the privilege of coming in contact with simple and straight forward people.\n\nSecondly, I would like to take up teaching as my career. I am deeply pained to find illiteracy in my country. For the successful functioning of Democracy, it is essential that we reduce illiteracy to the minimum. I want every young man and woman to get educated. There is a dire need for spreading education to every nook and corner of the country. I hope that by selecting this profession, I would be serving my country in the most appropriate way.\n\nThirdly, I am a keen and voracious reader. Reading novels is my favorite pastime. Reading widens the door of knowledge. They give us an insight into this world. Sometimes we are able to resolve many difficult problems by reading. We are able to chalk out many schemes which can be useful in our day-to-day life.\n\nFourthly, I love my country. I can forego anything just for the honor of my country. If somebody were to ask me to go to a foreign land and serve there, and get a handsome salary I will be the first to bluntly refuse this offer. I am very fond of the way of life, food and sunshine of my country. If I were to go to a foreign country for employment, I would not be doing justice to my Motherland.\n\nThe last but not the least, I love my home sweet home, The saying \"East or West, home is the best\" is correct. I live in a small house which does not contain all the modem amenities, but still it is not less than a paradise. I have been to my friend's houses where I find ultra modern decorations and lavish furnishing. I do not like this type of artificial life or home.\n\nThe selected items above are the five things which I hold dearest to my heart and are the very essence of my being."

        "content": "Before actually assessing the danger as contemplated let us first of all know about the certain premises raised here. To begin with let us be clear about an industrial society. In such a society for all his needs man look to the machines which symbolize the industrialized society. Many of the things would have been automated, for example, the sorting of eggs or the baking of bread. In such and many other cases man may be working but he is only a cog in the wheel. Everything is on a mass scale; everything follows a system; everything is made to order. The USA and most of the West European countries come under this category. Japan is the Eastern nation which is highly industrialized.\n\nFor all their industries, all these societies use many raw materials. They may be forest products, the fossil fuels, or the ores from the bowels of the earth. Their quantity is limited and the way the industrialized societies are exhausting them, create the fear that stock may be exhausted sooner or later.\n\nFor instance, forests are being denuded in many countries for the manufacture of paper and furniture. It is easier to fell hundreds of trees a day than to grow one. But the demand for paper is growing very fast that unless some alternative to wood is found in forest based industries, there may not be enough paper.\n\nSo too with fossil fuels whether it be oil or coal or natural gas. The way they are being used has led to the speculation that there may not be any petroleum by the turn of this century. Perhaps the stock of coal may last a few decades more. Anyway in the case of coal the stock is only limited and not inexhaustible. If forests take only decades to come up the fossil fuels require geological ages to form and unlike trees they cannot be made to order.\n\nThen there are other minerals especially ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Some of the metals are in abundance while others are scarce. After all mines are not milch cows and even milch cows would become dry and old.\n\nBut by the middle of the next century things may not be gloomy after all. Science and ingenuity of man will work together to find a way out of the impasse. Newer materials, newer processes and recycling may have the answer. Already we are having a taste of what may come. Look at the man made fibers and plastics. A few decades ago none would ever have thought of them but now there is none who does not use them. In fact they are made from things which were considered useless or which were going to waste.\n\nWith the advent of television and other still more sophisticated methods of communication, the need for a big bulk of paper, may be reduced. Instead of writing letters, they may be tape recorded. Instead of books we may have microfilms of books.\n\nRecycling has a great promise. Since matter is indestructibly, one useless stuff can be converted into something really useful. Nature does it in fact as in the case of photosynthesis or keeping the nitrogen cycle going. After man has set his foot on the moon, a lot of thinking has gone into recycling. So we may think of a day soon when there will be not waste material. By changing the constitution of materials they may be made to do wonderful work. An example is fiber glass which has the strength of steel. Then there is the sea floor which has not been exploited as much as land. Remember three fourths of the earth is sea.\n\nMan is the only animal who can take the challenge and if previous history has anything to teach, it shows that man has stupendous and fantastic capacity to survive."

In fact, as long as my memory stretches, I have been spending my weekend in this rather unexciting manner until last weekend.\nThat weekend, I was in Karim's house and was introduced to is cousin Jamal. The latter hails from Kelantan and very vivacious personality. He was full of energy, enthusiasms and a bit of a dare-devil, as they say. I took an immediate liking to him. Upon hearing of our boring weekends playing football and later adjourning to our favorite mamak stall for a late night supper, Jamal suggested e do something different. he is an accomplished trekker as well as a hiker. When he found out about the Air Hitam hill, famous among trekkers, which ahs tracks that reach right up to the summit, he virtually harassed us to accompany him. Both Karim and I are basically couch potatoes and have no enthusiasm for such a sport. But we did not want to disappoint Jamal and reluctantly agreed to go hiking with him.\n\nBut it turned out to be the most interesting weekend I ever had. i did not live to regret it ! It was a Sunday and the three of us were dressed in our hiking attires, much to the surprise and amusement of Karim's parents. we told them that their perspective of us as lazy bones and unadventurous would change forever. They smiled indulgently. we packed a few bottles of mineral water and some sandwiches.\n\nThe famous Air Hitam trekking area was fantastic ! There were many joggers and fitness buffs as well as tourists who converge there every day. There were clear racks that would enable trekkers to reach the summit without getting lost. In fact, at certain points, there are stalls and rest areas where one can even sit down for a light meal and drink. we did not make any stop as we were determined to reach the summit. The mountain was not too high and thankfully the dry weather had ensured the tracks were not slippery. we saw many exotic birds and other creatures along the way, even snakes. Thankfully, we had brought a long stick and a can of pepper spray in case we were attacked by wild animals. We didn't need to worry. No wild creatures tried to attack us nor were here any encounters with slithery creatures ! We also feasted our eyes on beautiful and strange looking flowering plants and even picked some flowers for Karim's mother.\n\nWe reached the summit two hours later. The scene was simply breathtaking ! It was covered with light frost and the weather was rather chilly. But we were sweating and actually enjoyed the cool air. Famished, we gobbled our sandwiches. they never tasted better. After relaxing for about 20 minutes, we made our long way down tot he foot of the mountain.\n\nIt truly had been an interesting as well as exciting weekend. Karim and I vowed to go trekking every weekend to keep our body fit and our mind refreshed."

It is the birthday of Jesus Christ that Christians celebrate on December 25th and the occasion is, therefore, a very joyous one.\nThis particular Christmas celebrations is in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Smiths who are Christians living in Malaysia. They have been in the Far East for ten years now and the rubber plantation and Mrs. Smith have invited all their friends, Europeans as well as Malaysians to their Christmas Party.\n\nThe house is gaily decorated. Outside, over the doors green leaves are entwined. Traditionally the evergreen leaf is used : holly, fir and pine but these cannot be found in Malaysia. Inside, too, all is very gay and bright. Red paper 'chains' or garlands are festooned the electric fans which would cut them down. Colorful vases of flowers and little bowls of fruit and nuts are placed on every table. In the far corner of the room is a Christmas tree, the idea of which originally came from Germany. This tree, standing in a bright red tub, is a local fir and it is decorated with silver tinsel, miniature crackers, glass balls of many different colors and little pieces of cotton wool tied on to represent the snow found in the cold countries in winter. On the top, looking down on the tree with its myriads of tiny fairy lights is a Christmas star -- shining and silvery as the star in Bethlehem shone once so long ago. Around the red tub at the bottom are many parcels tied up with bright Christmas wrapping papers and cheerful silver strings. A festoon of gaily colored balloons hang from the lights and in a far corner is a piece of mistletoe, artificially made.\n\nThe Smiths are welcoming their guests : the Browns, the Jones, the Ah Lims and Ah Chuas. Many friends are arriving by car or on foot. All are in gay party clothes and all bring presents since Christmas is the time for giving. There are many children here with laughing, smiling faces for Christmas is a child's festival. Eagerly they rush to the gifts at the base of the Christmas tree but they are told to wait because the celebration meal must come first.\n\nThe dining room table is as attractive as the sitting room. The guests eat the Christmas food which is eaten everywhere in the world on Christmas day : a huge, golden brown turkey, surrounded by potatoes stuffed with chestnuts : a 'plum pudding' made with rich fruits, butter and sugar; its top alight with burning brandy and then, if there is room minced pies, nuts, fruits and sweets for the children. Wine is drunk and there are speeches wishing everyone 'a happy Christmas'.\n\nThe children have waited long enough for their presents and there is a gift for everyone : a doll for Ah Lim's baby, a handbag of Mrs. Jones, a book for Ah Chua who reads all the time. Laughter and thanks fill the room as guests and hosts open the presents they have been given.\n\nThe younger people begin to dance and the sounds of the latest 'pop' and 'beat' groups fill the air. The younger children play with their new toys and shrieks of joy and delight mingle with the music. The older people rest, chatting quietly. The men walk out into the evening air now stealing darkly over the silent columns of rubber trees. The sky overhead is bright with stars. As they stand in the still, tropical, hot night some of them will have thoughts of the countries beyond the seas where they were born and lived as children. some will have thoughts of the Christmas in Palestine nearly two thousand years ago. But all of them will have thoughts of this particular Christmas in Malaysia and, as they turn to wander back to the house the sounds of carols wing through the air because the young people have taken off the dance records and they are now joyfully singing the words of one of the most beautiful Christmas songs :-\n\n'Hark the herald angels sing\n\nGlory tot he new born King.\""

        "content": "Assuming that the writer is a student and not a collector, there are three main principles to observe in the formation of a personal library.\nThere are :-\n\n1. Books are for use, not decoration ! A knowledgeable collector will have many fine editions, but it is quite useless merely to buy books for the sake for their cost or expensive printing and binding.\n\n2. Do not collect books for the sake of doing so, otherwise they will clutter your shelves and mostly remain unread.\n\n3. Buy nothing second-rate, but rather buy cheap editions of good works, many of which are available in paper-back form nowadays.\n\nThe private reader's library should be divisible into four main categories; reference, special subjects, hobbies and games and novels.\n\nIt is true that any good library contains all the encyclopedias and reference books you need. So why go to the expense of buying them ? Al the same, a student cannot always work in a library, neither can he visit one every time he wants to look up a reference, so it is advisable to have one or two key  tomes on your shelves. These will vary slightly according to your special subjects. If you are an English language and literature student, you would profit from getting the following small reference section together :-\n\nOxford Companion to English Literature.\n\nOxford Book of English Verse.\n\nOxford Book of English Prose.\n\nGurney-Benham's Dictionary of Quotations.\n\nConcise Oxford Dictionary.\n\nBrewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\n\nThe bulk of your library should consist of books on your special subject(s).\n\nThe basic textbooks are essential and bought or borrowed as a matter of routine, so your own library should consist of standard 'background' books. These will enable you to keep a true perspective in your subject and also help you in the understanding of the set books. A student of 20th Century European history would probably want to collect Sir Winston Churchill's war books and the memoirs of some of the great generals and statesmen. But he would beware of 'historical fiction', especially the romantic type !\n\nVery few of us have no hobby, game or 'outside interest', and there is a great variety of books in the market written to help us carry out these various activities better. They are generally cheap, an form an attractive addition to the personal library.\n\nToday, many people collect 'paperbacks' by the dozen, novels and novelettes, to be given or thrown away as soon as read. there is no harm in this form of relaxation, provided it does not supersede the reading of good fiction and study in general. Most paperbacks are not worth keeping in a personal library. The simple test is 'shall I ever want to read this book again'. If so, keep the book, but the answer is generally no ! Good novels, however, especially those of social importance or significance, form an essential apart of a well-balanced selection of books."

        "title": "The qualities of an ideal citizen",
        "content": "The qualities of an ideal citizen have never really varied since the earliest days of civilization. What has varied is the emphasis on some t the expense of others, due to factors of time, place and period. Until the recent emancipation of women, the latter were regarded more as servants than citizens, but today, they have equal rights, and therefore, equal responsibilities. Among by-gone societies, the emphasis has been placed on religion, and today still is in some communities, though democracy and religious freedom seem to together. Primitive societies, such as the Native Americans, used to place a premium on physical courage; Indian society in India, on obedience within the caste; British society, respect for class, and so, on. But today, we think in terms of the type of individual, whether male of female, who is of the greatest potential value in a modern, progressive and democratic community. This being so, and, for example, Malaysia being considered, we can broadly classify the qualities of the ideal citizen into four areas of responsibility; the citizen's responsibility to himself, to his family, to his community, and to his nation.\nFirst of all, the ideal citizen is a religious man, of whatever religion or denomination he may be. All world religions emphasize duty to God, to one's neighbor and to oneself. in the last analysis, the only real reason for displaying good qualities, when it is often natural to display bad ones, is that it is God's will that we should. The danger of religion is bigotry; only false religious observance can result in riots, political and personal hatreds, or the by-gone excesses of the Spanish Inquisition. Secondly, the citizen has three basic duties to him or herself. The first is to acquire the best possible education, not necessarily for employment purposes only, but also that a positive contribution may be made to the community. Even basic literacy enables a villager to write to his local council about a social problem, or to express a political view, in a letter to the newspaper of unselfishness and self-control, if only for the reason that such a person's actions and views are respected. Of not least importance is the ability to work hard and intelligently. Hard work has a good formative value on character as well as being the essential ingredient in personal success.\n\nSo far, we have looked at man or woman as individuals, but we must next see him in family life. Almost all societies see the family as the basic unit in their own structure and do everything possible to uphold it. The ideal citizen is a family citizen. He and his wife are nurtured by the family relationships, and their responsibilities should bring out the best in them. Their children, if carefully brought up, will be a future asset to the community. Their home should be a happy and free place, but guarded by mutual respect, courtesy and consideration, qualities which will be carried thence into the outside world.\n\nAn ideal citizen's third major quality must be respect for the law of the land in which he lives. Democracy is based on the rule of law but can only be maintained, provided there is a vast majority of law-abiding citizens. All forms of law-breaking and delinquency must be shunned, and the real training for this comes far more from the home than from the school. If children know their parents are honest, and demand honesty of them, they are more likely to grow up honest themselves. But responsibility does not end here. Hospitality and good-neighborliness, virtues typical of the East, are essential contributions to happy community life, in city as well as in village; wealth, however desirable, should never be pushed at the expense of outside kindness and generosity. An additional quality found n good citizens, is the desire to improve the life of the local community. This can involve a variety of contributions, from voluntary social work to sitting as a magistrate.\n\nFinally, the ideal citizen has an undoubted responsibility to his country. Whatever his views on war, in peace, he accepts the protection of the armed forces and the police. Given a just cause, and no alternative to war, he should, therefore, be ready to fight in his country's defense, though personally, he will shun war as a means of settling international disputes.\n\nSuch then is a good Malaysian, a good Singaporean, a good Briton, or a good American. Nobody ever achieves the ideal, but the world would become a far better place, if more people tried."

        "content": "The subject I like most is mathematics which embraces geometry and algebra as well as arithmetic, and now that I have started advanced work, calculus and trigonometry are included as well.\nThere are three reasons why I like this subject most. The first one, that the master is patient, likeable and thoroughly able, may not seem significant to adults, but to young learner, is an important factor. Throughout my school life Mr. Lee, my teacher has shown patience and clarity of mind. Areas, cubes, Lowest Common Denominations and Highest Common Factors were all explained and explained again, if need be, until even the slowest understood. The intricacies of Algebra from the simplest example : if 3x = 9, then x=3 right up to the most complicated quadratic equations, were all made simple and stimulating, as he stood before the blackboard with his chalk clearly defining the figures and symbols. The problems of geometry were equally clarified with his neat circles, isosceles and equilateral triangles drawn on the blackboard. And now as I study the advanced course under his experiences guidance, sines, cosines and velocities present no difficulties or mysteries.\n\nThe second reason for liking mathematics is that I believe, it will be a most useful subject for me after I leave school. A knowledge of mathematics is required for all advanced courses in technology, engineering, and scientific research. Many departments of industry, rely to a certain extent on the mathematician and his experience. So, if I can qualify and obtain a good degree in this subject, the choice of jobs afterwards will be varied indeed.\n\nFinally, for the real lover of mathematics there is a satisfaction and a reward in the mere solving of a problem. To someone who hates it and is bewildered by this subject, this is hard to explain, but those who really love figures will understand. There is an impersonal triumph and pride which never varies in a mathematician's heart, whether he has just discovered the simplest value of the unknown quantity x or the area of an uncomplicated triangle or whether he is unraveling the mysteries of determinants and exponential functions. For the lover of mathematics, it is the infinite satisfaction of adding two and two and making four."

        "content": "If I am able to pass the necessary examinations to go to a University, I would like to read law and afterwards spend two years in an office training to be a solicitor.\nThere are several reasons for my choice. Firstly, I want to read law, because it is a subject which has always interested me. In many ways it is similar to History which I have always liked at school. For a law degree, laws made by man right back to Roman times have to be studied. A slight knowledge of Latin is also required and this, too, is a subject which I like.\n\nSecondly, as a fully qualified solicitor, there would be a great variety of jobs available to me. There are always vacancies for young solicitors in general practice. Many Government departments employ solicitors as town clerks and legal advisers. There are a great many openings in industry too. Most large firms have legal departments to advise on patents, copyrights and general legal procedure.\n\nIn these days of high prices and high cost of living, most of us wish to earn as much money as we can, to provide the good things of life for ourselves and our families. We also want to educate our children in the best possible way. All this needs money, which, as a solicitor in any of the different spheres open to me, I could easily earn. we rarely see a poor solicitor, because the law is not subject to slumps or declining trade or things of that kind. As long as there are people, there will be a need for lawyers, to settle differences, to make wills, to draw up housing contracts, to protect the innocent and to punish the guilty. Therefore, as a solicitor, I would have a secure and well-paid job.\n\nFinally, in whatever branch of the law I work, I shall always be in contact with people and their fascinating human problems. To be with books or figures or machines, all day long would, for me, be very dull and monotonous, because I want to work with and for human beings. As a solicitor, I would be able to do this."

        "content": "Ever since I was very young and saw perhaps a child cut and bleeding or an old woman suffering from an incurable disease, I have always hated pain and the human suffering that it causes. It has, therefore, always been my ambition to become a doctor and to be able to cure diseases and to ease pain. Many count riches, power and glory among their ambitions, but for me, to serve humanity through medicine is the highest ambition of all.\nThe training is long and expensive and I shall need to work very hard. After passing the right examinations in school. I shall then need to take a University examination, which will enable me to enter the medical school, which is part of our University life in Singapore.\n\nAt University, there will be many lectures to attend. Physiology and Anatomy are two of the most important subjects during the first year. The different organs of the body such as the heart, the kidneys and the liver, together with their functions and disorders have to be studied. As well as this, there will be lectures on the many different diseases to which man is subject, with the various ways of diagnosing them and dealing with them. Lectures are given by highly qualified specialists.\n\nAs well as this theoretical work, there will be a practical course during the five years training. A new medical student has to begin by 'walking the wards' in a hospital. He accompanies doctors in charge of patients and watches what they do. He has to study patients being examined and listen tot he conclusions reached. he has intricate operations being performed by skilled surgeons. He had to make his own reports from his own diagnoses, at the same time, as the qualified doctor. All of these are checked and corrected, so that the student can learn from his mistakes. When he has passed this practical course, which lasts for about four years, he is then called a 'House man'.\n\nWritten examinations are taken at different stages. At the end of the first year, there is the first M.B. This is the first part of a Bachelor of Medicine degree and is a very difficult hurdle. Many students fail it. Then, there is the second M.B. and at the end 'finals' which include both a written, and oral and a practical examination. When 'finals' are safely behind me, I will really by a qualified doctor and be able to add this style to my name.\n\nIt will then be my ambition to obtain a grant from the authorities to travel abroad for further studies and I would like to go to Australia to do this. At a post-graduate course there, I would be able to study different methods, to see new techniques and to obtain even higher qualifications like a Doctor of Medicine degree.\n\nFinally, I would return to Malaysia where I want to work as an assistant medical officer in one of our busiest cities. There, I would gain more practical experience than I ever could in a small village. All types of illness would, among a large population, most certainly come my way. The ailments of children, of young mothers and of the very old could all be studied. I would learn to recognize an appendicitis of tonsillitis very quickly. In a very large city, it is not always possible to have the services of a gynaecologist and so I would have practice in delivering babies myself.\n\nDuring this time, I would try to save money. Doctors are rightly well-paid and I would live moderately. After some years, therefore, I hope to be not only experienced as a general practitioner, but also comfortably rich as well.\n\nFinally, then I would realize my ultimate ambition, which is to do the medical practice in my own village and to return here. I have never had any desire to specialize and to become a pathologist, a surgeon, a gynecologist or an ear, nose and throat specialist. To be a good general practitioner here, in my own home is the end of my dream and, although not a specialist in any particular sphere, I shall know enough to deal with the common ailments of life and to call in the right specialists a once if they are needed. I shall then be able to serve the village I love so well."

        "content": "In the \"Time Machine\" we have a contrivance that H.G.. Wells imagined would enable its owner to travel up and down the corridors of time, jumping from one age to another, witnessing perhaps one event of history on one occasion, meeting a hero of the past or another. If, I had such  wonderful machine, I would use it to meet these three fascinating characters from history : Alexander the Great, William Shakespeare and Mahatma Gandhi.\nPicture to yourself a vista of rugged, rocky mountains whose inhabitants have been made hardy by their environment. in a city among these Macedonian highlands, a wedding east was held or two thousands years ago. Philip, the king was celebrating his daughter's marriage. The occasion was, however, marked by tragedy. In the midst of the revelries, Philip was assassinated.\n\nPhilips' place was taken over not without a struggle -- by his son Alexander. The latter was determined to carry on his father's work of conquest. Phillip had unified Greece. he had welded all the various, loosely-knit Greek armies into powerful fighting force. Alexander was to use this force to conquer the world.\n\nWithin two years of his father's death, Alexander was on the march. In eleven years, he had won for Greece, the mighty Persian Empire, conquered Egypt and led his armies to the banks of the Indus. on his way back to Greece with his armies, Alexander contracted a fever in Babylon, and died. The fragmentation of Alexander's empire followed swiftly on the conqueror's death -- testifying to the extraordinary personality of the one man who could hold such vast and various territories in unity.\n\nThe greatness of Alexander lay in his tremendous vision of world unity -- unity under the influence of Greek arms, but primarily under the influence of Greek language, Greek thought, Greek culture. Alexander deliberately tried to make West and East one. He adopted Persian symbols of grand kingship, trained Persian officials for entry into administrative offices, encouraged inter-marriage between Greeks and Easterners, and tried to establish commerce on an international scale by facilitating communications between the Nile, the Tigris, and the Indus on the one side, and the Mediterranean on the other.\n\nAlexander's work was cut short by his death. History shows us that until today, men have continually striven to establish world unity. If Alexander has failed, none others have so far succeeded after him.\n\nHowever divided men may be , the desire for entertainment knows no boundaries. Russian ballet troupes have performed in England, and American symphony orchestras have traveled the east. A few years ago, a Chinese film was played to capacity houses in Singapore and its run lasted some months -- a record for this city. The film was based on Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet.\" Its popularity should not be surprising. Shakespeare commands an audience anywhere. That his plays are acclaimed with enthusiasm, both beyond the bamboo and beyond the iron curtains, is a comforting indication of a universal instinct in man.\n\nShakespeare's themes are universal. This striking quality of his success is an inspiration to those who feel too conscious of their literary shortcomings because of a lack of higher education. Shakespeare came skimpily through a grammar school -- what there was of it at that time. In dramatic lusture, his plays outshone those of the so-called \"University Wits\" of his day.\n\nShakespeare probably saw that there was no substitute for real hard work. He pitted strenuous labor and skilled enterprise against the academic training of his theater rivals. when Shakespeare was not engaged in touching up old plays or writing new ones, he found himself producing them or acting them or seeing to the business management of a theater or of a theatrical troupe. Shakespeare won popularity through hard work at giving the people what they wanted -- entertainment; at the same time, he confirmed his successes by giving his audiences what was wholesome and thought-provoking. To entertain and to teach was Shakespeare's aim : he was not unconscious of his social environment. Shakespeare's comedies still make us laugh at human follies; his tragedies show how human weakness may lead to disaster. in all cases, his stories leave us with a sense of satisfaction and peace.\n\nIt is a far cry from Shakespeare to Gandhi-ji. But India's humble saint knew Shakespeare well and admired him. Shakespeare would have reciprocated Gandhi's sentiments, if he could have met him. Gandhi's life amply illustrates the importance of peace and a balanced outlook in life. A fighter in the campaign to bring peace and justice in human relations to India. Gandhi's weapons were not the bomb and the bullet, but peaceful though determined resistance to arrogant and deluded men. He fought against man's inhumanity to man. He laid down his life in the struggle. No greater love could any other man show for the principles Gandhi held so dear.\n\nGandhi's example bore fruit -- even with his death. India, today plays a leading role in attempting, on a firm basis of reason and negotiation, to secure peace between contending factions in the world today. There is not other figure in modern times, which has given mankind such an example of humility, patience and charity in the practical business of day-to-day living as Gandhi's had. Millions in India have become disciples of peace and advocates of considerate living through the example precept of the great Gandhi. Gandhi's good teaching transcends the boundaries of religion and the barriers of race. All may learn from Gandhi. If his principles, which are simply the practical reiteration of the principles of the great world religions, are not accepted by the world's great men, then civilization is certainly facing a bleak prospect. An irrefutable conclusion is that civilization has to learn such lessons as Gandhi taught.\n\nAlexander dreamed of world unity; Shakespeare appealed universally to the hearts of men; Gandhi showed how right thought and good feeling may be translated into common action. With such tutors, the lesson can surely be learnt."

        "title": "What makes a happy life ?",
        "content": "Every one of us wants a happy life, but no two of us want exactly the same things, so, it is not easy to lay down hard and fast rules. A great deal depends on the gifts and the temperament born in us. Some need no human companionship and would therefore be happy as hermits or recluses, or following an isolated occupation in remote place, while others need family and friends around them. Some are cut out for adventure, while others are happier in mundane pursuits. Some desire power or prestige, while others can only be satisfied by a vocation, such as the medical profession. It is therefore impossible to do more than generalize about the conditions which make for happiness. but one thing is certain; happiness has little to do with the possession or lack of material things -- it belongs to the mind, and its secret is the discovery of contentment and the gift of making the best of what is available.\nThe basic, if unrealized pre-requisite of happiness is the good fortune to live in a free, settled and well-governed community. Bad government, the restriction of freedom, the incidence of crime and violence and the absence of the rule of the law-all these make for unsettled and therefore unhappy living. Security, justice, fair taxation, police protection, and a progressive community life lay the foundations of the happiness of the individual.\n\nThe importance in happiness of having the right job cannot be over-emphasized. Those who are condemned to dull, blind-alley, insecure jobs are never really happy. Preferably, the job will be a selected one, requiring a training, and offering progress to a position of responsibility rather than an occupation taken, because there is no choice. When this amounts to a 'vocation' -- so much the better; at least the bulk of the main's or the woman's working hours will be happily filled. Women's lives, except in the sphere of paid employment, tend to run along different lines, but he main considerations, none the less, apply. It might be added that most women want a good home, children, and a kind and loving husband.\n\nThis leads to the setting of a happy life, which for most people is the home and the married state. A good wife or husband makes the other partner feel 'wanted,' gives him or her added incentive to work harder and gain some success. Such a setting is a great source of encouragement, as well as a sound defense against loneliness and the harshness and indifference of the outside world. Where marriage is not possible, at least a community life is available through clubs and societies. This helps to provide enjoyable leisure activities of various kinds.\n\nMoney may be the 'root of all evil', but in the modern world, it is impossible to live happily without it. That is not to say there is any relation between happiness and material things -- there isn't; but lack of money brings hardship, hunger and ugliness into life. Perhaps, the guiding principle is to earn enough to cover all reasonable needs, provide leisure activities, and pay for emergencies and holidays, and after this, not to worry too much about money.\n\nGood health is of great importance. Healthy people do not realize how priceless is their possession, until they fall ill -- it is the key to all enjoyment, and its loss means that every other pleasure is affected. There are those, who, through religion and philosophy achieve happiness in the midst of pain. But such achievement is beyond the powers of most of us. If we begin with good health, we should show or gratitude by doing all we can to preserve it -- living active and healthy lives, free from vice and excess. Happiness for the human being always seems to involve activity rather than rest. We have a built-in restlessness of mind and body, which completely separates us from the animal world. We must always be doing, planning, and thinking ahead. Believing that our object is ultimate rest and perpetual relaxation, we discover, paradoxically, that the true happiness lies not in searching for the goal, but in the struggle to get there. it is only the energetic, fully-extended person who is fully at peace.\n\nBut given all these things, the lack of a faith, a morality, an optimistic philosophy will turn them all to 'dust and ashes.' We have been made moral and religious creatures, and the sincere effort to live according to the highest precepts, we know, is the ultimate basis of happiness."

However there is no harm in dreaming, especially if the dream provides the driving force to turn fantasy into fact.\nAs I live in Singapore, i would like my ideal house to be situated either on one of the residential estates, right outside the bustle of the city center, or on one of the coast roads so that the cool breezes from the ever beautiful China sea could waft through my windows. Wherever my house was, it would stand in it sown grounds so that I would not, on any side, be over-looked by neighbors. The gardens, with which it would be surrounded would be very beautiful, full of colorful tropical flowers; orchids and canna lilies and with many glowing flowering shrubs such as bougainvillaea and frangipani. There would be tall leafy trees for shade and underneath them, my private swimming bath would be built, where we could relax and swim in the heat of the day. there would be pleasant paths winding through the green grass and comfortable seats where my family and I could rest, when the day's toil was over.\n\nThe house itself would be built of white stone which is both cool and weather-proof. It would be on two storeys, because I like the habit of sleeping upstairs. It would embody features from both the Eastern and Western worlds. In front of it, I would have a large path with cool concrete pavings for the floor and a roof and sides of hanging creepers to which the humming birds would come in the still of the evening and keep company with us as we sat in the twilight.\n\nThe main sitting-room would lead off from the patio divided from it by sliding glass doors. The floor of this would be of parquet which is easy to keep clean and cool. Here, there would be comfortable 'easy chairs' in bright gay colors, many occasional tables and a cocktail cabinet, so that I could conveniently serve drinks to my friends. From the sitting-room, the dining room would lead. This, too would be suitably furnished in bright, cool colors. Both these rooms would have large electric fans from the ceilings and many standing fans besides. they would not be air-conditioned because this, all through the day creates too artificial a contrast with the temperature outside and would not, therefore, be healthy.\n\nThe kitchens and servants' quarters would lead off from the dining room and be connected to it by a long passage so that neither the noise nor the smells from the part of the house would reach our living quarters. the kitchen would be very modern and up-to-date with every mechanical device that money could buy. Washing machines, cookers, refrigerators, mixers, polishers, garbage disposal units; none of them would be stranger to my kitchen. All would be work-saving and cool so that my wife and servants' work in the kitchen would be a pleasure.\n\nOn the second floor, I would have three air-conditioned bedrooms, each one with an attached bathroom and a shower. These bedrooms, two for my family and one for visitors would be carpeted and furnished with comfortable beds. Although mosquito proofing is not strictly necessary, I would have this too to ensure extra comfort and peace of mind. One of the rooms would be equipped as a nursery with gaily decorated furniture and walls bright with flowers, so that the hearts of my children would be glad. The walls in the rest of the house would be in plain pastel colors, because such shades seem to make rooms appear larger and cooler.\n\nAt the back of the house, I would have a double garage with water pipes leading to it so that my cars would always be kept clean. Beyond this, in a scheduled spot in the garden not attached to the house at all, would be a separate building of one storey; simple and clean and neat. This would be my study, sparsely furnished with just a desk and a chair and my book-shelves. Here, I could not only work, but also rest and be at peace to contemplate my ideal house and the great happiness which it had brought me."

        "title": "My idea of a happy life",
        "content": "When I begin to think of my idea of a happy life, I think first of all of money -- plenty of money for everything all the time. Money to buy a beautiful house for my parents or my brothers and sisters with every convenience and luxury, money to buy a fine motor car, all the clothes we could ever want and as many possessions like transistors, bicycles and modern appliances, as the heart could desire. money too, for foreign travel and for a first class education. Then, I think, I could be happy. But, is this really the answer ? It is true that the possession of money contributes to comfort and easy living, but money in itself cannot create happiness.\nLet us look at some of the world's richest people. Barbara Hutton, the Woolworth's heiress, for example, was divorced several times and lived a most unhappy life. There are many other rich people, whose misery is much greater than that of those living with only enough money for the barest necessities of life.\n\nThe essentials, therefore, of a happy life do not lie in money. Indeed, very many of them are things that money can never purchase. Good health is one of them and the one that we value least, until we are in danger of losing it. It is true that brave people who suffer from ill-health do surmount it and often find great happiness, but this needs great courage and all of them would admit that they would be happier with a healthy body and leading a normal life.\n\nLike most of my fellowmen, I am a gregarious animal and therefore, love and human companionship are important factors in my idea of a happy life. Since a child, I have needed the love of my parents and the affection of my brothers and sisters. In a wider circle, the interests of my uncles and aunts and the companionship of my school friends have all contributed to my happiness. Now that I am older, I realize that I must find a loving girl to marry, who will share all my joys and sorrows, and who will provide me with a congenial home life as a refuge from the storms and stresses of the world outside. My childhood friends are being substituted for adult companions in college and in clubs, but I am still surrounded by a wealth of friendship and love, which to me are essential for happiness.\n\nI am now training to be a lawyer in our university. This subject has always interested me and since a child, my dream has been to become a solicitor and to return to my town to work and to help people there. Here again, it is essential to happiness to be trained to do an interesting, worthwhile job that absorbs all one's working attention and provides an outlet for one's abilities and energies.\n\nI like sport of all kinds, particularly basket-ball and swimming, and my idea of a happy life would include time and opportunity for these pursuits. It would also include time to reading and for all my leisure activities and hobbies. Public service has always interested me, and so I would want to take some part in public life. What I actually do will, of course, depend on where I am living, but I shall certainly want to be an active member of my Residents' Committee and my local church.\n\nMy faith too is important to me and therefore, it is essential for happiness that I should be able to live in a country, where the people walk in freedom to practice their own faiths. Singapore today, is a living example to the world, of this. People here, of many diverse cultures live side by side in peace, each contributing to the culture of the rest. All are tolerate. This is not so in every country of the world, and when freedom of speech and of action is taken away, as it regrettably can be, then all hope of happiness goes with it.\n\nIt is said, and rightly so, that happiness is the most elusive and evasive thing of all, Indeed cynics have remarked that a man can only be truly happy when he is dead. The world would indeed be a miserable place if this were so, but fortunately, the majority of us find more happiness than unhappiness in our lives. The secret of happiness perhaps lies in wanting the right things first, in working hard, in giving more than in receiving, so that eventually, we are able to achieve it."

        "content": "No two people's list of things will ever be the same, but there are certain things most of us treasure, that is, if we have lived a normal, average sort of life, and these things belong to no particular race, color, nation or class. They are the things of value universally accepted by civilized people. The artist may be obsessed by his painting, the writer by his best novel, or the racing motorist by his chances in the Grand Prix, but the man in the street  places most value on the simple, ordinary things of life -- and almost all of them are, as the saying goes, the things that money cannot buy Per haps first on the list is a religious faith.\nIt cannot be denied that religion draws the best qualities out of humanity -- in particular those of self-sacrifice, kindness and toleration of others, quite apart from the moral standards it instills. Faith in one's God is the key to a more profound understanding of life and leads to a genuine love of people. Without it, moral degeneration sets in, and the 'slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,' as they come upon us all, cannot be faced. second only to religion comes home and family life.\n\nThe home and the loving family are a safe refuge from the coldness and indifference of the outside world. Those near and ear to us provide us with love and encouragement, consolation in times of sorrow, happiness in times of rejoicing. Equally, they help to equip us to face up to the outside world, strengthen our morale, and instill into, us the moral fiber we need when confronted with temptation. 'A happiness shared is a happiness doubled, a trouble shared is a trouble halved.'\n\nLife, however, is a spoilt if we are dogged by ill health and sickness. Most people are born with good health, and given proper food and clothing when young, develop stamina and resistance to disease. It is often the case that we tend to undervalue or even abuse our health -- until we fall sick; and it is then that we begin to realize the priceless possession, physical and mental well-being, really is.\n\nBut, none of these personal and domestic things of value count for much, if we are unfortunate enough to live in a country which denies us the basic freedoms o democracy. We should treasure the freedom of our country -- which means our personal freedom -- and do all we can to preserve it; fight for it, if outside tyranny threatens. Like health, freedom is only truly valued, when it is threatened or lost.\n\nMost of our working hours are spent working for our living and our mental and emotional well-being depends very largely on doing a job we like doing, one which is interesting, exacting and progressive. those whose jobs are satisfying and worthwhile have something to treasure very dearly.\n\nBut what is life without good friends ? The friendless person may always be suspected of being anti-social or of having serious defects of character. we should value all our social contacts and treasure those people who help to enrich our leisure hours by their conversation and companionship.\n\nMan's essential difference from the animal world is his sense of a need to rise above his surroundings, to aspire to great heights. No great achievements can come about unless the ambition is there first. We are, not all, gifted with the capacity to write great literature, or make a 'break through' in scientific knowledge, or become famous statesmen. Our ambitions may indeed be very modest, but every human being worthy of the name has ambitions of a sort, and these are very near to his heart -- or hers.\n\nFor most of us, the occupation we enjoy best is the choice of our leisure hours, rather than the job we are paid to do, and even if the latter means the most to us, our leisure hours will be very poor if they are not filled with one or two absorbing activities. These 'hobbies' may be in the sphere of the arts, or in politics, or in sport, social clubs or societies, and to most people they mean a very great deal.\n\nThese are the things, I treasure most in life. They have nothing to do with large bank balances, beautiful houses, foreign travel, valuable possessions, expensive motor-cars. Perhaps they are not even fashionable. But to me, life would be insipid indeed without them."

        "title": "The qualities of a good leader",
        "content": "Whenever and wherever human beings are gathered together in large numbers, they need leadership. Even children need their school prefects and schools captains ! Armies need Generals. Civilians need governments, captains of industry and intellectual leaders of thought as well. Men whether of the East or the West, require to be led and each group 'throws up' its own leaders in each succeeding generation. Whether in the school-room, or on the battlefield or in governmental deliberations, people who are natural leaders and who are chosen to lead, always have the same qualities of character and of outlook.\nIn the first place, it is the personal qualities that count for most, in other words, the personality. A leader, in any sphere, must be someone who can be looked up to and respected. His personal judgment must be trusted and he must be able to evoke love and warmth from those he leads. So the, the first quality of a leader is that he must have the ability to win over men's hearts.\n\nSecondly, he must have intellectual control over his followers and a mind that is capable of assimilation what is true and what is right and then of exerting this over others. It is useless, no matter what personal qualities or what intellectual prowess a man may have, if he lacks the initiative and the will to lead and to rally men around him. He must also, in his search for truth have great powers of concentration.\n\nAgain, a leader must possess this mysterious thing we call \"character\" is meant strength of will, clarity of mind, tenacity and determination. In other words \"character\" is knowing what you want to do and being ruthlessly determined to do it.\n\nMen and women will not follow a gloomy person ! Therefore a kind sense of humor and a sense of optimism are two other essential qualities of a good leader. He must also, not only be a good judge of thins and of events, but of people too, so that he can select good subordinates. He must also show and practice such virtues as self-control, temperance and moderation, so that not only his body, but also his mind are always at their best, healthy and sharpened like finely tempered steel.\n\nWhether a religious faith is a necessary quality of a leader is arguable. Many of our famous leaders today, are of different religious faiths and some have no faith at all. But in any event, they are all driven and motivated by some inward force and some ideology. Nehru and Tito are examples of this. So too, are Prophet Mohammed, Gauthama Buddha and Jesus Christ taken from history. These three were, if the numbers of their followers are anything to judge by, very good leaders indeed, and all of them had their own inward convictions and beliefs.\n\nIf can be said that great leaders are born with all or some of the qualities that go to make for leadership, but this is not necessarily the case. Leadership can be trained and trained and many men who may have a spark of the qualities needed, can develop and show great powers of leadership in certain situations. A war illustrates this point best of all, and there are sadly too many examples of 'leaders' whose outstanding qualities have only been brought out by the events surrounding them.\n\nThere is, too the good leader and the bad leader, of which Hitler, is a striking example of bad leader because it is possible to have all the qualities of leadership without the most important one of all. This is a moral sense of right and wrong and the right kind of \"love\" which is emphasized in many of the world's great religions. This is true not only of international figures like Adolf Hitler, but also in smaller figures. The \"gangs\" of youths, typical of both East and West, whose members are led to violence and lawlessness are invariably led and inspired by leaders without a moral sense of right and wrong.\n\nThe final test of a good leader is, of course, the question :- \"Do men follow him ?\" The answer will be \"Yes\" if, combined with strength of character, the ability to evoke love, a clear brain and a fair minded outlook, he also has a knowledge and respect for truth, honesty and fair play. Such a man surely possesses the spark of leadership and men will look p to him and follow him."

        "title": "An account of some forms of dishonesty that I have met",
        "content": "Some acts of dishonesty are on such a massive scale that they attract international publicity and condemnation. A recent example in the UK was the Robert Maxwell affair. After his death by drowning it was discovered that this entrepreneur had consistently diverted pension fund money to his personal use, leaving hundreds of trusting saves penniless. there can be no excuse for this kind of heartless selfishness. Ha Maxwell survived he would have faced a long term of imprisonment.\nOther examples belong to our personal experience. Going back to schooldays, I remember two dishonest schoolboys. Neither was caught out, though one may be thought more reprehensible than the other. Both came from poorish families. Pocket money was scarce. Albert promised to be a brilliant chemist, but laboratory time for experimentation was severely limited. So Albert steadily filched chemicals and equipment to set up his own lab at home Surely Albert's parents were as much to blame as he was. Fred was put in charge of the tuck shop. At the end of his term of office profits had dropped dramatically, but since he had not stolen money there was suspicion but no evidence. A hungry, growing boy, he had in fact helped himself and his friends to free chocolates and sweets conveniently forgetting to put the cash into the till. the reader may consider Fred more culpable than Albert.\n\nAlthough any kind of dishonesty is immoral and usually illegal, incurring the most severe penalties in some countries, the degree of it's culpability must depend on the motivation behind it. My wife and I were stationed in Germany shortly after the end of the Second World War. Within a week, we had two burglaries which literally deprived us of every thing we had. We weren't too angry, however. At that time, many Germans were literally starving, and we asked ourselves the question 'would we steal in order to feed our children?\" The black marketeers of that period were an altogether different matter.\n\nIn the early part of that war, I remember the only occasion when I ever heard the banns forbidden in church. The Church of England is responsible for the legal as well as the spiritual side of a marriage. On three successive Sundays the names of those proposing to marry are read out and the final question as to legality is asked at the beginning of the marriage service. At one of these readings a man in the congregation got up and said 'I forbid the banns', and it transpired that the proposed bridegroom was already married. So he was dishonestly attempting to commit bigamy, since is western society to have more than one wife at any time is forbidden. the man's motivation was probably personal gain, irrespective of the suffering he would cause to the bride and others.\n\nI cannot profess to have led an entirely honest life myself. when I became senior in the British Army it was my duty to write the annual confidential reports of my juniors. Most were straightforward, but I remember having to write that of a friend, never easy. He was lazy. Should I recommend him for promotion ? I wrote 'yes'.\n\nShould one congratulate a lady on her appalling outfit, or remain silent and be 'economical with the truth' ? In that case, honesty would not be the best policy. Nor would it be kind, nor would the verdict matter. Forms of dishonesty range from minor matters of tact to major crimes which have far-reaching consequences for evil. The key to them all lies in motivation."

        "title": "The discovery of a huge oil-field has caused many changes and disagreements. Write the story",
        "content": "I live in what used to be a small fishing village on a beautiful stretch of coast. One day, about five years ago, there was a radio announcement that oil had been discovered off-shore about three miles from our quay-side. There would be a rig, an the oil would be piped inland. The field was extensive and the oil supply would last at least ten years.\nAt once the village people were divided, and the local council became the scene of some terrible rows, which got into the press. About half the people were against the idea. Their main argument was that the beauty and peace of the whole neighborhood would be destroyed. Then there would be a great influx of contractors and workmen of all kinds. That would mean new roads, new houses, shops, a bigger school, a new medical center and countless other amenities. Think of the dangers to our wives, our children, our daughters, our livelihood. Imagine the noise of the helicopters. Our fishing boats would be driven away, and no doubt the sea would be polluted. To sum up - NUMBY - NOT IN MY BACK YARD !\n\nAbout as many people disagreed. The village would benefit from all the new amenities, they argued. There would be new jobs for the men, which would pay much better than fishing - perhaps jobs for the women, too. Our standard of living would go up, and we could buy all the consumer goods so few people could afford. And the newcomers might turn out to be nice people, anyway.\n\nSo the arguments went on. A petition was raised. tempers often flared. The government found in favor of the plan, of course, as being in the national interest, and within a short time, work began. that was five years ago. When the workmen began, life was chaotic, nightmarish, though every one of the dozens of contractors who descended on the village, promised to carry out his work with as little disruption to our lives as possible. In general, they kept their word. Actually, all the development took place just outside the village. Our traditional ways, our fishing, remained undisturbed, except that the harbor was dredged and extended to accommodate large vessels.\n\nIn that first two years, the major works were completed. Huge machines carried out the ground clearance. Oil storage tanks, a rail extension, new roads, an airstrip and heliport, dozens of portacabins for temporary accommodation, were put in place. Finally, the offshore rig was towed into position. Very soon, the oil was on-stream, and the night sky over the rig ablaze with the huge gas flare.\n\nSince then, more oil has been located in the field, so the life of the new town has been extended for an indefinite period. Our little village has become the suburb of a new town. The old peace has gone, and people still grumble, mostly the elderly. Fishing is now a dwindling occupation, since many have taken training courses and are in much better-paid jobs with the oil company. There are problems, but we get on well enough with the newcomers and, of course, make full use of their amenities. In every practical way, the new oil-field has proved a godsend."

        "title": "What factors determine the locations of a country's capital ? Illustrate with examples",
        "content": "Many capital cities were founded centuries, if not millenia ago, so it is not possible to do more than deduce the reasons for the choice of their locations. Most, though not all of these reasons are geographical. Before the arrival of modern communications and transport, any large settlement required a location which satisfied certain requirements.\nFirstly, an area of fertile land capable of supporting a growing population. The growth of Cairo at the base of the Nile delta provides an example.\n\nSecondly the area must lend itself to the spread of housing, and the erection of public buildings. Thirdly it must be near a good water supply such as a large river, thought built above flood level. Fourthly it must be well away from the earthquake belts and volcanoes. Fifthly it must be defensible against enemies. Most large cities and capitals were originally walled, though possible attack from long range artillery, from the air, and nowadays perhaps from nuclear weapons, has rendered all capitals equally vulnerable.\n\nCapitals must have been located with these basic requirements in mind, though the origins of older ones are lost in tradition and folklore. London consisted of British settlements in pre-Roman times in a very defensible position which is now the 'city', the inner square mile. The Thames, England's largest river, not only communicates with the center of the country but also provides deep water moorings for seagoing vessels.\n\nMore often than not, capital city locations were chosen at or near river-mounts for these reasons, with facilities for trade, both inland and overseas, very much in mind. South America contains a host of examples; Caracus, Venezuela George Town, Guyana, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Santiago, Chile which is inland but has easy access to Valparaiso, which is on the coast; Lima near the Peruvian coast; Bogota, Colombia. To these could be added Johore Bahru, whence inland products were exported; rubber, tin, copra and pineapples. In a country covered by impenetrable rain forests and mountain ranges, rivers provide the only means of communication, both for trade and for political purposes.\n\nAnother factor rendering the seaboard popular was that of convenience to those countries which sought to colonize overseas. Conversely, some capitals became established because of foreign colonization. The USA is a case in point. Washington, the federal capital since 1800 was laid out by Pierre L'Enfant, a French engineer officer, who designed the city specifically as the center of government in 1790. He located it on the Potomac River, inland from Chesapeake Bay on the East Coast, as might be expected.\n\nThere are at least three examples of changes of capital city, made for political reasons Peking was the capital of China from the 10th century, the time of the Liao Dynasty Later the seat of government moved to Nanking, but from 1421 it again became Peking. From 1928 to 1949 the capital was again Nanking and again reverted. Both Peking and Nanking which lies south of it, have easy access to the Eastern seaboard. the same thing happened in Soviet Russia. From the 14th century to the present day Moscow was the center, excluding the period 1709 to 1918, when St. Petersburg, later Lenigrad, then Stalingrad held that distinction. The reason fro the original choice of Moscow was that it was the gateway to the West; it was sheltered by a range of hills; it was built defensively; it satisfied all geographical conditions; it was the center of intersecting trade routes. The choice of St Petersburg was more political because although it is strategic for the Gulf of Finland and for Lake Ladoga, it nevertheless has a terrible climate and is icebound for much ofthe year. The fact however was that St Petersburg was the center for all revolutionary activity between 1815 and 1914. Also it is every defensible. The Germans never succeeded in entering it in the Second World War during four years of siege.\n\nIn 1960, Brazil dropped Rio de Janiero as its capital and moved inland to the newly-planned city of Brasilia, because it was felt that this would bring life to the interior. One hears that Nigeria is even now considering dropping Lagos as the capital in favor of a new town inland, though the reasons for this change are unclear.\n\nApart from geographical considerations, trade certainly affected the growth of Cairo from its early beginnings in 641 A.D. as the capital, not only of Egypt, but today of the Arab world. It has become the trading and distributive center for North Africa and the Near East.\n\nMany of the foregoing factors also apply tot he building up of Bombay. Originally an island off the mid-west coast of India it s now joined tot he mainland by means of reclaimed land. Its great harbor and westward facing position made it the obvious choice by the Moguls in the 13th century, who were followed by the Portuguese and in 1662 by the British."

        "title": "The types of fiction I enjoy reading and reasons",
        "content": "The reading of fiction is escapism, but not in any bad sense. To read is more positive than to watch television, because the visual nature of TV limits the imagination. Reading also excels radio listening, partly because the listener has no choice in the programs, and partly because the quality or radio programs is so uneven. There is a world of fiction available to occupy the reader's spare time, so much so that he or she can be ultra-selective in following personal taste. It is perhaps true to say that a good library is one of the finest assets a community can possess. Failing a library, paperbacks are usually available.\nReading opens windows on the world, whether past or present, and most people enjoy looking through these windows. 'Robert Graves' novels 'I, Claudius' and 'Claudius and god' reveal the Imperial Roman Empire, just as his 'Goodbye to all that' reveals the horrors of the First World War. It may be this quality which distinguishes great from mediocre fiction. Tolstoy's 'War and Peace' reveal the Napoleonic struggle, whereas Jane Austen's 'Persuasion' being a study of the mannered relationships of early 18th century English country gentry merely gives the Napoleonic Wars a mention. So are we looking for people's reactions to a great sweep of national events, the sort we find in Pasternak's 'Dr Zhivago', with it's comments on the Russian system, or are we looking for an encapsulated set of personal relationships ? Perhaps, from time to time, we enjoy both.\n\nOur choice of fiction also depends on mood, after a hard day in the office, we need to read something out of this world. What about Mr Clarke's space fiction ? Or perhaps it is something light and amusing. There is a whole world of this kind of fiction. Again, tastes vary. For this writer, the Atlantic Ocean is a great divide as far as humor is concerned, just as the Australian reader would see nothing funny in an English novel which I think hilarious. This argues that humor has to be related to a known background. The Englishman laughs at the James Herriott stories, because the adventures of this veterinary surgeon relate exclusively to provincial English characters. The American would be puzzled. However, a gifted raconteur like David Niven sells equally well on both sides of the pond. In 'The moon's a balloon' and 'Go slowly, come back quickly', he pins down the foibles of both nations, to the delight of both, because he has spent much of his working life in Hollywood, and has absorbed both backgrounds.\n\nMost people enjoy a good thriller, and some, horror stories. Edgar Allan Poe's short stories set the horror trend. He was followed by a host of others, notably Dennis Wheatley, and more latterly by people like Blatty, who wrote the terrifying novel 'The Exorcist'. The real trend, however, is for the good 'whodunnit', because the acts of violence are no more then pegs on which to hang intellectual solutions. Violence is never dwelt on for it's own sake. This is the popular Agatha Christie genre, followed by dozens of other writers, some highly gifted, such as Georges Simenon.\n\nThere are, among many others, three genres which is the 20th century have had a great following. The outward-bound adventure thriller, represented by Alistair MacLean and Hammond Innes; the spectrum of spy mysteries, based on the machinations of M16, the KGB and the CIA, John LeCarre being a very able exponent, and a whole group of modern novels based on carefully-researched subjects such as airports, hotels and banks.\n\nThis short essay does not mention the 'Classics', perhaps because the student may associate them too closely with examinations. However, they are still read for pleasure, and one should not forget that they were the popular literature of their day, and were often denied the literary status conferred on them by subsequent generations."

        "title": "The qualities of a good teacher",
        "content": "Every student has his or her favorite teacher, but that teacher may not be the best qualified person on the teaching staff. In other words, although the mastery of the subject or subjects taught, plus an enthusiastic approach, is an essential prerequisite in a teacher, it is far from being the only qualification. There are some who know their subjects but totally fail to put them across tot he students.\nLet us first examine the negative side. Unless the teacher has a voice which carries, without shouting, there will always be inattention at the back of the class. There are teachers who cannot stop talking, and who will lecture a class for forty minutes. Most students will be asleep after the first fifteen minutes. There are teachers whose manners and dress are eccentric; they may be popular but few students take them seriously. There are teachers who either shout at or speak sarcastically to backward students. They are disliked y the whole class. There are teachers who prefer to talk about the football team or a certain television program rather than the subject they are paid to teach. While this again may achieve popularity, it certainly evokes no respect. There are teachers whose lives are marred by drink, drugs, or sexual deviation. These cannot begin to be effective teachers. So what are the positive qualities the student looks for ?\n\nA good teacher must be able to exercise discipline. Teaching cannot begin in an unruly class. In the past, class discipline has usually been strict and inflexible. The more modern approach is to allow more freedom of speech and movement, though no individual can be allowed to dominate proceedings by rough and noisy behavior. All teachers know the difference between a lively and a disruptive student. To be able to exert the right kind o discipline can be learnt, but this is often by bitter experience. There are a few fortunate men and women who have only to walk into a classroom to create order. unfortunately there are more whose entry is a signal for chaos.\n\nstudents are always ready to work to the best of their ability for someone whom they respect, for two reasons. The first is the desire to please that person. The second, more important reason, is the knowledge that the teacher has the student's best interests at heart.\n\nStudy has two objectives and a careful balance between the two must be kept by the teacher. The first is the ability to instill a love of the subject taught, which will be maintained in adult life. The second is to prepare the students as well as possible for the next examination, bet it O or A level or university entrance in some cases. On the other hand, if, say, English is taught exclusively to cover the examination syllabus by means of learning context passages and model answers by heart, the subject will become boring. If on the other hand too much attention is paid to generalizations about literature and its place in social evolution, then the lessons may well be interesting but the student will go unprepared into the examination room.\n\nThere should also be a balance between how much work the teacher does and how much the student does. Some modern educational theorists disapprove of any talking by the teacher beyond the bare minimum. Unfortunately, if students' work is not carefully guided, and if they are given free expression in their approach to any subject, most of them will learn nothing of value. Avoiding the lecture habit, the good teacher, who has already done his or her lesson preparation, will help the student to achieve certain objectives in each lesson by a mixture of verbal instruction and class work. Television, radio and other visual aids are only marginally helpful, and should be kept to a minimum.\n\nIn schools which are not streamed, there will always be class members who are sometimes incapable of doing the work which others find easy. a good teacher will help them individually, sometimes after school hours, and if they are non-achievers, set them simpler work.\n\nTo a certain extent, a good teacher needs to be a psychologist, able to detect and advise on mental blockages, which are sometimes due to outside emotional disturbances. A good teacher should be someone you can trust and talk to, and whose sane advice on your personal problems is worth listening to."

        "title": "A critical review of a book (play or film) which I have read (or seen)",
        "content": "Just as he uses the French Revolution as the catalyst to resolve the relationships and destinies of his characters in 'A Tale of Two Cities', Charles Dickens uses the Gordon Riots to the same effect in Barnaby Rudge, his other historical novel.\nInspired by the eccentric peer, Lord Gordon, the London mob carried out a reign of terror in 1780 against Roman Catholics, involving murder, looting, arson, and acts of sedition including storming several prisons such as the Fleet and releasing the prisoners. Gordon escaped the consequences, due to lack of evidence, but other ringleaders were executed in public once the military had crushed the riots.\n\nThe riots occupy much of the story, and are brilliantly described. Hatred of the Papacy was the moral peg on which to hang the violence, and it presented the mob with specific targets, Roman catholic churches, RC houses and their families. A mob out of control and guided by ringleaders will find the lowest common denominator of behavior. It is formed out of a depressed working class which has an inbuilt hatred of the 'Establishment' and, individually, old scores to settle against oppressive employers. It's real motivation is looting, revenge, and the exercise of power. For a time the mob succeeded by instilling fear into the respectable population at large. Many house-holders put notices in their windows declaring their Protestantism. Dickens captures and coveys this sense of fear which dominated London and it's suburbs for some weeks. This is the most successful aspect of the novel. The climax is the detailed account of the storming, burning and liberation of the Fleet prison.\n\nAll the same, there is a certain weakness in the plotting, and this is the weakness of many of Dickens' novels. Ever the sentimentalist, Dickens sees to it that all the characters, good and bad, get their just deserts. Life isn't like that, and the plaintive Old Testament cry, 'Why do the ungodly prosper ?' is much nearer the mark. Yet Barnaby escapes the gallows on grounds of idiocy, even though he had joined the rioters for gain, albeit to help his mother. So he is a 'goodie'; others are Geoffrey Haredale, a Roman Catholic whose house was burnt down, and Gabriel Varden, the locksmith who braved the mob in refusing to open the Fleet door lock. Anyway, his pretty daughter Dolly is needed for a happy marriage to Edward Chester. And the 'baddies' ? We have Hugh, he savage ostler, Simon Tappertit and Dennis the hangman. All get hanged. And the smooth villain, Sir John Chester, a secret fomenter of the Gordon Riots; Haredale kills his in a duel. Stewart Rudge, Barnaby's father, had murdered Heredale's brother years previously, but nemesis catches up with him and he also gets hanged. Even Miggs, the smarmy but treacherous maid gets sacked. So everything turns out well ! All this merely underlines the fact that Dickens, by far the most popular Victorian novelist, knew his readership. What did they want ? Exaggerated sketches of low-life characters, who would make them laugh by their grotesque misuse of English. The good and bad characters already mentioned. A love interest, with a happy ending, after the young lady has been exposed to many perils. An exciting plot, with vivid descriptions. A well-executed denouement, in which justice is seen to be done all round. And perhaps an eccentric such as Barnaby Rudge, with his talking raven. Even the raven survives the ups and downs of the riots.\n\nThe novel has all this. It is a masterpiece of popular fiction, but it is still second-rate.\n\nMost Victorian novelists are too long and 'wordy' for modern tastes. Trollope suffers from the same verbal diarrhoea, but his denouements grow convincingly out of his characters rather than being imposed on them.\n\nDickens' few middle or upper class characters are thin and boring. We know that Haredale is bluff, rough but honest, whereas Chester is smooth, but treacherous. Nothing more. The characters representing the various layers of the working class are far more rounded, but their comic use of English is very suspect. Working class English cannot have changed so dramatically even in one and a half centuries. Then as now, they abused the language, but wordiness, long and involved sentences, and delay in coming to the point were never features of their conversation, especially in London. Shakespeare understood this. Dickens did not."

        "title": "If I could choose to be endowed with a great gift or talent, which one I would choose, and reasons for my choice",
        "content": "I would certainly choose to be a concert-standard pianist, but please don't misunderstand. I have no desire to hear the thunderous applause, to be taken by the hand as the conductor and I acknowledge the standing ovation, to receive the bouquet, to come back on stage four times, to play a brilliant encore, to read the glowing press notices at the end of a late-night party.\n\nAll that is best left to the people who like that sort of thing. I merely want to match the professionals, to play as fluently, to memorize as completely, to express the composer's intentions as deeply.\n\nYou may have gathered that I am a competent pianist. I know that I shall never get much better. I need the music in front of me. I do not own a Steinway grand, but a gallant old Brinsmead upright, now in its eightieth year. One plays -- and one dreams !\n\nSo what about the 'great gift or talent' ? Is one born with it, or can it be developed ? The answers are yes and no. Occasionally, in a televised piano competition, one sees a young boy or girl, say aged thirteen or fourteen, sit down and play a Chopin ballade or a devilishly difficult piece of Liszt with consummate, almost contemptuous ease. That has to be talent. I could never do it in a thousand years. I used to tell myself that I could if I practiced more. Now I merely recognize that gift in others. I would never deny that to flower into perfection, the gift must be complemented by hours of practice, daily. Yet without the gift, no amount of practice will achieve the result. The word 'practice' implies a chore, the kind of mental resolution which says 'I will do half an hour a day'. Well, yes, that will improve the muscles and therefore the performance. Yet, the talented youngster is content to live a the keyboard, with a short break every few hours for a sausage roll and a coco-cola. And in turn this implies a musical background -- since I believe that such people are favoured genetically-encouragement, a good piano, and above all opportunity. The development of a great gift has to be at the expense of a good general education. My late wife used to teach maths to Toots Lockwood, and grumble because Margaret's young daughter made little progress. Toots, a budding actress herself, once made the precocious remark 'Mummy didn't need maths to become a star, did she ?'\n\nThere are various reasons why I would like to have been a gifted pianist. Firstly, for my own satisfaction, since I enjoy playing a wide variety of composers and would dearly love to extend my repertoire. Secondly, I would like to be able to hold each piece, however long, in my memory, and to be able to think exclusively of the interpretation as my fingers automatically translated the score into sound.\n\nAlso, I would like to be confident about entertaining my friends, and this demands not only memory but the ability to improvise. Fluent improvisation is a gift not possessed by all great pianists. The story goes that the jazz pianist Art Tatum once challenged the great Solomon to improvise on the tune 'Lady be good' for as long as he could. Solomon gave up after ten minutes. Tatum manipulated the tune for half an hour without repeating himself.\n\nSo my guilty secret is that I enjoy playing jazz music as much as classical. Certainly not the modern variety of the Dave Brubeck school, with its unrhythmic runs and depressingly awful harmonies. But give me Duke Ellington, Earl Hines, Teddy Wilson, fats Waller -- especially Waller -- and I am happy. If I had Waller's rhythm and Tatum's ingenuity, life would be a rich thing !\n\nSo, personal satisfaction, giving pleasure to my family and few friends, and helping my grandchildren, all of whom play the piano at varying levels consonant with their ages. None is likely to show a great gift or talent, but they will all become competent, like me. There is no greater satisfaction than giving them a hand with their scales, their theory, their pieces at Grades at Grades 3, 4 or 5.\n\nOne of them is likely to become a better pianist than me. She may even become very good, but like the rest of us, she will never be a virtuoso. I am rather thankful for this, because life is tough at the top, and there are many drawbacks to a concert pianist's life : jet-lag, bad hotels, the envy of one's peers, an unbalanced life, perhaps a marital breakdown.\n\nI prefer to have my cake and eat it. I would like the talent, but none of the pizzazz which always seems to go with it."

She had a lot of homework to do and she also wanted to help with the shopping. So, she tried to hurry through the jostling throngs. The pavements were very crowded. People were rushing this way and that. Some, like Ah Lan were trying to get home. Some were shopping at the wayside stalls. Others were merely hurrying to see the sights of the town. The streets were also very full. Taxis were hooting and driving along much too fast. cars and buses wwre speeding in all directions. even the tri-shaws were doing a busy trade. Ah Lan struggled on.\n\nSuddenly, there was a loud hooting of horns, and a wild screech of brakes followed by the loudest crash she had ever heard. She jumped with fright and when she looked up, there beside her on the road was a car, a taxi and a tri-shaw, all involved in an enormous accident. The car, hit by the taxi, was lying on its side, its doors jammed into the monsoon ditch. The tri-shaw had been hit too and was lying a crumpled mass of steel with its rider huddled beside it.\n\nA siren heralded the arrival of the traffic police in two black motor cars, and the ambulance bell could be heard in the distance. The crowd stopped in its tracks and stood transfixed. The, as if galvanized into life the pedestrians pressed forward, round the cars and onto the edge of the pavement, until the whole street was covered with a crowd of silent, curious people, watching. Smoke was rising from the bonnet of the car.\n\n\"Stand back ! Stand back\", shouted a harassed policeman. \"We must move the tri-shaw rider who is badly hurt\".\n\nThe crowd moved reluctantly backwards slowly pushing. Ah Lan, peeping through the legs of the man in front, saw the tri-shaw rider bleeding and unconscious, being lifted onto a stretcher and into a large white ambulance which had just arrived.\n\nThe taxi driver got out of the taxi followed by his two passengers neither of whom was hurt. \"It wasn't my fault\", the taxi driver began, waving his arms wildly and almost attacking the policeman with the shock. No one was taking any notice of the car. The people were all looking at the taxi and the ambulance. An Lan peeped to see what was happening. Out of the door, now facing up to the sky, a man was struggling. First his head, bruised and cut and then his body appeared. Wearily he heaved himself to the ground. 'My child is trapped in the back seat', he yelled in despair. 'Help me ! Help me !\" Only Ah Lan heard, because she alone had been watching. \"Although I am small and like a shrimp, as they say,\" she thought, \"I can help now. I must, because no one else is listening.\" She rushed to the car.\n\n\"Be careful\", shouted the frantic father. \"The petrol thank will be alight soon, but please help me to get my child. You're small enough to climb in.\"\n\nWithout further ado, with a brave heart, Ah Lan struggled up and into the back window, through the broken glass and onto the back seat. There was the child crying piteously.\n\n\"It's alright. You'll be safe\", whispered Ah Lan and clutching the small child to her breast, she got up and put it carefully through the window and into the arms of its father. \"Be quick yourself\", he yelled. \"The bonnet is on fire. I knew it would.\" Ah Lan, small and brave, was tired and frightened herself by now. Moreover, she had cut her legs badly climbing in.\n\n\"Come out ! Come out ! You'll be burnt in a minute\", screamed the crowd, all of whom were looking.\n\nWith one superhuman effort, Ah Lan heaved and flung herself through the back window, just as the whole car went up in smoke. She fell out onto the road at the feet of the grateful father.\n\n\"You saved my child\". He almost sobbed. \"A small girl yourself, but you saved my child. A brave deed indeed\"."

        "content": "Mary Lee seemed to have everything. She was very beautiful with a neat trim figure and an attractive face. She was very rich. Her clothes were better than anyone else's and she had more of them. Her books were always new and expensive as were her pens, school bags and bicycle. She was very clever too and without appearing to do very much work, she was always first in all the examinations and always answered all the questions, while the ret of the class were still thinking.\nWith all this, or really because of all this, no one liked Mary Lee. She was too good, too clever and she was also very proud. No one was quite good enough to talk to her or to be seen with her or to be her friend. And so, with all her proud ways and riches and brains, she was lonely but she did not care because she was always best in everything.\n\nAs the end of term drew near, the pupils including Mary Lee began to think about the most important prize of all. this was the prize, offered by the principal, for the best essay to be written on one of two subjects. \"I needn't worry about that,\" thought Mary Lee, as the others began to read and to think about the essay. \"I shall easily win; after all, my compositions are always better than the rest.\"\n\n'Pride goes before a fall,' they say and it certainly did in the case of poor Mary Lee. 'Happiness' and 'Friendship' were the two subjects for the essay and Mary Lee knew little about either. As she scratched her head for ideas and scribbled with her pen, she realized that she hadn't any friends to speak of and that she was very far from being happy. She had no idea and so, she did not win the prize.\n\nAh Chu wrote the best essay and the pupils were pleased, because he had never really excelled in anything before. He won lesson. She felt so silly because all her money and her cleverness seemed nothing compared with not wining the prize. \"I mustn't be too proud or too sure,\" she thought, \"the fall is very hard, if you have been too arrogant. \" She became a much pleasant person after that and her fellow pupils became her friends. She still won many prizes, but she never forgot the valuable lesson that the one prize she lost had taught her."

Describe your experiences.\n\n \n\n loud crash; a rending of steel and wood; a swirling uprush of water. I opened my eyes and I, alone, was alive -- alive in stormy angry sea. I took several deep breaths and began to tread water, slowly so that I could maintain my upright position and conserve my energy. Struggling for breath. I began to look around me. Floating on the stormy grey waves which stretched as far as the eye cold see, were the remains of what had once been my ship. Huge planks of wood were lying like shining sleeping monsters on the surface. Hundreds of life-belts, white and new looking were drifting to and fro. The people, some of them my friends, who might have been saved by them are now drowned, dead and gone forever, I thought. On one life belt, some material clung damply. Curiosity made me swim nearer. It was a cheongsam, brightly colored and gay. But there was no gaiety here !\nA huge wave lashed over my head an I began to sink, slowly. Coral, fish of many brilliant colors, the bright green flora and fauna of the sea kaleidoscoped before my eyes. I shut my eyes and prayed. After what seemed a lifetime, I found myself rising, floating upwards, till the grey of a sullen sky and the even duller grey of the sea hit my eyes.\n\nIt was becoming darker and slowly the stars were appearing one by one. There was a lull in the storm and the night seemed almost beautiful. But not for long, gigantic biting gales arose and the seas, lashed by fierce monsoon rains and winds tossed me and the remains of my ship on the surface, like pitiful corks. I shall never survive, I thought. Desperately, I swam to a piece of wood and, clinging to it, watched the night stars fade, one by one, until the dawn, when a pale streak of sun, gradually stole over the ocean. I felt that I would never be warm again.\n\nThroughout the next day, and the next night, I clung to the wood as pots, pans, a looking-glass and a child's toy: all the life of the doomed ship tossed and eddied before me, now turned into the flotsam and jetsam of the sea.\n\nWith despair, I began to resign myself to death, when far away, out on the stormy seas, I saw a fishing boat. With one hand I waved frantically, clinging tot he wood with the other. Shouting, yelling, screaming with fear and relief, I finally attracted its attention. It began to move towards me. Kind hands helping me on board, soft voices, warmth and safety were mine at last."

        "content": "Ahmed and Ah Chua were known as 'mischief makes', not because they were really wicked, but because they weren't. It was just that they liked fun and adventure. \"Whatever can we do with them ?\" their parents used to say, \"they are always up to something and it is usually no good.\" They were twelve years old, and lived in two adjacent flats on the top of a high-rise building overlooking the harbor. At night, when they had eaten their rice, which they sometimes did and sometimes did not, they used to watch from the high windows all the lights of the big liners and small fishing boats in the harbor down below. It was exciting, because they used to make up stories about the boats and to pretend that they were sailing away into far and romantic places.\nOne night, life for Ahmed and Ah Chua seemed particularly dull. \"let's get out of all this and go off in one of those boats,\" said Ahmed, sick of the world by now.\n\n\"We can't do that,\" muttered Ah Chua. \"You know that we are supposed to keep an eye on baby Lim for your mother.\"\n\n\"Never mind about that. Let's go anyway,\" urged Ahmed. \"Life's dull enough and we haven't had any fun for ages.\"\n\nAh Chua, being weaker, was easily persuaded and so the two excited naughty boys crept quietly out of the flat, down the outside steps, flight upon flight and out into the busy street.\n\n\"We must get to the harbor,\" said Ah Chua. \"Let's have a tri-shaw\". They found an old man who did not really want to take them, because he was just going home, but Ah Chua finally persuaded him with an extra fifty cents. The harbor seemed as busy as usual, when the two boys left the tri-shaw and started looking for an empty boat.\n\n\"We're sure to find one,\" Ahmed whispered excitedly.\" Someone would have left one unguarded for the night.\"\n\n\"But it's stealing,\" weakly murmured Ah Chua. \"What if we are caught ?\"\n\n\"It isn't stealing, because we'll bring it back and we won't be caught, because we'll be too clever,\" was the reply.\n\nUnder the harbor wall, moored by the stone steps was just what they were looking for : a newly painted sampan with its outboard motor glistening in the moonlight.\n\n\"We'll take that, just for an hour or two,\" said Ahmed, and we'll leave some money tucked under the seat for petrol. it won't seem so bad then.\"\n\nThey crept down the harbor steps, unseen because no fishermen or officials were about just then. Ah Chua was the echoic and he started the engine. They were soon gliding over the water, past the big liners that they had so often seen from afar. They could even hear noises from them now, as the crew busied themselves with jobs and the rich passengers went to and from the dining rooms on board. On and on, passing big boats and little boats, until they were out at sea and nearing one of the islands.\n\n\"Isn't this fun?\" began Ahmed, when suddenly, a huge boom of what sounded like a siren rent the air and search lights as if turned on by some giant magic hand, played down upon the water from every direction. from the tall ships and from the higher points on the islands, great beams of light were searching and prying into the hidden corners of the sea.\n\n\"What is happening ? We must get home. We shouldn't have come. I told you so.\" Ah Chua was almost crying. Ahmed was frightened too, and so slowly and stealthily, they turned back weaving cunningly in and out between the beams and trembling at the noisy sirens.\n\n\"Crouch low, keep hidden,\" whispered Ah Chua, as a huge searchlight played round the dark waters within inches of their sampan. They held their breath until the beam moved on. Trembling Ah Chua guide the boat, until they reached the harbor. They tied it up quietly and quickly and then ran all the way home. Luckily, their parents were still out and baby Lim was quiet in his cot. All was silent and soon they were asleep too.\n\nNext morning, Ahmed's father glanced at the papers, which he usually did before going to his office. \"They still haven't caught that escaped convict,\" he said. \"The biggest police search of the harbor ever known as last night,\" he went on. \"Many boats were searched, and many people illegally in charge of them were arrested.\" He stopped and looked at Ahmed, \"Time you were off to school.\"\n\nAhmed couldn't wait, \"What a hair-breadth escape,\" he panted, as he met Ah Chua hurrying on his way."

        "content": "Ah Mee often wished that she could have some fun like other girls. Some of her friends, she knew, were always going to see the latest films, eating meals in most expensive restaurants and always wearing smart clothes. Ah Lan, for example, had at least three party dresses and many cheongsams. \"My life is all work,\" Ah Mee said to herself one day.\n\nIt was indeed all work, because Ah Mee's mother was dead and so, as well as working hard all day in a departmental store in the large town in which she lived, Ah Mee had to look after her father. She cooked all his meals and kept the house spotlessly clean. But she did not want to spend all her life doing this and so at night, when everything else was done, she was teaching herself to type and to do shorthand. She went to classes for this in the evenings sometimes and on her day off as well. One day, I will get a really good job as a secretary to an important man, she used to think. Then I will have much more money and I will be able to send some home to my father, so that he can pay someone else to do his housework for him.\n\nSo the weeks and the months passed, each one of them seeing Ah Mee working harder than before. Work at the departmental store was tiring. She was very often on her feet all day from morning until night and sometimes, the customers were difficult, unpleasant and hard to please. Ah Mee worked at the meat counter and sometimes, the buyers were never satisfied. One piece of meat would be too fat, another too lean and people grumbled so much, if they could not have exactly the right join of pork. Ah Mee did not like this job at all and if she had to work in a store, she would have preferred a chemist's or a smart ladies' gown shop. However, like many working girls, she needed the money and so she had to persevere.\n\nWork at home, too, was hard. Although, she had only herself and her father to look after, the house, still got dirty and needed to be cleaned. The rich spiced pork dish that her father liked so much, took just as much trouble for two, as they would have done for four or for six people.\n\n\"It will all pass, if I work hard enough\", she thought as she walked with her shorthand book to the Commercial School, where she learnt shorthand and typing. The room was busy as she entered it. Other girls and boys were already seated behind the typewriters which were all new, since the school had only just opened. The pupils were putting long pieces of white papers into the machines and setting the spaces and margins. Soon the tap, tap, tap, of the keys could be heard as the class began its evening's work. Ah Mee became absorbed in hers. She was very tired, but she tried her best to concentrate, looking all the time a the copy lying beside her typewriter.\n\n\"You have a good touch\", said a voice. \"I have great hopes for you in th eDiploma examination next week\". She looked up to find the Principal of the School standing by her desk. This was indeed as honor. \"Your shorthand speeds are good too\", went on the Principal. \"Try hard in your examination and then I will help you to find a job. Remember to practice your shorthand at home. If you have no one to dictate to you, the voices on the radio can be used instead.\" He walked to the next desk leaving Ah Mee to her work and wondering just what time she could find to fit in any more practice.\n\nThe Principal was right of course, as they usually are and Ah Mee obtained her Diploma with very good marks. Now, she is the private Secretary to the Principal himself and has a pleasant job with a good salary. She helps her father to pay for a woman to look after them, and although she is still very industrious, she now has time for pleasure and recreation. She worked hard to achieve the congenial life she leads now, because at an early age, she was wise enough to realize that without pain there can never be any gain."

        "content": "Lim had always been lazy. He worked on a rubber plantation and it was his job to empty the tins of latex hanging round the trees that his father had tapped and to fill the buckets with the strong sticky liquid. He then had to carry the buckets, which, when full were very heavy, to the shed at the edge of the plantation. His father usually supervised the part at the shed to make sure that they were paid the right amount of money. It was also Lim's job, therefore, to take care of the tins as they hung round the rubber trees. he had to see that they were firm and securely tied with trees. He had to see that they were firm and securely tied with wire. He had to make sure, too, that there were no holes in them.\nOn this particular morning, there was a mist in the air and it was already very hot. The rubber plantation was quiet, dark and still. Lim went round the trees, one by one, inspecting the tins and emptying them. Some of them were full to the top, but quite a lot of them were only half-full or even less than that. However, he went to indifferently pouring the latex into the bucket without even bothering to think why so many of the tins were nearly empty.\n\n\"I'll take what I've got and not worry about anything else\" he thought and joined his father at the shed. Of course, they were not paid so much money that morning, because the latex simply wasn't there.\n\n\"What's happened today, son ?\" asked his father crossly. \"Have you missed out half the trees or what ?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" shrugged Lim, who ante to hurry home with his share of the payment to check if he had got enough money to buy the latest record of his favorite pop-singer.\n\n\"Perhaps some of the tins have got holes in them,\" suggested his father. \"Our rubber trees are young and should be yielding far more than this. Check all the tins tomorrow !\"\n\n\"Check all the tins, my foot !\" muttered Lim. But not aloud, of course.\n\nAnd so the day passed and his father came home cross, because he had hope to have more money.\n\n\"Don't forget those tins tomorrow,\" he said to him. \"If they've got holes in them, you must mend with some tin solder do it in good time. If you don't, we'll have to replace all the tins with new ones to say nothing of losing a lot of good latex and the good money that goes with it as well. Remember that 'a stitch in time saves nine' and in case you are too stupid to understand that, it is a European proverb which means that a little bit of trouble and work today will save the necessity of a lot of trouble and work tomorrow.\n\n\"Always preaching,\" mumbled Lim, as he went to bed. \"They are all the same.\"\n\nThe next morning, however, he did check the tins and sure enough, as he poured out the latex and inspected the bottoms of the small round tins, he found tiny holes in quite half of them. the latex which had collected was, of course, much less because so much of it had dropped through these holes and had begun to congeal on the soft grass at the base of each tree.\n\n\"I'll find some better tins later on today,\" thought Lim, and I'll buy a stick of solder in the village and come back and mend the rest tonight. But, in fact he did nothing of the sort.\n\nThe next morning, the pools of latex below the rubber tree were bigger than ever, because somehow during the night, the holes in the tins seemed to have got bigger than ever. The quantity of latex was so small that his father came to inspect the tins himself.\n\n\"You'll get them mended or replaced now, this very morning,\" he yelled in rage, as he looked at the shiftless Lim. \"Do it at once.\"\n\nBut, Lim never did and so, not many days later, there were no latex at all and the tins were beyond hoe of repair.\n\n\"They've all got to be replaced now\" said his father, \"and time and money will be lost while we renew them all. If only you'd listened to me and mended them while the holes were small, all this trouble would have been avoided. Now do you see that  stitch in time saves nine or will you always be too stupid either to listen or to learn ?\""

        "content": "The wind suddenly rose and at the time we thought nothing of it. We snuggled together, giggling, in the caravan double bed. Jan and I were just married, too poor to afford a proper honeymoon, so we made do with a week on that South coast caravan site, What does comfort matter when you're in love ?\nFor England, that October week in 1987 hand been warm and sunny. The forecasters had mentioned a break in the weather, but nothing serious. How wrong they were to be proved.\n\nMy luminous watch gleamed one a.m. Something was odd, very odd. For one thing the sky as blacker than I had ever seen it. For another, the wind didn't gust, it kept up a relentless pressure which gradually increased. The noise had grown to a whine, rising steadily in pitch.\n\n'Jan, it looks as though we're in for a gale', I said, and we moved to the window to look out. Under the wind's pressure the frame seemed to be moving, and I had a sudden premonition of disaster. I grabbed Jan and threw us both to the wooden floor. A second later the frame blew out and straight across the room with a crack like a pistol shot. We were showered with glass fragments, but miraculously not cut. Now we could feel the full force of the gale. It blew furniture, bedding, our cases and everything else moveable up against the back wall.\n\n'Jan', I shouted, 'we've got to get out of here. The caravan will go next'.\n\n'I'm frightened, David', she answered, 'but you're right'.\n\n'We'll need the rope', I said. I crawled across the floor to the pile of furniture, found our anaraks and a length of stout rope we had used for securing the packs to our bicycles. we dressed as best we could and I tied the rope round our waists. 'We'll try hands and knees', I said.\n\nThe wind screamed into the caravan as I released the door catch. we could make no progress. My guess was that the wind was blowing off the sea at eighty miles per hour. Somehow we dragged ourselves outside and on to the grass where, in file, we edged forward on our stomachs until we were clear of the caravans and in no danger from flying objects like bits of trees, dustbins, clothes lines and lumps of rock which had flashed over our heads. In the end we reached an outcrop of rock where I secured the rope and where we could lie in its lee ,exhausted, but in comparative safety.\n\nThe gale had become a hurricane. Over five hours it's pitch rose to a steady scream sounding as though all the demons of hell had been let loose. Our caravan, and most of the others, became matchwood and just blew away. The waves smashed against the quay below, throwing small boats across the road to splinter against the houses. Inland, we could hear the thunder of heavy trees crashing tot he ground. the nightmare began to end at first light.\n\nAfter wards, we learnt that the hurricane and been the worst in recorded English history. The wind had gusted at one hundred and twenty miles per hour. Twenty people had been killed. Five million homes were blacked out. Up to fifteen million trees were destroyed. Total damage was estimated at 1 billion pounds.\n\nOddly enough, we found our bicycles and some of our possessions -- three fields away !"

People would stop and smile, bend over her pram and tickle her under the chin whenever I pushed her along the pavement tot he supermarket.\n\nOn the terrible day though, I was in a hurry, so we took the car shopping. It is a modern blue Ford and Kim's little cot fits neatly into the back. I parked it in the multi-level car park in the supermarket complex.\n\nShould I carry her into the store ? She couldn't walk very far yet. I knew I should, but then I thought of the great load of shopping I would have to carry back. I wavered. Then I thought I would take a chance. After all, Kim would be all right if I left her for half an hour. I locked the car, leaving a window a little open. She was smiling and playing with fluffy little ball as I hurried to the store entrance. It's no use denying that I was worried about leaving Kim even though she was obviously in no danger. All the same I almost ran from shelf to shelf, filling my trolley with the groceries we would need for that week.\n\nThe store was busy that day. There was a crowd at the butter, cheese and bacon counter and I had to wait ten minutes before I could be served. In the end I pushed the trolley tot he end of the shortest of several long check-out queues. I glanced at my watch. I had already been in the store for half an hour.\n\nFinally, I was through. I snapped my purse shut and loaded my groceries into six plastic bags which I had brought with me. Then, heavily weighted, I left the store and walked across to the stacking car-park. The lift was out of order, as usual, so it meant climbing the stairs.\n\nIt seemed an age before I spotted the blue Ford. There was nobody about. Eventually I reached the car. It was just as I had left it. A rear window slightly open. Doors locked. But there was one difference. The back seat was empty. No cot. No Kim.\n\nSuddenly life became unreal. I remember screaming out 'Kim ! Kim ! where are you, darling ?' I remember fighting to open the car doors, forgetting they were locked. I remember shouting 'Help ! My baby has been stolen !'\n\nThen there running feet. It was a security guard. 'Now calm down, miss', he said, 'let's see what we can do'. As he spoke, an elderly gentleman carrying a shopping bag walked up to us. He stopped, a puzzled look on his face.\n\n'How can I help you ?' he asked, and I blurted out my sad story.\n\n'But you do realize that this is my car', he said. Then he took a bunch of keys out of his pocket and opened the driver's door."

        "content": "I'm getting on in years now, and perhaps my memory isn't what it was, but there some things you never forget. Such as my experience one night in the military town of Tidworth, near Salisbury in the UK.\nAt that time I was a senior clergyman in the British Army, and for some reason I had to stay overnight in an officers' mess there. The regiment normally occupying that barracks was our maneuvers, and they had left behind a skeleton staff, all of whom had gone home by six o'clock, the time I got there. The only people left were a young duty officer and the barman. His last job was to close the bar and lock up before he went home to his quarter.\n\nWe chatted at the bar. I had already dropped my bag in the bedroom assigned to me.\n\nBy seven o'clock the young officer had gone home. The barman turned the key behind him, and then began his rounds making sure all door and windows were locked. I went with him.\n\nA bit later he asked permission to close the bar, which I gave. I went with him tot he main entrance, said goodnight, and closed the door. He turned the key in the lock from outside, and his footsteps faded into the distance. I was alone, locked in. The barman would be back at six a.m.\n\nSomehow, I felt something was wrong. For one thing, the mess was very cold though it had been a warm sunny day. I shivered, and decided to walk round the mess again. There seemed to be someone else in the building, though I knew there wasn't. So I searched every room and finally satisfied I undressed, got into bed, and picked up a book. Then it began.\n\nThere was a heavy knocking on the bedroom door. I have to admit that a cold chill passed through my body. I was very frightened. But perhaps I'd imagined the knock. The mind can play strange tricks. After thirty seconds or so, it came again. 'Who's there ?' I shouted. But there was silence.\n\nSomebody was obviously playing a trick on me. I thought. So I got out of bed and walked across to the door. I put my hand on the door-knob, and waited. The heavy knocking came again. I opened the door and looked. There was nothing.\n\nThe mess was one of those large, stately Victorian buildings where the corridors were long and spacious. The adjacent bedroom doors were yards away. No joker could possibly have hidden.\n\nSo I then got a chair and sat by the bedroom door, and each time the knocking came I snatched the door open, to find nothing.\n\nIf you can believe it, this went on until night turned to half-light and six o'clock finally came. The barman was prompt, and I was dressed, packed and ready to go when I heard his key in the front door lock. I said nothing to him, jumped into the car and drove off to an all-night cafe I knew for coffee and breakfast.\n\nSome weeks later, I was chatting to an office from that mess and mentioned my experience. 'Oh yes', he said, 'you're not the first person to have that experience. There's some story about a young officer in Victorian days who locked himself in and took poison -- for unrequited love, if you can believe it. They tried all night to rouse him. All nonsense, I've no doubt'."

        "content": "Most people agree that television is one of the most important inventions of this century. Pinions vary as to its value but no one can deny its great effect upon society.\nFirstly, television is one of the greatest educators of all time. Documentary programs about foreign countries and their inhabitants, instructional programs on medicine, science, engineering, natural history and many others are all brought to the homes of ordinary people who without television would have known little about these things. In this connection too, special 'Schools' Television has been introduced in some parts of the world. In these programs pictures, films and diagrams, greatly add to the knowledge of the pupils.\n\nAt its best, television is a good form of entertainment which stimulates or creates an interest in the arts. we can see top-line artists cheaply and easily at home. A piano recital by Rubinstein, and orchestra conducted by Stokowski, an hour with the Beatles: all these would be beyond the pockets of most of us. Hitherto theatre-going was limited to the very few. Nowadays there are many good plays to be seen on Television with first class actors and actresses. Consequently, the love of the theater is far more widespread.\n\nAs a companion to old people, television has unquestionable use. People who have no one to talk to in the evenings or at leisure are now no longer alone. The old who cannot get out to cinemas and theaters do not have to forget these entertainment's as television provides them.\n\nScientifically television has its uses Photographs can now be relayed to earth from space by means of it.\n\nLike other great inventions, television can be and is, unfortunately, abused. It is said that television makes 'watchers' and not 'doers', and that people will watch a game on it rather than play one themselves. It is also said that hobbies tend to suffer because of too much 'viewing'. Reading, sewing, carpentry, gardening -- all these can be neglected if television had too strong a hold.\n\nAs well as the public, the producers themselves often abuse this medium. The programs are often poor with mediocre talent or illiterate and ill-informed views. Vice and crime can e given too much emphasis and therefore have a disastrous effect upon millions of viewers, especially the young.\n\nCertainly there is abuse, but if this medium is used with intelligence and discrimination by both producers and viewers, then it can become a blessing and not a curse to mankind."

        "title": "\"Advertising is becoming a nuisance\" Discuss",
        "content": "When business is good, it pays to advertise; if business is bad, you have to advertise -- so runs a well-known advertising slogan. Thus, whether there is a boom or slump in any enterprise, its owners are sure to advertise. With rising standards of living all over the world, competition for customers is becoming more intense. Advertisements of all sorts, today, clamor insistently, and even hysterically, for the attention of consumers, actual or potential.\nOne cannot leave a radio set tuned to a local station nowadays, without an announcer cutting in and enthusiastically proclaiming the excellent qualities of a particular product. The same announcer will, a few minutes later, insist that yet another product is a 'must' in a decent, civilized household. And this goes on all the day, and also part of the night.\n\nSome hardy souls may become immune to all this noise. This results merely in a hardening of sensitivity. A person soon becomes gross where his finer feelings are concerned. On the other hand, more sensitive people find all this extravagant advertising propaganda a strain on their tortured nerves. If they are listening to a serious program, they have to bear up with the continuous assaults of the advertisers. Those who can afford it, may smash their radios up and buy tape-recorders or record-players.\n\nThese latter, however, do not escape scot-free. They may like to relax occasionally in a theater. After all, there are some films worth seeing sometimes. In a theater, patrons have to sit through bouts of advertising twice during each show-- once before supporting features, and once again before the main show, that is, during the interval. If a film is too long for there to be an interval, one gets a double dose of advertising before the entertainment begins.\n\nOf course, one can enter a theater late -- but there are few spirits brave enough to risk groping about, stumbling over steps and shins, in the dark, and generally making nuisances of themselves. Moreover, there is the question of timing. If you come too late, you will probably miss a film's dramatic beginning. If you come a little before the film starts -- there will still be some advertisements to fidget through.\n\nAdvertisements are a nuisance any way one looks at them. Since they are aimed at the general mass of people, advertisements have to have a common standard of appeal. This standard certainly cannot be high, if it has to require a response from everybody, educated or illiterate, people who are highbrow or people who have very ordinary tastes, men, women, and even children. The message in an advertisement is purely commercial. There is no other aim .. scarcely one that can be called aesthetic. Hence one finds vulgarity in advertisements. Such infrequent exceptions as there are merely prove the rule.\n\nWhy are women the most popular subject of advertisement ? Because they have an instant appeal both to men and to women. In the case of men, the appeal is blatantly pornographic. A woman featured on an advertising placed or slide is often scantily dressed -- but this is subtly conveyed as being fashionable so that the fashion instincts of women are also pandered to. Sometimes, the leer on the face of a woman looming in tremendous proportions on a Cinemascope screen is supposed to be seductive, or at least attractive. And what woman among the audience dies not wish to be an object of some admiration ! The men are, of course, expected to respond instinctively to the appeal in such advertisements as have been described. What sort of insult do the advertisers think they are offering sensible people ?\n\nSometimes, the presentation of an advertisement in the way of a cosy, family subject. For example, one may be urged to buy a car through being shown father, mother and a couple of children surveying a particular make of car admiringly. The appeal here is to cupidity. The implication in the advertisement is that most ordinary families have cars -- why not you, YOU ? Thus, one is apparently required to keep up with the Joneses.\n\nThere is no doubt that advertisement try to arouse the instinct to possess. A harassed family man may well be pestered by other members of the family to buy something which has been admired in an advertisement. The result is frequent argument, irritability, and final capitulation on the part of the person subject to persuasion that really comes from advertisements. It is such a result that makes advertisements a nuisance. One has to contend with an added source of irritation in a world that is already producing neurotics by the million. An advertisement may be immoral. But this does not imply that people will succumb to immorality easily. What makes the advertisement a nuisance is the distraction it offers --- distraction from sane, balanced values. The sooner people decide on the worthlessness of most advertising propaganda, the sooner will advertisements be less of a nuisance."

        "title": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of co-education ?",
        "content": "The main argument in favor of co-education is that it provides a powerful incentive to both sexes to work in competition with the other. Hence, a higher standard of work results because both boy and girl are \"on their mettle.\" But the competition may not be confined to work only ! It may be channeled to boys competing to capture the attention of girls and preoccupation of a sexual nature are, of course, detrimental to work.\n\nThe mixing of the sexes through \"difficult\" ages and stages in co-educational schools eradicates shyness and gaucheness in the boy/girl relationship. This is true and they do benefit by living, working and playing together. On the other hand, boys and girls in separate schools do not experience shyness and gaucheness in the boy-girl relationship. Sexes are part of the curricula of most schools nowadays, and it is always possible to get to know the opposite sex through the contacts of family life.\n\nGood manners are said also to be inculcated through co-education. This is to some extent true, as the \"courtesies\" and \"social niceties\" are in fact imbibed in the school room. Social good manners can of course, and usually are instilled in the home and are also quickly \"gleaned\" in out of school activities. Schools of separate sexes also train pupils in good manners.\n\nFinally, co-education leads to a more balanced school life because of the mutual interest between the sexes. Plays, concerts and so on, are very much easier to produce when girls and boys can both take part, and the final results are often better. But this difficulty has been overcome in the past and will of course be overcome in the future. The school, in any case, exists in the main for education.\n\nThe biggest danger is that adolescents will become too preoccupied with sex and that they may become involved in difficulties of a serious social nature. This, with proper supervision is not of course insurmountable. In any event, co-education has come to stay and while clearly it cannot have very much effect on the side of work, it may bring advantages on the social side."

        "title": "Painting versus photography : which is better ?",
        "content": "This question cantinas two basic misunderstandings, one concerning the nature of painting and the other, the nature of photography. It implies that the purpose of painting is merely to depict a place, a scene, or a person with as much verisimilitude as possible; that the invention of photography now enables this to be achieved more exactly, in color was well as in black and white, and therefore photography has superseded painting. The truth is that painting and photography have entirely different functions.\n\nThe functions of photography in the modern world are many and varied. It is true that at one time the photographer, whether amateur or professional, was concerned largely with portraiture and to record places and scenes; every process, from preparing the photo-paper to coating the printed picture, was carried out by the photographer himself. This, of course, restricted the scope, quality and operation of photography. Today, every requirement is commercially produced, and processing is no concern of the individual -- it has become a purely commercial concern, and has become so highly developed that, in conjunction with modern cameras, it has been able to extend vastly the scope and use of photography. When the modern use of photography for aerial, industrial, microscopic, underwater, astronomical, architectural, time-lapse, television, the press, atomic research, and a thousand and one other purposes is considered, it is at once seen that social and pictorial photography is relatively inconsequential, and confined chiefly to magazine and newspaper work when quantity is considered.\n\nSecondly, the old adage that 'the camera cannot lie' and therefore that it always reveals the truth about a person, a scene, or an object, is totally untrue. While it is true that the camera must record the image in front of it, the photograph itself will vary enormously according to lighting, speed, aperture and focal depth used, as well as the speed of the film and the grain of the paper. Photographs can be 'touched up,' faked and altered out of all recognition; there are ways in which a variety of effects can be produced when the same subjects is dealt with. The camera can and does like, in the hands of the expert who may wish to flatter or cheat.\n\nThirdly, a photograph is a temporary production, while a painting is permanent, and will last for centuries, provided pigmentation is good and paints are correctly mixed. After a few years, photographs tend to blur and fade off, and there is no satisfactory method of curing this tendency.\n\nBut fourthly, and this is the most important point, no artist worthy of the name is ever content with pure representation, except those whose task is to produce calendars or attractive pictures fro chocolate-boxes. It is true that before the advent of modern art, great attention was paid by the artist to focus on intricate and often fascinating details; brushwork was fine and the object was partly that of exact representation. But even then, the artist was at pains to paint in appropriate lighting, compose his scenes very carefully for artistic effect, if necessary, altering them in detail to produce what he wanted or exclude what he didn't want. In this, even the 'artistic' photographer is limited; in fact, by banally recording only what it 'sees', the camera is a poor tool in comparison with paint-brush.\n\nBut when the painter talks of 'painting what he sees' he means something completely different. By 'seeing', he means the effects the salient features of the subject have, not on his vision, but on his emotions, an din the case of certain forms of modern art, on his subconscious mind. Thus, at its simplest, this means that the artist can emphasize certain aspects of a sitter which appear to him to be characteristic, and tone down those which seem unimportant, irrelevant, or dull. He can deal in much the same way with a landscape.\n\nHe can make a certain shape, or color of light dominate, he can simplify, he can add overtones of mystery, or harshness, or brightness, or pathos, or despair, or any of a whole gamut of the personal emotions inspired in him by the work. Provided, these are intelligible, the result must raise painting as an artistic form, high above the level of photography, a mundane and rather commercial science in comparison."

        "title": "Acting versus drama : what can the actor provide that the dramatist cannot ?",
        "content": "Acting has been described as 'the ability to react to imaginary stimuli', and we should first decide what these 'imaginary stimuli' are. The dramatist may be working from an old story, as Shakespeare did, a thought-out comedy situation, or a cleverly-constructed thriller. Whatever it is, he must first visualize his characters, and not begin writing until they are all as real to him as the members of his family. Unless he does this, he cannot hope to convey a sense of reality to his audience. If he is a good writer, his characters will then emerge as real people, just a little 'larger than life'. But this is far from enough ! It is precisely at this point that his abilities and limitations begin to show. A good play needs a series of dramatic climaxes, with third-act tension and a good denouement.\n\nIt also needs far more than words -- many a subtly characterized play fails completely through lack of action, contrast, surprise, stage 'business,' and, in short, general stagecraft. As all this has to be considered, and , broadly speaking, the story comes first rather than the character. There is comparatively little scope for the dramatist to do more than sketch in the 'broad lines,' and these will be done with fairly broad strokes. There will be enough stage directions, but only just enough. In other words, the actor has to supply a great deal that the dramatist cannot, and it is here that the producer, (in the USA., the 'director'), comes in. It is the latter's task to consult carefully with the dramatist, and find out his main intentions, but having done so, the rest is left to the producer. Sometimes, as in the case of the Noel Coward comedies, the main actor is also the author and producer rolled into one, but such individuals are exceptional and outstanding. Normally, the production is in the hands of the producer, and the success of the play will depend on his ability to interpret the dramatist's intentions stagewise, and, if necessary, suggest minor alterations and improvements.\n\nThe actor, with the help of the producer, pick up the threads of the production, at the point where the dramatist lays them down. It is up to him to get into the soul of his part, to 'live' in it, as he script-reads and then begins to rehearse. Inevitably, he will get as close as he can to the author's conception of the part, but his own personality is bound to become fused with that of the character he is playing. secondly, the dramatist will have given minimal stage directions, but it is up to the actor, with the producer, to use the arts of gesture, facial movement, stage 'business' (physical occupation on the stage) and stage positioning, to supplement the words he is called on to speak. Thirdly, although the actor is limited to the actual words which he is given by the dramatist, their whole meaning and impact on the audience depend on the actor's own emphasis, use of speed or deliberation, use of the loud or soft voice, use of the whole gamut of emotional overtones or undertones at his command.\n\nIn his mind, even in his play, the dramatist may have created a real person, but a real person has a certain appearance, or type of appearance, and the actor inevitably 'stamps' the part or becomes stamped by it. For example, Rupert Davies has in fact become 'Maigret' in the eyes of British television audiences. All these tendencies are even more marked in the film than in the play, where the producer expects to be in complete charge of the finished product, and may even have the original script rewritten ten or more times, and also alter much of the action to achieve the final result he wants. Many a writer for the cinema has ruefully accepted a large fee, and completely washed his hands of a final production which bears little or no resembles to what he originally wrote !"

        "title": "\"Science has proved to be the enemy of man\" How far is this true",
        "content": "On the face of it, the statement seems to be utter nonsense. Today, if we have a toothache, we can visit a dentist who can perform a painless extraction or make a permanent filling. A hundred years ago, dentistry was carried out by a barber with a pair of pliers. Medicine, through science, has made astonishing strides in improving the lot of mankind. Today, an appendix can be removed in less than half an hour. Fifty years ago, the appendix would have been perforated, with fatal results. Today, more children survive childbirth, more people live longer than ever before, thanks to scientific discovery, and their health and faculties, and therefore their happiness, have improved and increased immeasurably as a direct result of scientific investigation.\n\nScience, however, has done far more than promote health and longevity. In principle, the effect of the application of scientific discovery had been to improve man's whole way of life by allowing him to use the world's natural resources to the full. Simple machines and processes have now become complex and efficient through the application of technology -- another product of scientific technology -- another product of scientific research -- and a further by-product has been the increase of wealth, and therefore purchasing power both to the community and the individual. Without science and its application, there would be no roads, no transport, no street-lighting, no permanent buildings, railways, aircraft or shipping; no radio, cinema or television; no books or newspapers. Man's existence would, in fact, be at the bare subsistence level. He would be wholly pre-occupied in finding enough to eat and in defending himself from wild animals. Like that of the cavemen, his life would be 'nasty, short and brutish'. But science had done even more. The urge to travel and explore the world, and to develop its natural resources has been well served by science during the past five years. Today, science has begun to unravel the mysteries of the universe. Tomorrow, who knows ? In any event, knowledge leading to 'know-how' is man's only means of satisfying his natural instinct to understand and dominate nature, because, although physically one of the weakest of the animals, mentally and psychologically, he is a giant in comparison with all other known forms of creation.\n\nYet today, something has to be said on the other side. The old proverb 'knowledge is power' has more truth about it than ever before, and in many advanced countries, we are reaching the position where the real power has fallen into the hands of nuclear scientists who possess the means of whole-sale destruction. Such brain-power often goes together with psychological immaturity and childish dreams of an 'international society' in which all knowledge should be pooled. Such idealism, noble in the abstract, is dangerous in an imperfect world, particularly, when scientists reveal potentially dangerous secrets or defect from one political block to another. Today, science is indeed the enemy of man in this sense.\n\nFurther considerations are the fact that science has made warfare easy for the unscrupulous. Any small or vindictive nation can purchase jet aircraft, poison gas or the high velocity rifle. And some of the more general results of science are also somewhat disquieting. Crop fertilizers taint the crops. Tampering with nature can produce imbalance or drought. But perhaps, the most important danger is that science seems to be gaining control over man himself, as it has produced what we call 'modern life,' with all its nervous tension, ceaseless activity, worry and unbalanced living. City-dwellers tend to curse the machine like the computer which has forced them into a rigid pattern of restricted, high-pressure and yet monotonous living. Charlie Chaplin's old film 'Modern Times' effectively satirized this tendency some forty years ago and, for most of us, life has developed along the liens he predicted.\n\nScience, however, is neither man's enemy nor his friend. Like the jungle, it is neutral. everything depends on man's use or misuse of it. Today's signs are that its worst dangers are at least being recognized, and there is hope for the future, provided science is made man's servant and not his master."

        "title": "Should dangerous sports be forbidden by law ?",
        "content": "The 'dangerous sports' implied by this title include both which may involve death or serious injury to the participant and those dangerous both to participant and onlooker.\n\nThere is no case whatsoever, for legislation against the former, indeed in a free country, such legislation would be an unwarrantable limitation of the freedom of the individual. This is limited to the natural instinct for adventure, thrills, and seen as a challenge to nerves and reflexes. It is possible to break one's neck riding a horse, or climbing a mountain. No sane legislation would seek to bar such activities, because this would be to legislate against the development of certain qualities very valuable in youthful people, qualities which are at a premium, when a country's prestige is at stake, or when a country is faced with war.\n\n'Sport' is a very wide term, however, and includes some activities which are very much more dangerous than others; of these, motor-racing, and competitive motor-cycling are merely two. A mishap, or a fractional error of judgment can be fatal to other competitors and to a crowd of onlookers. Accounts in the press of terrible Grand Prix accidents, involving death and mutilation to perhaps fifty spectators at a time, are commonplace. It is incidents of this kind which have prompted the move to legislate against dangerous sports. The bereaved victims of such disasters may have a strong emotional case for urging such legislation.\n\nIt is sometimes urged by those who fear and dislike the baser pleasures of the masses that psychologically, many attend motor sports and other dangerous activities in the secret hope of seeing blood and disaster. The same contingent seeks to abolish professional boxing for the same reason, plus the undaunted fact that sooner or later, the boxer will suffer from brain lesion. The argument is that ultimately the public is responsible for forcing men into such pursuits. But the case is overdone; basically, the majority go for the thrill -- football, the least dangerous sport of all, is the most popular.\n\nIt may fairly be stated that legislation is required, but that such legislation should be framed in order to safeguard the public, and as far as possible, the participants. For example, crowd safety precautions at motor-racing meetings need drastic revision. The professional boxer's license should be removed if he shows the slightest sign of mental deterioration. Perhaps, thirdly, there should be some control over the financial awards available to the stars of any sport, as the continued need for a high income often leads them into taking part, long after they have passed their peak; it also encourages the second-rate to attempt things beyond their power. Both can be disastrous.\n\nAny attempt to ban the participants in dangerous sports is doomed to failure. The instinct of a man or woman to seek adventure or thrill cannot and should not be extinguished by Act of Parliament. Any such legislation will merely drive the sport \"underground\", make it more popular, and condemn it to bad conditions. In the days when professional boxing in England was forbidden by law, it drew far greater crowds into the scheduled fields than the carefully staged promotions of the present day."

        "title": "\"Money is the root of all evil\". Do you agree ?",
        "content": "The actual quotation, found in the New Testament. Timothy I verse 10, is 'for the love of money is the root of all evil' -- and this presumably is what the heading implies, for it is fairly obvious that money as a means of exchange is no more the root of evil than it is the root of good. it is neutral -- as the jungle is said to be ! Moreover, it is the indispensable standard against which raw materials, goods and services may relatively be valued and as such is the sine qua non of any kind of civilization whatsoever.\n\nThe Biblical quotation stems from the writer's belief that the Christian ought to live a spiritual life in a material world, and this train of thought has ever since been a commonplace of the Puritan tradition of Christian thought. The theory is that the world of material things is corrupt and unredeemed. Money is its life blood, so money -- or its love -- must necessarily be an evil thing. But the other Christian school of thought regards this as dualism, and will have none of it. money, it is argued, can buy the good things of life, which confer benefits, always providing unselfishness, and spirituality predominates in a person's thoughts -- and that view which regards the world in which we live as an essentially evil place is based on a wrong-headed, primitive Jewish notion that Satan thrown out of the garden of Eden, corrupted God's world. The Spirit of Christianity -- like that of other world religions -- is that money can be used well or ill, and that the man who possesses it can be either a narrow miser or an open-handed benefactor.\n\nLet us first examine the sense in which the statement is true. It has been said that 'every man has his price'. This implies that everybody can be bribed, providing the price is high enough. Most countries can provide examples of financial corruption from the proud and rich to the humble and poor. Britain, in recent years, had a Chancellor of the Exchequer who disclosed a budget secret before the due for financial gain. Money can buy vice -- of any kind; and organized vice exists to provide financial rewards to its criminal promoters. Money can inculcate selfishness. It is often true that the more money a man piles up, the meaner he becomes, whereas the poor show the quality of generosity to a marked degree. Of course, it is difficult to say whether this is a question of post or propter hoc ! Money confers powers corrupts; and infinite power corrupts infinitely. The arrogant dictator is no better than the aggressive business tycoon in this respect. And the majority of crimes are committed for money, or loot, its equivalent, and we find that the love of money motivates the protection-racket gang, the bootlegger in prohibition countries, the dope-peddler, the thief who robes with violence, the gangster, the black-mailer, the bank robber, the burglar, and a host of other denizens of the human underworld.\n\nBut the obverse of the coin presents an equally clear picture. Modern standards of living depend on industrialization, of which capital is the life blood. Money, rightly used, can and does immeasurably improve the lot of the ordinary person, whether in terms of food, clothing, houses, holidays, books, motor-cars and such like consumer goods, or whether in terms of public services -- national defense, public health, hospitals, libraries, clubs, playing fields, nature reserves, unemployment pay and so on. In fact, without a steady flow of private and public money, modern life is inconceivable. Money can also be used for the benefit of those in need, whether at home or abroad through charitable societies; it can provide education, foreign travel, and international cultural exchange. It can enable religion to do its work of leading men's thoughts to God, and teaching them to behave unselfishly towards each other. It can provide grace, beauty and nobility in the cities and towns in which we live.\n\nSurely the crux of the matter is the individual's attitude towards money. If he regards money as an end in itself, to be increased and amassed for its own sake, he is liable to become selfish and miserly, unconcerned about other people or their needs. If he sees money as a means of buying physical pleasures for himself, he is in danger of becoming a corrupt, indeed a criminal human being. If, on the other hand, he earns money, but spends it wisely, he can do nothing but good. This good may be to himself, if he spends his money to secure a balanced and intelligent life; it can be to his dependents, if he conscientiously provides them with a good home, a proper education, and a fair share of this world's goods. It can be to the world at large, if he had enough of it to give some away to benefit the community of which he is a member.\n\nIn such a case, money is certainly not the root of all evil. And if it is not the root of all good, it is certainly the nourishment which helps that root to grow."

        "title": "The arguments for and against the prohibition of alcoholic drinks",
        "content": "In dealing with this topic, we must discount entirely, the Moslem world in which alcoholic drink is forbidden on religious grounds, and deal with only with those communities to whom drink is legally available. There are few countries in the world where beers, wines and spirits are not manufactured, and/or imported.\n\nProhibition was a 'cause celebrate' in the USA in the 1920 and 1930s. Its history there began in 1846 in Maine and many other states followed this example, but the legislation was ignored and became a 'dead letter'. By 1900, many Americans were campaigning for a revival of the laws, part of the argument being that wheat and barley were in shot supply. In 1920, Congressman Volstead succeeded in passing an amendment, known as the Volstead Act, prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor. But public opinion insisted on its repeal in 1933. What was the background of this reversal of policy ?\n\nBriefly, smuggling and illicit distilling. not only was there a steady demand for drink among Americans, there were also an element of excitement in being able to obtain it and a certain 'status' in being able to offer it. The results wee predictable. The supply of alcohol was 'concerned' by the gangsters, who in addition, ran the halls of vice known as 'speakeasies' and controlled gambling drugs and prostitution into the bargain. Millions of dollars were made out of illicit liquor; gangs 'ruled' their own territories, the police being powerless against them and to some extent corrupted by them; gang-warfare led to pitched battles in New York and Chicago, with great loss of life. Very little of the liquor was genuine; most of it was dangerous and rapidly led to addiction, alcoholism with all its attendant evils, and blindness. Repeal of the laws of prohibition became inevitable. The law ha become a menace; it was observed nowhere, and it had led to far greater social evils than those it had been designed to remove. The result was that in nearly every state, all laws against drink, even hours of 'opening' were repealed; the country settled down to normal drinking habits, and he social evils attendant on drink became no grater or less than those in other countries.\n\nIt is more than likely that similar results would attend to introduce prohibition in any other country; people will go on drinking whatever happened and so from the practical point of view, legislation is virtually useless. But there is, nevertheless, a case to be made for prohibition -- if it could ever be effectively enforced. The poorer the country, the more relevant is the case. Where incomes are small, living standards low, and consumer goods in short supply, men and women naturally tend to drown their sorrows in alcohol. Money that cannot really be spared from the domestic economy is wasted on drinks; children go unified and ill-clothed, and wives receive no money for housekeeping. the drinkers themselves lose not only their health, but their self-respect. In extreme cases, they become alcoholics, and die in institutions, years before they need to, causing suffering and degradation to others as well as themselves disgusting; overweight, blurred speech, unpleasant breath, and lowered personal standards. Drink causes gloom, or false hilarity; it can lead to violence and quarreling. It can and does cause death on the roads, when a drunken person is in charge of a motor car, and all countries quite nightly impose severe penalties on such offenders. A heavy drinker is a menace to the society in which he lives as well as to his family and himself.\n\nNevertheless, experiences has shown that prohibition is not the method of dealing with these problems, because it is ineffective. Severe legislation against the individual who offends against society through drink is, however, another matter, and most countries operate such laws.\n\nThe main argument against prohibition is that it is a curtailment of individual liberty. In a normal society, nobody should need to fly to drink as a refuge from life. And if the use of alcohol is moderate, there is a case to be made that alcohol is a social asset. It helps to reduce shyness and social inhibitions and 'makes a party go.'\n\nSecondly, there can be a positive medical value in the judicious use of spirits, such as brandy, which is some times prescribed in small quantities by the medical profession for helping certain kinds of heart conditions.\n\nThirdly, suddenly to ban all production and consumption of alcohol would destroy the means of livelihood of many thousands of people. Practically the whole agricultural economy of Spin and Southern France is based on the grape, and to destroy their overseas markets would not only cause untold misery, but would devastate thousands of acres of land which are unsuitable for growing anything else.\n\nFourthly, there would be enormous losses of revenue to every government. Liquor in bond and on wholesale and retail is subject to very heavy taxation, and this factor alone would prevent many governments from seriously considering prohibition at all !\n\nThe real case, in fact, is not so much 'for or against' prohibition, but for so educating the people that they make proper use of alcohol, avoid its abuse, and become masters rather than servants of drink."

        "title": "\"Equal pay for equal work' is this fair ?",
        "content": "There is not, and can never be, any logical argument against equality of payment for the same work as between men and women. It is true that men do certain jobs better than women, or quicker, and the reverse holds good about other jobs. But is 'equal work' which is under consideration and payment for any type of work, performed by anybody, is always the least that the employer can get away with. In other words, pay rates are fixed by two factors; firstly the supply of labor available for a particular job. Scarce labor for skilled jobs tends to push up wages, coupled with the fact that skilled workers will revert to laboring jobs unless they are paid extra for the use of their skill. secondly, the government and the trade unions have a hand in rate-fixing, as well as the employer. If the cost of living index rises, the unions will call a strike for more pay, and they will always, in a free economy, press for not only a realistic wage level, but also a share in the profits of the firm, which are otherwise paid tot he government in the form of taxation, tot he shareholders as dividends, or ploughed back into the firm for development. The fact that in many countries, women are paid a lower rate for doing the same job merely indicates that, on the whole, most women are not union minded. They are relatively unorganized, because most of them do not bring in the basic income on which the family, if any, depends. Moreover, they are available in large numbers for a short-term employment and for most married women at any rate, their, 'heart' isn't in the prospect of a life time's employment.\n\nAnd this raises the argument often advanced against equal pay for women. Single women do not need the same pay as married men. Yet what about their old-age ? Married woman's pay is additional, while the married man's is basic to the family. The bachelor will probably get married any way and acquire responsibilities.\n\nWomen may well ask by what right an employer presumes to assess the income he pays his employees by a prior examination of their domestic commitments, when in fact, he is paying everybody the lowest wage he can. And, of course, in more advanced countries, these anomalies of sex are being ironed out, based as they are on the old system of regarding the female of the species as inferior to the male. Already in more westernized countries, women have achieved parity in matters of property and the franchise. It is now a short step to accord them equality of pay.\n\nThe fact that women on the whole suffer this inequality still is well and truly based on historic. For this purpose, we can discount the various national and racial customs of the Far East, because we are thinking in terms of industrialized, i.e westernized countries, where a real similarity of conditions exist to those of USA and Europe. Britain was the first country in the world to become fully industrialized, a process completed between 1733 and 1850 -- and the background of British thought about female labor followed the commercial and industrial flag of Britain Overseas, and fitted in very well with local ideas of the inequality of women. Women themselves have long since exploded this myth by means of their own efforts and have entered successfully into every sphere of male occupation, heavy engineering and the mines included. Today, quite rightly, they are debarred from nothing.\n\nSo the crux of the matter is the British background. From 1733, until at least 1914, and in some respects later the upper and middle classes considered it degrading for a female to earn money at all. Lower-class women worked as helps to their husbands -- in the fields, brickyards, foundries and the mills. They had no rights and expected nothing, but toil and an early death. (Unmarried women and spinsters far outnumbered jobs.) There was no state benefit for unemployment, so thousands had to tolerate the working conditions and poor wages, or starve.\n\nThe development of factories led tot he concentration of populations in the towns. Prices rose, and men's wages never kept pace, so women had to work to supplement the family income -- and again for what they could get, which was very little. Today, curiously enough, married women again work, usually from economic necessity. It is now more a matter of improving an already reasonable standard of living. And there is no moral reason why they should not do so, or receive the correct economic rate for the job they do -- not the sex they belong to.\n\nInequalities are historically based in snobbery and economic oppression, not in any careful assessment of financial commitments, and it is high time these remaining inequalities were ironed out everywhere."

        "title": "Consider the uses and abuses of comics",
        "content": "When Shakespeare wrote of the 'Seven Ages of Man' in 'As you like it', his view was that towards he end our intellect collapses, and we become senile. Today, we might apply the idea to comic-readers. The mature comic-reader gives them up in his (or her) middle teens -- and if he or she goes on reading the comics written for the older age-groups, senility has already set in. And yet i is, nothing to see a grown-up man or woman surreptitiously buying a comic from a street bookstall. What a pathetic commentary on an adult's brains this action is !\nYet we must not sweepingly condemn comics out of hand. They very definitely have their uses for children and young people. Of them all, perhaps the most attractive and appealing are those produced to young children. There is nothing more pleasant to see than the happy absorption of a child in his favorite comic or to hear his occasional chuckle as he sees a funny illustration or reads a good joke. young children, of course, love comics with an innocent devotion, so at the very least they have the merit of giving real, widespread pleasure. But they do rather more than this. The child or a rabbit or some other such character with the name printed beneath in large letters, being involved in some rudimentary adventure help the child to spell as well as to read. And thirdly, such comics are always completely moral, and therefore help the parents to instill the right ideas about life into the child from a very early age, and in a very pleasant way. The boastful person is made to look ridiculous, the thief gets caught by the policeman, the miser is made to give a way his money, and so on. Vicariously and at no personal hazard, the child begins to learn the lessons of life, and in a way which will not be forgotten. A few pence or cents spent on a weekly comic is generally money well-spent.\n\nThe second category of comics is aimed at the age-group 7-13, and again is largely beneficial in its effects. By this time, children should be reading quite easily, and so the emphasis is on the story rather than on the picture, although big, colorful illustrations and strip cartoons are always popular. The worst type of comic for this age-group is that consisting entirely of the strip cartoon. It appeals to the dull and lazy child who cannot be bothered to read, and often has rather doubtful standards of morality. But the good-class comic for this age-group, whether British or American does no harm but may do good. At school, work is being taken more seriously, and examinations are becoming important, so comic-reading must be strictly rationed by parents and teachers, because from this point of view it is a time-waster. But as a harmless means of relaxation, the good comic has a real value. It may also stimulate an interest in general knowledge and travel. sometimes it contains competitions and 'brain-teasers' which sharpen the wits of the reader. It always contains a due element of humor. But best of all, the comic contains stories of school-life, adventure, space-fiction, sometimes religion-- a real diversion for the child.\n\nThe real dangers lie in prolonging comic-reading into late teenage and adult life, and there is nothing good to be said for the kind of comics aimed at the older age-groups. From the age of 15 onwards the young person should be too busy with work, decent novels, newspapers and magazines to bother with them at all. So the promoters aim at the basic side of human nature. In the case of girls, cheap, highly-colored sentimental novelties are very popular among the unintelligent. They present a false view of the proper relationship between the sexes and a debased view of marriage. As far as male consumption is concerned, the three instincts catered for are sex, bogus glory and violence. Some are near-pornography, others glorify war and make it out to be a 'heroes' paradise', while others, the 'Westerns' adulate the same kind of stupid glamorous 'hero', but dressed in the clothes of a cowboy and fighting the Red Indians, instead of the Germans. There is nothing whatsoever to be said in favor of these, as from every possible point of view they are quite worthless, and reflect badly on the intelligence of the person found reading them. To read them is a sign of premature senility !"

        "title": "Are examinations a fair test of our knowledge ?",
        "content": "That there must be some measurement or 'yardstick' when judging proficiency is universally greed. The fact that an individual thinks that he had mastered a certain subject or craft is not in itself enough. There must be some outside impersonal test so that other people like school masters or prospective employers can know too. Hence, examinations of all kinds are a traditional part of educational policy in both the East and the West. from the age of eleven or twelve, when selection is made from primary to secondary education, right up to Ordinary Level Certificate Examinations and on to advanced degree course, examinations are set and must be taken in specific subjects and periods or work. Not only are examinations given in theoretical subjects as well. The Royal Society of Arts and the \"City and Guilds\", are two examining bodies in Great Britain which concentrate almost entirely on technical subjects such as carpentry and mechanics.\nGreat care is always given by educational establishments to the preparation for examinations. The required with suitable text-books is always covered and \"mock\" examination and revision are extensively given. The quality of the teaching is generally high. This is important, because all learning, particularly for examinations is two way combination of the efforts of both the teacher and the pupil. The pupil must, of course, do the necessary work and committing to memory and if he had done so, then he should be able to pass the examination for which he and his teacher have been working.\n\nExamining bodies are fair. They are not the natural enemies of the candidate and are not out either to \"trap\" or \"trick\" them. Hence, in such subjects as geography or history, a very wide choice of topics is almost invariably given. This, of course, is a considerable help to the candidate because out of such a choice, there are almost certain to be several questions that he can answer really well.\n\nFacts speak for themselves and it is true, in both the East and the West that the majority of candidates do pass the examinations for which they have entered. Successful people do not criticize the system. it is the failures who do and who say that examinations are not a fair test of knowledge. The truth is that the failures have not done a sufficient amount of work and even they, it must be remembered are always given a second chance !\n\nThe real criticism may be that examinations take no account of the human factor.\n\nIt is human beings who take them and therefore, human failings and limitations are bound to enter into any assessment of the problem.\n\nThere is first of all, the very nervous student who may well have learnt the work, attended all the classes and used his brain. Indeed, he may have a very bright brain, capable of original thought as well as of dedication to learning. And yet despite all this, if in the examination room, he really is frightened and \"overcome\" with nerves, then facts and opinions may well leave his head entirely. His mind will be a blank in extreme cases. For such people, the examination would not be a fair test, but fortunately such people are rare !\n\nEqually human illnesses must be taken into account. A headache, a common cold, minor in themselves can upset a candidate's entire equilibrium. An 'upset' at home, a quarrel with a boy or girl friend -- all these things can \"put a candidate off\" and on the examination day contribute to his not doing his best. The fact that some examinations are given when the children are too young and before their mind is fully developed, mature and retentive is another argument against their fairness. This applies particularly to the ones taken between the ages of eleven and fourteen the results of which, educationally, decide the child's future.\n\nSome educational authorities, realizing the possible unfairness of selection at so early an age have devised an alternative which could apply to other types of examinations as well. The alternative is an assessment by teachers and tutors of semester work and general capabilities. Both of these are open to abuse. Semester work can be copied from books and teachers and tutors can allow personal likes and dislikes to influence their judgment. A really good alternative to examinations has not yet been found, but our present system despite its minor faults is fair and has the approval of wise educational bodies throughout the world"

        "title": "Should efforts be made to preserve traditional forms of dress ?",
        "content": "Most countries wish to preserve their national character and have every right to do so. National dress is part of this character. The question of preserving it only arises when for business and other reasons a significant group of foreigners enters the country and perhaps settles there. They bring their culture with them; business offices, machinery, technology and communications. Over the decades, Western dress has evolved to meet these requirements. Men wear suits with pockets for pens, diaries, money etc; women import their own styles and use hand or shoulder bags. Formal, casual and sports wear has accompanied this standard form of day dress. The effect of this has been that local inhabitants have copied the immigrants and have relegated traditional dress to the observance of national customs and ceremonies and religious festivals. The danger is that traditional dress may thus be lost forever.\nThe above applies to countries which either have dealings with the West or lie within it's sphere of influence. The same is true of the Communist bloc. The worker's tunic, trousers and flat cap, often used by both sexes, has spread far outside the boundaries of Soviet Russia, with the same effect. The problem does not of course arise with the uncommitted countries. A further, and international influence si the style of dress favored by young people; tee shirts, jeans and trainers.\n\nPart of the problems has been that these imported styles are somehow considered better than the traditional styles, and certainly more fashionable. This is not true. In almost every case, traditional dress could be easily adapted to fit modern requirements without any loss of character. A sarong is more elegant than a blouse and skirt, and the colorful materials of traditional male dress are much more aesthetically pleasing than the business suit. Both are probably more comfortable and hygienic than their modern counterparts since they have developed in relation to the heat and humidity of equatorial climates. The European swelters in a so-called lightweight suit or dress when in West Africa, Malaysia, Singapore or India. Why should not he or she use local dress rather than unsuitable imported garments ?\n\nThe change from national to imported dress is bad for local clothing industries and may cause unemployment. This is a good governmental reason for supporting the continued production of local dress, as well as the other folk industries which produce traditional artefacts such as sandals, handbags, household wares, etc.\n\nAll this raises the question, 'should long-term immigrants or settlers impose their own culture or assimilate to the local culture ?' The answer should be to assimilate.\n\nSometimes immigrants claim that racial origin, politics, or religion dictate the forms of dress, hairstyle etc that they should use overseas. Again, all arguments seem to favor assimilation to local custom as a duty, in return for the hospitality they have received. In Britain, Sikhs insist on wearing turbans when riding motorcycles, thus technically contravening the law, which stipulates helmets. Britons of British origin have to obey the law. Why should exceptions be made for immigrants ?\n\nWhatever the intellectuals may think is good for us, the paying public will always vote with its feet. Entertainment in the widest sense remains the primary objective of the Arts if the Arts are to survive."

        "title": "Are you for or against zoos ?",
        "content": "Until recently the case for zoos was never questioned. They were accepted as useful and entertaining amenities which were also educational. Children love seeing animals, and a visit to the zoo has always been a treat.\ngradually however unrest has grown about the morality of keeping animals, reptiles and birds in captivity, though not on grounds of ill-treatment, lack of hygiene or incorrect feeding. The concept of confining them in cages became suspect. More than fifty years ago a wildlife park was established at Whipsnade in Bedfordshire, UK, and since the second World war in the grounds of large houses such as Longleat. The major-attraction types of animals such as lion, tigers and elephants thus have room to move freely and to set up their own social structures. they are fenced off from the public except in 'safari parks' where people can see them at close quarters from rover type vehicles.\n\nThere are four points in favor of zoos, and arguments against them all. the first is conservation. Due to over shooting and deforestation in Africa, India and elsewhere, many species are endangered or becoming extinct. The koala bear, some types of deer and the Arabian oryx are examples. Attempts to mate these in captivity have been successful, with the result that their natural habitats have been re-stocked. This process is expensive and time-consuming, however.\n\nSometimes it is unsuccessful. Sometimes animals bred in captivity cannot adapt to the wild, and either die or fall prey to predators. The fact is that only 5% of endangered species are to be found in zoos, so the whole concept may be wrong. These arguments do not of course apply to bird sanctuaries, where the birds are encouraged to frequent natural but protected habitats, and are never confined.\n\nThe main argument against is that available money should be put into the saving of natural habitats. Realistically, this is totally impracticable overseas, and difficult enough in the country concerned.\n\nPoint two is that zoos are educational. Seeing and touching animals means much more to a child than any number of good books or pictures. Children have a chance to touch, groom and ride on animals in a modern zoo. Some zoos specialize in activity centers which generate love of animals, understanding and enjoyment. The counter to this argument is that animals dislike being domesticated for any reason, and that in the strict sense the zoo does not further education. Zoology is best learnt in the classroom, in the laboratory, and from the text-book. Another counter-argument is that for close contact, visual or actual, cages must be small. This inhibits exercise, and worse, prevents the putting together of enough animals to allow for natural social behavior, i.e the setting up of families and clans. However it is conceded that given large enough cages or confined areas with sufficient animals these defects can be largely overcome. It has to be said that zoos are constantly improving their facilities and bringing them into line with the animals' natural surroundings as far as possible. the polar bear house in London Zoo is currently being remodeled in this way.\n\nIf the wishes of the public are to be considered, zoos as recreational amenities have a large following, and should be kept. Children have been mentioned, but the informative booklets, scripts and tapes available in a modern zoo attract the adult also. Entrance takings are high, and money becomes available for research as well as improvement. Some agree; others ask why animals should be made a peep-show.\n\nThe fourth argument for zoos is that they not only allow for research but also finance it. This again is not considered a valid argument by the opponents. 'What kind of research ?' people ask. In the case of the London Zoo the answer is that they have an Institute of Zoology. This produces comparative surveys, statistics for analysis, and data bases. The veterinary branch learns how best to keep animals and treat them when sick. Animal nutrition is studied. Problems of re-introduction into the wild are studied. Animal behavior is studied. Nothing was known about the social habits of the rhinoceros until specimens were brought into captivity and observed in suitable surroundings.\n\nWhat of the future ? Despite all arguments to the contrary, the continued development of zoos seems to be a valid policy. The old defects will be overcome. Surroundings will be made larger and more natural. There is also a strong case for the specialized zoo or sanctuary, such as the woolly monkey sanctuary at Looe, in Cornwall, UK. This provides conservation, education about their kinship and social life in natural colonies, plus personal contact, with opportunities to touch and groom; also lectures. The future may lie in this direction."

        "content": "A degree of superstition is built into the history of very race. The few remaining peoples living simple and remote lives still govern their actions by superstitions. Many African tribes live by a double standard. They adopt Western Attitudes for the most part, but the witch-doctor still wields great power. One wealthy example claimed that he could not only predict the winners of the World Cup but also, for due payment, prevent any participating team from winning, and all this from his native village. Some people believe him.\nMore sophisticated people tend to adopt a superior attitude to superstition. Yet despite themselves they sometimes find that they behave as though the believed in it.\n\nSuperstitions have varying origins. Most are based in some kind of religious belief, ranging from animism to the monotheism of the Muslim and Christian religions. In animism, all natural phenomena are held to be governed by different spirits, and care must be taken both to please and to propitiate. For example, fishermen have beach ceremonies to ensure favor i.e a good catch. These customs are understandable, but life lived in this way can become over-restrictive. Development is hampered.\n\nIn the case of the Christian Faith, the Roman Catholics have always laid great store by the efficacy of relics of the saints, or some place previously hallowed by virtue, such as Lourdes, in respect of healing the sick. On occasion, these superstitions are efficacious, though ti is hard o say how much of this healing is due to the patient's own faith. Any why should some be healed and not others ? At any rate, superstition of this kind cannot easily be dismissed. Veneration of images, the use of holy water etc come into this category.\n\nScience and sophistication have done much to eradicate superstition from Western and Westernized society. Adam Smith wrote \"science is the antidote to superstition\", meaning that people's actions should be governed by rational thought. Most people today would deny that superstition plays any part in their lives. Yet ironically British people for example still observe certain taboos, of which the following examples are typical; it is bad luck to bring certain plants into the house, such as lilac; if you fear had luck you touch wood, originally to appease the powerful wood spirit; if you spill salt at table you throw a pinch over your left shoulder. This gets into the eyes of the devil and thwarts his evil intentions. For some reason you do not walk under a ladder, perhaps because the painter above may drop his pot on your head !\n\nLogically, most superstitions can be dismissed as having their origins in ignorance. Yet there is a hard core of superstition which seems to work without any rational explanation. in the end, superstition may die out completely, but that time is far ahead."

        "content": "A slightly eccentric professor of archaeology in West Africa would neither answer the telephone nor reply to letters. 'As for letters' , he would say, 'leave them long enough and they answer themselves. As for the telephone, I consider it an unwarranted intrusion. If people want to talk to me they can come and see me'. Of course the world could not carry on it its modern way without the telephone, which has become an essential part of living. Yet in some respects it can be a curse.\nToday, telephonic communication is worldwide and instantaneous. It is possible to dial people at the other end of the world without even going through an operator. This is fine, providing the time-differences are remembered. More seriously, in conjunction with satellite television, world news is instantly on our screens, sometimes even as it happens. Such exposure of, usually, unhappy events, wars, accidents, acts of terrorism etc can actually have a bad influence on the course of a war, a hostage-taking, or a tribal massacre. when it took a British ship four months to deliver a letter to or from, say, India, the crisis had often been settled locally, with much less anxiety all round.\n\nThe telephone has greatly decreased the volume of mail worldwide. Some letters have to be written, of course, but the art of private letter writing has become a dying art. Writing a good letter means first collecting then sorting out one's thoughts, and the finished article can be something to be proud of, a small masterpiece. And because letters today are considered of secondary importance, mail services in many countries have greatly deteriorated.\n\nOne of the most annoying experiences in life is to be seated in somebody's office and to begin to talk business when suddenly the telephone rings. 'Oh excuse me', says the official, 'I must answer this'. Why should the telephone be given priority over the individual who has taken the trouble to attend in person ?\n\nThe telephone can become a curse in the home, when it is abused either by the caller or by a family member. Most countries have customary hours for mealtimes, and a caller who is determined to speak to you at all costs will often make use of this knowledge, interrupt your meal, and perhaps or perhaps not apologize for doing so. Small wonder that many people take the phone off the hook when they sit down to eat.\n\nThere are the callers you can well do without. Some commercial concerns employ salespeople to use the 'hard sell' on the telephone, and this is becoming such a nuisance that in many cases the problem is being brought under legal control. The worst kind of unwanted calls are abusive calls or obscene calls, made usually to single women and often late at night. Modern telephone systems can be made to identify the source of these calls, and this should to some way to helping the police solve the problem.\n\nFamily members have been mentioned, and here one thinks of the commercial exploitation of teenagers who are pressed to use 'chatlines' to pour out their troubles, or to talk to teenager 'pals' overseas. Neither occupation offers any benefit, and the parents' phone bill may become astronomical.\n\nDoes all this mean that the telephone is really a curse ? Of course not. Like any other advance in science the telephone is neutral. If it is abused, it becomes a curse. If properly used it is a great blessing in many ways.\n\nTo the lonely person, telephone chats are a blessing. To the disabled person, the telephone may be the only means of keeping in touch with family and friends. To the business, the stock exchange, and countless other features of modern life, the telephone is essential. In the police response to crime, in fire or medical emergencies, the telephone is indispensable. In all matters which require urgent communication and quick urgent communication and quick response, such as the locating of suitable bodily organs for transplant surgery, the telephone is a boon. From air to ground and ship to shore communication, the telephone is vital. Properly and responsibly used, it is a blessing."

        "content": "The title of the old American movie 'Poor little rich girl' answers the question. It is true that at weddings we often hear the newly-weds toasted in the words 'Health, Wealth and Happiness', but the epithet itself distinguishes between the three objectives. The fact is that you can be both happy and healthy and poor, by normal standards at the same time. Yet if you are unhappy, money can only cure your misery in some circumstances. And if you have an incurable illness o amount of money can buy the treatment to reverse that condition.\nMost people would accept that the human being is a composite of body, mind and spirit. Each of those parts has separate needs which must be fulfilled if happiness is to result. This fulfilment is most often, though not always, achieved through the love and companionship found in a good marriage. The newlyweds referred to above may start out together with few possessions and little money and still be blissfully happy. Body, mind and spirit are fulfilled. yet marital happiness is not a static thing. as the couple grow older they change, and happiness has to be constantly worked for if it is to mature into lifelong love and friendship. sadly enough the divorce rate in the west shows that many couples lack that incentive, and are not prepared to show the unselfishness and willingness to put the needs of each other first, necessary if happiness is to last. Very often, this process of alienation goes on at the very time when the couple are getting past their money problems, when the pennies no longer have to be counted.\n\nThis situation is highlighted when money never has been a problem, as in the case of some of the British royal family. Differences in outlook, i.e. in mind and spirit, sever relationships most effectively. Whereas one royal, for instance, was interested only in farming and country pursuits, the wife, some years ago, decided to devote her life to 'Save the Children'. Money never entered the equation. They are permanently separated. Mind and spirit had grown apart.\n\nIf 'old' money can be irrelevant, 'new' money can be a positive menace. every week in England somebody becomes a sterling millionaire having entered a winning football pool forecast. More often than not, the winner's cry is 'spend, spend, spend !', and the money soon goes. In the process, homes shatter, bad relationships are formed, drugs and alcohol are bused, and often the winner ends up with nothing.\n\nSo at least this can be said. Money itself is neutral. The ideal is wise stewardship, i.e. its proper use, which generally means making one's existing lifestyle more comfortable, but using excess income for charitable purposes. Money should not be seen as the key to luxury and self-indulgence. Money is not the root of all evil, but the correct version is true enough; 'the love of money is the root of all evil' (Christian New Testament). the love of money is a cold, alienating obsession. Was Howard Hughes a happy man ?\n\nWhat can also be said is that whereas money cannot buy happiness, the lack of it can bring misery. Few things are worse than debt, as the family of Charles Dickens' Mr Micawber knew full well. It is the duty of men, and in many cases today of women, to provide enough money for the family to live in reasonable comfort. It is not their duty to provide that comfort by going into debt. The modern way of doing so is through the credit card which if abused is the sure road to unhappiness. as Dickens said, 'annual income £1 annual expenditure 19s 6d, the result, happiness. Annual income £1 annual expenditure £1 6d, the result, misery'.\n\nThere is, perhaps, one sense in which money can buy happiness, and that is among the poorest of the poor in the third world. Happiness for them would be a safe home, enough food, medical care, and a school for their children. One day, the conscience of the world will ensure that they are given these things."

        "content": "The word 'sport' covers a multitude of activities, ranging from athletics to the 'field' sports, hunting, shooting and fishing, from rowing to equestrian events, from boxing to hockey and soccer. To assert that TV will kill these off is obvious nonsense. With or without TV, the instinct to pursue these activities will remain. Sport enhances health, builds muscle, satisfies the competitive instinct, encourages fair play, and creates friendships and excellent social contacts among those who share sporting interests. Since Greek and Roman times, when the Olympics were founded, and took place, as today, at four-yearly intervals, sport in some shape or form has always been a leisure occupation, and it will certainly take more than the 'down'-side of television to kill it off. we will consider that 'down'-side in a moment.\nFirst, the benefits of television coverage should be appreciated. It is undeniable that televised sport offers first-class entertainment to those who are interested. The watcher watches in comfort, out of the rain and the cold. It is also undeniable that some sports, e.g. golf, come across far better on TV than they possibly can to the spectator on the spot. The cameras keep up with the ball in it's full arc, underlining the outstanding prowess of the top players. Team games can also be watched in comfort, and again with a comprehensive view of the whole pitch. The zoom-lens gives close-ups from many angles, and the immediate play-back facility shows the top-class players' abilities, the fouls, both accidental and 'professional', and the refereeing standards. All brilliantly exposed. Sponsorship provides crucial funds to sports teams at all levels, whether their matches are televised or not. Sponsors fund teams in proportion to television coverage and ground attendance. So improvements to grounds and spectator facilities are made possible, and money is provided fo the purchase of star players. Finally, to be able to watch the top players perform with apparently effortless brilliance must encourage young people to go out and try to do likewise. Today, sponsorship provides money for the rich rewards available to stars, and this offers an added incentive to young hopefuls.\n\nOf course, televised sport has its drawbacks. Many people believe that ideally all sport should be amateur, the pursuit of physical excellence for its won sake, and with no financial reward. The film 'Chariots of Fire' highlighted a brilliant young miler. But as he moved towards Olympic status he too had a trainer ! Was the trainer unpaid ? It is certainly true that television encourages professionalism, even among amateurs. Rugby football in the UK, the amateur game, has been forced into a league system, which leads to star 'poaching'. It also moves players towards demanding money, particularly when training occupies an increasing amount of unpaid time. Stars, who lose months every year on tours, must, realistically, be repaid. At present, amateurs are indirectly recompensed through giving their names to newspaper articles, by writing and signing books, by endorsements of sports goods and by appearances at functions. Television exposure is behind all this. This is why many people basically disapprove. The line between the pro and the amateur is becoming blurred.\n\nAnother criticism is more arguable. It is that many people are becoming sport watchers rather than sport players. There is also the argument that the television has reduced gates at unglamorous matches and events, and this has already led to the sale of many run of the mill clubs, or their liquidation. Moreover, the excitement of the crowd atmosphere is lost in one's own home. As with the cinema, a visit is preferable to watching on the 'box'.\n\nThirdly, there is the old Olympic ideal. This is, partly, to spread international good-will. Today, through satellite television, the Olympics are watched worldwide by untold millions. Does this foster goodwill and fair play, or does it tend to nationalism, a 'win at all costs' attitude ? And it may be coincidence, but drug abuse among athletes has grown up alongside television.\n\nThe money motivation has been mentioned. It seems not unreasonable for players, whether amateur or professional, to be properly recompensed, but television creates 'stars', whether real or bogus, and these people can demand enormous sums, out of all proportion to their contributions and abilities. This 'hype' is to be deplored. It does nothing for sport.\n\nSo television may be said to do as much harm as good. However, it will never be the 'death of sport'."

        "title": "Reading novels is a waste of time'. Discuss",
        "content": "The designation 'novel' covers a very wide spectrum of literature. It comprises the classic works of fiction of all countries. By definition, a novel is a prose piece of over 60,000 words. Many are much longer. Anything shorter is a 'novella'; if much shorter, a short story. The genre grew up independently in many countries, particularly those of Europe. Though since this is an English General Paper it is the English (or British) tradition that will generally be referred to, with occasional references to countries which have produced fiction in some kind of English, such as the USA.\nFiction of course is not limited to the classics, which form a relatively small part of it. For at least three centuries the bookshops have always been full of the more ephemeral kinds of prose; the American 'block-buster', the J Arthur Clarke type of space fiction, the ghost story, the detective 'who dunnit?', the romantic novel, the psychological thriller; the historical novel, the adventure story, he war story. the list is endless.\n\nIt is quite possible to become 'hooked' on novel reading, and this has two dangers. To read novels when you should be doing something else, e.g. study, or practical chores, is indeed a waste of time. And it is never courteous to have one's nose in a novel when visitors arrive ! Secondly, there are some people who find in a novel a means of escape from reality. This has other dangers. Too much relapse into fantasy may destroy one's ability to face facts.\n\nIf reading novels can be a waste of time. Reading bad novels is always a waste of time and can be positively harmful. A really bad novel is not easy to define, but for anybody with intellect it has some, or even all of the following features; unreality in characterization and situation, poor construction, concentration on sex and violence for the sake of it, bad language generally, a biased attitude to people, situations and issues, and stereo typing of characters.\n\nThat said, to read anything is arguably better than reading nothing, or sinking to the bottom line, mindless television watching. At least the capacity to read demonstrates that one is literate. In Britain today there is an alarming number of school leavers from the state system who can neither read nor write.\n\nThe case for reading the classics need hardly be made. Their characters live, and are of their time. Descriptions of town and country engross the reader. Stories, and therefore plots, seems to grow out of the characters. Often, great national events, wars and revolutions provide the background, but are integral at the same time. Characters and great events affect each other. The same process is seen in the good political, maritime or war story. The classical novel provides a window on another world; good contemporary novels offer new insights into our own world. The reader will inevitably gain in knowledge and understanding from this class of literature. Such reading supplies valuable background material for other studies; history, sociology politics, psychology and economies.\n\nHowever, life is not all self-improvement, or shouldn't be. Reading for pure relaxation can do the reader nothing but good. The poor, ugly girl may find a therapeutic escape in a romantic novel, just such a person as she is may be picked up by a dark handsome, rich, even aristocratic stranger and transported into new worlds of delight. why not ? It will never happen, but there is no harm in dreaming. And there is the comfortable, stately world of the 'country house murder', where death is relatively bloodless, and the culprit turns out to be the colonel, the butler, or a rogue vicar. Pitting one's wits against the author's is a good form of relaxation. So, to the English reader, are the novels of P G Wodehouse, which open windows on the life of the idle rich in England in the 20s, contain absolutely no social comment on the rigid class system of the time, are brilliantly constructed, and contain laughs on every page.\n\nProviso have been mentioned, and given those, no sane person could say that reading novels is a waste of time."

        "title": "\"Young people are slaves to fashion.\" Discuss",
        "content": "Young people, or 'teenagers', are an invention of the American exploitation of the early 60s. The contemporary hype built them up into a separate class of society, and since jobs and money were plentiful in those days the promotion of fashion in dress, music, politics and general outlook proved very profitable. Prior to 1960 people aged under eighteen were children, above eighteen, adults.\nThe cult swept the USA, then Britain and Europe, and finally many Eastern and Far Eastern countries, even where it was proscribed, as in China and pre-Gorbachev Russia. The promoters made full use of two factors common to the thirteen to eighteen age group; adolescent insecurity, and the concominant desire to conform to peer pressures. hence they became slaves to fashion.\n\nAs already indicated, 'fashion' applied not only to clothes but to the whole of life. Some of it was harmless enough. Throughout history the instinct to conform to current clothing styles was an unchanging phenomenon in the adult world. Up to the 60s, young people wore schools uniform; in leisure hours, adult clothing. The radical change in the early 60s reflected the post-war instinct to defy conventions which were basically pre-war, and therefore associated with adult repression. So the tee-shirt and jeans culture was born, the tee-shirts carrying anti-establishment legends, references to hard left social policies, the lure of uncontrolled sex, the support of homosexuality, the attractions of the 'drop-out' culture, and the wonders of the fast growing hallucinatory drug scene.\n\nAs mentioned, some of this was inevitable and harmless. Some of it was pernicious. The pernicious element was centered in San Francisco, though it later infected London, Paris, and other major cities.\n\nAlongside this arose the 'pop music' cult, and the successful stars and groups became the objects of hysterical teenage adulation. Presley, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles became the wealthy heroes. The subversive and corrupting views of some of them did immense harm. the fashions they set became irresistable.\n\nIn the later 60s and 70s, violence as well as drugs, alcohol and indiscriminate sex became fashionable. In Britain, for example, teenagers of both sexes joined one of two fashionable groups, the 'Mods' and the 'Rockers'. The Mods wore trendy, velveteen styles and rode mopeds. The Rockers dressed in leather and rode powerful motorbikes. Large groups of each faction would foregather in the main seaside resorts and engage in pitched, sometimes blood battles. Later, the same cross-section turned to violent protest, vandalism and football hooliganism. The police have managed to stamp out most of this, and most teenage hysteria is currently connected with the 'pop' scene and the occasional 'acid house' party. for thirty years the slavish following of fashion has led many young people astray.\n\nBut not all. Every coin has two sides, and despite all the foregoing many, perhaps the majority of young people are proving to be a very fine generation. certainly they conform to teenage dress norms, enjoy 'pop' music and modern dance, but in all essential respects they are first-class, certainly far more worthwhile than most of my contemporaries at the same age. we were conformist to adult ideas and attitudes, but in many ways we were lazy, self-interested, and entirely lacking in any real social conscience. we were quite oblivious to the overseas poor, the environment, the victims of disaster, whether natural or man made, and to the animal world. In fact, we were selfish, and rather self-indulgent. No drugs, certainly, but plenty of cigarettes and alcohol.\n\nToday, many admirable features are seen in the young. They are individualistic rather than conformist. They eschew smoking, drugs and alcohol. They are fitter and generally more athletic than their predecessors. Many do social work in their spare time and some spend a year on voluntary service overseas. They have a conscience about people less fortunate and about the well-being of our world. They work hard and prepare for a market in which jobs are far from plentiful.\n\nAdmittedly, the media nowadays bring the world's suffering and problems to their attention with an immediacy unknown in earlier days. Yet the fact is that they respond. They are slaves, not so much to fashion, as to their consciences, and that is by no means a bad form of slavery."

        "title": "Can telling lies ever be justified ?",
        "content": "The old admonition to children, 'speak the truth and shame the devil', runs contrary to what is called the schoolboy's eleventh commandment; 'tell a lie, and stick to it'. The one adage advocates honesty at whatever personal cost. When charged with some illicit tree-felling the young George Washington is said to have said 'I cannot tell a lie'. Those who advocate moral rectitude always argue that honesty is the best policy. Those who do not say 'get away with wrongdoing if you can'. Thus, as a child you avoid punishment. As an adult, you hope to avoid the consequences of your actions. The one is the result of a strong sense of morality. The other stems from self-interest and indifference to the fate of other people. Silence itself may amount to a lie, particularly when it is meant to shift blame from oneself. Cicero said 'it is the nature of a scoundrel to deceive by lying', and it may well be argued that truth is an integral factor in the health of society. Justice itself depends on witnesses pledging themselves to 'speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth'. The law has severe penalties fro those who perjure themselves after taking this oath.\n\nSo logically there should be no circumstances in which lying can ever be justified. Yet we can all think of occasions when to tell the truth would be a very mixed blessing.\n\nThis applies especially to those who have access to secrets of national importance, particularly in wartime, or when there is danger or war. In these circumstances another moral issue is raised, and that is where personal loyalty lies. Most would say to one's own country. For others, a strong political belief, based on conviction, is more cogent. So, during the 'Cold war' between NATO and the Communist bloc, people on both sides were prepared to betray their country's secrets. This was generally out of conviction rather than for money, though the spy was usually rewarded in some way, sometimes by asylum and the conferring of honors and position.\n\nSuch men and women would argue, and some still do, that the ultimate end justifies the means, and if the means included lying and deception, so be it.\n\nThe same principle applied particularly in the 1939 -- 45 war. The allies relied heavily on agents, and the lies which were part of their stock-in-trade. 'Disinformation' was born and played a prominent role on both sides. Some of the deception was very elaborate indeed. Hitler's forces in France were tricked into believing that the invasion would be at the Pas de Calais rather than along the Normandy coast. England created a wholly fictitious army in the wrong place by setting up a subtle system of signaling, designed to be picked up across the channel. German doubts were settled by the 'planting' of spurious invasion plans by agents in France. As a result, the invasion was given a good start. every patriotic Englishman would say that all the lies and deception were amply justified both by the motivation and in the event. In much the same way, the British Ministry of Information concealed some failures and exaggerated some successes for the same of morale. It was morale which enabled Britain to counter what seemed to be inevitable defeat.\n\nSo the good of others seems to go a long way towards justifying the lie, and this applies in some personal as well as national concerns. No body would applaud the man or woman who lied about extra-marital relations. The more honorable course is not to have any. Yet it is not always kind to tell the brutal truth about a severe illness such as a cancer to a patient or to his to her relations just as soon as the illness is diagnosed. Treatment may be successful, so unnecessary sadness has been caused. Yet if not, there must come a time when the facts are disclosed. Not to do so prevents the patient from making testatory provisions. It also increases the shock to the family and friends when death actually occurs.\n\nKindness may be a good reason, if not to tell a lie, at least to be 'economical with the truth'. Another is tact. These two virtues oil the wheels of all social relationships. A lady may have chosen a hat which she obviously loves dearly, but you think it is hideous. Never tell her, even if you cannot bring yourself to say 'Wonderful ! Super !' There are ways of side-stepping the issue. Anyway, dress is a matter of opinion rather than of fact, and what does it matter ? no good at all could be down by 'telling the truth', and absolutely no harm done by withholding it."

        "title": "Work is the only route to happiness'. Discuss.",
        "content": "The ideal put forward to young people has, traditionally, been mens sana in corpore sano', and this implies a proper balance between work and play. Yet to achieve happiness, that coveted but elusive state of total fulfilment, requires more. it is true that mankind in general, though with exceptions, has a built-in instinct for work. The vast gulf separating humanity from its physical origins, the animal world, is due to millennia of cerebral and physical activity. yet there are other equally powerful instincts in the human make-up. The desire, in most cases, to form life-long emotional attachments; the instinct, again most cases, to start a family; the making of friendships; the search for a fulfilling occupation, to name the most obvious.\nIn some countries there are a privileged few who are born into possessions, money and position, so the need to work in the normal sense does not apply to them. Yet it is noticeable that these people generally fins some worth-while occupation. This may be anything from estate management to patronage of some charitable institution to participation in the 'pop' scene. This again indicates that to follow some kind of occupation, whether useful or not, is a genuine instinct.\n\nHistory supports this view, and literature has produced many sayings expressing the value, perhaps the necessity of work. 'Satan hath some mischief yet for idle hands to do'; 'our best friend is work' (Collin d'Harleville); 'to youth I have but three words of counsel -- work of counsel -- work, work, work' (Bismarck); 'sow work and thous shalt reap gladness' (Proverb); 'work wont' kill but worry will' (Proverb).\n\nFor most of us work is both a necessity and a source of fulfilment. we need a regular income, just as our country needs part of the wealth we create and claims through taxation. The fulfilment of the instincts mentioned in Para I cannot be achieved without money. The right use of money is of course important; Charles Dickens made the point that to live sixpence below one's income led to happiness; to live sixpence above led to misery.\n\nThe definition of work is wide, ranging from manual labor to the highest forms of intellectual activity. We are not all suited to every kind of work. I would be of little use as manual worker, since my skills in that direction are limited. Conversely, not all manual workers could do my work. Among other things I write a little. I was once asked 'What motivated you to write ?', the questioner expecting some 'high-falutin' answer. I was tempted to answer 'Money!' In fact the best writers have all taken this view. Only the second rate prattle about 'artistic fulfilment'.\n\nSo the worthwhile student spends his or her early years developing the skills which will lead to gainful employment; not to amass money for its own sake, but for what money can do. As life goes on, money becomes less important, though at any stage it only assumes importance when one has too little of it.\n\nRealistically, during the current worldwide trade recession, the sad problem many people have to face is unemployment or redundancy. One hopes that this will soon pass. Some countries have training and re-training schemes to prepare their workforces for the end of the recession. The fact that lack of work is so frustrating highlights the motivations for work already mentioned.\n\nIn any discussion of work it's dangers must not be overlooked. It is possible to be so obsessed with work that other highly important human considerations are neglected, with disastrous results. The 'workoholic' neglects his or her family. This may lead to separation, divorce, and or problems with growing children, not to mention damage to human relations generally. Trollope had a character, the Duke of Omnium. He was a most worthy and honorable character, became Prime Minister, worked indefatigably for the parliamentary acceptance of a decimal coinage. His wife and family, all admirably provided for, let him down consistently in various ways. His human sympathies had atrophied.\n\nThe love of money, work's product, may become even more dangerous. Charles Dickens' character, Scrooge, is an example. Another is Silas Marner, who did not reform his outlook until his store of gold coins had been stolen, and until he was confronted with the human need to bring up a small child.\n\nSo in general terms the topic-statement has to be supported, but with all the provisos mentioned. Like any other human instinct, it's expression must be wisely handled."

        "title": "Do you think that rituals, customs and ceremonies still have a part to play in modern society",
        "content": "There are several factors which appear to militate against the continuation of ritual customs and ceremonies in modern society. The first is the life-style norm in industrialized and westernized countries. An agricultural existence may be hard, but it is steady and unhurried. Modern living is fast living. Men and women work perhaps sixty hours a week in the factor, office or shop. Food imports means that they are less dependent on the land, so the old customs connected with fertility and the propitiation of hostile spirits, all based in animistic beliefs, have become irrelevant. The climate of outlook has also changed. The religious and political hold of the old time chiefs has largely been replaced by democracy, in some cases one of the enlightened religions, an din others a kind of hybrid of materialism and humanism. So it might seem that the new will inevitably replace the old, inexorably if not quickly.\nIn some respects, ritual, custom and ceremony may have a reactionary, indeed at times positively malevolent influence. The modern world has set certain standards of human rights, in religion, in sexual and racial parity, in speech, in education, in political freedom, in freedom of travel. The objective is humane behavior within countries, and international peace and co-operation. Yet in certain countries barbaric customs remain, especially where women are denied equality. Suttee. The harem. Slavery. Female circumcision. the cutting off of hands for theft. Floggings. Automatic torture, isolation and deprivation for prisoners, whether political or criminal. There is no place for these customs in the modern world.\n\nYet some customs remain good, and should not be abandoned. The custom of hospitality to strangers, and of ensuring their safety while they stay with the host. The custom of giving to the poor. The custom of helping one's neighbor in distress. Many customs connected with the dead, for example the wake. This ensures solidarity with the bereaved, and has a strong therapeutic effect. Customs connected with courtesy; behavior in public and as a guest; good manners at table, the wearing of the correct dress for a particular occasion. Modern society would be poorer without these things.\n\nMuch the same applies to rituals and ceremonies. Where any of these retain a helpful meaning they are worth preserving. Of course some have lost their original significance with the passage of time, and should be discarded. yet very many, particularly those connected with religion, remain powerful for good. Religious services are more meaningful if they include music, color and movement, and where each action brings an article of the faith concerned vividly to life. Much the same applies to the coronation of a monarch, where religion meets power and authority in ceremonial. the fact that judges wear special robes, and enter court in procession, reflects the dignity of the law. The same applies to the Speaker's procession in the UK House of Commons. The same applies to the military ceremonies of Changing the Guard and Trooping the colors. The service for the lunching of a ship recognizes the mariner's dependence on God. There are also worthwhile ceremonies connected with receiving a degree, or being called to the bar. Wedding and funeral ceremonies reflect happiness or sorrow and solemnity. Even the All Blacks carry out a Maori war dance before a match, and they remain very hard to beat !\n\nHowever modern, practical and enlightened modern society may be, people remain the products of their ancestry. History has passed on a profusion of rituals, customs and ceremonies. Some have become meaningless, or are positively inhumane and society can do without them. However, probably far more enrich the lives of those whose existence could easily become barren and humdrum if the past were to be discarded."

        "title": "Manners in modern life",
        "content": "In any community, whether ancient or modern, good manners differentiate the civilized person from the barbarian. The outward forms of good manners are known as \"convention\" and these vary according to the traditions of different countries. Basically, \"good manners\" may be defined as \"consideration for others.\" Consideration for self is unfortunately more natural than consideration for others -- such is human nature ! Therefore, in every society, good manners are a matter of training; a child is made to follow the outward forms in the justifiable hope that the desire to be well-mannered may follow.\nWilliam of Sykeham, who founded Winchester College gave a motto tot he School : \"Manners make the Man\". At that time, \"manners\" meant \"character,\" and the motto is at least a pointer to the fact that the two are connected.\n\nMan's object, whether admitted or not, is to be a \"gentleman.\" To be a gentleman, according to Robert Surtees, means \"never to talk about being a gentleman.\" It also seems to mean behaving in a civilized way even when alone. \"A gentleman is one who uses the butter knife when he eats alone and has to wash up.\" But Michael Arlen perhaps said the last word : \"A gentleman s a man who is never rude unintentionally.\"\n\nOne criticism of the modern (i.e Western ) way of life is that good manners are fast disappearing, and the disappearance is lamented by reflective members of both sexes. There appear to be more reasons than one.\n\nFirstly, manners assume certain social attitudes between the sexes in various world societies. In Chinese and Muslim societies, there are certain attitudes between man and woman based on \"customs\" which are in turn based partly on religion. The Chinese mainland custom of \"self-denigration\", the role of the geisha in Japanese society and a host of other national conventions are \"good manners\" within their respective spheres. In the Far East, the \"West\" has crudely broken into the various systems. The working scope, the dress, the aspirations of the Eastern woman are in the process of radical change. How then can one define \"good manners\" in Singapore ? at present one cannot, but a new structure will emerge, combining the best of the old and new. In the Western World, the past 80 yeas of female emancipation has produced fundamental changes.\n\nUntil 1918 in Britain, women were voteless, without separate property rights in marriage, and forbidden to engage in paid occupations. By the same token, they received \"gallant\" treatment from the \"protective\" male sex -- an idea based on the Christian teaching of chivalry -- and were \"shielded\" as well as dominated; their bodies, minds and spirits were \"tender\" ad a corresponding code of behavior between men and women sprang into existence. Today, men and women are equal in all but physique. Men expect them to behave as they do themselves, and a lack of courtesy in public transport, and indeed in all social intercourse, has resulted. There seems to be ample reasons for discarding \"good manners\" in modern life ! Yet, a gentleman feels that there is something basically wrong here. He is happy, and rightly so, to pay a woman the old-world courtesies provided she behaves as a lady.\n\nSecondly, the pace of modern life initiates against the observance of the good manners which belonged tot he earlier, more spacious way of life. It is difficult, but not impossible, to behave in a civilized may both to men and women, in the shop, the office, the factory and the home.\n\nThirdly, \"good manners' depend on a respect for other individuals and their needs. This is more a moral than a social concept, and finds its ultimate sanction in religion. In the past 50 years, the West has drifted away from Christianity. The practical result is personal selfishness, and today, few parents instill good manners into their children as a serious duty.\n\nOn the credit side, we may remark that the average man in the West is reacting against selfishness and materialism; inevitably the changes in class-structure and inter-sex relationships will produce the requirement for new codes of behavior and these will emerge. they will certainly be new in detail and there will simply be no time for the old-fashioned outward observances. But essentially, the practice of good manners will remain what it always has been -- a control of \"self' and the fruits of a genuine desire to foster the comfort, happiness, and well-being of other people."

        "title": "The modern supermarket",
        "content": "Gone are the days of the 'old fashioned' business, as it used to be called, when customers expected, and usually got personal service and polite individual attention. Shopkeepers, familiar from childhood would know exactly what individual requirements were. The butcher, providing the exact amount and cut of meat would ask questions in a leisurely way about families and health. The personal touch was the key word of such shops and so many of which, for better or for worse, have now been replaced by the supermarket which is an innovation from the United States.\nSupermarkets are to be found in any large city in the world \"The Cold Storage Stores\", \"Jasons Supermarkets\" and \"Parksons Stores\" in the Far East or 'Fine Fare' are examples of them; and whereas it was 'the personal touch' of older times, it is now an impersonal, quick, efficient shopping concept in the world of the supermarkets. Tinned goods of every description are stacked in perpendicular pyramids even in danger of toppling to the ground. Vegetables are pre-washed, prepacked or frozen. Meat is sealed in packets. Biscuits come in cellophane wrappers, not in the old-fashioned square tins anymore. Toiletries, wines, fish, cleaning materials all can be bought in one store. everything is priced, eighty cents, two dollars or whatever it is with an ink pricing stamp. At the entrance, and there are usually several of them, for supermarkets are by their nature large stores, are piles of wire baskets for purchases, some to be carried and some trolleys to be wheeled. In some supermarkets, there are even trollies to hold the baby ! So, elbowing this way and that, the thronging customers push and hurry through the columns of shelves taking this article and rejecting that. Huge signs seems to hang everywhere: Meat and a large red arrow, Frozen Food this way, Cosmetics First Floor: all are there for the buying.\n\n'Self-service' is the rule in the supermarket and so 'counter service' has gone. Occasionally, assistants can be seen in colored OVERALLS CHECKING, STAMPING OR REPLACING PURCHASED GOODS. The latest 'gimmick' now is for assistants to wear their name printed on their overall. This is an attempt to recapture something of the personal touch and to make the thousands of anonymous customers feel at home. Only occasionally are these assistants asked a question. 'Where are the cheese ?' or 'Have you any shark's fin soup ?' The world of the supermarket is so efficiently planned and cut and dried that there is no need for questions.\n\nAt the exits, organized and many, there are enormous cash registers with electric computers to calculate the bills. again, the personal touch is eliminated for there is no chance of human error here. Like lightning, the quick fingers of the cashiers snatch goods from baskets and venomously rap out the prices on the keys of the machine or they may be even de-coding the items. Jus occasionally a fleeting smile of recognition and no more. With equal rapidity, the machine, fed with deft figures, disgorges a long strip of paper : Each item may be individually named, besides the blue or black machine-stamped figures with the total at the bottom. And so out, leaving behind the wire basket and clutching their own from the racks provided, the customers rush away, anonymous ciphers in a busy bustling lonely world.\n\nAlthough busy supermarkets have killed all individuality, they have of course got something to offer to the public. Speed is one of the bi advantages. Nothing need be fetched from back stores because all is on display to be taken. Prices are marked and so there is no need to ask. The shopper is independent and need not be hindered by slow assistants or inefficient service. The adding machines are so much quicker than the human brain and cannot be faulted in mental arithmetic.\n\nPrices are cheaper too. Goods sold on so large a scale clearly yield a much greater profit than a small stock could ever produce. Some benefits of this finally reaches the customer. Fifty to eighty cents less for each article can make an appreciable difference to the final bill.\n\nCheap, efficient, quick, almost clinically streamlined service. What matters if the personal touch has gone ? Will the shopkeepers care for the particular rice or fish that Mrs. Wong has always had ? What matters if all is stereotyped, impersonal and unvarying and above all quick ? Such qualities are an intrinsic part of our modern life and whatever has been trampled underfoot by their arrival, they have come to stay."

        "content": "The first column of soldiers moved forward briskly as one man as soon as the parade commander gave the order for the march-past to begin. The massed bands had struck up a lively tune. Soon, the various contingents were swinging past the saluting dais, every man in step, columned and filed in precise straight lines. Hours of hard, discipline and work had gone into making the parade a grand success.\nAnd it is in the same way too that life can be made successful. In fact, it is only through discipline that living becomes smooth and peaceful. Law is nothing more than community discipline. People who keep to the law accept the discipline of the state. Thus, the criminal -- the thief, murderer, gangster -- shows by his defiance of the law, that he refuses to be disciplined.\n\nAs a child is punished when it misbehaves itself -- that is , when it shows lack of discipline -- so also is a criminal shown, by punishment or some penal treatment, that he has to conform to the discipline of the state. As a child is shown kindness as well as firmness when being taught discipline, so also should a wrongdoer be treated understandingly as well as strictly, so that he may not become hardened in crime.\n\nThe image of the education of a child is specially appropriate in illustrating the need for and power of discipline. From its birth a child is taught discipline. Its feeding and sleeping are regulated, otherwise the child will grow up unhealthy. Bowel-training is important, otherwise there will be frequent stomach upsets, with their consequent ill-effects on the growing body. As the child grows, it is taught respectful and unselfish behavior, or it will turn into a young savage. Discipline features in every stage of the child's development, whether mental or physical.\n\nThe word \"discipline\" is associated most frequently with school life. it is, perhaps, useful at this juncture to examine the meaning of the term. The dictionary defines \"discipline\" as \"instruction : training and mode of life in accordance with rules : subjection to control ...\" It has the same origin as the word \"disciple\" meaning \"pupil, follower\". It is in school, especially, that discipline is taught with reference to all aspects of the definition given. A schoolboy is given instruction in various subjects; he is trained and shown a mode of reasonable existence which will fit him for adult life; and, to his repeated annoyance, he is subject to constant control.\n\n\"Discipline\" must be distinguished from \"order\" with which it is frequently confused. Order is the condition which results from discipline. But order may be imposed from without. Discipline, finally, comes from within. True discipline is always self-discipline. The aim of all schooling is to teach children to discipline themselves; to guarantee that order will result from a child's recognition of the fact that order is utterly necessary. Discipline certainly cannot be based on mere fear of authority. For, as a child approaches adulthood, it is moving more and more away from the figures of authority. A person becomes more and more independent as he grows up. With this growing sense of independence must also grow a sense of discipline and respect for the rights of others.\n\nA disciplined child, growing into a disciplined adolescent, will finally emerge into society as a disciplined adult -- one who is read to play a constructive role in his community. Life will have its trials and disappointments; it is discipline which will enable a person to remain cool and sensible amidst the stresses of life. When temptation to evil occurs, it is discipline which will help overcome it. Should a person fall, it is discipline which will set him on his feet again. All this is trite and what modern \"enlightened\" people would call \"moral\". It is a fact, however, which cannot be denied.\n\nIn recent years, there were some misguided psychologists who said that a child should be left to develop on its own, that it should be allowed to do anything it willed -- free discipline should be encouraged. the woeful effects of \"free\" discipline show that the child becomes neither \"free\" to develop healthily, nor \"disciplined\". And other psychologists have come up to say that a child wants discipline. In its uncertainty, a child craves guidance. And that is what discipline eventually gives him, so that, growing up, he may be able to see his way about the mazes of life."

        "title": "Motorways",
        "content": "Motorway' is the name now given to the very wide roads built all over Europe which connect the major cities, but which also by-pass all of them. The idea for the construction of these vast \"roads\" cam originally from the German \"autobahns,\" designed before the war, in order to move troops quickly from one end of Germany tot he other. Further back in time than this, the idea stems from the old Roman roads (like the famous \"Watling Street\" and \"Foss-Way\" in England); which were designed for the same purpose. In Italy \"Autostrades\" have been constructed. In Britain, the idea had been taken up since the last war at vast national cost and the new motorways are called 'M's. They are numbered as for example the M.I. which connect London with Birmingham. The British system of motorways is not yet complete. In Singapore the pan-island expressway with three land double track bear resemblance to the motorways of the west.\nA motorway is different in many ways from an ordinary road. It has a three way doubled track. Three lanes, in fact, each one of which has a different speed limit. There are lanes for the fast-moving traffic, for the slower traffic and for overtaking. No cyclists, pedestrians or learner drivers are allowed on these roads. No minor road cross the motorways; as for this purpose there are flyover and tunnels. All \"feeding\" roads merge from the left. There is along their whole stretch \"no waiting\", \"no parking\", and no \"U-turns\". For drivers who need rest and refreshment on their journey, there are controlled and spaced cafes, petrol stations, toilets facilities and lay-by.\n\nThe beneficial effects of a well-constructed and planned motorway system are at once apparent. Since their object is to ensure a continuous flow of swiftly moving traffic which avoids the congestion of large towns, much time is saved on long journeys. How much was wasted before, in long and tedious hold-ups in the narrow roads of major cities ! Petrol too, as a result of this, is saved and a general economy in transport ensues. Minor roads and hitherto major roads are freed, at it is only the traffic going to the relevant town which uses these. The cars which before would have been over-crowding these roads just to pass through the town, are now on the motorway.\n\nBut, like any new innovation, the motorway brings harmful effects with it as well. The engines of small cars tend to become accidents too occur. These are caused by glare or by drivers misjudging speed when they re-enter minor roads. Sudden storm, oil and ice-patches make these roads very slippery and this, at fast speed, is highly dangerous. Long uninterrupted driving on monotonous roads which are almost completely straight, causes drivers to fall asleep. it is, in fact, possible to 'sleep' at the wheel.\n\nTrade in towns, which because of the motorways are now by pass, is also affected. A pause for a rest and meal, which before was often made in a town, usually means a certain amount of shopping as well. Now rest and refreshment are taken at the motorway restaurants and the shopping wants delay until the final destination is reached. Consequently, shops of all kinds, petrol station, cafes and so on, in many towns have lost trade. The livelihood of certain inns and wayside cafes on minor roads has, in some cases, been lost altogether.\n\nThe motorway, however, with both its advantages and disadvantages has come o stay. It is the only answer to modern traffic conditions in countries where long distances have to be covered, especially through vast industrial areas. If its final effects are to be completely beneficial, then the problems which it causes must be solved at the same rate as they are created."

        "title": "Descriptive music",
        "content": "The term 'descriptive' is taken here to mean what is more commonly described as 'program' music, and would be defined as a dramatic expression of a subject or a story in musical terms. Its history in the Eastern world goes back a very long way, in fact to the great Henry Purcell, whose masque 'Venus and Adonis' is a case in point. The death of Adonis is musically described in affecting terms, just as the baying of the hounds is directly imitated on the violins.\nThis type of music was, however, severely limited up to and after the time by Batch by the limitations of the orchestra itself, but even Bach was able to reproduce the braying of an ass, a noise designed as a punishment ! Beethoven's 'Battle of Victoria' certainly produced battle realism, if very bad music, while the gunfire etc. of the 1812 is overdone in the opinion of most people. Yet the calm of the 'pastoral' is almost tangible.\n\nIt was, however, in the rather later days of Listz and Berlioz that Program Music really came into its own. Listz' Symphonic Poem' is a series of actual descriptive illustration of pieces of poetry; he tried to produce in music what the poet sought to produce in words. Later on, the Czech, Smetana, wrote in the same style, but not so much on the emotional level as on the directly pictorial. These composers certainly started a new style in music, not one which is popular with everybody, but certainly one which had produced much fine music. Russians such as Tchaikovsky, Balakirev and Rimsky-Korsakov all developed the 'tone-poem' idea, as did Saint-Saens, whose works such as 'Le Rout d'Omphale,' 'La Jeunesse d'Hercule' etc were very successful. The 'Danse Macabre' is very ghoulish indeed, while Dukas' 'Apprenti Sorcier' conveys wonderfully the idea of swelling waters which well-nigh engulf the soccer's house. Among modern British composers, Arnold Bax, particularly in the 'Tintagel' tone poem, and Sir Edgar Elgar in the 'Planet' Suite and the symphonic poem 'Falstaff,' have managed to combine directly descriptive music with a true feeling for the continuity and development of the music. Music, which is purely descriptive is rarely fully satisfactory from the critical standpoint; indeed, the more direct the programming, the less successful the total aesthetic appeal becomes.\n\nFinally, a word about 'background' music, as written for the film, the television program, or as 'incidental' music for the radio play or story. Such music can rarely stand alone, or is ever meant to. Often, it is too over-powering, or merely just too loud, and it then detracts from the enjoyment of the audience.\n\nAt its best, it is used to enhance a variety of moods, ranging from the forbidding and sinister accompaniment to a psychological thriller to the carefree music which enhances a light comedy."

        "title": "National service",
        "content": "In the modern world, National Service may take one of several forms and may be ordered by a government for one of several purposes, or of course, it may be voluntary. Whether or not, it is compulsory depends on the urgency of the time. For example, a short spell of army, navy or air force service was compulsory for all young men in Britain during the 1950s when the threat of a Russian advance in Europe was considered real. In contrast, British civil defense ( ie anti-nuclear bomb training ) had been voluntary in the 1960's, as the threat of nuclear war has receded.\nThe theory of National Service is that the individual owes an allegiance to the state and should be prepared to come to its help, when threatened by a crisis, which is beyond the power of the police and regular armed forces to deal with. But modern communications are rapid and modern weapons are devastating and almost instantaneous, so National Service also implies preparedness, and this is turn means training. Most political thinkers believe such training to be justified, even though, it is not directly linked with an outside threat. Strength and preparedness are, in fact, generally considered the best means of safeguarding peace.\n\nFor many decades, France had required military service for all her fit young men for a limited period, and the community accepts the requirement without questions. It is not so elsewhere. Britain, except since 1945 had never enforced conscription, leaving outside defense to a worldwide deployment of regular forces, supplemented in emergency by the rapid formation of Civilian Armies. But the complication of modern warfare, the need for specialists, and the diminishing importance of the foot soldier has now changed the pattern. The USA and indeed most other countries today, think along British lines. Short periods of compulsory training supplemented by voluntary and eventually compulsory conscription to meet a direct threat either to the homeland or to protected territories are now the order of the day.\n\nThe particular form of National Service required, depends on circumstances. Basic training in tactics and small arms will do, to fit a people to resist a direct attack by conventional forces using similar weapons. The sue of, and defense against, limited nuclear weapons may also be included British conscription in the 1950's to the three services was organized on these lines. Thus, a mobile force was available for any zone, backed by  previously trained 'Z' Reserve group required to attend periodical 'refresher' camps. The diminishing threat is indicated by the reduction of the National Service period from 3 years to 9 months, before its total abolition. today, an all-regular force is deemed adequate.\n\nNational Service in wartime has a much wider significance; it includes civil defense and the drafting of both male and female layout not eligible on grounds of fitness for active service into work of national importance, such as munitions manufacture, agriculture and fisheries, and many other jobs connected with the war effort. This is achieved by 'National Service Acts', which, insofar as the individual is concerned, amount to the statement, \"you cannot leave your employment, nor can your employer 'sack' you, without the permission of the National Service Officer\". In peacetime, this more general National Service is voluntary. Britain felled that key personnel should be trained in post-nuclear bomb techniques, and today, has a voluntary organization for doing so, as also has the USA. The general public is urged to join.\n\nAlthough National Service seems common sense, there are disadvantages. The fist is the large cost to service the civil defense force. The second is the temporary loss of professional or skilled labor to industry. To the individual, there is the personal loss of time, and possibly the difficulty of settling back into a demanding vocation.\n\nThe advantages, however, would seem to outweigh them. Singapore has introduced National Service to reap the benefits. National Service provides a trained, mobile force ready for any emergency anywhere. secondly, it helps to relieve unemployment, as most countries provide resettlement courses which spread the new labor into a greater variety of occupations, and a proportion of ex-national servicemen always join the regular forces. thirdly, the influence of National service on the regular forces in broadening. Finally, National Service widens the individual's personal horizons, makes him (or her) a better 'mixer', instills self-confidence, and often evokes unsuspected leadership qualities which can afterwards be put to good use in civilian life."

        "title": "Strikes",
        "content": "The right to 'strike means the right to withdraw labor for one of several reasons; as a means of enforcing wage increases, of improving employment conditions, of showing sympathy with other strikers, sometimes overseas, of showing displeasure at the employment or dismissal of a 'trouble-maker' or a non-Union worker, and occasionally of gaining a political objectives. 'Striking' as a means of 'industrial action' is universally legal today, though in wartime, National defense measure illegalize it, and it is \"unquestionally\" right that the worker should enjoy this freedom of action. In the individual's case, striking only amounts to the withdrawing of layout, but between 1918 and 1939 both British and American lawyers tried to show that collective withdrawal amounted to conspiracy, but neither country was foolish enough to press this to its logical conclusion. Britain has always kept strike action carefully out of the legal sphere, in the present century.\nThe fact is that any enlightened government accepts the right of the workers to go on strike as art of his basic personal freedom, and when large numbers, by so doing, seriously upset the national economy by essential production to a halt, or prove themselves an inconvenience to the general public, a solution is sought by an unofficial process of collective bargaining, sometimes with trade unions, sometimes without them. In this way, a solution is nearly always reached at some point and the men and women go peacefully back to work. A case in point was the strike of motormen in London, which greatly inconvenienced the 'commuting' workers. Some people wanted the strike broken, but the government refused, despite the fact that electric train driving is a government service. The strikers argued that precisely, because their job was responsible, it should be better paid. Finally, a solution was reached.\n\nBut what happens about wages during a strike ? Nowadays, the official 'Union' strike is a planned measure, and funds are set aside to provide 'strike-pay' -- a minimal wage. When funds run out, either other unions help with loans, or the strike is broken.\n\nThus, it is seen that there is a real economic basis to strike action, which in most countries is a highly organized Trade Union affair. The worker's advantage, as an individual, is that his personal grievance can be speedily rectified by the Shop Steward, who, if he considers it justified, will demand satisfaction of the management. This is rarely refused, as no business wants to face the loss incurred by a strike. But both employer and 'Union' object t 'wild-cat' strikes, often the impulsive and unreasonable action of the few, called on grounds hard to justify, throwing the business into chaos, and bring industrial action into disrepute.\n\nIn all democratic countries today, the employer and the employee are legally held to be equal, but of course, this was not always so. Before 1875 in Britain, the employer who broke his contract was only liable for a civil offence; the employee was convictable for a criminal offence, but since then, the law has kept out of the picture, except in the minor matter of the giving and receiving of due notice.\n\nThe whole history of the 20th century had been one of developing strike action, of many different kinds. Between 1906 and 1917, Russia saw a series of strikes in her revolutionary period. There was one in Germany in 1920, against the Kapp Putch, in Britain in 1926, held in sympathy with the Miner's Federation and in Italy during the first World war. 'Sit-down' or 'Stay-in' strikes were frequent in France in the 1930s and also among workers in the colonial territories between the wars. In Russia, the aim was political; to cause a social revolution by establishing a 'workers' society'; in France in the 1930s it was the same, though unsuccessful. Striking for political reasons is comparatively rare; social reasons are more commonplace, but sometimes, one leads to the other.\n\nStrikes, for whatever reason, are both legally and morally justified, provided their grounds are reasonable, and provided they do not endanger the country in wartime. The fact that they may be inconvenient is unfortunate, but no adequate reason for banning them. the fact that worker's pay demands are sometimes exorbitant is true, but the final check on these is a simple matter of economics. If a firm cannot afford its wage bill, it has to go out of business, and the worker must choose whether he wants it to happen, knowing that it may have disastrous effects on himself."

        "title": "Social work as a career",
        "content": "To choose social work as a career, a man or woman must have one over-powering desire which is to serve mankind. This idea of service stems originally from nineteenth century England when many enlightened people, Octavia Hall, Elizabeth Fry and Florence Nightingale among them, left their own comfortable homes and worked in different capacities with the poverty-stricken, often sick and very large population of London. By doing this, they believed that they could greatly improve the lives and lot of these poor people. These early social workers were neither trained nor paid.\nToday, although the desire to serve must still be paramount, the ret is very different. All paid forms of social work both in the Far East, in America and in Europe demand some kind of training and the social worker today is a highly skilled individual. Firstly, a diploma in the social sciences or a University degree in Sociology or another allied subject is required. Both the diploma and the degree include studies of Economics, Philosophy and Psychology, all of which are subjects dealing with people and society. 'Sociology' means the science of society. After this two or three year course, a further year's practical training is required. The prospective Hospital Almoner, Housing Officer, Probation Officer or Child Care Officer will have to spend a year in a hospital or an office, during which time, he will receive little or no pay. He has, during this practical training to master the routine of the office. Very often, a social worker has a shorthand/typing or clerical qualifications as well, since this is relevant to his work.\n\nHe will also be required to 'listen to' and to observe interviews; to learn to elicit the right information and to present it in logical and acceptable form. Visiting is an important art of the practical training, for the whole of a social worker's life is spent dealing with and 'handling' people. Such visits are highly trained and skilled procedures. It is not a question of 'dropping in for tea.' The people to be visited are often hostile, sometimes illiterate and usually inarticulate. To deal with them, to guide and sometimes to lead from wrong paths to right ones is not easy and the social worker must be highly trained in the art of dealing with people, before he can accomplish anything. At the end of this practical year, there is a written examination which is geared to the practical side of social work rather than to the theoretical. A knowledge or Rent Acts, of Landlord and Tenant relationships, even of drainage systems are things, a Housing Officer is expected to know.\n\nA Hospital Almoner must have mastered the theory of National Health and of Hospital routines. legal procedure and the law are important in all social work and therefore, a study of the relevant law is required. After he has passed this final practical test, then the social worker is fully trained and qualified.\n\nBoth in Europe and the Far East, the Social Services are undertaken by a Government department. In England, most Social Services are under the Home Office or the Ministry of Health. In Singapore, the Department of Social welfare takes charge of them. This department is primarily responsible for administering the Publi Assistance scheme. It is also responsible for the T.B. Treatment allowance scheme. In addition, it provides children's centers, homes for children and young people and homes for the very old as well. It is responsible for the supervision and after care of adult offenders and juvenile delinquents; the protection and care of children and girls, the prevention of drug trafficking; housing and emergency relief for victims of flood, fire and similar services.\n\nThe opportunities for a social worker are many and varied, but in whatever branch he chooses, he will always be working with people -- with the sick, the old, the child, the delinquent or the unhappy and with all of them, he must show patience, understanding, love and desire to help. His rewards will be materially small, for on the whole, the social worker is not well paid. His real reward comes from knowing that he has helped people to find the right road through life and to live a more contented and balanced life."

        "title": "\"The pen is mightier than the sword\"",
        "content": "Most paradoxes are clever rather than true, but there is enough to be said for this one to give it at least the color of truth. Lord Lytton was a prolific and popular Victorian author, but well aware of his limited powers, not to claim originality for what is clearly an ancient aphorism. His play 'Richelieu' of 1839, at any rate, defines the interpretation, he himself would have put on it. Richelieu adroitly saved himself from his enemies and scored them off by his pertinent writing. Moreover, he enabled his country to sidestep an alliance with Spain. Thus, he limits the application of this borrowed paradox :-\n \n\n'Beneath the rule of men entirely great\n\nThe pen is mightier than the sword\n\n........... take away the sword\n\nStates can be saved without it.'\n\nNo doubt in his own day and age ! But there are aggressors whose swords must be met by swords. There are the Hitlers of the world who dub the Treaty of Versailles a 'scrap of paper.' There is the pathetic 1938 picture of Neville Chamberlain waving another scrap of paper, as he returned from the meeting at Peterburg, promising the deluded British 'peace in our time.'\n\nBut nobody could accuse Hitler of 'greatness' in any true sense, or Chamberlain of 'greatness' in any sense, at all, so Lytton might even today maintain his argument holds good. The unilateral disarmed believes that it holds good at all times; that irrespective of the temporary triumph of the sword, whether that 'sword' takes the shape of the bully's fist or the aggressor's nuclear bomb, the triumph is ultimately gained by peaceful acceptance of tyranny, possibly without even a written protest. that tyranny carried its own seeds of destruction is true, but history has many a case of such seeds taking a very long time to ripen. Meanwhile, millions suffer, and we reflect that much suffering might have been saved by a sword raised in defense.\n\nSo the paradox is at best a half-truth, but the half that is true is very true indeed, because we must define real 'might' as something other than military power. Man is basically a spiritual and mental rather than a physical creature. he can be more easily led by the pen than driven by the sword, and there is ample evidence in all spheres of writing to prove this.\n\nThe civilising power of world religions down the ages has been incalculable, and the perpetuation of religion has always depended on writing. The great Roman Empire was christianised by the Bible 300 years after the life of Christ; today, the purity of the Muslim way of life depends on the learning of the Koran by the followers; the Vedas still inspire millions of Indians, and the record made of the Sayings of Confucius by his disciples provided the basis of the social order of much of the Far East. Modern democratic theory owes much to the writings of Aristotle, philosophy to those of Plato, and law to those of Gaius. The law student at Oxford today, begins by studying his 'Institutes'.\n\nOn the narrower canvas, social reformers have sees the newspaper and magazine article and especially the novel as a means of stating their case and moving public opinion to take legal action in their favor, this making valid gains for humanity. Charles Kingsly's 'Water Babies' castigated the infamies of child exploitation. Harriet Beecher Stowe, those of negro slavery, Charles Dickens, those of a harsh legal system and of a society which condemned the multitude to poverty and class oppression.\n\nHumor and satire have a sharper point then any sword. Even in times of tyranny and oppressive laws, the lampoon and the political 'broadsheet' pilloried hated public figures and institutions, preserved a sense of humor in the community, and sometimes gave pause to the pressers, whereas physical attack or revolt would have been punished to the full extent of the law. 'Punch' castigated the crown and the lawyer in the days when no less than 200 felonies were punishable by death. In earlier days, Pope and Dryden used the barbed rhyming couplet to ridicule dominant political figures, who in the modern, 'free' days would have won fantastic libel damages. But the tyrant is always 'touchy', and the pen always finds the weak spot ! And abroad, need we do more than mention the explosive power of Voltaire and Rousseau, Marx and Engels ?\n\nAnd today, the mass-molding popular press, of which modern man is becoming heartily sick. Today's need is for independent and logical thought. Let us hope that this will supersede both the pen and the sword in the hands of others."

        "content": "The insect world exists in enormous and bewildering variety, serving its main purpose of helping to maintain the balance of nature, supplying birds with food, and occasionally man himself. More often than not, insects do great harm, destroying crops and roots and occasionally eating everything vegetable in a wide area. Locusts are an example.\nThey inhabited the world 300 million years before the arrival of man, but have never shouted the evolution characteristic of the animal world. By definition, an insect consists of a head, a thorax, an abdomen which carries out digestive and reproductive functions, and in most cases six legs. But apart from this, even the main categories are almost innumerable. In general, hey are the world's scavengers, and though they may spread disease as they spread pollen, they prevent far more by literally consuming carrion after animal and bird carnivores have done their part.\n\nAll orders of insects have some form of co-operation among themselves, but among them, the bee and the ant have developed the highest form of 'civilization.'.\n\nThe modern bee evolved from the digger wasp. The principle of bee society is that of the importance of the female and the young, reproduction and provisioning, therefore being the most important functions. everything therefore 'revolves' round the queen, who normally stays in the nest (or hive). She is 'queen' by virtue of having established her young, and shares the nest with future 'queens' (reproductive females), until the latter leave with the males to establish 'homes' of their own. Provisioning is carried out on a mass scale by the males who store nectar; there is no worker-caste of non-reproductive females. the social bees are the apish, the bumble and the two tropical ones, Trigona and Melipona. The bumble have a clear, annual cycle. They begin as one family, the queen (mother) occupying the nest. Mass provisioning changes to daily over the brood and the workers. Young queens become fertile over winter and stat new nests for the following year.\n\nThe ant-world is also based on the female, the male only being of passing importance. Their co-operation is highly developed. Ant-hills, especially in tropical climates, rise to considerable heights and last for many years. The focal points in them are the queen-ants (two or three), who have been known to live for as long as 16 years. There are many varieties of ants, from the humble worker to the formidable soldier, and each kind has his or her allotted task, which is carried out with a single mindedness which, humanly speaking, borders on dementia. Queens (reproductive females) and males have wings, and 'swarm' like bees on mating. They then reproduce workers, non-reproductive females, who take over the complete care of the nest and the gathering of food. Once, this is established, the queen becomes a reproductive machine. Food is fed into her, and new workers emerge.\n\nCo-operation, in fact, is the keynote of the insect world; on it depends survival and reproduction, but, it is a basic and primitive instinct, a compulsion far removed from man's co-operation which allows him to materialize such a wide variety of aspirations."

        "content": "The first two considerations apply to members of non-Western nations wearing their national dress. An Indian is at once indicated by a turban or sari, an African by a 'mammy-cloth', a Polynesian by his head-dress. Very often, subtle distinctions in national costume, will give to fellow-nationals a precise indication of caste, social standing or origin, facts of which an outsider would not be aware. It is a curious fact that as a result of Westernization, some non-Europeans nationals have become ashamed of their own costume. The European, who is tired of his own dull, standardized dress. would generally prefer to see them as they used to be, but both sides agree that a mixture of the two styles is deplorable. Bare feet, a cloth and bracelets do not show at their best when surmounted by a cloth cap battered terribly. In deed, styles of dress have become so mixed in places like West Africa or Egypt that dress no longer serves as a sure guide to nationality even though, it will generally give the spectator a good idea.\nNon-European dress can often, however, indicate religion. Nobody could fail to recognize the dress of a Muslim, or the special robe of those Muslims who have made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Turbans have many fine shades of meaning.\n\nAll this is true of members of \"non-Western\" countries, but to the Western world, clothes have no significance whatever, in respect of religion. In regard to nationality, differences of style may offer clue. A Briton would recognize British shoes, the Italian cut of a suit, the Parisian style of a lady's dress, or an American 'tee-shirt'.\n\nThere are, however, various other deductions open to the shrewd observer of European dress. Firstly, that of income-level. Good clothes cost money, and the poor man would sooner economize on clothes rather than food or fuel. A noticeable factor, however, is the great increase in the number of well-dressed people, due to the leveling up of incomes in the West.\n\nWe can, of course, differentiate the 'good taste' (or its absence) between individuals of even the same income level, and we are, therefore, given a clue as to whether the individual concerned is educated and 'guided' in his or her choice or not; such guidance goes with a home of high standards.\n\nClothes may be expensive and in a good taste, but they may either be fashionable or not, and they may be old or new. Again, the shrewd observer will instantly make a mental note that the person wearing them is either 'conservative' or 'progressive' in outlook, or, if the clothes are good but old, had recently come on hard times.\n\nClothes which are clean, tidy and well-pressed, always give a favorable impression of the wearer's character. They indicate a tidy mind in the wearer, as well as respect for the company, a fact which candidates going up for an interview remember. the fact that a polished pair of shoes is an old pair, or that an old shirt is well-darned, is not criticism; it may well be a commendation. Poverty is no disgrace; dirt is.\n\nBad manners can, of course, be attributed to those who deliberately wear the wrong dress on a social occasion. Those who, in doubt, tend to 'over-dress' show more consideration tot heir host or hostess, than those who assume informality on the least pretext.\n\nTo the Easterner, Western dress, in its monotony, gives very little indication of status or character, unless the dress in question happens to be uniform of some kind of a special dress proper to a certain occupation or trade. Tot he Westerner himself, it is full of deceptions and pitfalls; there is so much that can be detected by observation, that the wisest observer will reflect that he can really detect nothing. this is especially true in Britain, where the bank clerk dresses like a Prime Minister, and a duke like a gardener.\n\nAt least, dress can indicate only so much, and what it does indicate may be doubtful; one thing is certain -- as far as the real essentials of character are concerned, dress reveals absolutely nothing."

        "content": "The old saying 'Power corrupts; infinite power corrupts infinitely' is the eternally true corollary to the Hitlerite slogan \"Might is Right.\" It is a valid truth in practically every sphere of human life. 'Might', or the possession of total power by either an individual or a group seems to bring out the most universally-condemned failings of mankind; pride, arrogance, contempt of the weak, and the presumption of infallibility. it is often mingled with fear.\nThe dangers of the 'Might is Right' doctrine are very apparent in the field of politics. If a president becomes dictator, we soon discover that democratic processes wither and die, and that ultimately, even the rule of law is challenged. The head of a police state, however, lives in fear; hence, the imprisonment of opponents, the armed escorts, the arbitrary changes of law, the oppression of minorities. Domestic and foreign affairs are handled automatically and capriciously, other countries being alienated. Totalitarian states carry within themselves the seeds of their own destruction; Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan and Adolf Hitler all bear witness tot eh fact. Eventually people rebel. The tyrant or the caucus falls to the assassin. 'Might may be right' -- for a time, but rarely for very long.\n\nThe principles actuating nations also hold good for individuals. Everybody hates the bully, the hold-up man, the brutal murderer, who all pay unconscious tribute tot he principle of 'Might is Right.' Such individuals are anti-social, and the laws of all nations include stern measures for dealing with them.\n\nIn the modern business world, the principle has regrettably many adherents. Many a headline tells of the 'take-over bid,' the 'price ring,' the 'squeeze' put on the small business man. Often, the public suffers from high prices and over standardization of products, but, this is partly competition of a free state in the commercial and business world, and partly by Government intervention, sometimes in the form of the nationalization of basic supplies and the sources of raw materials.\n\nIn some communities, it is said that the 'might is right' principle holds good in the administration of justice. Justice Galsworthy's play \"The Silver Box' implies that in early 20th century England, there was 'one law for the rich and another for the poor.' Such is very rarely the case nowadays in enlightened or civilized countries, a testimony to mankind's general approval of the principle of fair play.\n\n'Might' may have 'right' on its side in a major war, and people generally accept the morality of a greater force putting down a tyranny. 'Might' is also 'right' in the sphere of sport, where the best man wins, and is applauded for doing so.\n\nBut humanity never allows 'the weak to go to the wall' for ever. Power is dangerous, and therefore feared. History had taught us to shun the 'might is right' principle. we can only hope that a more civilized principle will govern the actions of those nations, who, today have a stake in the 'space age.'"

        "title": "Democracy",
        "content": "Democracy is that form of government in which the ruling power of a state is legally vested not in any particular class or classes, but in the members of the community as a whole. it is a government in which the will of he majority of citizens rules without overriding the rights o the minority. The ideal of democracy is that of equality, freedom and welfare for all. it involves the abolition of very form of restriction and privilege. Ancient democracy was based on the direct participation of the masses in public affairs. Modern democracy is representative in character and it demands not only universal adult suffrage, but also the active participation of the people in government. Thus, in a democratic state, the acts of the government are in accordance with the will of the people, since they have the right to elect and remove their leaders and the right to determine the main lines of policy. Nevertheless, democracy is a matter of degree, and no complete expression has yet been given tot eh ideal of democracy.\n\"Our constitution is named a democracy, because it is the hands not of the few, but of many. But our laws secure equal justice for all private disputes, and our public opinion welcomes and honors talent in very branch of achievement, not for any sectional reason, but on grounds of excellence alone.\" These words of Pericles uttered in the 5th century B.C., still hold good and may be considered by far the best definition of democracy. democracy is in truth, \"government of the people, by the people and for the people.\" Thus, if the people of Malaysia rule the people of Malaysia for the benefit of the Malaysians there is democratic form of government in Malaysia. every citizen has a share in the government of a democratic state. democracy rests on the will of the people and not on force.\n\nDemocracy implies political liberty. Political liberty consists of the right to vote, the right to sand as a candidate for election, the right to hold public offices, freedom of speech, of association, of worship and of opinion. All these secure the individual, the most fundamental right of political participation. By giving everyone a share in the government, democracy prompts patriotism.\n\nDemocracy is based on the doctrine of equality. Inequality has been the cause of all the revolutions which have changed the face of the world. Popular government resting on the will of the people and on the principle of equality are immune from all revolutionary disturbances. moreover, this form of government also implies the possibility of an alternative government in place of an inefficient one. These characteristics ensure the stability of the democratic form of government.\n\nThe greatest merit of democracy is that it elevates the character of the citizens. It demands a high standard of morality and honesty on their part. It provides for the fullest possible development of all its citizens and gives each citizen, a sense of responsibility. In a democratic society, reason governs the conduct of men and each man feels responsible for his actions. Here every person contributes some thought or feeling to the common life. Thus, democracy is not only a form of government, but also a way of life. In a democratic state, each citizen is an integral and irreplaceable part of the whole. it gives each citizen, a sense of responsibility. \"When political institutions call upon him to bear a part in their working, he is taken out of the narrow circle of his domestic and occupational activities, admitted to the larger life, which opens wider horizons, associated in new ways with his fellows forced to think of matters which are both his and theirs\" says Bryce.\n\nThe above principles imply that every citizen in a democratic state should have the opportunity to develop his personality. he must have access to knowledge, must be able to earn an adequate wage. The state must guarantee him the right to work as well as leisure. It must protect him from being exploited by the well-placed sections of the community or the privileged class. All these raise the important questions of education of the citizens of a democratic state. Education must teach them not only to assert their rights, but also to discharge their duties. It must teach them to think and act freely and express their views boldly. But, the system of education must guard against making the citizens selfish or overcritical. The education system must be adapted to suit the needs of democracy.\n\nAlso leadership and proper organization are other important requisites of democracy. Without proper organization, the people cannot express themselves effectively. The leader of the party must be responsible, honest and courageous. He must be able to think clearly and act boldly. He must have the ability to judge public opinion correctly. Above all, he must adhere to high principles. An unscrupulous leader might easily become a dictator and endanger democracy.\n\nGiven favorable conditions, democracy is the best form of government known so far. It reconciles liberty and authority; it imbues the citizens with a sense of patriotism; it is a government by discussion; it rests on the will of the people; it treats all individuals as equals and tolerates the opposition; it aims at giving the greatest happiness to the greatest number of citizens in a state. Under the democratic form of government, human character develops and the individual realizes his best self."

        "title": "The part played by advertising in modern life",
        "content": "This present age has been called the Nuclear Age the Plastic Age, the Machine Era, etc. Another good description would be to call these modern times, the Age of the Advertisement.\nThe ability of people to maintain generally higher standards of living than ever before, and the hysterical competition to provide people with what they may be persuaded to buy, have resulted in the high-pressure advertising which is so much a feature of our modern life. Our eyes are assailed by flickering neon, sky-signs -- even searchlights piercing the gloom of night, slides and cartoons on cinema screens, and the ubiquitous advertisement block in newspapers and periodicals; all scream out the merits of products for sale. We are treated to the sight of sandwich-men and to similar spectacles. Our ears are quite accustomed tot he persuasive tones of announcers in radio and television commercials. Our arms are loaded with samples. And our minds are dazed by the continuous, planned assaults of the advertising agent.\n\nSometimes, we feel sickened by all this emphasis on our material wants. The purposes of the advertiser is to create the impression of a need in the mind of the prospective customer. In many cases, the aim is to arouse a feeling of covetousness. Buy a bridge -- you can afford it on the never-never system ! Buy a car -- the latest, with all its gadgets ! Buy new furniture, luxury gods, buy, buy, buy ! The appeal is the instinct to keep up with the Jounces.\n\nSoon the poor consumer gets into debt, taking years -- even a life-time, to pay of the installments on stuff he could have done well without. The so-called consumer is himself consumed into a state of constant fretfulness over the serious monthly inroads into his income, and curses the times he was deluded by advertisements. One of the reasons for the neuroses typical of the twentieth century is the strain that comes from trying to maintain artificially high standards of living. And advertising has, I think, contributed to this strain. What self-respect can a man ultimately have, who has been lured by cunning advertisements into owing half-a-dozen sales concerns a total of a fair sum of money ! This habit of indebtedness, which advertisements of goods offered on installment payments inculcate, certainly does not conduce to attitudes of thrift.\n\nThe evil about many of these advertisements is that the consumer is almost helpless against them. They appeal to his most emotional and instinctive impulses. Many advertisement subjects, for example, come close to being pornographic. One advertisement, for instance, may show a scantily-clad lady smiling alluringly at a stricken newspaper reader or film fan, inviting him to light her cigarette, brand mentioned. what had the lady in her inadequate costume to do with cigarettes, anyway ? Ladies feature frequently and irrelevantly in all sorts of advertisements; even chocolate-box covers are not without a common display of simpering immodesty. And these are the things  we buy for children !\n\nApart from this simple, basic illogical animal appeal, advertisements show extreme lack of good taste, artistically speaking. Art is either parodied or ignored in advertisements. One sometimes sees a work of art reproduced -- the Mona Lisa, for example. But the Gioconda's smile may well be broadened to show the brightening effects of the dentifrice advertised. Blatant vulgarity is a dominant characteristic in advertising. The part played by advertisements of this sort in modern life is, therefore, to vulgarize it.\n\nAdvertisements also debase music. Popular airs to even portions of classical compositions, are distorted and fitted with words calling the hearer's attention perhaps to the quality of a particular brand of toilet paper. When a piece of advertisement music is original, it is tuneless and raucous. This sort of lack of artistry, of course, characterizes advertisements of all sorts: neons are garish, short advertising film sequences are sentimental in subject or downright ridiculous; in countries which have television, commercial programs are puerile in content.\n\nNot all about advertising, however, is demoralizing. Advertising in itself has a useful social function to fulfill. It tells people what they can get with their money, and where. The fact that many advertise, their goods is economically beneficial. For people can get their goods more cheaply, if many sellers advertise for customers. But advertisements should be plain and tasteful. There should be no attempt to pander to lower tastes in order to influence choice on the buyer's part. In fact, in certain countries, a certain code has been laid down for advertisers. It is in such circumstances that advertising can play a beneficial part in modern life. For advertisements can be presented in an aesthetically pleasing way. they can even be educational.\n\nToday, in better-class periodicals like \"Readers' Digest,\" \"Time,\" \"Newsweek,\" \"Saturday Evening Post,\" \"Enquire\" and so on, advertisements show a new respect for the reader's intelligence and sensitivity. Informative material is frequently incorporated in advertisements. Advertisement Art itself is aiming towards standards of beauty that, we hope, will inspire general emulation. Thus, when we come across advertisements in good magazines and newspapers, we attend to them more eagerly. We look upon advertisements as guides to our purchases. If we cannot afford such purchase as are advertised, we can still treat the advertisements as a source of information, entertainment, or even of aesthetic delight.\n\nMeanwhile much can be done to improve standards of advertising in all advertising media. Large-scale advertising has come to stay; it can stay for the good of society."

        "title": "Nursing as a career",
        "content": "Nursing, as a recognized profession is comparatively young. In Great Britain, it dates from the year 1860 when the first school of nursing was established at St. Thomas' Hospital, London by Florence nightingale. she had been given a large sum of money by the British public, in return for her services in the Crimean War and since she had found great difficulty in finding even a few women with sufficient nursing ability to take with her to the Crimean War, she determined to use the 50,000 gift to train future nurses. Hence, this first Training School was built.\nFrom this, over the last hundred years, Training Schools fro nurses, attached to large hospitals have been built all over Britain and in most other countries, including Malaysia, as well, to train girls for this highly skilled and dedicated profession.\n\nSince then, it is now recognized as a profession. All girls entering it are required to have a good standard of education and normally no one is admitted as a student nurse, without a good pass in the General Certificate Examination at Ordinary Level. Nursing course does not begin until the age of eighteen. The years, therefore, between sixteen when a girl usually obtains the required \"Ordinary levels\" and eighteen, when she can begin her nursing training at a preliminary Training School, are difficult ones to fill in. To cater for this there are, in most countries, pre-nursing courses at Technical Schools. If she attends these, a girl can often fit in a less exacting paid job as well, so that between the years of sixteen and eighteen, she is not only preparing for her training, but also earning a little money as well.\n\nAt the age of eighteen, three hard years of intensive training begins, during which girls must attend lectures given by senior nurses, tutors and doctors. They have to read and study in order to pass theory examinations in such subjects as physiology, anatomy and hygiene. They have also to do a great deal of practical work. At the Preliminary Training School, they learn bed-making and bandaging, which they practice on a life-size doll. Later, they are given training in all the different departments of a large hospital. Outpatients and the operating theater are two examples.\n\nAt the end, there is the final examination which includes both the theoretical and the practical. after this, if she passes, the student nurse is fully qualified and entitled to call herself S.R.N. -- State Registered Nurse. These letters are hardly won and dearly cherished and nowadays, there is a State Roll of qualified nurses so that unlike days gone by, amateurs and charlatans cannot prey upon the sick and pretend that they are qualified, when they are not.\n\nOn a lower scale, a girl can become a State Enrolled Nurse. The training for this is only two years. There are no State Examinations and the nurses' work and progress are merely 'assessed'. This, therefore, is a way in which girls, lacking academic ability, but having a highly developed sense of vocation may enter the nursing profession.\n\nThese days for the trained nurse, there are many different avenues. there is hospital work of all kinds ranging from the care of the elderly sick, to the care of the new born babies and expectant mothers which is called midwifery Much nursing is now done in the homes of the patients. the District Nursing Service caters for this and trains girls to visit the sick at home. for those with a special vocation, there is the care of the mentally sub-normal or the physically handicapped. there are also unlimited opportunities for travel, because all countries, whether of the East or the west which are short of trained nurses may seek the services of newly trained nurses.\n\nThe conditions of service for nurses are not, as good a they ought to be, hours are long, the work hard and the pay not enough. Recently, nurses trying to keep up with the cost of living in Britain, 'staged' an informal one-day strike. Since then, they have received pay rises which are richly deserved. There are few professions in which personal qualities are so important as in the nursing profession. Nurses must have a genuine desire to serve humanity. No matter how great the advance of Science and technical skills, the nurse must also be scrupulously careful and conscientious, since there can be no 'trusting to luck' when a life may be at stake. A nurse too must be able to take orders and to accept discipline. At the same time, she must be self-reliant and prepared to take the initiative, if necessary. With skill and patience, she helps her fellow men and women at a time when they need help most."

        "content": "The title suggest that \"book-learning is all right as far as it goes, but success in life goes to the practical man of affairs rather than tot he lofty theorist.\" Such ideas are certainly given the color of truth by the undoubted fact that the successful politician goes further on shrewdness than on political theory, and the rich businessman further on practical ability than on the degree in economics. If success in life is to be measured in terms of money, power and position, it is the practical man who succeeds most often. Experience has taught him when to buy and when to sell, whom to trust and whom to suspect, whom to make friends with and whom to ignore.\nThe title also suggests that we tend to take more notice of the lessons of life than the lessons of our teachers in school. This is undoubtedly true! Children are naturally lazy and inattentive because a failure in class doesn't seem to matter very much -- at least at the time. After all, there is always the security of home. But, when a man comes to have his own home with payments falling due and hungry mouths to feed, he is afraid to be inattentive to his job because he may lose it. Harsh experience teaches him to be his best, because if he fails, he knows his employers will not be sentimental about the needs of his family.\n\nAnd again, the title suggests many spheres of adult activity in which, although a little theory is obviously necessary, practical experience alone can achieve results a learner-driver can easily learn the mechanics of driving a motor car in the classroom and be able to answer any question, but with all his theoretical knowledge, he (or she) is bound to be nervous the first time out on the road alone -- even when the driving-test has been successfully passed. Only experience can teach the new driver to cope with the speed of the hurly-burly of the city roads.\n\nMarriage, also, is said to be 'a lottery'. Some mutual thoughts can perhaps, bring together partners who are likely to be happy, but experience really counts in marriage more than anything else. No two people can live happily and successfully together before they have learned by experience how to strengthen their bonds and break down their barriers.\n\nMany occupations also demand a maximum of experience, given a minimum of theoretical knowledge. The salesman goes to shops and private houses with a good theoretical knowledge but experience has to teach him to make friends, what selling line to take, and how to avoid offence. Many a job depends entirely on practice and experience. the shoemaker, the goldsmith, the tailor, the fisherman -- all these and hundreds like them learn their skills by practice, by trial and error, and often serve a long apprenticeship to their trade. Even the soldier in battle learns the art of jungle-warfare better in action, when his life may depend on his decisions, than in the jungle-warfare school.\n\nAll the same, we must be careful not to regard experience as the only teacher. There are indeed certain subjects concerning which practical knowledge is either impossible, or beside the point, or completely dependent on theoretical knowledge. The astronaut is the practical man of space-travel, but he is merely the 'Guinea-pig' of the scientist in actual fact, doing precisely as he is told by men whose practical experience has never been extended outside the university lecture-room. In fact, in the approaching age of science, technology and automation, theoretical knowledge will be at a premium, while practical experience diminishes in importance.\n\nAgain, nobody's individual experience can ever be regarded as complete. We must inevitably draw on the experience of others for success in any worthwhile occupation. after all, theoretical knowledge is in reality no more than the accumulated experience of other people. While such textbook knowledge will have been sufficient in itself, the man who fails to use it merely, makes matters harder for himself. The usual process with theory is that we learn at school rather reluctantly -- and then refer back to it when experience teaches us its value and the less well the theory has been learnt at school, the harder this becomes in later life. Experience is no doubt the best teacher, but it is foolish to scorn the classroom."

        "title": "Birds",
        "content": "The earliest birds of which we have any record were descended from reptiles and lived about a hundred and thirty million years ago. These first birds had tails like lizards and teeth in their jaws. Over a period of many millions of years, the wings developed at the expense of the tail and the teeth disappeared. Thus birds as we know the today have evolved. They now differ very much from reptiles and it is only because of the research of zoologists one hundred years ago, that they were found to belong to the same class.\nThere are about eight thousand five hundred different species of birds, and the world can be divided up into areas or regions in which a large proportion of birds in those regions are found there and nowhere else. There are six formal regions. The Northern and Southern Hemisphere are divided into two regions each and the Far East is covered by two : -- the Oriental and the Australian. Such divisions are only very rough ones and are not as definite as the rubber producing areas of the Far East would be on a map. The oyster-catcher for example, with its long red bill and pink legs, does not belong anywhere and is as well known in New Zealand or New Guinea as it is in Britain. The house sparrow or starling, very common birds in most parts of Britain is never seen in Scotland. The line which divides the two Far Eastern 'bird regions' passes through the Indonesian Islands, and it is not by chance that it does. It is called the Wallace Lien after the great explorer and naturalist. On one side of it the birds of Bali are completely different from the birds of Lombok on the other side and only twenty miles away.\n\nFlying birds are all physically built for an active life. Their bodies are very muscular with hollow light bones, a sharp keel and a powerful heart. They are nearly always small to reduce weight and are covered with feathers which are light and not only keep the bird warm, but also assist in flight. Feathers are usually attractive and bright and a bird has many different kinds ranging from the Quill, which is stiff and barbed to the soft down found on the breast. On the whole, it is only the small birds that fly. The ostrich, for example, while possessing all the bird-like characteristics stays firmly on the ground because of its size.\n\nThe habits as well as the physical build of birds are similar too. Mating and courtship are purely by instinct and it is not true that the male courts the female with passionate bird-song ! Before mating, the cock-bird will annex his own territory according to his own needs. He then proceeds to 'stake his claim' by singing aggressive songs which keep other would-be tenants away and attracts the female. then comes the important business of building the nest. All birds do this with a few exceptions like the cuckoo, which 'borrows' other nests or the mound-bird family in which Australia, which leaves the eggs ins and or rotting vegetation. The hen bird must then lay the eggs and incubate the young and after they arrive, parent birds feed them and train them to fly and fend for themselves.\n\nMigration is another habit which some, though not all, birds share. The mystery of migration has intrigued men for centuries. It is thought that cold weather and shortage of food cause birds to migrate and this may well be true, but how and why they plot their courses are much harder questions. Some British swallows, for instance, will winter in the South of England, while others have been found in the USA. The Arctic Tern flies half way round the world to migrate from its breeding ground in the Arctic to the fringe of the Antarctic. They gray plover, breed in Siberia journeys to Australia. Much has been discovered about migration through the process of ringing birds and it has been found that for year after year, swallows will fly to the same place in South Africa and then returns to England in February. The young do not always fly with the old. How they find their ways is another mystery. Some ornithologists say that it is purely instinct or an inborn common sense which tells them. Others think that they are guided by the moon and stars or by the lines of coast and rivers. It is suggested now that a bird such as the Arctic Tern has built-in radar equipment since every year it lands on the same solitary Pacific Island to rest. As with so much of nature there is, as yet, no final answer.\n\nBirds play an important part in the life of man. Some of them, like the common sparrow are merely pests, while others help to rid the world of insects on which they live and which otherwise would become a menace. many larger birds like hens and ducks provide food for man in the form of meat and eggs. Wild fowl provide sport as well as game in the catching of it. Feathers are used for different purposes as in hats or for down. Finally there is the beauty of birds -- whether the tuneful song of the nightingale or the magnificent plumage of the peacock. All are there to delight the hearts of men, not only of ornithologists, but of ordinary people who, perhaps, in the middle of a dreary day will be cheered by the clear bell-like song of  bird or the sight of a clean, beautiful wing in flight."

        "title": "The influence of cinema",
        "content": "The pre-war romantic ideal of boys and girls was to become a film-star. Today, it is to 'get on television', or to lead a 'pop' group, or to make a best-selling record -- perhaps even get it into the 'top ten'. Such, perhaps, is the measure of the decline in influence and importance suffered by the cinema in its primary role, that of an entertainment medium. Today, in Britain and the USA, though not yet in Malaysia generally, a cinema-queue is a rarity. Far less film are produced nowadays in Hollywood and Britain than in the 1930s, the 'golden years', and these belong to relatively few categories. Three quarters of the cinemas in Britain have already closed down, or gone over to 'Bingo' (a gambling game). a cynic tells the following story. A man rang up the local cinema manager and asked. \"What time does the program start ?\" The manager replied, \"What time can you get here ?\" The cinema is dying a lingering death in the West and the death-blow has, of course, been dealt by television. Why should people go out and pay for entertainment, when they can be entertained at home ? The cinema industry admits the sense of this and now concentrates on producing film features, domestic serials, 'Westerns', hospitals and law-serial dramas exclusively for the television screen.\nWhat then is left for the cinema proper ? Very little, but what there is, succeeds because of the present limitation of television. First of all, the long drama, the 'epic', usually on a biblical or classical theme, needs time, space on the 'wide screen', and color, while there is limitation on the size of the television screen and the number of channels available. But, this is a transitional period and ultimately no films will be made for showing in cinema theaters. This assumes, of course, that enough people will be able to afford television sets ! There will still be a long period during which poorer section of population will look tot he cinema as their chief means of entertainment.\n\nThe experimental 'theater' of France and Italy has done much to turn cinema technique into an art-form. 'Epics' are good, sometimes very good indeed, though often, they tend to lose their dramatic value through too much noise and movement. Provided such films only are seen, the cinema-goer can defend has habits, but he or she is open to criticism, if the film showing ex, or violence, or horror is preferred.\n\nBut the main charge against the cinema-goer is that, he is wasting time which could better be spent in productive or creativity activity. It is perfectly true that no student or any other ambitious person can afford the time to spend long hours at the cinema, and if he prefers to watch the worst type of films, there is chance that he will carry some of the wrong ideas, if not actual violence and immorality, into his own life.\n\nThe cinema, all the same, properly used, is a legitimate means of relaxation. Moreover, there are certain advantages to be gained from intelligent and moderate cinema-going. As the medium is vision and sound, illiteracy is no barrier to learning, and the minds of many primitive people must have been immensely broadened by the cinema. Providing, it is not used for propaganda purpose, the cinema, can also disseminate good social and moral, sometimes even religious ideas and ideals.\n\nMuch also can be learnt from documentary films, whether shown in schools or in the cinema; films are valuable adjuncts to military training and in many advanced studies. the film is also a useful means not only of disseminating, but also of recording the cultures of nations, often when such cultures, expressed in native dancing, folk arts and crafts etc, are in danger of dying out through Westernization. The folk-stories, the plays and the dancing of the Indian, Malays and Chinese cultures have been captured for ever, and the films recording them will ultimately become historic documents.\n\nLike any other means of communication, the cinema has been, and will be debased from time to time. But at its best, the film is of value to the community, and the cinema, properly used, can be of positive value in the fields both of entertainment and education."

        "title": "Smoking",
        "content": "It is alleged that Sir Walter Raleigh first imported the 'noxious weed' into Britain from America and the smoking habit swiftly caught on. Today, the tobacco industry brings employment to thousands in the various growing, picking, curing and manufacturing processes. Most of it comes from America, Turkey or the Balkans, but tobacco is shipped to factories for curing and manufacturing in almost every country in the world, although its ownership is shared between a few giant international combines. Cigars, pipe tobacco, cigarettes, and snuff, (another by-product) are subjected to government anti-smoking propaganda, a sharp decline in tobacco consumption is not desired by countries such as Britain, as it would result in an embarrassing financial loss.\nWhy, then, all the fuss ? Why is there the increasingly large and vocal body of anti-smoking opinion ? It is perfectly true that pipe-smokers always smell of tobacco, that snuff-takers have stained upper-lips, that a room littered with full ash trays and tea-cups full of sodden cigarette ends is disgusting. even the smell of tobacco offends some people; hence the banning of cigarettes in many theaters and cinemas and the provision of non-smoking compartments on aircraft. But the real objection -- so we are told -- is the marked tendency of addicted cigarette smokers to bronchial and respiratory complaints, some of which are fatal, and most important of all, the high incidence of lung cancer.\n\nNobody denies that smoking habits are distasteful to the non-smoker, but opinion is harpy divided about the alleged medical harm. Statistics can be made to prove anything, and while doctors alarming figures allege a direct connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, the cigarette maker's own research, understandably enough, seems to indicate that there is no connection at all, and furthermore that more lung cancer is caused by atmospheric pollution in industrial cities than by the smoking habit. So far, the medical case remains 'not proven', but it is sufficiently frightening to deter many people who have never smoked before from making  start.\n\nFurthermore, the doctors admit that there are degrees of danger The heavy (i.e. 20+) addicted cigarette smoker who inhales the smoke is most liable to lung cancer, those who do not inhale much less liable; pipe-smokers are much safer. To inhale cigars is particularly dangerous. Yet, Sir Winston Churchill who smoked eight or ten large Havana cigars a day, lived to see 90; but, the observers say, he did no inhale! Probably the dispute will not be settled until much more is known about the nature of cancer itself. But meanwhile, the propaganda gathers momentum both for and against. tens of thousands are spent on advertising in the press, magazines and on radio and television. Efforts are being made in Britain to ban this television publicity.\n\nWhether or not to smoke, must remain a matter for the individual. Nothing is more likely to increase smoking than attempts to discourage it or even make it illegal. The curious schoolboy who is forbidden a cigarette at home will only smoke in secret. America, during the days of prohibition, consumed more liquor than at any other time in her history. But smoking, to any sane individual, is a vice to be discouraged whenever possible, particularly among young people, and it is quite distressing to see cigarettes drooping from the lips if young people whose parents and grandparents probably never smoked in their lives. they are certainly the victims of the clever advertising propagandists who make it appear sophisticated, or manly, or smart to indulge. Tobacco 'goes up in smoke' and is therefore a sheer waste money. At the very least, it affects the wind and is harmful to athletes, and it is an undeniably dirty habit. Also, it can easily become a craving and a necessity, and pleasure which becomes this, becomes a vice.\n\nYet, despite all this, people go on smoking and perhaps it is only fair to put the case for smokers. If asked, a smoker would say that he enjoys the 'taste' of his cigarette, cigar, or pipe, but there is more to it than that. Life is busy and lived at a great pace nowadays. Nerves are easily frayed, tempers shortened, brains busy, but hands inactive. A cigarette soothes -- during that difficult interview, or making that important decision. It also helps concentration, and there may indeed be something in the idea of having the mouth and the hands active as well as the brain. And everybody knows that a cigarette helps to 'break the ice' in social relationships and the phrase 'have a cigarette' is often a good opening gambit between strangers.\n\nBut the best advice about the smoking remains this. If you do, cut down; if you don't, don't start !"

        "title": "Electricity",
        "content": "The word 'electricity' comes from a Greek word meaning amber, because it was the Greeks, many thousands of years ago who first discovered this mysterious force. They found that if a piece of amber was rubbed with fur, it would pick up pieces of straw and other light weight materials. Later, scientists discovered that other materials would act like amber and could be given charges of electricity. Today, such charges of electricity can be produced in a similar way by running a comb through the hair or by shuffling across a thick rug. But, all this is very primitive and before electricity could really become the servant it is today, scientists over many years have had to discover a great deal about it.\nThey have had first of all to understand something about the smallest of all units -- the atom. This is made up of minute particles called electrons which can, given the right stimuli, move from atom to atom. Here we must remember that all these divisions of matter are very small indeed. They are so tiny that they cannot be seen even with the most powerful microscope.\n\nIt is these electrons which can move from atom to atom, which form an electric current and the scientific definition of an electric current is a stream of electrons moving through certain materials.\n\nMore than one hundred and fifty years ago, an Italian scientist named Volta found a way of getting an electric current. He invented an electric bell, but only a very weak current came from it and so it was not of much use. It is only since Michael Faraday, a British Scientist of the nineteenth century, invented a machine to push electrons on their way and thereby to produce a current of electricity, that electricity has become really useful. Faraday's machine was really the primitive and simple forerunner of today's modern generators.\n\nNowadays, we use both electric cells and generators to supply currents of electricity. A battery, which we use in portable radios, hearing aids, motor vehicles and electric toys is made up of two or more electric cells joined together. Such cells are made up of zinc and carbon with a moist mixture of chemicals in between. It is the action of these chemicals on the zinc which starts the flow of electrons and thus causes the electric current to begin to flow.\n\nA generator is made up of magnets and coils of wire either of which must be whirled round and round to start the electrons moving and to begin the current. Hence generators are often driven round by large water wheels, and electric power plants are often to be found near waterfalls and dams. Steam turbines are used to 'turn' generators too. The electricity which is supplied to our houses, to our shops, streets and offices all comes from generators as do the currents in the big machines and factories. Thus, we are provided with lights, fans, cookers, and all the modern electrical appliances which we know today, from the simple electric light bulb to the most elaborate electrically driven machine. Loads of iron can be lifted by electric machines, an X-ray picture can be taken, silver knives and forks can be replated, from electricity produced by a generator.\n\nBut before ordinary people could feel the benefits of these things, scientist and electricians have had to learn a great deal about the use and control of electricity. There is much more to it than the setting up of a flow of electrons and the turning on of a switch. Circuits or paths along which the current can run must be set up and there must be easy ways of stopping and starting it. Electricity will flow through some substances which are called good conductors, more easily than others, which are called bad conductors. Both are equally important because poor conductors are used to stop electricity from flowing where it is not wanted. The circuits of electricity are made by wires which bring the electricity from the power plants to our houses -- to the switch in the wall, to the cooker, to the power points. All we have to do is to put the switch on or the plug in. This action joins the wires in the plug or switch, to the wires connected with the generator and the circuit is made complete. It is broken when the switch is turned off or the plug removed.\n\nAll this  sounds very simple as indeed do all great discoveries. But, when we consider the Myriad uses of electricity for all our home appliances, our television sets, our transport and telegraph systems we should think for a moment the debt which modern civilizations woes to men like Faraday and others who in former years, wrote out the many signs we now see blazed in electric lights all over the world \"Electricity, your servant.\""

        "title": "Physical education",
        "content": "It has become conventional to trace most worthwhile features of civilization to classical times, but in the case of physical education, it is essential. The Greeks placed physical culture high on the list of noble virtues; to gain the victor's laurel wreath at the Olympics was a high honor. he Romans were no less enthusiastic, it is said that even Nero competed for Olympic honors. The idea of physical prowess was to impart the stoic virtues of physical courage and indifference to pain necessary both in warfare and in the battle of life. The modern theory of physical education is very different. it all began with a revival of the Olympic in the early part of the present century, after a time lag of almost 2,000 years in which games and athletics had been either local and spasmodic, and non-existent.\nThe new idea was based on the idea of physical education for its won sake, and healthy international competition, as a means of raising standards. The effect of an unbroken series of Olympiad has been that today, in almost every country in the world, almost every child, young man and woman has a built in aspiration to excel in some physical activity or another. This is fostered by parents, but more particularly in schools, where, all over the world, physical education forms an important part of the curriculum. In earlier days, women and girls took a relatively small part, as they were hampered by social and dress conventions. Today, women quarter-milers are as fast as the men quarter-milers were in the '30s. Again nowadays, the emphasis is not on body bulk and brute force, but on speed, suppleness and 'wiriness,' and coaching is designed to produce this kind of physique -- so is the diet planned for athlete.\n\nThe love of sport and physical education actually originate in Britain, where for centuries all classes had followed their own athletic pursuits -- football and rugby, cricket, swimming and boxing. It was the British who introduced winter sports to Switzerland ! But the Olympiads caused the spread of sports and games to all corners of the globe, so that today, the finest exponents of many sports and games are to be found in the Far East. These are such as suit the Far Eastern physique, with its light build and suppleness -- hockey, football, judo, table-tennis, acrobatics and tumbling, netball (basketball) and ice-skating.\n\nNowadays, the importance of correct, balanced feeding is recognized on all sides as the essential basis for the athletic physique. Fats and starch are avoided, while food containing protein and vitamins are encouraged. Adequate sleep is important and so is personal hygiene, including abstinence from tobacco and alcohol. These are merely the basis on which advanced coaching can be built.\n\nBut competition and kudos are not the only motive for an interest in physical education. Nowadays, the competent amateur in almost any sport is tempted to become the paid professional, and rich prizes are available to those who succeed in the world of boxing, football and tennis, to quote but a few. Apart from money the professional athlete enjoys world-travel and sometimes world-fame; he can do much for his country's image in the eyes of foreign nations. But there is more even than this. The athlete, whether amateur or professional, plays his or her game primarily, because it brings pleasure, because it sustains health, because it builds resistance to constitutional weakness and disease. Neither must sport be given up  in youth; Stanley Mathews plays first division soccer at 50. even the lesser man can go on playing golf as long as he can still walk and perhaps this identifies the most important argument in favor of physical education -- the provision of an absorbing leisure activity which refreshes, in that it is a complete contrast with the normal paid occupation. Further merits, applicable more to team games, are the ability to show self-control of body and mind -- merits learned in the process of playing with one's fellows.\n\nExcess in physical exertion, as in anything else, has its dangers. Athletics should be avoided by those with any weakness such as heart disease or blood-pressure, but common sense and the doctor's advice are the guiding principles here. Neither should physical education be allowed to become a fetish. However competent an athlete may be, the world will require brains rather than brawn -- an active mind is worth more than an active body ! There is also the danger that mass -- hysteria may put the athlete on a higher pedestal than the doctor, the teacher, or even the statesman. Let us be quite clear that their true place is lower in the scheme of things. Physical education is an excellent thing -- in its place !"

        "title": "Freedom",
        "content": "Freedom, is a privilege that every person living in a democratic country is proud to possess, and in many constitutions, the freedom of the individual is guaranteed. The word \"freedom\" is a general word, which means three different things, freedom of speech, freedom of the person and freedom of assembly.\nWe deal firstly with freedom of speech, a most important right since, if a country is to be run on democratic lines, every individual should be allowed to say publicly what he thinks. In England, no such specific right is laid down in the constitution specifically, thought here are many ways in which the law can be broken. Defamation is not allowed, and can take the form of libel or slander. defamatory matter is matter which causes some other person to be brought into ridicule, hatred or contempt, and if it is written down, it is libel, whereas, if it is spoken, it is slander. Genuine criticism made in good faith is quite acceptable, however. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to determine what constitutes libel or slander, and as a famous writer on English law, Professor Dicey, once wrote \"freedom of discussion consists in the right to write or say anything which a jury, consisting of twelve shopkeepers, think it expedient should be said or written.\" Freedom of speech also includes the freedom to worship as one pleases, a most important RIGHT. However, it is against the law to publish blasphemous material, which is defined as material which reviles God and religion. Clearly the right to speak freely does not include the right to publish obscenity, and the law is naturally strict on this subject. Finally, under freedom of speech, we must consider the position of the press, and in general, it can be said that press writers stand in the same position as letter writers, in that they are free to print what they like, provided that it is not libelous. However, if a newspaper libels someone, it is usually a defen2e to say that the libel was not intended or malicious, and that a full apology should be inserted at the earliest opportunity.\n\nThe next aspect of freedom is freedom of assembly, and since one man is legally allowed to publish his views, it follows that a hundred or more can meet together to do the same thing. However, form the point of view of public safety, meetings should be subject to some form of official control, and the police in many countries are vested with a number of powers. If a policeman suspects that a public meeting is likely to cause a breach of the peace, he can break it up as the community's safety is at stake. In addition, if something illegal is going on at the meeting, it can be broken up. The law with regard to processions is similar: they are not against the law, but if a procession is obstructing the highway, it can be broken up, and the authorities can lay down the route for a procession, so as to avoid troublesome or congested areas.\n\nThe last important aspect of freedom is freedom of the person. While it is true to say that in this country, every person is liable to be arrested for his criminal acts, there are important safeguards for the individual which ensure speedy trial or release if the charge is wrong. This right is laid down in the Habeas Corpus Procedure. Habeas Corpus (meaning \"you have the body\") is a procedure, whereby the prisoner or his friend demands a writ from a judge, which is then served upon the gaoler who has to show good cause why the particular person has been arrested. If he cannot do this, the prisoner must be released. even if, the arrest is proved to be correct, the Habeas corpus writ ensures a speedy trial and right to bail. Though nobody can be arrested without good cause, certain countries authorize the temporary detention of political suspects.\n\nIn conclusion, two important points should the stressed. Firstly, the government should not curtail the individual's freedom too strictly, and that this can have disastrous consequences, is well illustrated by the French Revolution of 1889. Here, the people rebelled against a government which applied the law too strictly and unfairly against the lower classes and which completely restricted personal freedom. The government was over-thrown and a period of social disorder resulted as there were no laws nor central administration left, any tyranny was replaced by another. Secondly, for society's sake, freedom should not be abused by the people and law should be observed. Man is primarily a member of society and of a community rather than an individual, and though his freedom is important, it must be limited to conform tot he well-being of other members of the same society. freedom, which is not subject to some form of control is of no value at all."

        "title": "Road accidents",
        "content": "The sight of ambulances and police-cars racing to the scene of a road accident in the city or on the busy highway is so commonplace in modern countries that few heads turn even in idle curiosity. This is part of the tragedy of road accidents. They occur so often that they are taken for granted, and the general public has become conditioned to them. A murder, a fire or a riot is still front page news, but a serious motor accident resulting in ghastly injury and often loss of life hardly rates a small back-page paragraph except o the relatives of those involved, whose lies may be shattered and reduced to pitiful sadness, often poverty, by a few seconds of rending metal and shattering glass. No solution of the problem can help these individuals. There is indeed no cure, so there must be prevention, an the alarming increase in accidents shown by statistics makes the question of cure an immediate one. In most countries, the accident rate goes up roughly in proportion to the increase in the number of vehicles on the road, and there is every sign that in most modern countries, the numbers of both are steadily increasing.\nSuch is the problem, but when we always the cause of accidents, we find there are many, and that the problem is complex indeed.\n\nThe first point to realize is that not all accidents are caused by the driver; quite often the pedestrian is to blame. The \"jay\" walker who is liable to a heavy fine in the USA, can be a menace; so can the child or teenager playing 'last across' or simply playing about with a ball on the road; so can the old person whose ability to see, hear and walk properly may be defective. Sometimes, the roads themselves present hazards; the sharp bend with a reverse camber can easily send a vehicle off the road; sudden rain, ice patches, snow and fog in cold countries, cause innumerable accidents every winter. and the narrowness of many roads in country areas, and their poor surface and blind corners, greatly increase hazards of the driver. A proportion of accidents can, of course, be blamed on the vehicle and therefore on the driver, though nobody can rule out a front-wheel blow-out of speed. Vehicle defects, however, results from careless maintenance and the refusal to pay for necessary repairs. Faulty tyres, steering, lighting and brakes cause many accidents. Badly focused or undipped headlamps can blind oncoming traffic. But, it must be admitted that most accidents result from a failure of the driver himself. Drink increased foolhardiness and slows reactions, and in most countries, the penalties for driving under the influence of liquor are very stringent indeed. But, many accidents results from a simple error of judgment due to inexperience or lack of 'road sense' -- and it is unfortunate that so many people who barely 'scrape; through their driving test gain their experience at the expense of other people. Other relevant causes are inconsiderate driving, a momentary slackening of attention due to fatigue, an insect in he vehicle, or a family row, irritation hurry, perhaps and attack of illness at the wheel, or simply the desire to 'show off' to a girl friend.\n\nJust as there is no single cause of road accidents, so there can be no single solution, although most countries are trying out both short and long term ideas. Looking ahead, the sane policy is to teach road manners, both to drivers and pedestrians alike.\n\nBritain is at present trying 'horrific' propaganda both on television and in posters -- depicting realistically what happens when an accidents occurs.\n\ndriving tests are becoming more exacting, and licenses withdrawn for long periods following serious offences. Heavy fines and imprisonment await the serious offender. It may well become necessary to institute periodic tests for all drivers -- if this happened, one suspects, many people would be put straight off the road. Insurance companies already put up their premiums after serious accidents and may refuse to reinsure 'bad risks,' after which ti is unlikely that any other company will take them on. Drunken driving - especially in Britain -- is severely punished nowadays; 'breathalysers' may become legal evidence after the government has laid down the maximum quantity of liquor a person who is driving may consume in a given period.\n\nRoads, of course, must be widened, improved, and modernized as fast as possible -- and preferably made two ways. it is rather a grievance among motorists that little of the revenue they pay in road-tax, is actually spent on road-improvement.\n\nVehicles should be subjected to a five-year check, at least, and old commercial vehicles to spot-checks. This would put many of them of the road."

        "title": "Superstitions",
        "content": "The dictionary definition of superstition is 'credulity regarding the supernatural, irrational fear of the unknown or mysterious, misdirected reverence'. It is not altogether satisfactory, because it fails to lay due emphasis on the disastrous results of superstitious beliefs and practice in the lives of a vast number of people throughout the world -- even today. Superstition can do nothing, but harm. It can destroy the lives of those over whom it gains a stronghold.\nSuperstition originates in primitive animism which may fairly be described as false religion. While all great world religions have an element of superstition about them, particularly in their early beginnings, their main teachings are based on the personal leadership of their founders and in every case tend to set the soul and mind of man free from fear and prejudice. Animism, however -- still accepted in tropical Africa and the remote areas of the Asia -- is entirely different. It is based on the false assumption that every feature of nature has its own familiar spirit, and in order to live at peace with nature, the individual is committed both to please the to appease this welter of imaginary deities. Life becomes a series of 'restrictive practices' and there can be no hope of development, for those minds suffer this daily and nightly torture. what, then, are some of these effects ? Here are a few examples.\n\nMany primitive races share a fear of the dark. The Jews in Biblical times and the Native Americans in the 19th century, were the constant prey of alien marauders. many thousands were slaughtered because they refused to offend the 'night spirits' by fighting back after dark. Toda, in tropical Africa, countless cruelties are practiced in remote jungle villages because of superstition. The  fertility cults and the puberty rites undergone by women and adolescent boys and girls defy description -- and all this happens to ensure the woman's 'productivity' and the man's 'manhood', as the requirement of the appropriate spirits. The more intelligent and therefore less frightened villagers, of course, make capital out of the fear of their fellow-tribesmen, by laying down the required offerings and practising the required ceremonial -- all to their own financial advantage. a village can easily be superstitious-- not only through tribute-paying, but also because the people are afraid to take sensible action to improve their lot for fear of offending the spirits. When the new fish-quay was built near Accra in Ghana as part of a beneficial development plan, the local people spent thousands of pounds on sacrifices to appease the local 'gods of the sea', because they were afraid their catches would be poor.\n\nBut even sophisticated countries in Europe and Asia have their superstitions, handed on as folklore, or exploited as financial rackets by the unscrupulous. Some are relatively harmless, although others can seriously upset an ignorant person's outlook on life or harm his pocket. event he Germans use their legend of the 'black man', the 'sweep' to ensure good behavior from their children at Christmas. the children are told that the sweep visits every house before Christmas and will beat any child who has been naughty! Most of the British superstitions are relatively harmless. Many people will not walk under a ladder - possible because they think the ladder may collapse or the painter upsets his pot ! Many British people 'touch wood' if they find themselves confidently asserting an unfortunate thing is not going to happen -- perhaps because trees had a magical significance in early  Britain. And again very many people, if they spill salt, throw some over their left shoulders. The theory is that it gets in the devils' eyes. and no doubt the Chinese, the Malays and the Indians have many similar practices. None of these are specially harmful -- yet there are certain other superstitions which can be disastrous.\n\nThe worst of these is astrology -- the belief that our lives are governed by the stars and the planets. Not only do people pay large sums to those who exploit this racket, but their lives also become just as rigidly circumscribed as those of primitive tribesmen. And this same superstition can be extended to gambling in its many forms and lead to people losing vast sums of money because they rely on a 'lucky' number or color charms, amulets and so on -- absolutely worthless in every respect -- also extract from many people their hard-earned money.\n\nAt best, superstition is no more than eccentricity -- at worst, a dangerous threat to serene and untrammeled living. Most of it belongs to our dim ancestry, and as the human race evolves, so will superstition decrease, and, in the end, disappear."

        "title": "Divorce",
        "content": "In the monogamous countries of the West, marriage has for many centuries been regarded as a permanent contract binding the couple together until death. Most of the Christian Churches are very rigid in their views on the indissolubility of marriage and consider that it is a sacrament and that it offends God's laws for it to be broken.\nThere is another large body of opinion in Western countries, which considers that marriage is a man-made contract only, without spiritual significance. This being so, they argue there is no reason why the marriage contract should not be broken whenever it is convenient.\n\nIt is because of these diametrically opposed opinions that the divorce laws have never been clearly defined. Indeed they have seesawed between the two. In Roman Law (from which much of the Western legal system originates), divorce was easy. it could be obtained at the wish of either one or both of the parties. In Mediaeval times, divorce was forbidden and a marriage could only  be ended by an annulment. By the eighteenth century, the law had again changed and divorce could only be obtained by an Act of Parliament.\n\nToday, despite the efforts of men such as Sir Allen Herbert and Lord Gossell who have constantly urged that the law should be relaxed, 'Quick divorce' either in Britain or in America is not easy. To obtain one is both a costly and lengthy business during which the case must be taken to 'High Court'.\n\nThere are social as well as religious arguments against divorce. An easier divorce law can, say its opponents, make for a slacker attitude to marriage so that the moment things go wrong, the couple will 'down tools' and seek escape through the Divorce court. they will not try to mend the marriage and so the divorce laws mean that unhappy married couples are condemned to live in a hell-upon-earth from which there is no escape and it is here that the children suffer.\n\nThe question of children is a very important one. A marriage should be kept intact whether it is happy or not for the sake of the children, say the people who are opposed to divorce. A child must have both its parents. on the whole, however, such evidence as it is possible to obtain, seems to suggest that children brought up in an unhappy home are far worse off than children of divorced parents who are brought up peacefully be one parent and can see the other from time to time.\n\nFigures and statistics are invariably misleading. Now that the divorce laws in England are much less rigid than they were a hundred years ago, the rate of divorce has in fact risen. But before drawing the obvious conclusion, it must be remembered that a hundred years ago. (when the mortality rate was high) many marriages ended in death that might have come before the courts today and also that women of those days, completely subservient as they were to men, could not seek divorce and therefore endured untold misery which, for today's emancipated women, would be unthinkable.\n\nThe ideal, of course, is for all marriages, everywhere, to be happy but, of course, they are not. Many people marry too young to know what they are doing. Others are completely incompatible. For others, shortage of money, bad living conditions, latent insanity and many things drive all hope of happiness away. the law, therefore, in monogamous countries will have to be relaxed.\n\nOn the brighter side, it must be remembered that, in a recent survey in Britain, it was found that over 95% of marriages stayed intact and therefore, it is only a very small minority that is involved. Nevertheless, minorities have their importance and a right minded attitude to the problem seems to be summed up in the words of the Royal Commission on Divorce :-\n\n'No law should be so harsh as to lead to common disregard of it and no law should be so lax as to lessen regard for the sanctity or marriage.'"

        "content": "Psychology is an exact science which makes a study of all human behavior, both of individuals from childhood up to old age and of crowds because the behavior of the two is very different. If not only studies normal behavior, but abnormal behavior as well. Everything in man's make-up, therefore, that causes him to act as he does is within the psychologist's scope. His material is composed of human emotions which, of course, include fear, love, hate and feelings of that kind. it includes too, a study of human instincts like the instinct to eat, to sleep or to construct. As well as this, the intelligence, the personality and inherited characteristics must be considered before a true knowledge of human behavior can be achieved. Psychology is called an exact science because it studies facts as they are and not as they might be (as is the studies of Ethics).\nIt is comparatively young science, as it is only over the past hundred years or so, that men have considered it with any seriousness. Men such as the great German psychologist Freud, who put forward theories of the subconscious mind and its influence over conscious thought; Jung, Adler and McDougall, who thought that instincts were of paramount importance in influencing human behavior, were the great pioneers in the early days of psychology. Today, most universities all over the world have departments of psychology where, young men and women train for five years and more, to be psychologists and psychiatrists.\n\nBefore the emergence of psychology as a recognized science, people were considered to be either sane or insane. In between was a stage known as 'queer' or 'soft'. Such stage were never thought of as diseases and no attempt was ever made to help people labeled 'queer' or 'soft'. Nowadays, things are very different and in most large cities, both in the East and in the West, there are special hospitals which deal with the psychologists' patients or the mentally ill as they are called. In smaller towns, there is nearly always a special wing of the General Hospital which is set aside for other specialists do. Here, it is interesting to note that in supposedly highly advanced countries like America and Britain, the proportion of people who are mentally ill is every high. In a recent survey in Britain, it was found that one out of every three hospital beds is occupied by the mentally sick.\n\nPsychologists have something to contribute in the educational world. They advise as to the behavior of children, not only of the 'difficult' or retarded child, but of the normal ones as well. It is the research of educational psychologists which has given us the now familiar Intelligence and Mental tests. In these, a norm has to be established and then, when a child is given an Intelligence Test, his position in relation tot he norm can be found. Such gests are often used in selecting suitable jobs for children and young people too. Psychologists too have advanced many of the theories behind our modern approach to teaching and to learning. it is they who have suggested the value of visual aid and of practical work rather than theoretical all the time.\n\nPsychologists too, play an important part in the Industrial World and in the Services. How much work a man can do well, how much rest he needs, how much routine and monotony he can stand; these are all questions which all wise businessmen ask psychologists, before new steps are taken or changes made.\n\nIn the legal world and in police work, psychology is important too. Here, of course, t is the abnormal man or woman who is the psychologist's material. It is widely believed today that crime and lawlessness to some extent stem from the fact that normal reactions are not given a normal outlet. Hence frustrations and inhibitions arise, which lead to minor crimes of exhibitionism right up to sex crimes of murder or the may abnormalities of sex to be found in the modern world. Here, the advice of the psychologist is very valuable not only in the prevention of crime, but in the treatment of the criminal and in his rehabilitation afterwards.\n\nThe value of psychology and of psychologists is therefore very clear. There are those who scorn and sneer at it and are all for the old attitude where black was black and white was white. The criminal was wicked and the maniac depressive, or paranoiac or the schizophrenic were lunatic. This may well be true in extreme cases, but in between, there is a wide range of people with mental disorders who can be helped by this modern science just as the lives of normal people can be improved by a knowledge of what makes them react. Hence, psychology which is the study of man himself should and does play a most important part in his life."

        "content": "Life in a modern community is far more controlled by fashion than many people realize; fashion is big business, invented by original designers and controlled and promoted by business magnates for profit. Moreover, it affects not only clothing, but almost every aspect of daily life from the kind of house we live in, to the kind of book we read. And what is this mysterious thing called 'fashion' ? The best definition is that it is the material expression of a new trend of thought -- the outward expression of a new idea, and new ideas are the life blood of business, if they 'catch on' !\nWhen most people think of 'fashion', they think of clothing a women's clothes in particular, and it is true that the 'world of fashion' implies the latest 'model' from Paris, New York or London. Curiously enough, it was man in the old days who, like the male bird, dressed himself in 'fine feathers' -- not so much woman. In Britain, for instance, the 18th century 'gallant' in his velvet coat lace ruffs and powdered wig was splendid to behold. But since about 1820, fashion decreed that to look 'male' meant to look somber, and men's clothes have never recovered from the change, or indeed altered very much since then. Women, however, have more than made up for them. Today, event he most remote and primitive of them try to obtain Western clothing, shoes, etc ... while the wealthier ladies of more developed countries spend annually millions of pounds sterling or US dollars on the latest 'model'. These are first produced in the famous fashion houses of Paris, New York, London and Rome. \"haute Couture' draws the rich to the annual shows in these salons for the purpose of buying exclusive clothes. The prominent designers produce them according through their own ideas, and in doing so create new fashion trends which may or may not be popular. Stage two is the commercialization of successful models by large clothing firms which mass-produce them much more cheaply for the general market. and so, thousands of copies of a 'model' may appear in the chain stores some few weeks after the salon show. To be fashionable, women's clothes must have a certain 'look' which can be identified by other women, and therefore admired. It may be a raised or lower hem line, a low or high waist, a dress cut naturally off the shoulder, a certain range of colors or materials. The 'fashion-wise' woman recognized 'fashion' at once, and buys it, and this makes fashion big-business. To a lesser extent, men's clothes also vary according to fashion, but the conservatism of the average male is despair of the men's clothing trade.\n\nBut public taste in almost every feature of living is subject to change -- even the female figure must be one year thin and boyish, another year' curvaceous' to meet the dictates of the couturier, and men's clothing firms are, today, trying to sell the 'baggy look'. So let us look outside mere personal appearance.\n\nThere is a vast difference between Victorian furniture in Britain, pushy and elaborate and over-stuffed, and the cleaner, streamlined household products of the middle 20th century -- and this is simply fashion. Much modern furniture is grossly uncomfortable and much Victorian furniture supremely functional ! Houses, too, vary according to architectural fashion, modern leading architects setting the trends. Your new house today may be round, or made of glass and steel, or built on a split-level plan, or -- thanks to modern materials such as reinforced concrete -- perched high over a river or protruding from a mountain side. the old-fashioned 'boxy' structures are 'out'.\n\n'Fashions' are often made possible by the invention of new materials like plastics, 'man-made fibers' and cardboard they have revolutionized packaging and consumer-goods presentation. Cars have ever-new body-styles, thanks to fiber-glass and monocoque construction.\n\nBut 'fashion' goes deeper still. A 'way of life,' an occupation, a residential area, even a religion can be 'fashionable' or not, according to the whim of the moment. And we all know how 'fashionable', 'doubtful literature', 'kitchen-sink theater' and incomprehensible art and sculpture is at the present day.\n\n'Fashion,' in fact, is the commercial exploitation of man's restless quest for something new in an over-sophisticated society. It may give expression to new ideas, but basically it has no real worth. The beauty of a Grecian urn never varies, any more than will the absolute standards of beauty and decency which apply eternally to art and life."

        "title": "Leisure",
        "content": "The word 'leisure' means time at one's own disposal or free time which is not filled by work, whether it is by a paid job or by schoolwork or by housework. It is, in fact, 'time on our hands' when we can do exactly what we want to do. It is, therefore, one of the pleasures of life to have leisure and to be able to use it intelligently because, however old we are, or young, we have only one life, and time is most precious to all of us. It cannot be wasted.\nIf we are wise, therefore, we do not think of leisure as time to do absolutely nothing, because to do nothing is, for most intelligent people, the most boring thing of all. \"Sometimes I sit and think and sometimes I just sit !\" is a European saying not to be put into practice ! On the other hand, all of us sometimes, need to relax completely. \"What is this life if, full of care, we have no time to stand and stare ?\"\n\nLeisure, then, is time to be filled in congenial ways which differ with each individual, but it is wise to fill leisure hours with activities which are different from our main occupation. Thus, we have a change. for the indoor worker, perhaps a bank-clerk or a copy-typist, to spend leisure hours poring over books or cryptic puzzles would constitute no change, whereas, for a gardener or a farmer to do something like this, would provide the contrast needed for relaxation. Indoor workers are better served by doing outside activities and vice-versa.\n\nBut again, how we use our leisure depends entirely on our own individual tastes and talents. Here, hobbies and leisure are closely connected. The game lover will spend every available fee hour playing the game at which he excels or of which he is fond. The book lover will spend hours poring over books and will be a frequent visitor to the local library. Many people, including Britain's famous Winston Churchill, find relaxation in painting. He even found it in brick-laying ! A music lover will either play his favorite instrument or visit a concert. Television supplies the leisure needs of many.\n\nThe more varied the interests of each individual, the more varied, of course, will be his use of leisure. Wise people try to do many different things with their leisure hours, so that indoor and outdoor activities are included, as also are passive ones (like watching television) and active ones (like gardening or knitting). In this connection, it is wise for young people to try to develop many interests outside their regular work, some sedentary and some active, so that later on they will not be forced to lead too narrow a life. A criticism, and rightly so, of many universities in both the East and West is that students have to concentrate so had on their studies that they do not have time to develop interests and liking for subjects and activities outside their own. This is a pity and the lack of suitable interests for leisure is perhaps most of all felt when, men retire from the occupation which has filled their life-time. Then, at the age of sixty or sixty-five, they find themselves with the rest of life on their hands -- all of it leisure. There is a vacuum indeed for the man who is unable to fill any of it with interest and occupation.\n\nNowadays, it is not only for the old, but for all of us that the problem of how to use leisure usefully and well arises. With increased automation, labor-saving devices and precooked food, the housewife has more leisure than ever before. With shorter working hours and holidays with pay, people all over the world have more free time. A hundred years ago, a man was lucky if he had one half day a week 'off'. Today, t is a five-days working week for most people, with two or three weeks holiday with pay every year. This is right and proper, but there are pitfalls which a modern society must avoid. Boredom is one of them and this affects all age groups from the suburban housewife, to the old man who seems to fade out of life, because he does not know what to do with it. Teenage crime, juvenile delinquency, and the 'antics' of \"Mods and Rockers\" are attributed by many social workers to boredom which arises out of having nothing to do. 'Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do !'\n\nThe most important point of all, therefore, is to be educated for leisure so that however much free time we may have, and at whatever age, we may always be able to fill it happily and well, thus developing our fullest possible personalities."

        "title": "Thrift",
        "content": "Cicero, the Latin poet, once said that men do not realize how great a revenue thrift is and this is indeed true, because to be thrifty means to manage money in an economic way so that there is somehow always enough and often a little left over. Philosophers and poets of the world, in many different countries have extolled the virtues of thrift and as a result of this, there are many proverbs in almost every language which praise this human quality.\n\"Look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves,\" is a European proverb. \"Waste not, want not,\" is another and their is considerable truth in all of them.\n\nIn primitive societies, the virtue of thrift was even more applauded and certainly more necessary than it is today. In those days, the law of the jungle operated and only the fittest survived. There was no money in the sense that we know it today and therefore barter was the order of the day. Primitive men and women had, therefore, of necessity to save bits of this and collections of that, so that they could barter and thus survive at all. Later on, in the history of the world when wages were low and money Scarce, the virtue of thrift was still very necessary In England, for example, before and during the Industrial Revolution, there was a great deal of poverty. Whole families had to survive somehow on a few pennies a week. A crust of bread was precious and the thrifty dare not waste it.\n\nToday, fortunately, in most parts of the world, conditions of life are very different although there are regrettably, still some countries both in the East and West, where there is not enough money and where there is still a permanent struggle to survive. By and large, however, man is better off today than he has ever been. Machines and mass-production have made consumer goods become far more plentiful. wages too, in most countries keep pace with prices and so, in modern times, thrift is not thought of as the virtue or the necessity it once was. Too many factors in our modern life are militating against it. \"Hire Purchase,\" \"Pay as you wear\" \"Buy now, Pay Later.\" are such slogans seen in most of the world's shops and stores. All of them discourage thrift n the desire to save for something before buying it. Practically everything from the cradle to the grave, even including air passages can now be paid by installments and in arrears, if necessary. the desire therefore, to be thrifty and to save before having anything seems no longer to matter, since so many things can be obtained anyway. There is, of course, something to be said on the side of 'Hire Purchase'. In the old days, the power sections of society were never able to possess very much simply because, however thrifty they were, they could never accumulate the necessary capital. On the other hand, a \"reckless, couldn't careless\" attitude is often encouraged by this method of purchase.\n\nThere is, of course, the other side of the picture and although thrift is universally recognized as a virtue, it is all too easy to carry the virtue of thrift to extremes and to become mean, and ungenerous. Many so called self-made men are guilty of this. In their youth, they have had to save and to work hard for every penny and so in later years they, having been thrifty for too long, lose the habit and the joy of spending money even when they have plenty of it. They still continue to be thrifty even when there may be big savings in the bank.\n\n\"Thrift\" then, at its best, should b encouraged in ourselves and in our children. Everyone should be trained to know the real value of money and to be careful with it. Neither countries nor individuals can run their lives, unless this is so. Absence of thrift leads to the \"eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die,\" attitude which should never become paramount in a responsible society."

        "title": "Examinations",
        "content": "Older people who reflect on the happiness of youth often forget all about examinations, just as we tend to push all unpleasant things out of mind. All young people who aspire to reach any worth while position in life are committed to the examination system from the age of 9 or 10, until the early 20s, if the university training or technical college is included. Examinations are a series of hurdles to be jumped until the weary student finally reaches the winning post -- job.  At any rate, most people see them this way. Nobody likes them, but nobody can suggest a reasonable substitute for them.\nThere are two kinds of examinations; the private ones held in school or college and the public once such as school entrance, School Certificate, Higher School Certificate and the University examinations such as B.A. (Bachelor of Arts) B.S.c. (Bachelor of Science), B. Lit (Bachelor of Literature, L.L.B ( Bachelor of laws ) etc. their objectives may vary. The private ones are intended to show whether or not a student has worked well during a term and the result may involve little more than pleasure (or displeasure!) on the part of parent or teacher. The public ones are designed as steppingstones to more advanced fields of education, until the degree level is reached, and these are very important in determining the kind of job a student can get in the competitive world or in indicating what kind of further education suits his or her particular talents. Banks, business houses, commerce and local government demand a reasonable number of good 'O' levels and prefer some 'A's, while the professions, the law, medicine, teaching etc require considerably higher qualifications even than these. To the student, it seems an endless vista of study -- an intellectual 'rat-race' in these competitive modern times. Yet, there must be some way of indicating that one student has reached a required level when another has failed -- even the student will admit this (especially after he ahs passed). And the authorities have never been in any doubt -- any where. The fact that public examinations, both oral and written, were held as long ago as in Greek and Roman times shows this -- as does the fact that examinations today are held in every civilized country in the world. If we accept the need for a way of differentiating students, the question which follows is, \"are examinations the best way ?\" Here, there are two schools of thought. In Britain, the most debated examination is the \"11 +\". If a child fails at this age, he or she is debarred from the grammar school or 'stream', and in effect, from the academic life.\n\nIf a few cases, bright failures are given a second chance at 13 and a few move into higher schools -- but not many. Some local authorities have now dropped the examination altogether at this stage and award places on termly work and primary teachers' recommendations. But here again some have to fail, and however impartial the decision may be, there is always some suspicion of favoritism or unfairness.\n\nThe question arising, then, 'is an examination a fair test of ability ?' The answer, generally is, 'yes, it is.' There are, of course, children and young people whose minds 'go blank' in the examination room and those who suffer from nerves or whose technique is bad and then they fail to do themselves justice. But too often this talk of 'exam. nerves' s a cloak for laziness or ignorance ! By the middle teens, a child ought to make a fair showing, at more tender ages the candidate is given every chance including an intelligence test beforehand sufficiently elaborate to enable the school to predict results with some confidence.\n\nThe last question -- 'Are examinations fair in themselves ?' - may most certainly be answered 'yes'. The examiner is never out to catch the student; indeed enormous efforts are made to offer a wide selection of fair questions covering the whole range of work the student may be expected to have done. Again, the student who says 'I had a bad paper' really means 'I only covered part of the work and was unlucky!'\n\nGiven hard and intelligent work, any normal student may expect to pass his examination. There are, of course, helpful points such as neatness good spelling, paragraphing, planning the paper at the beginning and so on. These will all gain marks. But in general, providing the work is there, so will be the results.\n\nExaminations need never be feared. They can even be enjoyed; if only in retrospect !"

        "content": "About 90 million sterling is spent on the Football Pools in Britain every year and it is roughly estimated, ten times that sum is spent on betting at race meetings. Most of this stays in the pockets of the pool promoters or the bookmakers. In France, the \"Loterie Nationale\" is sponsored by the government. In England, 'Ernie' selects winning Premium Bond numbers which carry cash prizes. These facts are typical of the changed attitude of the West to what was once universally condemned as a social evil. An occupation that was once the pastime of the gilded aristocracy at least as lately as Georgian days -- spread eventually throughout society. In Victorian times, life was pathetically hard ad empty for the workers, both agricultural and industrial and gambling became the scourge of the lower classes -- with drink, its yeoke-fellow. But subsequently, it became the occupation of the middle-classes also and in doing so achieved an aura of respectability. Today, middle class family men and women have no qualm about a weekly stake on the football pools or a regular visit tot he betting shop, a recent and deplorable innovation in the streets of English towns and villages.\nBetting and gambling have come to stay in the Western world, and nobody would deny that it has always been a feature of the East. The Chinese love Mah Jong just as the Arab races love Backgammon. West Africans flock to the races in Ghana and Nigeria, the elite to the Casinos of the Riviera, while the British working-man has today added organized 'Bing' to his games of chance, some 90% of the cinemas in England having now discovered that gambling has far greater drawing-power than films, however good. Gambling, in fact, has come to stay. And the question, the educated and socially responsible person has to face is should gambling be condemned, and, if so, on what grounds.\n\nThe advanced standards of living which have been the by-product of industrialized states lend color to the view that gambling in moderation is harmless. 'What is wrong' people ask, \"if I spend a limited amount of money each week on gambling that I would spend on pleasure anyway ? I enjoy the excitement. Admittedly, I want 'something for nothing' -- but who has ever met a poor bookmaker ? Nobody suffers\".\n\nThe case against gambling is, of course, a very real one, despite the fact that few of us are so rigid, that we would refuse to take part in 'a raffle for a good cause' -- occasionally and generally, with no particular interest whether we win or lose.\n\nThe fact is that regular gambling makes a compulsive gambler in the end, in exactly the same way as regular drinking makes a drunkard. And even if the money spent is limited, there is no reason why it should fall into the hands of gambling promoter or why it should not be spent on intelligent purchases such as books or clothing, or even given away to charity. But generally, gambling becomes an obsession, making serious inroads on income, causing dependents to suffer, and bringing the gambler into touch with the undesirable underworld, where debts, violence, blackmail and other forms of vice flourish. These are the very real and practical results.\n\nMorally speaking, to 'get something for nothing' is a motive that spring from a combination of laziness and avarice. It is also a misuse of brains, time, money and opportunities.\n\nBut it is also an offense against society, because it is unproductive and because nobody can benefit except at the expense of somebody else. There are only three justifications for accepting money from another or indeed from a society or organization. These are first, the law of exchange which means that you give back the equivalent value. The second is the 'law of service', in which case you perform a service equivalent tot he payment. Third is 'law of the free gift' -- which means that what your receive is an act of kindness. Gambling falls into none of these categories."

        "title": "Juvenile delinquency",
        "content": "The problem of juvenile delinquency has assumed alarming proportions in most modern countries today. Towns and cities from the USA to South Africa, suffer from teenage hooliganism and lawlessness, drink and drug-taking have increased everywhere; gangs of youths, male and female, attack the law-abiding citizen, rob the shopkeeper, or organize their 'runnels' or pitched battles among themselves, Juvenile courts are overcrowded with offenders, 'approved' schools and borstals full to over-flowing. And neither government nor schoolmaster nor clergyman nor parent can seem to cure the trouble, or even fully diagnose its causes. Certainly, society as a whole cannot be blamed, affluent as it is in many countries, materialistic as it is in most; while the problem is serious and widespread, it is not one which affects more than a small proportion of young people. The vast majority are both hard working, moral in outlook, and imbued with a sense of responsibility. Unfortunately, worthwhile young people get little publicity, while the worthless ones make the headlines.\nWith all due respect to the USA, it is probable that the trouble stemmed from the post-war 'beat' movement. This American nihilist philosophy encouraged an attitude of personal irresponsibility among young people and rebellion against all forms of established authority. Its tenet was 'anything for kicks', therefore drink, drugs, violence, sexual license and perversion all played their disastrous part, and teenagers became first the victims of drug-peddlers and other criminals and then, the victims of their own vices. Unfortunately, many of these evils were made fashionable by a spate of moral plays and films and books. Secondly, the idea of 'teenagers' as a class, i.e. young people aged between 13 and 19, was a commercial invention of the American businessman; previously young people were either on the upper-child or the lower adult fringe. But such as the US pride in her young people that to make them precocious and to give them adult status in immaturity was a status symbol in very many families. It was also important for them to have a great deal of pocket-money. So the businessman produced a great range of consumer goods aimed specifically at the teenage -- not only clothes and 'pop' records, but 'reefers' and 'purple hearts'. And where the restraints of home, school and church were inadequate, the damage was done. But again, we should note that only the minority were affected.\n\nThere were, of course, other factors, some of them new. First of all, young people have always 'rebelled' against authority, but not often with the modern violence. secondly, youthful energy combined with over-indulgence leads to boredom, and much juvenile delinquency stems from this. Thirdly, young people have had a justifiable sense of disillusion about an adult society which solves international disputes by war and holds the threat of nuclear destruction over humanity. A further modern factor a 'house with a television set' -- and common home activities embracing all members of a family have largely disappeared. Feeling insecure in society, and denied real adult interest, thousands of young people have found what they lacked in gangs -- often pathetic little organizations -- which exist to dominate other gangs in an area or go to war with authority -- the police, and many individual acts of criminality have been due simply to gang-pressure on the boy or girl concerned.\n\nThe glare of publicity, the radio, television book, play (such as 'West Side Story'), magazine, gramophone record; all these have spread the modern teenage philosophy to Britain, the Continent, Africa, Asia, and elsewhere. At best, the problem is a challenge to the conscience of society; at worst, it is a challenge to the police and law-courts, and we must be careful to distinguish between the hard-core young delinquent, who has existed in every age, and the juvenile who is the victim of the gang or of the unfortunate circumstances of his or her background. detention constructive hard labor remain the only answer to the hardcore young criminal; physical punishments may be a deterrent, but they are brutalizing.\n\nSociety in every modern land has the responsibility to care much more for the juvenile. This care begins in the home and involves concern, love and interest by the parents; the school can only supplement, never replace this, and the good social or sports club, though desirable, is not alternative. Secondly, religion and morals must be firmly, yet kindly taught from an early age. Thirdly, bad company, drink, cigarettes and drugs must be discouraged. Fourthly, perhaps the most important factor of all is that the young person must be encouraged to find a real ambition in life, and help to attain it."

        "title": "Co-operation",
        "content": "Co-operation' means, literally, 'working together', and it has always been a feature not only of human life, but also of the animal, and to some extent the insect world. Anyone who examines an anthill will notice that the different kinds of ants have different  functions and work together to serve the queen-ant, just as bees co-operate to serve the queen-bee. Birds unconsciously co-operate with each other, and, can be taught to co-operate with man for many purposes. Wolves and jackals hunt in packs, dogs can be trained to control sheep and to act as guards, and to perform tricks on the stage or at the circus. The co-operation of farm animals like horses is essential to primitive agriculture.\nBut the value of co-operation is most evident in the sphere of human relations, almost every aspect of man's life being dependent upon it. In any team game, all the players depend on one another, and in a game of football, the forwards cannot score goals, unless their wings and halves feed them passes.\n\nThe 'team spirit', is valuable in many human activities, and is perhaps most marked in family life, in which every member should be prepared to receive help from and give it to the others. Unless, parents co-operated with their children, a good upbringing and opportunities of higher education, leading to good jobs would be non-existent. Unless, children co-operated with their parents, many of the latter in their old age would suffer from poverty and neglect. And all members co-operate to preserve the good reputation of their family, by avoiding actions which would bring disgrace upon it.\n\n'Keep off the grass'. 'Do not throw litter'. Such notices, seen in our parks and public places invite the co-operation of the general public in maintaining the beauty of our cities and the countryside. It is a great pity that they are so often ignored.\n\nRather more important is the need for the co-operation of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians in keeping injury and death off the roads. There is a clear highway code which, if observed by everybody, would virtually eliminate traffic accidents, but the mounting toll exacted by the roads in nearly every country is ample testimony to the need for much greater co-operation in this sphere of living.\n\nThis somber need suggests another crucially important example of co-operation -- that which is require between a doctor and his patient. It is quite useless for a sick man to expect a doctor to cure him, unless he obeys instructions with regard to treatment and also actively tries to help himself to get better. Doctors can do nothing for patients who refuse to co-operate, anymore than teachers can for students who are too lazy to learn or who refuse to do so. However good the teacher is it is the student who has to pass the examination. However skilled the surgeon, he will fail, if the theater-sister does not hand him the right instrument at the right moment, or if the nurse has failed to sterilize them beforehand.\n\nCo-operation is not only a feature of agricultural methods but also, applies to agricultural; organization. 'Co-operatives' exist where land is held communally, and all resources of machinery and manual labor are pooled. It is a matter of argument whether this is a fairer means than that of private enterprise, or distributing the rewards of labor, but it often makes for efficiently in countries, where vast tracts of lands are given over the production of cereals.\n\nModern industry would be impossible without a high degree of the most subtle co-operation. The manufacture of a motor-car may depend on a thousand separate processes, each of which is essential and which must be timed, even in automated plants, to ensure the smooth delivery of the finished product at the end of the assembly line.\n\nIn modern warfare, success depends entirely on co-operation between army, navy and air force, and also on the co-operation of allied countries; sometimes on that between civilians and the military, as in the 'underground movement' of war time Europe. And in peace time, all countries request the co-operation of the public with the police forces.\n\nGovernment and people, capital and labor, parents and children; must co-operate in the hour of need. In the worst sense, co-operation becomes conspiracy; in the best, unselfishness."

Reading, is therefore, one of the first things children learn to do in school, and perhaps even before schooldays, at their parents' knee. To begin with, they probably don't enjoy reading very much, because, like everything else worth doing, it demands study and hard work.\nIn most countries, there is one predominating language and according to whether education is free and compulsory or not, the rate of literacy varies -- and very widely indeed, ranging from 99% in Britain and USA to under 1% in over-populated and under-privileged, countries, Malaysia is an unusual example of a country where children are required to be literate in two or three languages; Malay their own language, Chinese or Tamil, and English. Literacy would never have been possible without printing, and the Chinese are proud of the fact that the first printing press was made in their country in the 6th century. Printing was again invented independently in Germany in the mid-15th century by Gutenberg and used for the first time in England by Caxton in about 1477.\n\nPrinting, of course, opened the door to reading. Before the printing press, books were copied laboriously by hand and were therefore scarce, valuable an carefully treasured. The privilege of being taught to read was accorded to very few and these had a tremendous advantage over the illiterate masses. It was a case of 'in the country of the blind the one-eyed man is King.' However haltingly a man could read, his neighbors relied on him for information and indeed guidance, for the ability to read carried a certain prestige. Governments were naturally not always in favor of making their peoples literate -- it meant, for one thing, that they might ask awkward questions. And in the Western world, they banned the dissemination of the Bible in the national languages, because they considered religion should be interpreted by the church and not by the direct appeal of the individual to the scriptures. But eventually, governments were compelled to accede to popular demand, and by the 19th century, most countries in Europe had some sort of system of primary schooling, though in most cases, parents were expected to pay for the privilege of having their children taught to read and write. Charles Dickens has much to say about the horrors of these 'dameschools' in England, and about the gross inefficiency of the teachers. The idea of universal, compulsory schooling belongs to the 20th century. it is accepted by almost all countries and paid for out of taxation. As a result, if children leave school unable to read, it is probably that they are unteachable. What, then in the 20th century, is the importance of being able to read ?.\n\nFirst of all, it is almost impossible to get a job of any kind -- except mere laboring in the fields or road-sweeping in the towns -- if the candidate cannot read. Modern industry, commerce, and the armed forces, demand the ability to read and write, and it need hardly be said that reading is indispensable in the higher grades of employment.\n\nSecondly, reading is indispensable to a full understanding of the world we live in. Newspapers and magazines keep us abreast of world and national events and in touch with current thought. Without it, we should be ignorant and isolated. A story is told of an English 17th century peasant, who was told to get of Marston Moor, because the King's forces were about to do battle with the Parliamentary forces. 'What, aren't they friends, then ?' he asked.\n\nCommunication with our friends by letter is another factor which enriches life, and again this would be impossible without reading. even the use of the telephone required the ability to read letters, while, that of paying the telephone bill involves reading figures !\n\nThe attainment of most skills is greatly helped if we can read. Almost every sport, game and occupation have manuals of instruction written about them. And this is just an example of a hundred other items which go to make up a civilized life and which depend on the ability to read.\n\nBut the most important reason for reading fluently and well is the world of books. Textbooks, novels, biographies, the scriptures of the world religions; all these help us to understand the world of the past, interpret the present, and plant for the future. It is, of course, possible to 'overdo' reading, and become 'bookish', preferring the world of the written word to the realities of living experience, but this is the failure of relatively few. Most people find instruction interest, happiness and a release from loneliness in reading. they enjoy collecting their own personal libraries, and using the public libraries. Book sellers and publishers gain a livelihood from the world's insatiable demand for books, and fine art dealers from those who seek books which are rare or finely produced. Without the ability to read, the life of man would be immeasurably poorer."

        "title": "The beasts of burden",
        "content": "From the earliest days, man has needed power to carry out the tasks of transportation and agriculture. Primitive man used the power of his own muscles, but the human body is inadequate for prolonged and heavy work. So eventually, natural forces were harnessed in a simple way. Water wheels provided power for crude machines and irrigation, and the sails of windmills, an alternative source. Bu the main step forward was the training and 'domestication' of certain animals which could be set to work, the beasts of burden.\nCertain animals proved suitable, and amendable to training -- elephants, camels, horses, donkeys, mules and oxen, and in countries not yet industrialized, they can all be seen at work even today. Of them all, the horse proved the most important. the horse is quick, strong and intelligent. He can carry a rider or a burden, pull a cart or a plough. So widespread was the use of the horse that the 'horse-power' became the unit of power and engines are assessed today according to their 'horse-power'. Perhaps, the elephant is the most dramatic beast of burden. Immensely strong, he can uproot trees and drag the logs to rives where they float down to papermills. He can be used for clearing forests, carrying enormous loads and, of course, for carrying passengers, particularly on ceremonial occasions in India. His disadvantage is that though highly intelligent, he is rather slow and stately and immensely expensive to feed. The African elephant, his cousin, in untamable. Those who know the Middle East are accustomed to the familiar sight of camel and donkey trains, the caravans of the itinerant traders. Like horse, camels have been used as charges in desert battles, and their descendants today for racing. Their plodding brethren, however, have the ability to carry heavy loads through arid countryside for days on end without water. The accretion of fat and liquid on their two humps and the dromedary's one, make them independent of liquid refreshment for long periods. The humble donkey can also show surprising strength, and the cross-bred mule, used so often in ancient military campaigns, has the added advantage of being an able climber and extremely sure-footed. He also has the disadvantage of being very obstinate, bad tempered, and sometimes violent ! Those who live in the Far East value their Friend, the ox. In the countryside of Malaysia, he is to be seen pulling the bullock-cart, and wading through the padi-field, while in India, he treads out the corn and turns the water-wheel. He is kindly, amenable, and very strong.\n\nThose who make use of animals grow to love them, almost as members of the family, and the community thinks very poorly of those who ill-treat or neglect their beasts of burden. They must be well and suitably fed, properly housed, kept warm and dry, never overworked, and given veterinary attention, when they are sick. There is nothing more pathetic than an ill, staved or ill-treated animal. The animal gives its loyalty and strength, but cannot speak or fight back against cruelty.\n\nFor all animal lovers, it is a matter of regret that the beast of burden is slowly disappearing from the scene, and this is largely due to the fact that his work is superseded by the machine, and an economic necessity in these modern days of industrialization. His disappearance is also a loss to the fertility of the land. Artificial manure is a poor substitute for the natural variety.\n\nThe animal as a means of transport has long been displaced by the bicycle, motor-car, bus and railway. People nowadays, ride animals only for pleasure and on ceremonial occasions. Most transport is mechanized nowadays for reasons of speed and power, and as the result of the widespread use of machinery. This has also largely displaced the functions of the beasts of burden on the land. Ploughing is done by tractors, and the combine-harvester can carry out a variety of different agricultural functions at the same time with an enormous saving not only in time and efficiency, but also in man-power. Sot he beasts of burden are today largely relegated the remote, agricultural areas and even there they are becoming more and more scarce.\n\nAll this is inevitable. But the disappearance of the beast of burden will be a sad loss to man, whose faithful friend and servant he has been down the centuries."

        "title": "English as a common language",
        "content": "There are in Asia many different languages as well as many different dialects. This is true also of many parts of Africa where in Ghana alone there are many different languages, each one again, with many dialects. Therefore since it is only by the spoken word that human beings can communicate with one another, the necessity for a common language, whatever that common language may be, is obvious. Anyone finding himself in a foreign country, unable to speak a word of the native language there, will know a complete feeling of isolation and of being 'cut off' from everybody there. No amount of miming or acting can really restore adequate communication and even when skilled interpreters are employers, the process of translation is low and a great deal of the personal touch is lost.\nWhether English should be the common language for the world is arguable, though there are some points in its favor. There is the fact that apart from Chinese, more people in the world speak English than any other language. It is spoken in most of North American continent, in Australia, New Zealand and Britain as well as in many other countries. In fact 290 million people have English as their national language. If it is accepted as the common language of the world, communication between the various countries would be easier.\n\nEnglish, too, is already a language which is known to a great many Asians. This is due to the fact that English speaking people had colonized and had been living there for over a century, and doing so, they brought their language with them. English is now taught in Asian, schools and today, many Asians have far better command of English than their European counterparts have of Asian languages. It is interesting to note that this is true of many African states as well. There, for many of the same reasons, English is known to a large number of African citizens.\n\nThe language of the twentieth century world is the language of science and technology. Often new words must be added to the language to keep up with modern inventions and developments. The list in the last ten years is endless. 'Television,' 'Telestar.' 'Sputnik' 'computer,' 'Penicillin,' 'Jet propelled' are just a few which illustrate new words for new inventions in many different spheres. Malay is a composite language. In other words, it is composed of may different parts. It is, therefore, capable of assimilating new words to cover modern needs. On the other hand, only over a hundred and eighty million people speak Malay, the common language of Malaysia and Indonesia, communication outside the region will be very limited, if indeed possible at all.\n\nNearly a billion people speak Chinese and so there would, at first sight, appear to be arguments in favor of Chinese as a common language. But there are many arguments against it ! The Chinese language is not, in the first place, based on Latin as most of the other languages like English are. It is composed of a series of 'characters' and symbols. It is, therefore very difficult indeed for 'ordinary' foreigners to learn it. The language does already include characters and symbols which cover scientific and technological words and phrases, but their use to the world in general is limited since such symbols and characters are virtually unfamiliar to the world outside China. Therefore although Chinese is spoken by so many millions of people, it is not as suitable as a common language as English.\n\nSingapore is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Her Prime Minister, together with his colleagues and fellow Prime Ministers from other Commonwealth countries meet to deliberate, to discuss and to shape policies on world affairs and they use English as the common language. It is necessary at all levels to be able to communicate thoughts, words and ideas. Singapore using English as one of her language would therefore, be able to contribute much that is wise and good to the welfare of mankind, even when Malay is her National Language."

        "title": "Spies",
        "content": "A spy is a person employed to gather information in a clandestine manner as a weapon in a country's armory against an actual or potential enemy. This information is usually of a military nature, though spying may be industrial. Operating on behalf of an enemy, such a person is described as a spy; on behalf of one's own country, an 'agent'.\nMost countries have a secret service. This service operates both at home and abroad. To take the USA and Britain as examples; in the USA, the FBI deals with espionage, treason, and other matters relating to security. The CIA does basically the same job overseas, but some of its roles have recently attracted domestic criticism. The CIA has been held responsible for actively supporting movements in neighboring countries favorable to the USA. In Britain, there has been a move to link the activities of MI5 and MI6 with the CID (Criminal Investigation Department) -- perhaps a good thing. Governments of all persuasions tend to resist too much accountability. In the USA, the CIA is an enormous, costly, complicated and largely independent organization. In Britain, MI5 (home affairs) and MI6 (overseas affairs) have no official existence. The amount of money spent on them is never disclosed, but it is believed to be considerable. The head of these services in Britain is now a woman. She is responsible to the prime minister through the Home Office, but in some cases, directly.\n\nIn the UK, MI6 agents are usually attaches at overseas embassies and consulates, and are often described euphemistically as 'trade secretaries'. Their task is to gather military intelligence and nowadays nuclear intelligence, and then to feed it home in a variety of ways. It is also to keep a check on their opposite numbers. MI5 agent act at home as counterintelligence operatives.\n\nWho are these people ? Usually young men, and a few women, who have been recruited while at university. Intelligent, they achieve good degrees, and are offered entry into the Civil Service in the administrative section; sometimes into the Diplomatic Service. Offers are made tot hem when in these posts. The lower grade of agent is often recruited from the tougher service units.\n\nWhat is their motivation ? Traditionally and historically, it has been patriotism. However, during the years of East-West confrontation, theoretical political considerations predominated. Approaches were made to them by both sides, in some cases. The convinced, but secret young communist might ostensibly agree to work for Britain, but actually work for the USSR, often as a 'sleeper', and the reverse was often the case. Such people came to be known as 'doubles', were paid by both sides, and equally despised by both.\n\nTheir methods were, and are, hardly admirable, but with some people, conviction easily overrides morality. Sensitive information is acquired by payment. This invariably leads to blackmail. Information is passed on, but it may be 'disinformation' if the spy is actually out of sympathy with the recipient, or if the rewards offered by one side prove to be irresistible.\n\nThe diplomatic bag, the phone-tap, the short-wave radio, the microdot, the miniature camera, the gun, the wad of notes, and the threat are all tools of the trade\n\nSome would argue that their existence is essential, and what was achieved by spies in the world wars proves that point. They have operated since time immemorial, and are likely to continue.\n\nAmong other functions, they have provided material for many fiction writers and film-makers, who, since the collapse of the USSR, have had to look elsewhere !"

        "title": "How do you measure success in life ?",
        "content": "Reaching the top of the tree' in one's chosen occupation or profession is the usual standard by which success in life is measured, at least in the Western world. However many Asiatics would reject this criterion. The contemplative religions assert that 'success' is only measurable in terms of religious advancement and of the acquisition of the virtues. Thus 'success' would be in inverse ratio to material advancement.\nMost of the world accepts the definition of material advancement, its objectives being affluence and perhaps power over others, both being the most important means of self-expression.\n\nSome are born into positions which already confer affluence and power, so 'success' to them might lie merely in the preservation of the family business or estate and perhaps its enhancement for the benefit of the next generation. Most people have to work hard to achieve success.\n\nThe western concept of success is not always satisfying and some people at the height of their affluence and power, reject it in favor of the 'simple life'. This happens for a variety of reasons.\n\nBeyond a certain point the acquisition of money proves unsatisfactory. The difference between the lifestyle available to a millionaire and that available to a billionaire is marginal. Unhappily money making can become an obsession, and some very wealthy people become very means. Money also creates anxiety since it usually has to be put at risk if more is to be made. Other anxieties may be created when a large number of people become dependent on a financial empire. Money confers power which may corrupt. It is often made at the disadvantage of others, and it may damage a business man's relationships both with his peers and with his subordinates. These pressures and anxieties often have a detrimental effect on health and on family life. One's wife and children are inevitably neglected and unhappy. The children of successful capitalists or career 'workoholics' sometimes reject everything the father or parents stand for. 'Success' thus means failure.\n\nIt is of course possible, though unlikely, that worldly success can be combined with a sensitive and therefore successful approach to the problems outlined above. If a man or woman can achieve this then he or she truly has the right to be called 'successful'.\n\nHowever success is not strictly related to the externals of power, prominence and affluence, though these are often its attributes. It is more to do with happiness and fulfilment. What then are its features ?\n\nFirst, mental and spiritual peace. A satisfying yet balanced way of life makes for the former and a religion or at least a philosophy for the latter. The body should not be neglected; physical well-being is usually the result of good food and exercise; absence of strain is at least as important.  A successful life depends crucially on good personal relationships both within and outside the family, to ensure the well-being and happiness of others forms a large part o success. Perhaps the fundamental way to achieve success is first to be sure of what you want to do with life and then to be sure that you are capable of doing it. Some people are strongly motivated to a profession or to politics or to social campaigning from early days; others have to find their own role in life by trial and error. Many of these careers will not confer much 'success' in the worldly sense but they will lead to the success of happiness and fulfilment."

        "content": "It is only a tiny minority who are born without a talent in one direction or another. even these people are usually employable. It seems logical, in general, that one aim of education should be to develop latent ability, whatever that ability may be.\nHowever, the pressure from educational theorists today is to concentrate teaching on preparation for employment. Parents, also, feel that the priority for their children is to become equipped to earn a good living. Governments urge concentration on certain subjects, so that a pool of labor can be formed which can move easily into specialized training. These essential subjects include English, or another international language, since these languages possess technical vocabularies and also equip young people to travel overseas in the course of their work. The other favored subjects are mathematics, the sciences, the use of computers and other office machinery, engineering, and general handwork. Given proficiency in some or all of these, it is  short step to useful employment. Modern job opportunities lie in the fields of the service industries, i.e., banking, insurance and stockbroking, technology and the manufacture of sophisticated products, research and development and computers. Governments see these occupations as essential to national wealth creation, and therefore crucial to the general improvement of the national standard of living.\n\nThere will always be young people more interested in the arts than in the sciences. The arts are usually bracketed under the general heading 'liberal studies'; they include history, languages and literature, philosophy, politics and economics, social and environmental studies. Some require exact knowledge and serious study, while others are 'soft options'. In any real sense they are totally unproductive, and modern education has spawned a sense they are totally unproductive, and modern education has spawned a brood of these non-subjects. it is small wonder that both governments and parents discourage some of them nowadays. We live in a real world. yet the obverse of this coin is the necessary enrichment of the culture of all countries in successive generations. What is material success if there is nothing to engage the artistic side of our nature in our spare time ?\n\nPerhaps the greatest concept of education originates in the European cultural renaissance in Italy, and dates back tot he late Middle Ages. It is the development of the whole person. Perhaps the modern version of 'mens sana in corpore sano', a 'healthy body in a healthy mind', still has its place. So even attention to sports training is justifiable.\n\nSo music, art and drama must all have their place in the curriculum, even if this is not a prime place. every country has its own artistic heritage, and it would be tragic if that heritage were lost through neglect. Yet this is not merely a matter of conservation. Artistic pursuits have now become international and offer brilliant careers to gifted young people of every country. It is clear that those with this kind of talent should be encouraged."

        "title": "How can we as individuals become more healthy ?",
        "content": "The three basics are food, sleep and exercise, though the balance depends on age. As we get older we tend to need less of all three. Metabolism slows with age, so we feel less hungry; with age we become less active and therefore need less sleep However, all three basics are required at any age if we are to remain relatively young and healthy throughout our allotted span.\nFor the purpose of this essay, let us assume that you are a young man or woman of about eighteen years. You have an interest in sport as well as in academic work, preparatory to employment. You look forward to a long, active trouble-free, healthy life. no doubt you have been inoculated against the common killers such as typhoid, tetanus, diphteria etc. Let us also assume that you have been born with healthy genes and have both a normal resistance to disease and a good recovery rate. You were not born with any physical defects or handicaps which require special medical treatment. You have an average to good health record. You wish to keep your health, even improve it.\n\nTake food. The temptation is to overeat. Stop when you stop feeling hungry. When this is socially difficult go without the next meal. What to eat ? Try to avoid 'convenience' foods; keep the intake of carbohydrates, fats and sugar low. Protein builds the body without thickening the waistline. All this of course assumes that a balanced and varied diet is available. Nobody could lecture the Ethiopian or the refugee or the very poor on this subject. When to eat ? Three meals a day should be enough for a young man; one too many for an old man. Eating sweets, chocolates, ice creams, cakes etc between meals can undo all your good intentions. fresh vegetables, not over-cooked, are excellent. If you can obtain fresh food in variety, good. Eat according tot eh rules, and forget food ! And don't forget, ladies, that you also need food. too much slimming can destroy appetite and lead to the downward spiral of starvation; anorexia.\n\nSleep is even more crucial than food. Eight hours per night for the young person, six to seven for the elderly. A medium to hard bed and circulating fresh air make for the deepest sleep. Most experts advise going to bed reasonably early, say not much after 11 p.m. The late-night film or disco should be the exception.\n\nA reasonable amount of exercise is essential to everybody. Most young people play sport, often team games, football, basketball etc and this, plus walking, running and cycling keeps the body in tune and sets up the kind of strength and stamina which pays dividends in later life in health. It is a mistake to give up activity when we exchange studentship for employment. All too quickly the body runs to fat. Some sedentary workers are out of breath after climbing one flight of stairs. Strenuous exercise in youth, phased down to walking, golf and swimming in later years, goes a long way to prevent heart and respiratory problems.\n\nAny normally healthy person, sticking to the above regime, will get healthier and stay that way. Yet there are three final points.\n\nThe first is to try to learn to kill needless anxiety, and to adopt a positive approach to life. Nobody can predict the future, so 'day by day' living, albeit with an overall plan, is required. Worry and depression, i.e. psychological weakness, can be very detrimental to health.\n\nThe second is to practice normal hygiene. Cleanliness, especially in food preparation, is essential. Yet nobody can create a totally sterile environment. Most of us have more built-in resistance to disease, however, than we imagine.\n\nThirdly, smoking and alcohol. If you have never started, don't. However, and despite the pressure lobbies, moderation in both has never been finally proved harmful. Field Marshal Montgomery once boasted to Sir Winston Churchhill, 'I neither smoke nor drink, and I am 100% fit'. Churchill replied, 'I do both, and I am 200% fit.'\n\nChurchill outlived Monty by many years."

        "title": "Is air travel as safe as it should be ?",
        "content": "Statistically, air travel is reasonably safe when compared with road, rail and sea. Many countries have a high death and injury rate on the roads; train, ferry and ocean-going ship disasters are regular enough to be commonplace, taking a global view. yet air disasters are usually fatal to all or most concerned and are therefore more widely reported. Consequently there is international pressure to make air travel as safe as possible, and rightly so. Yet no form of travel can be made totally safe. The causes of disaster, whether natural or man-made, can never be completely eliminated.\nLooking first at natural causes, at least three can be identified. Bad weather is one. This includes storm, icing and air-pockets in the case of light aircraft; less so in the case of large jets with sophisticated instrumentation. One cause in the case of jets can be large flocks of birds or swarms of insects being sucked into the jet nacelles and thereby stopping the engines. This may happen at low altitudes. Little can be done to prevent this. A third is the alleged danger in what is known as the \"Bermuda triangle\" in which both ships and aircraft have been lost without trace. In the case of aircraft the reason is though to be loss of horizon due to electrical disturbance.\n\nMost dangers to aircraft however are man-made. The first and obvious danger is collision. In the busiest airports, especially in the tourist season, aircraft may take off as often as every twenty seconds. Much strain is imposed on aircraft dispatchers and traffic control generally. Clearance for dispatch is by radar and computer. Personal fatigue or mechanical failure in a radar center can be very dangerous. Aircraft often have to circle before being given landing permission, and collision or perhaps a near miss can result from mistakes in assigning heights. Most, though not all countries have strict regulations governing air traffic control. Any strike by operatives will cause grounding -- bad enough, but preferable to taking risks.\n\nAnother cause of trouble may be the age of the aircraft. Metal fatigue eventually sets in; cracks appear, bits of the aircraft may fall off, even whole engines, or the passenger cabin may lose compression. This means almost certain death to all passengers and crew, and there have been cases where an aircraft has been lost because one of the doors was not properly secured. The important of safety checks before take-off is obvious. So also is the importance of regular and completely efficient servicing. Operatives' licenses can be withdrawn if government inspectors find inefficiency in this area. Most modern aircraft can shut down engines which catch fire, deal automatically with the fire, and proceed on three, or even two engines.\n\nCabin fires are equally dangerous. They may occur for any reason, but in many cases they result from a crash landing causing the fuel to ignite. two things are important here. First, cabin exit must be unimpeded. Some modern aircraft have built-in chutes for swift escape. Much of course depends on cabin staff and their ability to prevent panic. Second, the seat upholstery must be non-flam. Many people have died from the noxious smoke emanating from flammable upholstery.\n\nThere is argument today about emergency drills. Normally a steward will explain life-jackets for use should there be a sea landing, and just mention oxygen masks which are lowered to each seat. Should all these by physically tried out by all passengers prior to take-off ? Such drills are boring and time consuming, but the time may come when they are mandatory.\n\nSome disasters are caused by pilot error. Recently a Shackleton in fog crashed into a hillside in Britain, killing twenty-five young men. the plane has a good safety record. Again recently the pilot of a plane with a faulty engine shut down the good engine due to the failure of his instrumentation. the plane crashed, killing most occupants, and virtually destroying a small village. Sometimes instrumentation can be affected by electronic interference due to unauthorized equipment carried in the hold or hand luggage. This hazard can be eliminated.\n\nNot much can be done about terrorism except through airfield security and electronic vetting of all passengers and luggage. Unhappily not all airports are really efficient in this regard. Efficiency would arrest the terrorist and the hijacker on the airport.\n\nFinally, attempts by carriers to economize on pilot coverage and seating space must be prevented by law. The two essentials are fresh and fully-trained pilots, and reasonable space for movement in emergency.\n\nThe answer to the question is no. Much could still be done to avert future disasters."

        "content": "The title of this essay suggests a series of contrasts, perhaps between rocket-firing Hunter and the weekend pilot's Chipmunk, or the Bomber photographing enemy installations from 30,000 feet and the Comet or Boeing long-distance jet airliner. yet the two are inextricably merged; the development of one has always depended on that of the other. Out of the hostile uses of the jet-engine, invented by the Englishman Sir Frank Whittle during the last war, has com the peaceful use of the jet transport and passenger plane. Out of the latest pre-1939 monoplanes came the early wartime fighter, the Hurricane.\nMan has always longed to fly like the birds and in the 20th Century his dream has come true. It is said that Michaelangelo invented a quite practicable heavier-than-air flying machine which, had he had aluminium to play with instead of iron, would have worked. Ballooning was quite common-place well before 1900, particularly in France; so were 'gliders' of a sort, which sometimes amounted to 'wings' of bamboo and cloth which served to carry a man a few yards off the ground in a high wind. But true aviation, that is powered 'heavier-than-air' flying, only came about with the development of the petrol engine which, by about 1896, had brought about the prototype motorcar. Primitive aircraft had come into being on both sides of the Atlantic by 1900; Orville and Wilbur Wright built a powered plane a Kitty Hawk which flew for 3 1/2 seconds and traveled 105 feet. Later Bleriot, a Frenchman made history by flying 22 miles across the English Channel in a biplane. Between 1900 and 1914 several countries had made serviceable aircraft, mostly biplanes, gradually overcoming design problems, increasing wing-lift and power, reducing weight and thereby increasing fuel capacity, ironing out facets of maneuverability, and adding both height and speed potential. But pre-1941 aircraft were scarcely more than toys; nobody trusted them for travel purposes, range was severely limited, and as freighters they were not worth considering.\n\nIt was the outbreak of first World War which gave a tremendous impetus of flying, and the potential of aircraft as weapons were swiftly realized. Money was spent by both sides on design-research and eventually primitive war planes were mass-produced by both sides. At first, the Handley-Pages and the Camels were visualized only as aerial observation-posts on the Western Front, but this swiftly led to overhead engagements, the pilots shooting it out with revolvers. Later, machine-guns, with a limited are of fire, were fitted, but a great advance came with the Synchronized Machine-gun, capable of firing through a propeller. These aircraft certainly had a nuisance value, as had the dirigibles with their bombs, such as the German Zeppelins, and the early bombers used in open country against concentrated forces, as in T.E. Lawrence's desert campaign, but nobody could portend they were crucial. it is an irony, however, that their development laid the foundation for the 'growing-up' of Civil Aviation between the wars.\n\nIn most countries their period was a sad story of governmental indifference and brave efforts by individuals to put flying 'on the map'. The whole world applauded Charles Lindbergh who flew the Atlantic in 1926, and Amy Johnson, who flew alone in a series of short 'hops' to Australia. But flying really grew up in the '30s when metal monoplanes of long range and high reliability standards were produced. The early passenger and freight lines were produced. The early passenger and freight lines were established; seaplanes were invented -- even ski-planes for polar exploration. But Hitler had realized the war-potential of the aircraft, and his early panzer-attacks in Europe and Egypt move on with ruthless efficiency, supported by the high-level saturation bomber and the Stuka dive-bomber. Britain and America had to catch up fast. Hurricanes and Spitfires saved Britain from invasion, and the American Boeings and British Whitleys and Wellingtons virtually destroyed the Ruhr towns in preparation for the Second Front. Airpower was crucial in the allied victory in the East as well as the West. Hiroshima and Nagasaki reversed Pearl Harbor and Singapore.\n\nThe nuclear bomb had made the aircraft a terrifying weapon in modern times, and humanity prays that it may be outlawed. But out of war came advance, and the jet aircraft, scarcely in use until 1945, had established international passenger and freight airlines; all countries today recognize the importance of flying as a potential money-earner and a means of cementing international relationship by today's incredibly quick and easy exchange of visitors."

        "content": "Much to his housekeeper's disgust, the great fictional detective Sherlock Holmes carried out scientific experiments in his Baker street rooms in the cause of solving crimes. Since his day, science had played an increasingly important part in both the detection and the proof of crime. Technology, the derivative of science, is used by most countries' police forces today and is responsible for bringing many criminals to justice. Dr Crippen escaped by liner to the Unites States, but an early ship to shore radio telephone enabled the police to arrest him when the line docked.\nFootprint casts and fingerprints are traditional methods of detection. Fingerprinting was invented in Great Britain by Francis Galton and has been of fundamental importance in detection for decades. Some countries fingerprint their whole populations, though others, Britain included, regard this as an infringement of personal freedom, and restrict fingerprinting to those accused of a criminal offence, or to those who are screened for certain security categories. science has greatly enhanced the efficiency of this system. Fingerprints are now held on computer, and much time and cost is saved by the fact that information can be exchanged instantaneously throughout the country. Co-operation with the National Crime Information center in the US and with Interpol in the continent of Europe greatly enhances this facility.\n\nRecords of convicted criminals are now held on microfilm in conjunction with fingerprints, photographs and personal profiles and stores as computer data. These, again, are capable of instant retrieval countrywide and can also be made available overseas. In the UK this data cannot be disclosed to a jury during a criminal trial, but should the verdict be guilty a previous criminal record becomes available in the matter of sentencing.\n\nThe polygraph, or lie detector, is not university sanctioned. Its supporters claim that its ability to record nervous tensions is infallible. Others disagree.\n\nVery recently, DNA printing has revolutionized the process of bringing the criminal to justice, and in civil actions establishing paternity. The minutes quantities of blood, skin, hair or nail-parings can positively identify or eliminate the individual concerned. No two individuals have identical sets of genes. This scientific advance is particularly important in the examination of cars and rooms where crimes have been committed.\n\nInterrogation has always been an important part of criminal investigation. in uncivilized counties, drugs, psychological pressure and often physical torture have been, and still are used. these methods are banned in civilized countries. However, even in the latter, the police occasionally enforce signatures to false statements or to statements which are subsequently mutilated. Taped interviews today now go some way to overcome this abuse, though even tapes can be falsified.\n\nA good deal of crime detection and prevention has been privatized in recent years. some countries allow firearms to security guards, others, such as the UK, do not. Various pieces of technology are in common use. Closed-circuit TV cameras allow centralized observation of customers in large stores. Flood-lighting around buildings can be triggered electronically when anybody approaches in the dark. Foot patrols are issued with light intensifiers, a military development, enabling them to see without being seen. 'Electric eye' burglar alarms have been in use both in public buildings and in private homes for many years.\n\nObservation by police 'on the beat' who know their own areas intimately has always been a recognized and valuable means of crime detection and prevention, bolstering the citizen's sense of security. Unfortunately, this is being replaced by police car patrols. And although the latter are in radio communication with officers on foot and with police headquarters, the general public see this development as retrograde.\n\nDespite all the above, crime is on the increase in many countries. Its detection is no doubt becoming more efficient, due to scientific advance. this is related to an entirely different factor; the decline in religious faith and observance, which instills moral standards into children."

        "content": "\"Life is short, experience treacherous, judgment difficult,\" said Hypocrates, the Father of Medicine. two thousand years ago, no less than now, judgment was difficult, life short; the barber was the surgeon and major operations were equivalent to death warrants ! The physician, when he did not refer to the ancients, was still looking to chance experience for his knowledge; while 'Asiatic cholera' stalked the land.\nthen it was that experience which began to be supplemented by experiment. Vesalius introduces dissection; Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood; Jenner banished the terrors of small-pox; Pasteur, experimental-chemist, turning to the study of micro-organisms, laid the foundation of Modern Medicine. Listen, applying the new knowledge to his work with the scalpel, founded modern aseptic surgery -- all in three hundred years and simply because men began to observe closely and with open minds, while they caused things to happen, instead of observing casually, with closed minds and when things chanced to happen.\n\nWhat of the method by which men are thus creating or helping Nature to create a better physical environment for us all ? If the desire is for something intrinsically new, whether an alloy steel, a synthetic dyestuff, a radio tube, or a spineless cactus, it must be obtained, if at all, in Nature's prescribed way. it must be created, and nobody who is in a hurry to get something, has ever been very successful in learning what way Nature prescribes. On the other hand, certain intellectually honest, enthusiastically persevering individuals, endowed with insatiable curiosity, keen power of observation, ingenuity, originality, patience, commonsense and the urge to take infinite pains, have been notably successful in inducing Nature to reveal her secret ways of working. Besides, to such, it is the best of all sports.\n\nSo, when 'Curiosity' began to learn from Nature, he began to observe her closely and to record faithfully what he observed. as an experimenter, he is like any good general, man must have a well-thought-out plan of attack, but must also be an opportunist and change his plan to meet unexpected situations as they arise. He must be open-minded, must seek facts regardless of whether they may lead him.\n\nIf he is not open-minded, is not intellectually honest, he will be inclined to explain away an unexpected result; he may even refrain from recording it. In such a case, he is not playing the game, but he overlooks the fact that some of the greatest discoveries have come out of irregular results which were not rejected, but were further investigated. it was only a slight irregularity found in the orbit of Uranus that led Adams and Le Verrier, independently to discover Neptune. There was less tan one per cent of a residue of inert gas that persistently remained when Cavendish tried by electric sparking, to combine atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen. But he recorded and reported the fact and a hundred years later. Rayleigh, repeating the experiment found the residue to be a new gaseous element - Argon - which is used in gas-filled electric lamps. This was to all. Ramsay was thus led to discover in our atmosphere, a whole series of inert elementary gases, among them Neon, employed in the orange-red lights seen in the business streets. it was from the detection of otherwise unexplained lines in the solar spectrum that Helium was discovered, though no one felt sure at the time, that it was peculiar to the sun. Later, Rayleigh discovered traces of it in the air. All these came about because painstaking experimenters observed closely and recorded faithfully what they saw. As Joseph Henry, contemporary of Faraday, put it, \"The seeds of great discoveries are constantly floating around us, but they only take root in minds well prepared to receive them\"\n\nExperiment conducted for the discovery of new facts and their relation to other facts is Scientific Research. Behind it all is the well-founded conviction that there is order in all natural phenomena. For every determined rise above failure, while experimenting, there is in waiting the more than compensating joy of having created something. None is better qualified to bear testimony to this than Pasteur. Listen to his appraisal of the lot of the researcher : \"It is indeed a hard task when you believe you have found an important scientific fact and are feverishly anxious to publish it, to constrain yourself for days, weeks, years, sometimes to fight with yourself, to try to ruin your own experiments and only to proclaim your discovery after having exhausted all contrary hypotheses. But when after so many efforts, you have at last arrived at a certainty, your joy is one of the greatest which can be felt by a human soul, an the thought that you will have contributed to the honor of your country, renders that joy still deeper.\"\n\nIn has been truly said that the great events of history are its great scientific discoveries. \"In our century, science is the soul of the prosperity of nations and the living source of all progress. Undoubtedly, the tiring daily discussions of politics seem to be our guide. Employ appearances ! -- What really lead us forward a a few scientific discoveries and their applications\" - says Pasteur !"

        "title": "Food preservation",
        "content": "Men have preserved their foods from ancient times in order to keep the results of harvesting for winter months, for resale, for storage, and for transporting from sea to inland, overseas, or cross-country. To do so, they generally used nature's methods, which are drying, parching and fermenting. Parching is the most natural method, but for many thousands of years, others have also been used. Direct fermentation of liquids, usually by the introduction of yeast, has not only preserved liquids but also enhanced their quality, the same of course applying to salting. Smoking has preserved, and sometimes improved both fish and meat. Hickory wood is generally used for the fires, and natural juices are contained by a slight coating of wood creosote.\nIt was not until recently that the causes of rottenness were understood, these being the reactions of bacteria, moulds, yeasts and micro-organisms. Some fermentation and moulds are, of course, necessary in the production of food and drink; moulds, for example, being used in cheese-making. But the real 'breakthrough' in preservation against the causes of rottenness came, when it was learnt how to deal with the micro-organisms present in all foods and drinks, and which react chemically over a period to produce unpalatable or poisonous food or drink. There are three basic methods.\n\nFirstly, food may be preserved by cooling or freezing, to a very low temperature when long-term preservation is required. This was originally done by packing in a mixture of salt and ice; today, cold storage is big business and refrigeration is a highly-developed science. 'Dehydration' may be bracketed with this method, as the principle involved is the same, namely to suspend the operation of bacteria which requires normal temperatures for chemical reaction. This is why reconstituted eggs cannot against dehydrated, and melted ice-cream refrozen. the second method of destruction is by heat-processes, which destroy all the bacteria present in food and drink. This process is used before canning foods in hermetically-sealed containers, great care being taken not to allow the foods or drink s to become re-infested after cooling and before canning. the third method is to preserve by the addition of chemicals, which control or destroy bacteria. this is merely a follow-up of the old systems of salting, smoking and candling.\n\nEventually, the method of 'cold sterilization' is expected to supersede most of the others; this amounts to exposing the food-stuffs to ionizing radiation.\n\nToday more than mere food-preservation is sought by the consumer, and for this reason, processes are becoming more and more sophisticated. Quality, economy and convenience are sought by modern man -- especially modern woman -- convenience is important, the 'ready-cooked' meal is popular, while, in Western, or 'Westernized' communities, goods do not sell easily if they lack color, a good appearance, natural flavor, the right texture, and are free from defects."

        "title": "The uses of rubber",
        "content": "In 1887, rubber seeds which grow naturally in Brazil and South America were shipped to England by a man called Wickham. Two months later, tiny rubber plants grown from these seeds in London's famous Kew Gardens, were dispatched to Sri Lanka and Singapore. There, the plants flourished and so not only was wealth and prosperity brought to Malaysia, for the production of rubber is now Malaysia's greatest industry; but also the world's rubber manufacturers are able to cope with the phenomenal demands for rubber in practically every department of life. Synthetic and man-made rubber, which is now being produced on a a very large scale is helping to cope with these demands and may possibly in the future usurp the position of the world's natural rubber.\nToday, rubber is indeed man's versatile servant. It serves you in your home. It is found on your radio and television, on telephones, electric irons, toasters, coffee percolators and sewing machines. It is found in the kitchen for the vacuum cleaner and refrigerator. Where is the house without its electric fan containing rubber or the desk that does not show an eraser, elastic band or vulcanized fountain pen ? There are mattresses made of foam rubber and in colder climates, where is the house without its rubber hot water bottle ? In the garden, rubber has a variety of uses from hose-pipes to footwear. Rice and biscuits -- these on the  surface, would seem to have nothing to do with rubber. But, it is because of rubber that the high polish on grains of rice can be obtained. the machine to polish rice consists of an emery cone and rubber blocks. the rice revolves between these two and it is the combination between rubber and emery board that achieves the polished surface. we often eat biscuits with the 'brand' or maker's name printed on the surface. 'Glaxo' or 'Peakfrean' are examples of this. A printed metal stamp would be impracticable on the sticky surface of the dough of which biscuits are made. It would stick ! Therefore, to stamp the biscuits, a thin sheet of rubber is inserted between the stamp and the dough. thus, the biscuit is stamped through the rubber rather like a carbon copy of a letter. Rubber is used to make our raincoats or mackintoshed as they are called after a Manchester firm 'Machintosh' who, in 1846, bought a patent for vulcanizing rubber, invented by a man called 'Parkes' in Birmingham. Since Christopher Columbus first saw natives of Haiti playing games with balls made from the gum of rubber tree, thousands of different balls from the rubber, beach ball to the golf ball, have been made out. Further a field from home, rubber is used for furniture and gymnastic equipment. In the cinema, it is used for projectors and cinematograph equipment of all kinds. Even down on the farm, it appears in tractor tyres, milking machines and combine harvesters.\n\nRubber is used when you travel. Pavements and roads are sometimes made of it, as are the steps of buses and trams. There would be little comfort in motor vehicles without the pneumatic tyre first patented by J.B. Dunlop in Belfast, Ireland in 1888.\n\nNowadays, with the increasing number of cars, pneumatic tyres take 90% of the world's rubber. Rubber bearing springs and rubber sealing systems in rake mechanisms of airplanes, ships and cars add considerably to our comfort.\n\nRubber is there when illness lands us in hospital. Because it absorbs shock, it is used for sound proof flooring, tyres on wheel chairs and rubber rollers on beds and trolleys. Rubber is water-proof"

        "title": "The evils of war",
        "content": "Responsible citizens of all countries today, have learnt to hate and mistrust warfare as a means of resolving international disputes through the bitter experience of two world conflagrations in this century. Between the wars, the major powers established the 'League of Nations'. Its dual role was to attempt to substitute negotiation for warfare and to press for multi and unilateral disarmament, but certain ambitious powers treated it with cynical contempt, and it was powerless in the face of German, Italian and Japanese empire building. Since 1945, a somewhat more realistic organization, the U.N.O., has come into being, and by means of its international 'police' forces has successfully quenched many 'bushfires' which would otherwise have become conflagrations. yet, it is doubtful whether even U.N.O., could halt a major power, and it is a sinister fact that certain of them ether ignore its decisions or absent themselves from its councils Most sane individuals condemn warfare absolutely, but not all governments. History has taught us that there will always be warfare, because a government may display the lowest common denominator of human characteristics, and act upon it. Accepting war was a periodic fact, therefore, peace-loving nations usually feel compelled to arm themselves with the most powerful and effective weapons of defense, including nuclear weapons, and refuse to part with them, unless their competitors do the same we thus reach the position of an armed truce, based on parity of weapons, and the paradoxical situation of having to avoid the evils of war, by manufacturing the very weapons and training the very armies which alone can bring them about. The alternative is pacifism. The disarmers, the 'Ban the Bomb' movement in Britain would have the Commonwealth abolish arms and armies, believing that non-resistance to aggression, even the acceptance of invasion, is the only sure way to peace. But is it ? it was certainly not so in Britain in 1939, when the declaration of war called a halt to German expansion, and when, without an all-out arms effort, Britain would have been overrun and her people enslaved, even exterminated. In 1939, the true evil of war, deprivation of freedom, was avoided by the very act of going to war. It cannot be over-emphasized that, while every sane person must condemn warfare 'in vaccuo', the same person, realistically viewing the world in which we live, must distinguish between the greater evil of losing his freedom and the lesser, of both suffering and inflicting the evils of warfare. In certain clearly defined circumstances, it is right to inflict the evils of war.\nBut nobody doubts the miseries which are inevitably caused. Psychologically, the effects are disastrous. A people at war ceases to think of the enemy as 'people' like themselves. Propaganda, the one-sided or even lying, reporting inflammatory incidents, creates hatred of the enemy. The 'other side' become targets at the end of a gun, vermin to be exterminated by the napalm fire-thrower, or the nuclear bomb. This, and the actual horrors of experiencing warfare, cause frequent mental breakdowns, feelings of self-reproach, psychological scarring which are often indelible. Fear, both experienced and imposed, has its shattering effects. Brutality is at a premium, in the prisoner-of-war and concentration camps. Racial hatred is stirred up; it is believed that the whole Jewish population of Europe would have been wiped out, had the war gone on for another year. Greed, of course, becomes paramount. War always means food and luxury rationing. 'Black Market' operations begin, and the unscrupulous grow far at the expense of the poor. Personal freedom is inevitably lost. All fit men are expected to join the forces or be branded as cowards; all civilians exist in a welter of government controls which completely regulate their lives. Overwork, fatigue and irritability are only minor by products. Much more important is the fact that everything is geared to the war-effort, and cultural and humane discoveries and developments come to an abrupt halt.\n\nPhysically and materially, the evils of war are catastrophic. Enemy control of the seas and skies may reduce countries which rely on imports to famine. It is the poor and the children who suffer most. Cities and countryside are laid waste. Hospitals are filled with those who are injured, or blinded, or crippled, or poisoned by gas or radioactivity. wealth ad resources are wasted, fine men and women squandered, buildings, art-treasures, historic places obliterated.\n\nCountries may be forced to resort to the evils of war, but humanity will always condemn warfare because it is humanity which suffers."

        "title": "Travel as a part of education",
        "content": "Education' in the broad sense is the drawing out of the individual's personality and intellectual ability, and travel has always been considered an important part of this process. Yet, the functions assigned to travel as part of education have varied curiously. Before modern times, the greatest travelers were the Dutch, the onwards, the motives behind travel were exploration, military conquest leading to ownership of foreign territories, trade and commerce, and diplomacy. Clive of India, Sir Stamford Raffles of Singapore, are among the great names associated with the old-fashioned object of travel -- colonization and, in the opinion of some people, 'exploitation'. So far from learning about their travels, which, in a sense, they were bound to do, whether they liked it or not, early travelers considered themselves teachers -- of an outlook, a religion, and a way of life, which they assumed was superior to what they found, just because in certain respects, it was more materially advanced. The early travelers were explorers, 'empire-builders' and adventurers, despite the incidental benefits they were able to confer on undeveloped countries. Countries which bred travelers believed quite firmly that foreigners were 'lesser breeds without the law', and that the only justification for travel was national or personal gain. The object was to make money abroad, then come home and live 'as gentleman'. Typical of this spirit was the 'remittance man' -- the 'black sheep' of the family who was paid to live overseas. \"Deportation\" -- was the sentence imposed in 19th century Britain as an alternative to execution for certain serious crimes. Botany bay in Australia was peopled by such criminals. An important factor in the early days was time; travel, by sailing-ship or 'safari' meant months to an from a destination. Going overseas meant being away a long time - perhaps for good. European travel was the exception, and here, we look at a new consideration, that of 'culture'; Italy and Greece are living reflections of ancient classical lore. The 'educated' young man, rich and sophisticated, was not considered completely 'finished', until his classical education had culminated in a 'Grand Tour' of Europe. During this period, he used the languages learned in the schoolroom, and saw for himself the places which had figured so prominently in his earlier studies. with this new background, he became fit for the Army and Navy, or the Colonial and Diplomatic Services. But, he always 'looked down' on the foreigner -- even the European -- as a second-rate person.\nThe theory of travel in the modern age is totally different, and this is because the attitude of the older countries to foreigners had undergone ad radical change in the last 50 years. As nations draw closer to one another, and we all progress to the ultimate goal of a world-community, we tend to look upon all men as of equal value, and we are prepared to learn from them all, however undeveloped their way of life may be. Today, every intelligent person regards travel as an intellectual venture, and goes abroad prepared to learn rather than teach. Not only his means of getting abroad, but also his occasions of wishing to go abroad have undergone radical change within recent years.\n\nToday, distance means little in terms of time. The European executive will soon be able to make the return journey to the USA within the day; already the Singapore businessman can reach England within 18 hours. The jet plane, the fast car, the ship, and the railway have made travel for diplomatic, business or military reasons virtually an immediate thing. Travel is, of course expensive but is much easier if the government or the firm pays the bill. But all the same, it is far from being limited to the rich, or to officials. Today, travel is a function spread throughout the community. Paid holidays help the worker to travel beyond his own country. Perhaps the most important change is that, nowadays, people at every level of the community are meeting overseas. This tends to spread an international outlook and makes for world peace. It result sin a certain amount of resettlement and admixture of populations, which has  actual benefit from the education point of view.\n\nNowadays, few travel primarily to gain education, but education, though incidental, is the inevitable result. Travel teaches climatic conditions, racial customs, religions languages and the social and political outlooks of other nationalities. It helps in racial and national understanding through exchange of ideas; it provides interesting conversation. Inevitable certainly when the mind is tuned and receptive, but not so to the dull and narrow person, who gains to benefit wherever he goes, and therefore might as well stay at home."

        "title": "Science in everyday life",
        "content": "In its broadest meaning of 'knowledge', science enters the life of even the most primitive human being, who knows the safe from the poisonous berry, who has stored up some rudimentary ideas about building a hut, sharpening a spear, and fishing in the river. this knowledge, or accumulation of experience, distinguishes man from the animal which has to rely on instinct.\nYet, for most people 'science' means a number of abstract subject such as physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics, to quote a few, which have to be learnt as part of 'education', yet which seem to have little bearing on everyday living. How wrong this is. Our way o life is completely dependent on science and its fruits surround us on all sides.\n\nThe Renaissance first taught man to realize the value of scientific progress, but it was not until the 18th century that the Industrial Revolution in the West really showed the impact science could have on living through developments in land-tillage, commercial production, transportation, and the beginning of the supply of mass-produced consumer goods. Until about 1920, progress was steady but in the last 45 years, the process of applying of science to the needs of living has accelerated enormously. This has been proportionate to the rate of scientific discovery itself.\n\nToday, there is available an enormous range of consumer goods from the simple frying-pan to the jet plane, from the alarm-clock to the computer. All these things serve to make life easier and more pleasant, yet in themselves do not constitute civilization -- merely its comfortable adjuncts. Progress in real living is achieved less through 'things' than through education, the arts and the love of beauty. Science has nothing to say to us in these categories, merely providing aids and short-cuts. Without them, life would be no more than the struggle for survival; there would be no time or incentive to pursue higher things.\n\nScience gives us safe food, free from harmful bacteria, in clean containers or hygienic tins. It also teaches us to eat properly, indicating a diet balanced in protein and carbohydrate and containing vitamins. The results is freedom from disease and prolonged life. In pre-scientific days, food was monotonous and sometimes dangerous; today it is safe and varied. It is varied because through improved sea, land and air transport food can now be freely imported and exported. Science has also improved clothing and made it more appropriate for climatic and working conditions. Man-made fibers and versatile spinning machines, today enable us to dress in clothes both comfortable and smart without being expensive.\n\nHome, school and office all bear witness to the progress and application of science. Nowadays, most homes possess electric lighting and cooking, but many also have washing machines, vacuum cleaners and kitchen appliances, all designed to increase comfort and cleanliness and reduce drudgery. Science produces the fan which cools the air, the machinery which makes the furniture and fabrics, and hundred and one other features for good living. The books and papers are at school, and again everything from the piece of chalk to the closed-circuit television of instruction are the direct or indirect results of scientific progress. Learning is therefore easier. And clerical work is made far more speedy and efficient by the office typewriter, quite apart from the hundreds of different machines which relieve the manual worker of so much slow and monotonous toil in the factories.\n\nIn the old days, the idea of travel or taking a holiday was the monopoly of the privileged few. Today, science has given us the steamer, the aircraft and the motor-car. New horizons are opened to us and the increase of wealth brought about by science has given us the means to enjoy the new leisure we have been given. But to enjoy life at all, we must be healthy and it is perhaps in the sphere of medicine that some of the greatest advances have been made. Today, because of the use of antibiotic and isotopes, many diseases are speedily cured and man has become, on the whole, a healthier being, set free from pain and illness.\n\nScience has been completely beneficial to ordinary living when properly applied. When misused, it is equally harmful. Land can be poisoned by chemicals, workers can suffer industrial disease, war can mobilize science to man's own destruction. Science is a good servant, but man must remain master."

        "content": "The modern scientific revolution has certainly enabled man to make enormous strides in harnessing Nature's power and potential for his own purposes. Yet, e should be careful not to assume too easily that final and complete control is only a matter of time.\nBefore the days of freedom of though and research, progress was held up by ignorance and superstition. Early cosmologies pronounced the earth flat, the fixed center of the universe. Being flat, it therefore had edges, precipices in fact, so, wide travel and exploration was discouraged, and none by the most intrepid would venture far. Religion especially Judaism and the mediaeval Christianity rooted in Jewish concepts, taught this cosmology as a religious fact and banned all scientific research based on independent thought. It was believed that the world was God's -- in the sense that he discouraged interference and undue investigation, all knowledge necessary to man's salvation being contained in the Bible. Knowledge, therefore, belonged to the Church. Men died at the stake to contest this assertion. But it was the Renaissance which set thought free. Galileo pronounced the earth round. the door was open, and science struggled free from religion. Thus, the beginning of man's conquest of nature came about, and it was not until the 20th century, well after the Darwinian theory of evolution has been fully accepted, that science and religion came to terms, that the enlightened began to realize it was a case of 'both and' rather than 'either or.'\n\nBut whatever knowledge was groped after the Renaissance, such knowledge had virtually no practical application, until the 18th century in Britain, which marked the beginning of the scientific revolution. This was because there was virtually no such thing as systematic scientific research. From times up to Watt's steam engine, applied science was almost non-existent. But from 1733 onwards to the present day, discovery has followed discovery with fantastic speed; the steam engine -- hence industrial machines, 'horseless carriages,' and railways -- now of course petrol jet, atomic and nuclear power; electricity with its manifold applications; radio, telegraphy, radar, television; rocket propulsion and therefore space probes; lighter metals resulting in freedom to use them for aircraft; plastics, with their thousand one uses; man-made fibers and a host of others. And apart from these dramatic discoveries, great advances have been made in medical science, in public health and in crop growing -- to mention but a few.\n\nThe more man probes nature's laws, the more he seems to control nature. Today, he an extract precious metals from ore -- he can even transmute them; he can move earth and forests and rapidly lay roads, construct airfields and parts, build new cities. He can defend himself by using modern weapons, guns, bombs or missiles. He can ride the earth's surface by car, rail, bicycle and ship; he can search the sea's bottom by using diving gear, or sail beneath the surface for months on end in submarines. He can fly over it in jet aircraft high over the earth's atmosphere. He can photograph the moon from a few kilometers range and transmit the pictures instantaneously to earth. We have seen him land on the moon. He can move and till the earth with giant machines. He can defeat disease by antibiotics and prolong his life by observing scientific health-rules. He can use natural products as never before; timber for his daily newsprint; coal and oil for his machines; waterfalls for his hydro-electric plant; steel and concrete for his buildings; nuclear power to produce his electricity.\n\nThere seems to be no end to it all, and it is easy to assume that man will soon master the world and eventually the universe. This, on reflection, seems to be a fallacy, for what man is really doing is discovering and applying the forces of nature -- not inventing them, and in his applications, merely scratching the surface. Science may probe space, but it cannot defeat the laws of time and motion. there is no foreseeable way tin which man could ever venture beyond Mars; Medicine had advanced, but we still suffer from the common cold. The psychiatrist can diagnose a psychopath, but cannot cure him. The technologist can make a robot or a computer, but cannot begin to understand the human brain.\n\nIt seems the giant intelligence we call God has said 'thus far and no further'. And the facts of man's moral nature give no cause for optimism. The truth seems to be that man has not and never will master nature. It is nature which gently tolerates man."

        "title": "The uses of forests",
        "content": "Forests and the many varying trees of which they are composed have, since the very earliest days played an important part in the life of mankind. It is because of this that men have realized their value and have taken steps to preserve them and to prevent their wanton and useless destruction.\nFrom the primitive days of the wigman, the house on stilts or the African but, wood has been the basic material used for men's housing to provide shelter from the animals. The wigwam and the African hut were built round a frame of timber. The elaborately attractive black and white houses of 'Merrie England' in the sixteenth century depended on wooden frames. even today, when steel girders from the frameworld of our huge modern buildings like those in the Raffles City in Singapore or the sky-scrapers of New York, wood still forms an important part of the smaller modern houses. Soft woods of all kinds are used fro frames and doors and a variety of hard woods for furniture.\n\nFrom earliest times too, wood has played a large part in transport. A rolling tree trunk, very probably showed primitive man the possible use of the wheel, perhaps as important a discovery as that of fire. In the earliest days of the automobile, wood was essential in its construction, but even before that, trishaws, carts, carriages and wagons, all made of timber enabled man to move from place to place overland. Men were equally dependent on wood for crossing water ad through all the staged from the hollowed-out log and the small boat built round a wooden frame right up to the first great sailing ships which first crossed over oceans, all means of transport were wooden-framed and wooden-walled.\n\nAnother very important use of forests is a modern one . This is the cutting up of logs and timber for use in the making of paper, particularly the kind of paper on which our daily newspapers are printed. The logs of wood, when cut, are ground up by hue machines and are turned into wood pulp. This, then undergoes certain chemical processes and paper is the end product. When we realize how much daily news-print the world consumes, we can see how great is the need of timber for this purpose.\n\nAs well as producing timber, certain forests provide important oils such as turpentine from the pine forests of North America or palm oil from the palm forests. Olive oil is produced from the olive tree. There are other products too. The American sugar maple provides sugar from its sap. Flock, for mattresses is produced by the forests of huge cotton trees in West Africa. Equally these same African forests provide the necessary shelter under which the cocoa bean can grow.\n\nForests also prevent soil erosion. They protect it from winds blowing it away and form water washing it away. Forests, too, revitalize the soil and because of the addition of humus and vegetable matter, it does not degenerate and become barren. They also attract rain-clouds and in places where they have been cleared, deserts are likely to appear.\n\nMany wild animal and small insects find shelter under the protecting branches of forest trees. A wide variety of climbing shrubs, flowers and creepers are also protected by them. Forests too, whether the tropical ones of South-East-Asia; whether the sweeping miles of north American pines or whether the softer deciduous forest of Europe provide men with beauty. A tree, of whatever kind is a wonderful of nature.\n\nIt is because of the importance of forests that they should be preserved. In 1919, after the first great war, the wood shortage in Britain was very acute, because so much had been used in the war effort. The Forestry Commission was therefore, set up. This is a body which buys old woods and land, that is at present bare and turns them into modern forests using the latest scientific knowledge and equipment to help in this purpose. The modern forester grows his trees just as the farmer grows his crops or the gardener, his vegetables. He plants and then thins them and finally, when they are fully grown, he cuts them down for timber. He always replaces the felled trees with young ones. In reforestation, natural trees must always be grown. The Oak tree which is indigenous to England would not grow in Malaysia. neither of course, do palm trees flourish intemperate climates. Countries all over the world are caring their forests in this way, to ensure the supply of timber which is so badly needed."

        "title": "Reading and refinement",
        "content": "Ever since members of early civilizations used simple hieroglyphics to communicate their thoughts, hopes and aspirations, there has been a close connection between reading and refinement. For this purpose, the terms 'refinement' must be extended to include far more than 'good manners' -- otherwise, the only reading necessary to produce he 'refined' person would be a book on etiquette ! Refinement, however, really implies culture and civilization in the widest sense, a combination of those qualities which differentiate man from the animal world, and it is the bearing of reading on the development of these qualities which we must examine.\nA high standard of personal morality and unselfishness is cultured man's first characteristic. This, he largely owes to the books of his religion, whether it be the Christian Bible, the Muslim Koran, the Hindu Upanishads, the Philosophy of Buddha or Confucius. Such books teach him the meaning of family life and virtues of honesty, peaceful living and integrity. But, the best of secular literature helps him to achieve the same object. The innocence of Ophelia, the nobility of Sydney carton cannot fail to impress and attract the reader.\n\nGreek tragedy was intended to induce in the audience a 'Catharsis,' or purging of the emotions, primarily those of 'pity and terror'. But the general reader finds that all good literature has a salutary effect on the emotional side of his nature. Great emotional pleasure may be derived from a good novel, as we enter fully into the life of the hero or heroine, an the best of writing, whether it takes the form of poetry, drama, or the novel has an undoubtedly maturing effect on our emotional nature.\n\nFor most people, however, the 'refined' person is the 'educated' person, the person whose intellect has been developed through reading intelligent books. The clear, logical thinker owes much to his grounding in the school-room, and even more to the love of reading which this grounding has fostered. Reading becomes a stimulating function of adult life, and ceases to be a child's tool for passing an examination or getting a job.\n\nCultured living requires that people should be 'well-informed,' and wide reading has the added advantage of imparting useful general knowledge. Thus, the well-read man or woman is more fitted to live in the community and travel, profitably, outside it. Such knowledge is obtained from a variety of sources ranging from the newspaper and magazine to the many available volumes of specialized non-fiction books.\n\nAn added benefit of good reading is the development of a love of language for its own sake. Style, imagery and figurative language, the 'atmosphere of prose and poetry, its emotional intensity and its intellectual content-all these things inculcate a love of beauty, the mark of a truly civilized person.\n\nNo reader of good literature can fail to be influenced by the attitudes to life to members of the family, to the community and to the nation which it contains. He constantly checks his own philosophy against what eh finds, and in analyzing it, refines it. we do not necessarily try to behave like people in books, but at least we can learn from them.\n\nSometimes, however, we rightly desire to model our lives on those of great men and women, in so far as we can, and in this connection, the importance of reading biographies cannot be over-estimated. it is a poor scientist who does not emulate the achievements of a Michael-Angelo or an Einstein, it is a poor nurse who does not admire the forcefulness and devotion of Florence Nightingale.\n\nToday, we live in a cosmopolitan community, which has become sophisticated and matured by the admixture of foreigners, with their own languages, ways of life and special gifts. Furthermore, few of us nowadays, spend all our live sin our own small village or town. And so, it becomes increasingly important to know about other countries, other people. To know about other countries, other people. To know something about them from books, perhaps to learn their languages, at once smoothes the path to friendship, and it is a characteristic of a refined person to wish to make friends with other nationals -- not to regard them suspiciously as 'foreign devils.'\n\nThe refined person is the mentally disciplined person -- the person who demands a full and intellectually satisfying life."

        "title": "Modern methods of teaching",
        "content": "The old fashioned idea of teaching was that the children should play a passive part. They were completely in the hands of their teachers, to be molded into a certain pattern set by formal education, and to emerge as school leavers full of facts which, they had all too often learnt off by heart and parrot-woes. Often, none of these facts were related to life. The children were made to absorb them as a sponge absorbs water. this attitude was adequately summarized by Addison in the eighteenth century. \"What sculpture is to a block of marble, education is to the soul,\" he said.\nNowadays, such attitudes to teaching have completely changed and, while a certain store of facts must be learnt for examination purposes and indeed as a background to ordinary living, today such facts are not the 'be all' and 'end all.' Each child is regarded as an individual and not as a cypher in an educational machine. The teacher's aim is to develop the full potential of each child. He must be taught to respond to and to participate in the activities connected with learning and to -co-operate with the teacher so that everything he does is geared to his own life and to developing his control over his own environment. Today therefore, the facts and the subjects studied are secondary to the development of the child's whole personality. Hence, subjects cover a much wider range these days, from technical and practical subjects to current affairs and commerce.\n\nTo claim a child's interest, great importance is placed on purposive learning which means practical work of all kinds for the pupil. Such work must be varied as a child soon becomes bored when one particular activity is carried on for too long. His interest is not stimulated neither is the require skill acquired.\n\nNew attitudes mean new methods. Oral teaching, a time-honored method is still used, but not to the same extent. The teacher must do some talking, but children are encouraged to talk too, to ask questions and to discuss. The teacher has many mechanical aids to assist him in oral work. Language laboratories in which children can both listen to correct speech in foreign languages and record their own efforts, are extensively used. tape recordings of poetry and literature and of plays stimulate a child's interest and foster a love for these things.\n\nWords must be supplemented by visual aids which are important. A British child, who has never seen South-east Asia will know it better, if he sees pictures of rice fields of Malaysia or Singapore's colorful harbor. British geography will come alive for a Malaysian child if he can see pictures of the coal-black mining country. Diagrams and charts clarify many subjects like anatomy, science or chemistry. Film strips, from which children absorb facts much more quickly than they do from a book, are widely used too. It is one thing to explain the growth of a plant from a seedling. It is a much more telling experience to see it on a film taken with a time lapse camera so that in ten minutes, growth spreading over many weeks can be seen. Mathematics too, makes use of visual aids. Problems can be 'explained' and 'Cusenaire' equipment provides models and blocks for measuring, all of which convey more to the pupil than a dull textbook.\n\nIn modern teaching, great value is placed on creative subjects such as craftwork, music, dramatics and woodwork. Here, practical work is the order of the day and the child's progress measured by the end product.\n\nModern teaching includes the body as well as the mind. a child must express himself and have an outlet. Hence, all schools provide facilities for physical education and for a variety of games. Many provide swimming instruction. extra-curricular activities too are considered important. Hence, visits to museums, art galleries, theaters, and public games are organized.\n\nWe have come a long way from the old ideas on education where the three R's or the classics were alone considered important. Now the aim is to teach a child live and to be lived with. As with all new ideas, time will supply the answer as to whether the child and hence the man has benefited."

        "title": "The world of entertainment",
        "content": "Throughout history, man has demanded entertainment. Greek tragedy and comedy were an important feature of ancient soceity, staged in impressive open-air amphitheaters. The troubadour and 'strolling players' of mediaeval times were welcomed in hall and cottage alike, and the shadow and puppet plays of the East, even today, can draw crowds of village spectators. Thus, it has been, and always will be in every country in the world.\n\n'Entertainment' implies non-participation by the audience. A football match may be entertainment to the spectators, but it is sport to the players, and when we think of entertainment, we must exclude, 'activities' such as indoor games, card playing, dice, tenpin bowling, even amateur theatricals, because the point of all these is that we are providing our own amusement. To be 'entertained', we must be content to look, and to listen.\n\nModern entertainment has become a highly organized business, and in most modern countries, is available in bewildering variety. In a big city every conceivable taste can be met, from cabaret to ballet, from radio and television to the opera and the circus, from the 'straight' theatre to the 'Pop Ground', from the cinema to the variety show, and from the comedian to the symphony concert. And where different races. live side by side, as in Singapore, to these may be added the traditional performances of the Chinese, Indians and Malays.\n\nAnd what an attractive world this is - especially to young people! There is a glamour and glitter about it all which makes it irresistible. The prominent 'stars', especially, the 'pop' stars, of today become the idols of the adolescents, who imitate their clothes, habits and hair-styles, and dream of becoming famous and wealthy themselves, Generally, this remains a dream, and the humdrum business of ordinary living has to be got on with. But there are examples of talented youngsters being 'spotted' by promoters and turned into famous, wealthy personalities almost overnight, so young people go on dreaming.\n\nAmong them, there are a few who, having talent, try to break into the world of entertainment and, of these, a small minority succeeds. The truth is that bitter disappointment awaits the majority of young hopefuls, yet some carry on, and among them are the few who, not only possess talent, but who also have the good luck to be 'spotted'. But even this is not the end of the story. The real problem is not to 'break into' entertainment, but to keep your place in it, and this means not only a good basic training, but also having the originality to produce more and more new material. The television is an insatiable 'gobbler' of scripts as writers find to their cost and no comedian can afford to put over the same jokes twice. The crux of the matter is that some achieve instant success, and to be sure f a sustained, permanent place in the world of entertainment demands a training, whether in the drama or ballet school, or in the music academy, or with a professional script-writing team. There are no short cuts for the professional. For this reason, many professional entertainers are disgusted by the enormous sums paid to relatively untrained 'pop-groups' - but, of course, the majority of these die a swift natural death, their members returning to the humdrum jobs from which they came. Another source of anger to the professional is the inequality of reward, which is related to the popularity of the actor and not to the degree of training and skill which lies behind it. A musician in an orchestra will receive a small, if steady wage; a pop-group guitarist perhaps a hundred times as much; a trained stage actor will be paid far less than a more glamorous, but far less gifted cinema star.\n\nThinking of the average professional in the world of entertainment, one marvels that he is prepared to go on at all; his conditions are such that nobody without a vocation for entertainment would ever consider his life at all. At times, he will be working, and quite well-paid, but there will be other times when he is 'resting' i.e. out of work, and then he may hardly be able to buy food and shelter. Moreover, when he is in funds, he will be helping his less fortunate colleagues; the theatricals are a generous race. Eventually, age will catch up with him, but, he cannot expect a pension. Those who make a lot of money tend to spend it, and few are able to live in affluence after retirement.\n\nFurthermore, the professional entertainer is exposed to many moral temptations from which most of us are spared, and he has to be of strong fibre, if he (or she) is to be free from the corrupting influence of some of their colleagues.\n\nBeneath the glitter and the glamour lies hardship and heartbreak for the majority. The promoters, the managers and the impresarios are never poor men, and the entertainer becomes pathetically dependent on them -- especially when his public image is fading. But despite all this, we still have the professionals and always shall -- because the world of entertainment has an eternal, irresistible glamour. 'The show must go on !'"

        "title": "The influence of religions",
        "content": "In a short essay, on a vast subject, it is impossible to deal with more than four or five aspects of the influence of religion on the life of man - and these, of course, must be connected with the main world-religions excluding primitive, animistic beliefs and practices encountered in the most backward societies. Considering Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Confucianism and Judaism, we find that religions have influenced every aspect of the life of man.\n\nAmong the early Jews, religion not only 'influenced' government, it was government. Palestine, until the 8th century B.C. was ruled by 'Priests-Kings' who claimed divine sanction for all their decisions. Their appointment was a religious rite. And this has more or less influenced the Western theory of monarchy ever since. The theory of the 'Divine Right of Kings' was formally propounded in Britain in the 16th century, based on New Testament social philosophy. Officially rejected, it has, nevertheless, influenced the monarch to subject relationship in many countries ever since. Christianity, for its first 300 years, lived in more or less opposition to the Roman Empire ... until the days of Constantine, who, in 325 A.D. became the first Christian monarch of the Holy Roman Empire. But of course the temporal and spiritual functions of government had long since been separated between Pope and Emperor, King and Archbishop, and the relations between these have shown all the 'ups and downs' one might expect in subsequent history. In most countries today, government is carried out on democratic lines, the monarch retaining little more than a strong 'influence' and powers of sanction and veto.\n\nReligion has, in result, played an important part in the foreign affairs of countries. In this, the Moslem and Christian religious are cases in point. The faithful Muslim has always been permitted to take up arms in the defense of his religion, or to further its cause. The outcome has been wars against the Jews and the Christians. The Christians, likewise, considered it their duty to oust the Moslem Turks from the 'Holy Places' of Palestine in the middle ages, and long drawn-out 'crusades' were the result, costly in manpower, wealth and goodwill to both sides. If we examine the causes of most wars from mediaeval times to the 17th century, in Europe and the Middle East, we find religion was the direct cause, as between Christian and Saracen in Europe; sometimes, it was used as a cloak to further a political or economic struggle, or as a sanction to proceed with a war of aggression where legal claims could be proved (Henry V, Charles VI of France). Occasionally, the war was on a religious issue such as Protestantism versus Roman Catholicism. The Spanish Inquisition, as a part of the counter reformation, forcibly attempted to 'Convert' Protestant prisoners to Catholicism for the ultimate good of their own souls! Religious massacres have been commonplace in India in the past, and it says much for the democratic spirit of the New Malaysia that, today, Christians, Muslims and Hindus are able to live together in harmony.\n\nAmong other influences, those on the social customs of countries have been important. The Western 'weekend' is based on the Christian Sunday which in turn replaced the Jewish Sabbath. Bank Holidays such as Easter Monday and Whit Monday have a religious origin - just as do the sequence of holidays proper to the Chinese and Indians, beginning with Chinese New Year. But the effect of religion on social custom goes much deeper. It certainly produced the caste system in India and was partly responsible for the class system in Europe, but nowadays, both Hinduism and Christianity repudiate these arbitrary divisions among people. The theories of marriage and general conduct in social life also stem from the teaching of the respective world-religions and have become a fixed part of the pattern of life where they apply.\n\nThe most important influence of religion is upon morality. Modern law is based on a mixture of Roman law and religious principle. Its sanction is authority. Moral law, which is behind national and international legal systems, has behind it the final sanction - the Will of God. In this connection, each world-religion has made its own individual contribution to the sum-total of world morality, despite the fact that certain moral precepts are held in common by them all. If we look to the Muslim faith, we find there an admirable teaching about self-discipline; to the Hindu faith, about non-violence; to the Christian faith, about love; to the Buddhist faith, about contemplation and to Confucianism, about duties to society and the family. The most important commonly-held piece of teaching is that we should behave towards others as we should wish them to behave towards us.\n\nThe great Religions not only carry profound influence today, but also are, (and will remain) integral part in the life of man."

        "title": "The housing problem in a modern city",
        "content": "Whenever national economy permits, whenever commerce and industry flourish, cities are nowadays passing through a process of modernization. This is a world wide trend. In the 'older' countries, this process is steady, almost gradual, except in Europe, where the inhabitants of Germany, Italy and France, and Britain to some extent, had to take bold and swift measures to reconstruct vast areas devastated by bombing. In the 'newer' cities, the process has been ever faster, and of these, Singapore, which we will examine later, is a typical example. But in all cities, the tendency has been to convert city residential areas to other purposes, and the result has been the proliferation of problems; housing shortage, and the resettlement of large groups of workers to suburban areas; the social changes involved in such moves, and so on. Generally, the residential areas in the centre of cities have become neglected, giving rise to overcrowding and the creation of slums, while the wealthier professional and managerial classes have steadily moved out to suburban or country houses. So, whether the changes have come about through government policy or were made necessary by war-time destruction, they have been changes for the better.\n\nIf a modern city is to play any real part in the modern world, its central areas must exclude dwelling places, except perhaps those which are preserved for historic and cultural reasons. The needs of civilized life have to be met, and there simply isn't room unless 'skyscraper' blocks of flats are built - and on the whole, these can be built in suburbs, when there is pressure on space, as in Hong Kong. Secondly, land values in the centre of cities are very great, and rents therefore, become uneconomic, or have to be subsidized by the government. It is not difficult to see why these land values are so great when the competition to build 'at the centre of things' is so great. The list of the various kinds of public buildings, all competing for space, is enormous. To quote but a few, space has to be found for government buildings and offices, police and fire stations, hospitals, office blocks, shops, sometimes factories, hotels, a wide variety of places of amusement, churches, car parks and garages, museums, schools, universities, art galleries, and a hundred others.\n\nThe result is that the government, or property speculators, buy land and housing property, demolish the house, and erect some kind of public or commercial building in their place. An acre of land in central London can, for this reason, be worth more than million pounds sterling.\n\nAt the same time, it is realized that you cannot run a large city, unless the workers are there to run it. or near enough to commute by bus, train, car or bicycle. So the suburbs expand - either upwards or outwards - and the position is reached that the city's ever-widening circumference has become a mixture of older and larger houses, new industrial developments, and new blocks of flats, or re-housing areas, built by the private speculator, built and subsidized by the government as council houses. Unless architecturally planned as 'satellite townships' such areas soon tend to become depressing warrens of 'living units', utterly featureless and lacking even the 'character' of the old-fashioned slums. But this is only of the problems attending on a re-housing area. New facilities in the home mean changed ways of life. The lost 'community spirit' has to be re-created. Clubs, churches, temples, shops and sporting facilities have to be introduced, if the new area is to have any individuality, if the older people are to be saved from boredom and the younger people from delinquency. Internally, there are 'teething troubles' in the early days. It is not only the housing shortage in a modern city, which is the problem - it is the featureless house in the featureless area.\n\nThe age-long housing problem in populous Singapore has been solved by the Government in recent years. Since 1963 the Government, through the Housing and Development Board, has completed thousands units of flats and shop-houses, for the lower income groups. As an example of our previous remarks, it may also be noted that consultant engineers from the U.S.A. have been engaged to advise on transportation by monorail, dual rail or electric train. Traffic congestion has always been a problem, but Singapore is on the way to solving this by road-widening and double-tracking projects, and by building multi-storey car parks."

        "title": "Modern means of transport",
        "content": "Recent developments in transport by land, sea and air, have been made necessary by the modern, 'high-pressure' age in which we live, and made possible by scientific and technological development. Since the war, most modern countries have electrified their railway systems, motor cars have become fast, comfortable and reliable, the bicycle has largely been replaced by the motor scooter. The hovercraft, floating with equal ease over sea or land by means of its compressed air jets, is becoming a useful method of making short sealand journeys. The nuclear-powered ship or sub-marine can travel on or in the water for months on end-without refueling. The helicopter can hover, take-off and land vertically, in a jungle clearing, on the deck of a ship, or on the roof of a building. And in the sphere of fast air-transport, the jet-engine has revolutionized speeds and heights at which aircraft can travel, and so made the crossing of oceans and continents a matter of hours. While in the grandest sphere of all, that of outer space, the rocket-propelled space-craft can orbit the globe or reach the moon, enabling humans to land there.\n\nThe advantages of these power-war improvements are obvious. The pace of modern life, internationally as well as nationally, required swift communications. In an age, when even the minor affairs and troubles of even obscure countries are given immediate and world-wide publicity by the radio-telephone, and, television through links such as 'Telstar' and 'Early Bird,' has made it possible for statesmen and politicians to travel swiftly to conduct talks and 'on-the-spot' investigations. Domestic issues, once settled locally, or by the sheer passage of time, nowadays, rapidly become internationally explosive. Without the jet plane, U.N. mediators would be powerless. Industrially and commercially, swift travel is no less important. Personal business deals between, say. U.K. and U.S.A., can be finalized within one day - and with all the benefits of personal contact, and 'off-the-record' discussion. The pressure of time on people who can afford foreign travel and holidays is such that they often have only a few days to relax in different surroundings. Swift travel is, therefore, a modem trend of the tourist trade overseas. And within a country, tourism is greatly helped by the modern car, or the motor scooter, both as a cheap method of seeing the countryside and also as an advance on the bicycle for the lower income group commuter. Commuting for the rich, nowadays, is even carried out by helicopter; whereas the scooter moves through the traffic jams, the helicopter can fly over them! And who knows what scientific revelations will be made, when man is able to travel confidently in space and see for himself something of the mysterious universe in which he lives?\n\nBut modern transport also has something on the debit side, much of this being due to its actual or potential misuse. The satellite, space-ship, or jet plane can all be used for international spying and for releasing nuclear bombs as well as for peaceful purposes. The fast planes quickly transport troops and equipment to trouble-spots, but international friction is increased when two hostile nations make of the domestic issue of a minor country the battle ground of their own ideological disputes. It is a sad irony that many advances in modem transport have been forced on major countries by diplomatic competition and mutual mistrust.\n\nInternally, modern transport has played havoc with many modern cities. It is said that there are as many private cars as taxpayers in Singapore. In most countries, traffic congestion is an ever present imitant; peace is banished by over-crowded roads, and the wear and tear on the nerves by high-speed traffic. But the car remains a 'status-symbols', the bigger and faster it is, the more status' a family thinks it has.\n\nPhilosophically, the idea that material possessions and progress can be equated with human advance in the true sense is rubbish. We all like traveling fast from 'A' to 'B' - but, in the words of the old war-time British poster - 'Is your journey really necessary?'"

At this moment, both the USSR and the USA are capable of putting men `into orbit' round the earth, who can even leave their space-craft and float in the space. Permanent scientific satellites already carry equipment which feeds back date to the earth. The second revolutionary advance is the speed of air transport due to the development of jet engine. Invented by Sir Frank Whittle, this engine today, powers aircraft to incredible speeds and heights. The 'sound barrier' is broken very easily and high flying reduces air friction, so that crossing oceans and continents is now a matter of hours. The safety-factor has also been highly developed. Air line disasters continually make news, but in fact, the accident rate in flying is very low. For local transport, the helicopter has become an incredibly useful machine. Able to hover, land and take-off vertically, this aircraft needs only a confined space; even the top of a large building or a small jungle clearing will do. The machine has shown its paces in war, and also in the more humane tasks of land-sea rescue, collecting land-casualties and dropping food and medical supplies. Perhaps bracketed with this machine is the hovercraft, land-sea or land by means of compressed-air jets. For short, comfortable journeys, this transport innovation is ideal. Four of them have recently been ordered by Britain for the English Channel crossing. Finally, of course, nuclear fission has helped transport. The nuclear engine can operate for months without re-fueling, with the result that submarines carrying strategic nuclear weapons, can remain under sea almost permanently, and that nuclear sea-transports are independent of fuelling-stops.\n\nTurning to communications, we find a series of similar advances. Perhaps the modern age dawned when the murderer, Crippen, was arrested in 1910, as he left the trans-Atlantic liner in the USA where subsequently, he was tried and executed. His arrest was due to the radio-telephone, an invention which has been of great service ever since where world-wide instantaneous communication is desired. Nowadays, it is possible to pick up the telephone in Singapore and within a matter of seconds speak to the subscriber in London. This is achieved by a series of booster radio stations set up at intervals for this purpose. The undersea cable supplements this method, and it is not possible to send pictures by both means. This is a boon to journalists. Internal communication have, of course, been greatly improved. A large office or factory nowadays, relies greatly on two modern methods of communication; that of the intercom telephone system, which enables offices to exchanges notes at the drop of a switch, and the 'public address' system for disseminating news and even 'music while you work'. The same system is used on ships and at sports meetings, among other places. The last has marked the development of radar, which is really a locating system. Radio waves 'bounced' back from the object located define its position, on a screen. Television is, of course, the best known advance in communication. It has a variety of scientific uses in addition to its commercial use as a news and entertainment medium. Satellites such as 'Telestar' and 'Early bird' now enable television to be used on world-wide scale.\n\nWe live in an age of scientific marvels, which could make for a better, happier world - were their employment confined to humane purposes. But every one of these inventions can be misused, and the reflective mind is saddened by the fact that whereas man is making enormous advances on the scientific front, he is still in the dark age from the moral point of view."

        "content": "Modern youth, indeed all youth in whatever country, have something in common with the crab. The crab, if you look at him carefully as he sidewalks the golden sandy shores of Malaysia, has a very hard outside shell under which is a very soft interior and young people can be compared with crabs.\n\nToday's youth, in general, seem at first glance to be hard, sophisticated and wordy. On the whole, he is better educated than his parents were. There are more schools, more colleges and universities and more chances for him to develop the best that is in him. He enjoys all the advantages of modern science, television, radio, faster and more efficient travel - all contribute to his urbanity. A Malaysian youth enjoys travel these days just as the youth of Europe and America does. Mass production means cheap, smart clothes within the reach of most pockets. It means possessions too, on a far larger scale than what the previous generations have had.\n\nThis group, if they are working are comparatively \"well-off,\" and since between the ages of fifteen and twenty, most of them are single, and live at home, very cheaply; they have more actual spending money per head than any other age group. Consequently, their pleasures and their possessions, clothes, make-up in the case of girls, and motor-cycles and things of that kind for boys, are more abundant than they were ten years ago.\n\nThis age group too, seems to like the same kind of things and adopt similar fashions. Pop music is its theme song. Walkman (cassette player) and youth seem to be inseparable and it is \"a hard day's night\" for the rest! The 'Pop groups' have set the fashion among many young people, for other things too. The long hair style of the modern young man of the West has become almost a status symbol. Clothes for boys have a more distinctive cut and are fashioned from brighter materials. The girls, while adoring the Western singers, wear their hairs long and straight and \"Baby Doll\" dresses are \"with it.\"\n\nThis, then, is the outer shell of the modern youth, but underneath is the soft vulnerable part. He has his problems just as his parents had at the same age. For some examinations loom forever large and these are, in some ways harder because competition is keen these days, and the \"rat race\" so much quicker. In an Age of Technology, great emphasis is laid on technical and written qualifications of all kinds. For others, who are wage earners already, there are problems of balancing the budget, of making ends meet, of pleasing the boss and doing a satisfactory job.\n\nFor all of them, there is the difficult process of transition from the child, with very few responsibilities to the adult with very many. How to behave? What to say? Shall I sound or look silly? How to run a banking account or a car? Such questions may seem trivial, but to modern youth, struggling to find his feet in an adult world, they are all important, because youth is, above all sensitive. An advantage of age is that life teaches us not to care too much what other people think, but this is not given to youth and so they are easily hurt.\n\nQuestions of religion, of morals, of politics worry them, because this age group, or whatever educational attainment is a \"thinking\" group. It questions, for the first time, the validity of parental utterances or the sagacity of philosophers and religious leaders. All the time, it is searching for truth and for the answers to life's problems. It sometimes thinks that it has found them until life shows that is has not! Much, far too much, is written, discussed and published about modern youth, its habits and its behavior.\n\nJuvenile crime and delinquency, encouraged by violence in television programs and 'Comics,' are, it is said on the increase. For the small minority, this is unfortunately true, but it must be remembered that minor crimes, all of which are recorded and apprehended today, would have been 'overlooked' or punished by 'authority' on the spot, fifty years ago. Nowadays, all crimes, however trivial, reach juvenile Courts and so swell the statistics.\n\nModem youth is often irritating, but which generation of young people is not? It may have 'oddities' which to older people seem very peculiar indeed, but, on the whole, the picture is a bright one. Young people, whether in the East or in the West, enjoy their young and, with help and guidance, will mature to be the citizens and parents of tomorrow. Good citizens and good parents, in these days will be discussing the foibles and peccadilloes of their own children - the youth of tomorrow."

        "title": "The benefits of and the problems caused by the artificial damming of rivers",
        "content": "The damming of rivers to form reservoirs was common practice in Roman times, and probably much earlier. Over the intervening centuries the practice has evolved for three main purposes; human consumption, irrigation, and industrial use. Since rainfall is never sufficiently uniform to provide a reliable water source from normal river flow, the reservoir has always been a great boon, spanning as it does lengthy periods of drought. There are, of course, other reasons for damming a river. Following heavy storms in mountainous areas more water than a river can carry will flow down to the plain, inundating large areas often destroying crops, homes and animal and human life. Mountain passes, if dammed, give the opportunity not only to control the flow of flood water at its peak but also to retain large quantities for controlled use in dry weather. This control of water works from sea to river as well as from to sea. An example is the recently constructed Thames barrier below Woolwich on the River Thames in England. This consists of solid pillars across the river with massive steel plates between each pillar which can be raised or lowered mechanically. The object is to protect the low-lying parts of London when a certain combination of wind and tide raises the water level by as much as thirty feet.\n\nA further use of the dam is to produce hydroelectric power, the power station, of course, being built below the level of the dam. Water is channeled through conduits and used as mechanical power for the turbines. It is then returned to the river. Reservoir water is also used today in vast quantities in nuclear power stations for cooling and other purposes and is similarly returned to the river or to the sea.\n\nSome rivers in their natural state are not navigable by large vessels, or run dry in seasons of drought. Where such rivers can be dammed they can be given a constant depth for purposes of navigation, and this benefits a country's communication system.\n\nMore often than not a dam may be central in a multipurpose scheme including most of the functions outlined above. This is particularly true in countries lying in temperate zones, where water shortage can be a nuisance but is rarely a disaster.\n\nMatters are different in underdeveloped countries which are hot, dry and barren. In these areas populations are often nomadic, driving flocks and herds from waterhole to waterhole, or scratching a mere subsistence from the soil. Drought means disease, hunger, dehydration and death to animals and humans alike. The damming of major rivers such as the Nile is crucial to life itself, and the control of their floodwater for irrigation purposes essential, but even this is not preventing large tracts of North East Africa from reverting to desert.\n\nPerhaps of least importance is the social value of a reservoir. Some stocked with trout, provide good fishing, and most are used by sailing clubs, and for other aquatic sports. A reservoir is also a great attraction to water-loving birds and often becomes an interesting staging-post for migrations.\n\nDamming a river can also cause problems. A great area of land, with its trees, flora and fauna, farms and houses, has to be inundated. Neither the resident, who have to resettle elsewhere, nor the environmentalists, appreciate this. The problem is more acute when the countryside about to be spoilt is environmentally unique, as in a recent case in Australia, where attempts were made to involve Prince Charles and Princess Diana in the dispute. Creating an artificial lake inevitably changes the character of a large area. Farmland is destroyed, natural scenery, in the opinion of some, despoiled. People have to move, inconveniently.\n\nA second drawback may be political. Many rivers flow through more than one country, that lying higher up the river having the whip-hand. A dam built for one country's benefit may be much to the detriment of another. The USSR has been in dispute with Turkey over this matter as has Egypt with the Sudan.\n\nDams are vulnerable to air attack in wartime. The destruction of the Mohne See dam in the Second World War brought the industry of the Ruhr to a virtual standstill, as well as causing loss of life. There have also been cases of the collapse of dams due to inadequate strength and imperfect design."

For domestic use it is fined down to what is known as table-salt, and small quantities of other chemicals are added to it to keep it free-flowing when in contact with the atmosphere.\n\nSalt and potassium are combined to produce iodised salt, used when iodine is lacking in diet. It s absence causes goitre, the swelling of the thyroid gland.\n\nLivestock as well as humans need salt, and this provided in the form of solid blocks, known as 'salt-licks'.\n\nSalt is also crucial to the food industry. It is used in meatpacking sausage-making and fish-curing both for seasoning and as a preservative. It is also used in the curing and preserving of hides and in the form of brine of brine for refrigeration purposes.\n\nSalt is extensively used in the chemical industry; in the manufacture of baking soda, sodium bicarbonate; of caustic soda, sodium hydroxide; of hydrochloric acid, of chlorine etc. It is also used in soap-making, and in the manufacture of glaze and porcelain enamel. It also enters metallurgic processes as flux, a compound used to assist the fusing of metals.\n\nSalt lowers the melting point of water, so in combination with grit, it is used for clearing roads of snow and ice. It is also used for water-softening by means of removing calcium and magnesium compounds from tap water."

        "title": "The relative importance to man and animals of the five senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell",
        "content": "It is difficult to grade the senses in relative importance to mankind. Opinions vary particularly between sight and hearing. A person blind from birth has no concept of vision, so presumably does not `miss' sight. It is different for a person who goes blind because suddenly, or gradually, so much is lost; personal independence to a large degree, driving a car, reading and watching television, enjoyment of all forms of visual beauty. Some of these deprivations can be partially overcome. The loss of sight tends to train a more acute hearing. People will always help the blind in practical ways, and there are many modern aids for the visually handicapped, ranging from braille and books on tape to all kinds of domestic appliances designed for the sightless. Musical appreciation and music making are also open to the blind. Many blind people would grade vision as less important than hearing, since, given help and their own determination, they can live a relatively full life. The obvious drawback to deafness lies in loss of communication, though today there are some marvelous machines which allow the sufferer to learn speech through varied frequencies of vibration. The traditional method of lip-reading supplements this, so that conversation and teaching can be carried out. The social disadvantage of deafness is that of the impatience of others. Deafness is not at once obvious and so may be mistaken for stupidity. In the modern world deafness can also be dangerous; traffic-sense, particularly in children, depends largely on hearing. Touch, taste and smell are all sources of pleasure, the two latter being important in the enjoyment of food, but they are all relatively dispensable. Their absence can, however be dangerous; the loss of nerve endings can lead to severe domestic burns and abrasions, while taste and smell can detect lethal gases and poisonous substances.\nFrom the human point of view most people would grade the importance of the senses in the order given in the question. This is not necessarily so in the animal world. Smell or 'scent' is of crucial importance to many animals, who rely on it to detect enemies and to find quarry. Thus it becomes far more highly developed than in humans, since survival may depend on it. For the same reason hearing is of nearly the same importance. The hearing range of animals is much wider than that of humans. Dogs can hear supersonic sounds and react to them at great distances. Many animals have very limited vision, simply because vision is relatively unimportant. Touch and taste are also of less importance to animals than to humans, though, as with humans, these two senses, combined with smell, have a protective role in warning them off obnoxious and poisonous organic and inorganic substances.\n\nNobody can ask an animal to grade the importance of the senses, but it seems to be, smell, hearing, sight, touch and taste in that order."

        "title": "The various methods of advertising and their effectiveness",
        "content": "`It pays to advertise.' The old adage remains true in principle because advertising not only sells goods but also creates the demand for new lines. The home computer is a modern example. The half a dozen big producers go in for highly competitive advertising, some of it aimed at children. They can play games, educate themselves, prepare themselves for modern living. All this can be done with books and paper, but parents are pressurized into buying computers, never-the-less, the sop to their consciences being that they can use the computer for family accounts. Of course they can. Equally they could do their family accounts once a month on the back of an old envelope.\n\nAdvertising sells goods and services, otherwise it would not exist, and the development of advertising in the West dates back at least three centuries, coinciding roughly with the publication of early journals such as The London Gazette, Tatler and Spectator in England, the circulation of which was largely limited to London and one or two large provincial cities. So advertising began on a local basis, because wherever you create a demand you must be able to meet it. So various factors combined to create national and international advertising; mass-production, based in the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, rail communication and transport, the development of printing, especially color printing, and the freighter for overseas markets. For as long as most people can remember advertising has been seen wherever the public go; on walls, shop fronts and hoardings, in railway stations and the underground, on streamers trailing behind light aircraft, from static balloons, on trains, buses and business vehicles, taxis and container lorries. With the advent of color-television, the commercial break has assumed primary importance. Some commercial radio channels still carry advertising. Handbills, advertising local firms, flood through the letter-boxes. Junk mail, addressed to computerized lists of likely buyers, fills the waste paper baskets.\n\nFrom this will be seen that over-kill is one drawback to the effectiveness of modern advertising. People get fed-up if they are over-pressurized, especially intelligent people. The hard sell becomes counter-productive. Yet the fact that it continues argues that this kind of advertising is financially justified.\n\nAdvertising is therefore big business, and the world's capitals, outside the Eastern bloc, offer scope to advertising firms with their highly specially areas of expertise. Such firms employ some of the best ideas people, graphic artists, promotional experts, and film producer and technicians.\n\nThe effectiveness of advertising depends on the assessment of the consumer's motivation in buying, and a direct or indirect appeal to that motivation; sometimes the creation of that motivation, by an appeal to a range of human instincts. Where there is poverty in a potential market the only effective appeal is based on cheapness, reliability and effectiveness in a product. In a mixed or affluent community the field is wide open. Most Western advertising works in a competitive market where the variety of brands is matches by the consumer's power of choice.\n\nThe soft sell works best when appealing to the very rich, and usually price is not mentioned. A country house with a hundred acres of land is offered as a modest gentleman's residence, the Rolls Royce is merely described as 'the best car in the world. Everybody knows that a small group of products are the best in their fields, so advertising merely keeps them in the public eye. 'Apeing the celebrity' is another line of attack; if a famous heavy-weight uses a particular deodorant, or a great actress a particular shampoo, good sales result. Another successful line with a shampoo is that it works, implying that the others don't. In contrast sexy lingerie ads are self-defeating. they bore women and men don't usually buy lingerie. Yet sex can sell chocolates. If a stunt-man goes through the hoops to bring his beautiful girl-friend the brand of her choice he will take the easier way of buying them in the supermarket and she may begin to fantasize about the bringer. The appeal to snobbery still works. Because those bright, successful, affluent Jones next door certain brand names, the failed, boring economical neighbors must do likewise. Comic ads amuse some, repel others, but in either case people keep the brand name in mind, if only never to buy it.\n\nMost countries today have a statutory body which seeks to deep advertising up to a certain basic standards; ads must be morally decent, truthful and legal. However there are countless ways of disobeying the spirit if not the letter of the law. Subliminal advertising has rightly been banned. The advertising of foodstuffs has been improved by 'sell by' and statements of contents."

        "title": "The causes and consequences of erosion",
        "content": "Erosion is the eating or wearing away of land features. It is caused by a variety of factors, some natural, others man-made. The consequences can be serious both for the natural world and for man himself.\n\nThe natural causes are weathering, water, ice, wind and change of temperature. The changes may be very gradual, sometimes taking millions of years and dating back to the major upheavals on the planet when the earth was very young. Wind and rain driving incessantly against sandstone, formed originally by immense pressures on early sea-beds and then lifted above sea-level by volcanic eruption or the clash of land-plates, wears the stone back into sand, thus creating beaches along the sea-shore. In the case of harder rock such as granite, surfaces are worn smooth.\n\nWeathering also erodes exposed coastlines in temperate zones. Often cliffs and dunes simply disappear over perhaps a short period of two or three hundred years. The sea encroaches, and sometimes coastal villages are lost. There is written evidence of English villages having been lost under the waves.\n \nThe sea also plays its part in the erosion process. The Netherlands, facing the turbulent North Sea, have for centuries fought the battle against salt water encroachment due to erosion. Great dykes have been built to exclude the sea, and gradually the low-lying salt flats have been sweetened and fertilized for agriculture and bulb-growing. In another way, the sea also erodes rock fragments by friction due to the tides. The smooth pebbles on northern beaches are the result of their having rubbed together over millions of years.\n\nThe great ice-floes attached to the poles play a conspicuous part in regulating sea levels. In general, sea levels are thought to be rising, though opinions vary as to the rate. At present, many fear what is called the 'greenhouse effect', i.e. the punching of holes in the ozone layer due to industrial gases and the use of CFCs. Nations are beginning to agree to eliminate these hazards. The result might be the melting of the ice-caps causing a devastating rise in sea levels. This would put much of the land in temperate climates under sea-water.\n\nSlow-moving glaciers also have an effect. Their immense power pulverizes any rocks in their path. The piles of shale at the foot of many mountains resulted from the pressure of glaciers millions of years ago.\n\nWind is probably the greatest single cause of erosion. Where there is no protection given to the soil, and after a period of drought or intense heat, the soil crumbles to dust and literally blows away. Man himself can either let this happen or take steps to prevent it. Rain, of course, has a dual effect. In some circumstances it can wash away the soil into river beds, where it is carried down to estuaries, often silting them so that they require dredging. Inland, and on flat territory, rain holds the soil together. Yet rain depends on trees and foliage which cause clouds to precipitate. The central plains of North America from time to time become dust bowls, simply because all vegetation has been cleared in favor of large scale, economic cereal growing. The same clearance of rain forests goes on currently in South America in favor of cash crops. Conservationists throughout the world are resisting these clearances, but are fighting vested interests.\n\nThe rain forests support a wide variety of animals, birds, insects and plants, many of which can only exist in their present habitat. This is an added reason for resisting deforestation. Sooner or later when the forests have gone the climate will change from not and humid to dry. The soil will crumble and erode.\n\nTribes dependent on land for grazing and agriculture lose their herds, flocks and food. They become nomads or refugees and are exposed to epidemic and starvation. Erosion can cause much human suffering.\n\nEven in temperate countries large-scale farming is now being discouraged, for the foregoing reasons. In England such farming has meant the destruction of hedges, ditches and trees, aging spoiling traditional landscapes and the habitats of bird, animal and insect species.\n\nSome erosion is natural and inevitable. Much however is caused by man. Long term conservation is essential if man is to pass on a beautiful planet to future generations."

        "content": "Obviously the practical means of doing so lies in the hands of the police force, para-military antiriot forces, and, in the last resort, the armed forces themselves. In democratic countries, these are firmly under the control of civilian governments, the members of which are freely elected.\n\nGovernments legislate and judiciaries administer the law. However the degree of control over the individual and the nature of the sanctions to be applied depend partly on the traditions of the country concerned and partly on the seriousness of the law and order problems which the country faces.\n\nWhat are today's problem? Political protest, leading to strikes, street demonstrations, physical violence, use of arms and weapons, mob violence and vandalism, looting, and in extreme cases, civil war. Football violence, such as has recently excluded England from matches in Europe. Crime against the person and against property e.g. murder, rape, theft, burglary and vandalism. These evils spread from country to country by imitation through international media publicity. Paradoxically, they also spread when law and order sanctions are either tightened or relaxed. This dilemma faces Mr Gorbachev precisely because of glasnost and perestroika, particularly insofar as political unrest spreads through the Soviets and Russia's satellite neighbors.\n\nSo the distinction between personal and political motivation behind lawlessness must be made. Where the motivation is personal, i.e. based in natural violence, social resentment due perhaps to deprivation, greed, sexual amorality, hatred or drug-induced mental states, then sanctions must be toughened as required. There are arguments for and against the death penalty, but there is little doubt that it provides an effective deterrent. There are arguments against physical punishments, but they also deter. English law provides severer penalties for offences against property than against the person. In view of the muggings, street and public transport violence experienced today, this must be reversed.\n\nThe modish, liberal explanation of the increase of such crime is that `society rejects the poor and underprivileged. Rebuild slum areas and offer more government handouts and crime would disappear'. This is nonsense. What is society but a collection of individuals? Every individual is endowed with personal choice. The individual must be made to choose the law and order path. Religion and morality must be instilled into children in the home, in the school and in the workplace. Some form of compulsory national service of a non-military nature would benefit young adults of all racial origins and of both sexes.\n\nThe more difficult question is that of offence against law and order when the motivation is truly political. Do citizens owe a duty to support and preserve the established order in return for the benefits they receive from it? If not, at what point does the freedom fighter become the terrorist? At what point in a democracy does the legitimate lobby become the violent, chanting, vociferous and sometimes blackmailing pressure group? The answers must of course depend on the political stance of the individual. Again however the distinction between political and personal motivation must be clearly made. In Ireland religion and politics are used as a cover for common criminality. In South Africa the motivation behind violence is often tribal rivalry or the instinct to loot, pillage and murder.\n\nThe justification for using the sanctions already mentioned in order to maintain law and order when offences are political lies in the quality of any country's government. Where there is democracy, where there is a multi-party system, where the legal system is fair, where human rights including that of free speech within the law are preserved, there lies the justification. When these things are denied then there can be a case for resistance, even revolution.\n\nYet underlying the spread of common criminality is the flight from religion and morality and the weakening of the family system. Much youth delinquency could be pre-empted by discipline in the home, school and work-place, always provided the motivation behind such discipline is affection and the true well-being of the young person."

        "title": "What can be done to alleviate suffering in the world ?",
        "content": "We live in a world we are perpetually exposed to what William Shakespeare described as \"the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\". It is true that much suffering is caused by accident and natural disaster and is therefore almost unavoidable. A drunken car driver may kill or maim. Hurricanes and earthquakes leave a trail of death, injury and havoc. Some steps may be taken to lessen the likelihood of this kind of suffering by imposing severe penalties for drunken driving, or living, if possible, outside hurricane and earthquake centers, but the innocent still suffer, and are likely to go on suffering.\n\nUnmerited suffering has always perplexed philosophers, who can rarely say more than that we live in an imperfect world. Religions supply explanations; God, or the gods, punish mankind for breaking the divine law, and to some extent this is true. Abuse of alcohol, tobacco, drugs and sex carries with it automatic retribution. Whether catastrophe is a direct form of retribution for sin, imposed by a divine being or beings is very doubtful. What is quite evident is that we are required to live in a world which is dangerous, and whatever protection from either natural or man-made disaster we can find has to be made by ourselves. Some religions teach that there will be an after life in which all wrongs will be set right, and where the injustices of this life will be redressed. This enables the faithful to put up with whatever misfortune comes their way in the hope of better things to come. Suffering has to be faced by everybody, sooner or later, and it is no use philosophizing about divine impartiality. \"God's rain falls on the just and the unjust\", says the Old Testament. Nearer the mark is this rather flippant rhyme;\n\n\"The rain it raineth every day\nUpon the just and unjust fella, But mostly in the just, because\nThe unjust hath the just's umbrella'.\n\nThe lessons of history are against the probability of abolishing suffering, yet that is the ideal, the objective towards which all civilized human beings should work.\n\nIf selfishness and hatred could be replaced by unselfishness and love, this would go a long way towards the alleviation of suffering. Ever since pre-history there have been wars, usually caused either by pure aggression of by greed for fertile and or natural resources. Since 1945 war has taken on a new and horrific dimension. Though nuclear bombs have been used only against Japan, there is a proliferation of nuclear weapons, and recently there have been terrible examples of the use of napalm, nerve gases, and chemical armaments. There is no need to enlarge on the resultant suffering. And since all these armaments are universally available, and since the arms trade virtually knows no boundaries, any real progress must lie in the direction of multi-lateral disarmament and severe restriction on the arms trade. This can only be achieved by a move towards the \"one-world\" concept and a heightened respect for the dignity and basic rights of the individual.\n\nThe latter point raises the matter of political systems. Most civilized countries today are governed democratically rather than autocratically. The democratization of much of Eastern Europe is a real step forward. Gone are the secret police and the barbarous acts perpetrated against the individual by the previous regimes. However, political oppression and brutality to dissenters still exists in many parts of the world. It is to be hopes that the major powers will exert such pressure that autocracies will finally be overthrown. With that overthrow could come an end to torture and the physical and mental degradation which continues to scar the face of humanity.\n\nThere are three final points. First, religious fanaticism, an age-old problem. Does God want \"Holy Wars\" and the self-sacrifice of teenagers on the battlefield? Does God approve of hostage-taking, of the bombing of town centers or aircraft? There is one theme common to all true religious belief; \"Do unto others as you would they do unto you\".\n\nSecond, the poverty of the \"third world\". The wars waged by, and the cynicism shown by many third-world leaders should be brought to an end, if necessary by force. International and voluntary aid is often diverted to the purchase of arms and the feeding of troops.\n\nFinally, the frailty of the human body itself. It is true that God allows physical suffering but has given man the intellect t alleviate or prevent it, then medical research must not be hampered. Science is on the way to finding the cause, and therefore the elimination of cancer and other inherited diseases. Genetic in vitro probes can also prevent the birth of handicapped children. Research must be given the green light."

        "content": "Strictly speaking, a language is a verbalized means of communication, enabling the speaker to convey thought to another person. However, the more complex the thoughts or ideas, the harder or more cumbersome language becomes. To explain verbally why 'the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides' would require a long and tedious paragraph or great math tutors. And this is the simplest possible example; anything more complicated would be unmanageable. So in this way mathematical symbols which nowadays are universally accepted, compress information in a way that no ether 'language' possibly could, and this fact supports the topic statements.\n\nHowever, this 'language' is only available to most people in it's simplest forms, i.e. arithmetic, algebra and geometry, and these are taught in schools because they have everyday usage. The shop assistant needs arithmetic, unless there is an automatic cash till, and technicians of all kinds need the other two; perhaps more, such as trigonometry, logarithms and the calculus, should he or she be dealing with quantities that vary in time and space. In this sense, of course, mathematics is a minority language, a language intelligible only to the specialists of all nations.\n\nThe time may come when knowledge of higher mathematics is far more wide-spread, however. The 'new' mathematics is now being taught in many schools, sometimes alongside the traditional approach, and younger students find the new methods more intelligible. The principles of course have not changed; merely the setting out. However, there are great developments available to younger students enabling them to see the subject as a whole rather than as a series of separate compartments, and this should engender more interest in those whose natural bent is in the direction of the arts.\n\nMathematics has been described as 'the spearhead of natural philosophy', and this was certainly true up to about 1800. The subject grew up independently in China, India, the Arab world and Europe. For example, many of the Alexandrian and Greek schools of geometricians, represented by Thales of Miletus, Pythagoras, Euclid, Archimedes etc advanced propositions which were already Pythagoras, Euclid, Archimedes etc advanced propositions which were already known elsewhere. The West derived it's numbers system from the Hindu-Arabic world, which reached Europe in about 1000 AD. The West learnt mathematics from the Arab world and, from the 15th century, great developments took place.\n\nDescartes revived algebraic geometry, Napier invented logarithms, Newton and Leibnitz the calculus. Lobachevsky developed non-Euclidian geometry, and was followed by Einstein, though the latter was more of a physicist than a mathematician. From Newton onwards, mechanics and astronomy began to use advanced mathematics and, later on, physics came in for the same treatment. Both 'pure' and 'applied' mathematics became the indispensable tools of progress. Pure maths reaches conclusions by means of the deductive process, and may be independent of need. Applied maths consists of developments to meet the requirements of science and technology.\n\nSo mathematics has become a 'beautiful language' in several senses. Firstly, in it's ability to compress ideas, just as a great poet achieves desired effects by great verbal economy. Second, because it's tools, the symbols, are internationally accepted. Third, because it is entirely objective, and completely exact, allowing no room for prejudice or human emotion. Fourth, because it constantly provides the ground for new hypotheses. These in turn are checked by logic and observation. Often as with Pythagoras, mathematical conclusions can be checked by other means. So mathematics can lead man closer to absolute truth than any other means, that is in the categories of discovery in which it can operate.\n\nMathematics means 'facts', verified by experiment, and these facts are true within the four dimensions in which the human mind can operate. The other dimensions, perhaps six according to Stephan Hawking, must be compressed into infinitesimal space, so are likely to remain the prerogative of the Creator!"

        "title": "The advantages and disadvantages of industrial development",
        "content": "Over the past three decades, there has been an explosion of industrial development in many Far Eastern countries, ranging from those with no work-force expertise to the far more sophisticated states such as Japan and Singapore. Most countries have .some natural resource to develop, be it oil, timber, rubber or minerals and gemstones. The general process has been to exploit these resources by importing foreign expertise and equipment. Ideally, the results have led to dramatic increases in countries' GNP, favorable balances of trade, and the establishment of hard currencies which attract foreign investment. All these should lead to the building of hospitals and health centers, schools and colleges, sporting facilities and other amenities. Good wages should permit radical improvements in living standards. Unfortunately, this only happens where a country enjoys a reasonably democratic political system. otherwise, in a one-party state, the temptation is to divert new money into armaments, unnecessary extravagances and sometimes the pockets of those in power.\n\nSingapore and Japan are not typical of the Far East, since for decades they have been ahead of the rest in industrial development, although keen competition has reduced their lead in the past seven or eight years. Oil exploration in the Singapore region has dropped, and with it the demand for the re-export of oil-related machinery, drilling equipment and metal sheets and bars. Electronic components, diodes, photocells and integrated circuits; consumer goods such as radios, TVs, clothing, furniture and vegetable oils have also declined, due to competition from countries where much lower wage-levels are acceptable. However, Singapore will always benefit from its free trade zones. There are six; five for seaborne cargo and one for airborne. With their time-limited but duty and document-free storage facilities, they will always remain an attractive proposition. So does INTRACO, an international and paid-up trading company which has many useful functions.\n\nThe above relates to trade as much as to industry, but the results of both are much the same. On the industrial side, apart from the products listed in para 2, mention must be made of the great diversity of industrial products in modern Singapore; industrial chemicals, printing and publishing, shipyard restructuring and upgrading, aircraft repair and overhaul capabilities, machine tools and related products, and office equipment. Less than 5% of the land area of Singapore is used for farming, the main products being pork, poultry, eggs, vegetables, fish and cut flowers.\n\nSo to summarize the advantages. Industrial proliferation generates jobs. Money can be spent on universities, colleges, schools and training centers. State housing, mostly blocks of flats, offers rented accommodation. Health, social and police services can be financed. Typical health hazards, such as the anopheles mosquito, can be eliminated, and both hygiene and family planning publicized. Above all, relatively late industrialization means that state-of-the-art factories can be built. There is no legacy of ancient factories to modernize or demolish.\n\nYet all is not sweetness and light. There is something to be said for a more leisurely pace of life. A sudden shift to urban dwelling and high tech employment can and does set up psychological problems, which lead to health problems. Moreover, there was something to be said for the semi jungle nature of Singapore, and it would be pleasant to have a few wild tigers present. However, the main disadvantage is that industrialization sets up living standard expectations which depend absolutely on a healthy overseas trade. At present there is a world trade recession. Also, surrounding countries are becoming far more competitive. Inflation and widespread unemployment are the chief dangers."

        "title": "Eventually computers will allow people to work from home. Is this desirable ?",
        "content": "The answer is that computers already allow some people to work from home, though clearly this cannot apply to more than a limited number of people and a limited number of occupations. As to whether this is desirable, the answer is philosophical as well as practical.\n\nComputers, both analog and digital, have developed out of all recognition since the Second World War, when they were large, mechanical, and limited in use. They were then used in conjunction with radar for missile guidance and also for code breaking and a small range of mathematical functions. Most of those functions are now available in a child's pocket calculator. The application of electronics in the 50s followed by the use of the silicon chip and pre-printed circuits widened the computer's function out of all recognition, permitting a myriad series of voltage controls. The computer today is powerful, compact and relatively small. It combines readily with word-processing, faxing, and the electronic creation of screen graphics, which can be modified either by keyboard control or by electronic pen. The analog computer rapidly solves differential equations for civil and mechanical engineering problems. The digital computer with it's card punching function permits access to data banks, and allows the processing of records and all the kinds of work connected with bills, orders, wages, VAT etc. The computer today is integral in the world of business, commerce, design, word-processing and industry in general. Any organization from the small business upwards keeps a computer to which remote terminals may be linked, giving access at a distance to all it's functions and information.\n\nThe need for all white-collar workers to do a nine-to-five job in the office has disappeared. Today it is obviously possible for all workers down to lower-management level to work from home, and as computers continue to develop it is likely that firms will find it convenient to let an increasing number do so. Whether this is a desirable change is a moot point.\n\nSome visionaries anticipate the day when computers, in combination with robotry, will totally eliminate the need for work as we know it. This may theoretically become possible, though in any event computers could never quite eliminate the need for maintenance groups. To most of us, however, such a prospect would be appalling. Leisure only has value by reason or it's contrast with work, and the instinct to work is a built-in part of the human makeup. The past millenia have not adjusted our genes in this direction for nothing.\n\nA more likely scenario is that a much higher proportion of workers will eventually be able to operate from home. Of course, many people have always done so. The writer, the painter, the sculptor either work in the study or in an adjacent studio. Even the professional musician practices at home. Some of these are reclusive by nature, others not.\n\nThe majority of people are naturally gregarious. To produce their best they need both the company of others, and the 'atmosphere' of work. There is an instinct to go out to the job, and with all save workaholics. to be able to draw a clear line between work and leisure. The benefits of doing so are obvious. Easy association with others is confidence building. Ideas improve and extend as they are exchanged. You cannot get the 'feel' of a firm or institution at long range. If you have any responsibility at all you need to be in personal touch with managers and directors, not for ever using the telephone or the fax machine. And what about the social side, the friends made, the office party, the human element ?\n\nTo work in public demands a certain standard of dress and personal care. It would need more self-discipline than many people have to keep up the same standards at home. Self-discipline and the observance of good routines may come easily to some, but not all.\n\nThe reality of today's work-pattern is that when children are of school age wives also take on paid employment. Perhaps the wife also would have a computer terminal and all the paraphernalia of a modern office? Would they share facilities or duplicate equipment? How many flats and small houses have even one room which could be turned into an office? Who would make the coffee, cook the meals, collect the children, do the shopping and the housework? One can foresee many sources of domestic discord!\n\nComputers may change. Human nature does not. As a tool, the computer is vulnerable to the enemy, industrial or personal. Hackers can wipe out records unless there is duplicated soft-ware backup kept under lock and key. Hackers can introduce a virus.\n\nThe more one considers the implications of working from home the less desirable the project seems to be."

        "title": "Should we be concerned about the greenhouse effect ?",
        "content": "First, what is this effect? Ever since the Industrial Revolution began in the 18th Century smoke from fossil fuels, oil, natural gad and especially coal had deposited carbon dioxide in the lower part of the earth's upper atmosphere. The effect of this had been that part of the energy of the sun's rays reflected from the earth's surface had been absorbed by the C02 and by water vapor and returned to the earth in the form of heat. Thud the atmosphere is behaving increasingly like a greenhouse. The glass allows the sunlight through but traps the heat. The consequence is what is called 'global warming'.\n\nThere is a school of thought which says that the result will be a change in the earth's climate, plus an increase in nitrous oxide, methane gad and FREONS. It is predicted that by the mid 21st Century average temperatures will ride by 5 degree C (9 degrees F). This will result in the melting of glaciers and the polar ice-caps. Coastal waters will ride and inundate many low-lying countries. Food production for an increasing world population will be put at risk.\n\nNot everyone, of course, accepts this scenario, though the quantity of CO2 in the lower upper-atmosphere is constantly monitored, and the fact that the level is increasing is not disputed. Whether or not the expected ride in average temperature will happen is another matter. There have been no significant climatic changed for centuries, indeed millennia and, the opponents of the doom-merchants argue, nature has it'd own methods of damage-limitation and self-adjustment. Moreover, there are no present signs of global warming. The weather pattern in Britain, for example, is much the dame ad it wad in Victorian days, or Roman days for that matter. Why should it suddenly change? Coal had always been burnt and before coal, wood and charcoal. Forest fired have always raged. Volcanoes, and explosions such ad Krakatoa (1883) have always thrown tons of noxious gases into the atmosphere. After that particular explosion a cloud of dust and gas drifted over Europe and darkened the sun for six months - before dispersing naturally. A tidal wave drowned 36,000 in the Java-Sumatra area. Nature's self-damage greatly exceeds any possible human contribution.\n\nThe fact is, however, that many people do take the 'greenhouse' threat seriously, and there is a cross-section of people in most industrialized countries who lobby continuously against the continued use of fossil fuels. Whether they are right, or merely alarmist, only time will tell. However, the fact that CO2 is on the increase is undisputed. Further, it cannot be disputed that the greenhouse effect is a possibility, even if remote. Nuclear war is also a possibility, though remote, but every possible step is taken by democratic countries to ensure that it will not happen. So, therefore, should every possible step be taken to reduce, even eliminate C02 emissions. There are already agreements in the USA and in Europe to cut down, or eliminate the use of fossil fuels by certain target dates.\n\nThe problem is that many countries are geared to fossil rather than nuclear power sources. Supplies of coal, and probably of oil and natural gas, are virtually unlimited. In Britain, most pits have closed down, causing wide-spread unemployment and much consequent human suffering. The coal lobby argues for emission cleansing and a compromise, both economic and environmental, may be possible. It would be cheaper, they argue, than to transfer entirely to nuclear power, whose installations may in any event cause health hazards and even the occasional disaster.\n\nOne optimistic sign is that proponents of all power sources agree that every generation has an obligation to preserve rather than exploit and pollute the planer. The worst culprits in the C02 saga are the old-fashioned heavy industry plants, such as those in the Ruhr, East Germany, and what was the Soviet Union, and the fossil-fuel fired electricity generating stations. Much of the old industrial plant has now been either modernised or superseded, and some countries such as France have moved over almost entirely to nuclear power. That, in my opinion, is the way forward.\n\nI do not believe that in any event the greenhouse effect would have the dire consequences which have been predicted. Yet it is a risk which we should not take. Modern technology has outgrown the use of fossil fuels, and apart from any possible dangers to future generations, the kind of world to which we commit them should be a clean, wholesome and beautiful world, as the Creator intended."

        "title": "Science can never provide a final answer or things, it is only a way of studying them' Do you agree ?",
        "content": "It is somewhat rash to assume that the only role of science is to answer the question 'How?' That was true in the days of Newton, when an educated person could have a grasp in outline of all human knowledge. Science then filled some of the gaps left by the deliberations of the philosopher and the theologian. Since then, it has far outstripped the contributions of both. Philosophy has degenerated into historical study and has no modern contribution to make. Theology has made no advance since the Middle Ages. The mantle of seeking answers to man's most fundamental questions has fallen on science. Whether these questions will ever be answered is an entirely different matter, but there is no other way ahead. So the topic-statement is fundamentally wrong.\n\nBy 'science', of course, is meant physics, which is fundamental to all studies - chemistry, biology, astronomy, indeed all macro and micro investigation. Physics has identified the laws which keep the universe in a state of equilibrium, and today seeks a unified theory to account for the space-time continuum necessary to the existence of that equilibrium, and the various other 'dimensions' beyond the four known which are postulated. So science moves towards the first philosophical question, 'Is there a unified theory, or are events ultimately random?' The answer to this question, if ever found, leads to the far more fundamental question, 'To what extent, if any, id God (the Creator) limited by his own creation?' The determinism of Laplace is now seen to be totally beside the point, and belongs to a mechanistic view of the universe which can no longer be sustained. Today, science is moving rapidly towards a 'chaos' theory which takes into account God's freedom of action plus the predictable results of laws already known to us, and also unpredictable events.\n\nIt is interesting that whereas the old scientific determinism either limited to the Creator's function or precluded the necessity of a Creator, or saw the Creator as totally detached from his creation, science today is begin forced into a belief in God. It also moves towards an acceptance that the scientifically unknown area, the God - mankind 'personal' relationship, is not only feasible, but likely. So science has become much more than 'a way of studying things'. Whether science can get beyond this point is a matter of conjecture. At a shrewd guess, science may well establish the possibility of 'eternal life', without being able to advance any more proof than could the old-time theologian. World religions have always said that such a belief depends on revelation and personal faith, and it may well be the Creator's intention to keep it that way. Faith, at least, would be greatly devalued if it could ever become the subject of scientific proof, whatever that may be.\n\nAnother answer, again stemming from the 'chaos' theory, is to the co-existence of good and evil. If there is a Creator, it follows that evil, at least as understood by humanity, must have been allowed to enter the world-scene at some point, but deliberately. Redemption from its consequences is another result, and history is the record of the struggle between the two forces. This says science, although leading to apparently random results, such as the little child stepping under the bus, or a death from cancer, is not random at all. All the same, it may stem from 'chaos', if this is seen in conjunction with a belief in the indestructibility of the human personality. So, say the faithful, 'God not only creates, He cares', and science today is not disposed to reject this possibility, the two approaches may converge on the same point. The processes of the universe are incredibly diverse and complicated, so why should the possibility of life after death be ruled out ?\n\nSuch a belief is an essential corollary to any concept of justice in the Creator's character. This is not justice merely in the sense of retribution. The early Jews believed the Creator got so fed up with humanity that He destroyed them in the Flood, but made a fresh start with Noah's family and the paired livestock' Divine justice is part of the concept of Divine Love, which postulated creation, with mankind as it's highest sentient form, as an expression of that love.\n\nSo the great world religions have this at least in common with modern science; there is a benevolent Creator who offers post-earthly life in some other dimension in exchange for the human response of kindness and observance of a revealed moral law. Justice, therefore, moves into an eternal setting.\n\nA religious scientist will find no essential disharmony between his or her faith and the scientific outlook. The great questions of life have satisfying, if unprovable answers. Some of the inadequacies of religion, such as early church doctrines of the cosmos, and strictly Bible-based theories of the origin of species, have been corrected by scientific investigation without detriment to the central core of belief.\n\nWhere science, or more precisely the scientist, inevitably falls short is in the application of an essentially simple moral code to the complex issues raised by scientific advance. Genetic manipulation is a case in point. The whole question of in-vitro fertilization is highly controversial.\n\nAll that is on the local scale. On the grand scale the Creator may, or may not allow the discovery of a unified theory of the universe which will provide answers to supplement, rather than displace the answers already provided by the higher religions."

        "content": "Good morning and warm welcome to the respectable judges, the opposition team, teachers and fellow students. First of all, I would like to convey my gratitude for being given the opportunity to represent the team that opposes the motion hand phones should be allowed in schools.\n\nThere are many important reasons why hand phones or cellular phones should not be allowed at the school premises. Although recent years have witnessed an \"explosion\" of hand phones in Malaysia, it would be a grave mistake to allow school students to bring them to school. Firstly, possession of hand phones distracts students from their studies. In fact, the main reason why the government has made it illegal for drivers to use hand phones while on the road is that it increases risks of accidents. Likewise, hand phone users at schools would be busy either sending short message texts (SMS) or calling their friends when they should be focusing on their studies.\n\nSecondly, hand phones are becoming cheaper to own. With the introduction of the prepaid system, many students even from poor backgrounds are able to own hand phones. Thus, I have personally witnessed how students compete to buy expensive handphones with the latest features. Video phones are the latest craze and there have been cases reported in the press whereby students have used the phones to film other students in compromising positions. They have in fact used the films to black mail the targeted student or sell them to VCD peddlers or even circulate them through the internet.\n\nThirdly, there are still many poor students who are unable to afford these phones which I would consider a luxury rather than a necessity. Hence, they face a tremendous amount of pressure to own hand phones, some even resorting to stealing or shoplifting. The undue pressure on them is unhealthy. Instead of feeling the pressure to perform better at school, students face competition to show off their wealth and possessions. This is leading to the spread of negative materialistic culture which our Eastern society abhors.\n\nFourthly, students have been apprehended using the SMS to cheat in the examinations. Many teachers have caught them red-handed using this latest hand phone technology to cheat and do well in the exams. Those who have not been caught continue to engage in this illicit method to further their academic achievements. Honest and ethical students feel undermined by this and many are prepared to throw in the towel and cheat as well. They fail to see the point of studying hard and competing fairly in the exams when others who do not put in any effort at all to earn high marks.\n\nSupporters of hand phones say that they should be allowed to be used in schools for emergency purposes. Though I concede that parents and students should stay in touch via phones in cases of emergency, it does not mean that handphones are the solution. School authorities must make the effort to install and make available more public phones. Phone use should be restricted to the morning or lunch breaks\n\nI am sure that most, if not all of you, would agree with my position on this issue. Hence, I would reiterate that hand phones should be banned from the school premises due to its negative effects. Thank you."

        "content": "Good afternoon and a warm welcome to the honorable judges, teachers, parents and dear friends. My topic today is titled Women are increasingly becoming victims of fashion. Before I proceed with my arguments, I would like to thank all those present for allocating time to be here as well as giving me the honor to state my position on this issue.\n\nAs many of us readily acknowledge, fashion plays an important role in our daily lives. Fashion relates to designs of clothes, hair styles as well as accessories such as jewelry, shoes and others that many see as shaping our personality. A person attending an interview stands a bigger chance of getting the job if he or she is dressed appropriately and fashionably compared to candidates who are dressed sloppily and in an old fashioned manner. Thus, it is important for us as humans to dress well and neatly and keep up with the latest fashion so as not to be branded as ultra conservative and traditional.\n\nHowever, having said that, we can become a victim of fashion when we lose control of our personalities. Our fashion sense then dictates our personality which means we have become slaves to fashion! Women are more prone to becoming fashion slaves and as a woman I can verify that. Many of my female friends compared to male friends are fashion crazy and spend a lot of money buying trendy, designer-brand and fashionable clothing. They always appear to be competing with each other. The poorer ones who cannot afford to spend such huge amounts of cash on clothing and accessories feel left out and eventually alienate themselves.\n\nI am sure the audience here would have noticed how pencil-slim or even anorexic the supermodels who model the latest fashion are. Most of them are actually very young or forced to maintain a skinny look to stay in the job. You would hardly see any curvy or models with a bit of flesh on them - they would immediately lose their jobs! Thus, the designs are getting tighter and women are forced to become thinner so that they are able to parade around with those skimpy clothes! In fact, I have trouble buying clothes from the malls because they are too tight for me and I am not even considered plump by most people. Hence, many young girls and women have fallen victim to fashion and developed medical condition associated with obsession with thinness such as anorexia and bulimia. There have been many cases, some fatal, of women consuming slim drugs that are not approved by the medical authorities. Even the late Princess Diana admitted to being a bulimic and famous seventies singer Karen Carpenter had died of anorexia nervous (though they are not considered fat).\n\nIt is important for women to feel confident with the way we look. Of course there are some of us who would want to shed a few pounds because we are overweight. The latter condition can lead to obesity and doctors say you can develop serious medical complications as a result of that. However, the only way we can ensure a fulfilling life is to eat healthily and lead an active life by exercising daily and donate our time and effort to doing good. We should channel our energy to becoming a better person and be less materialistic and obsessed with our looks. After all, life is short!\nI hope my talk has given all of you some food for thought. Thank you once again for your kind presence."

        "title": "The effects of War on Human Societies",
        "content": "Wars break out for various reasons. There are wars between countries or nations and within the nation. The latter is generally known as a civil war and can occur as a result of differences based on race, religion, socio-economic dissatisfaction among others. Whether wars are waged between countries (interstate) or inside the country between different sections of the communities, the effects are very damaging.\n\nAccording to experts, the main reasons or factors that contribute to wars are human greed for wealth and intolerance towards the other. Many world leaders in fact believe that the main reason America invaded Iraq was for its oil wealth. Hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians as well as American and Iraqi soldiers have been killed, injured or maimed. During the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq in the 1980s, there were more than 1 million casualty figures with millions injured. The attack on the American World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001 killed close to three thousand people and the subsequent reprisal on Afghanistan by American forces killed thousands of people in that country. World War 1 and World 11 combined have claimed millions of lives and in the African continent, tribal wars and regional wars continue to occur.\n\nThe civil war between the Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda tad claimed more than 3 million lives and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, more than 3 million people have died due to conflict between warlords. Many countries especially in Africa are still embroiled in tragic wars.\n\nThe effects of war are both physical and psychological. Human societies are deeply affected by wars as residential areas, public infrastructure, hospitals and the very basis of human existence are destroyed. Malaysia too experienced war when it was once occupied by the Japanese and people faced many hardships and challenges to meet their basis needs. The Japanese only surrendered when the unconventional weapons or better known as nuclear weapons were used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki which took thousands of lives and maimed as well crippled thousands of people exposed to radiation. Thankfully, most warring nations still use conventional weapons like grenades, rockets and otters which do not inflict that kind of damage as nuclear weapons.\n\nWars bring untold miseries as well as political and economic instability. People's lives and daily existence come under threat. It would be difficult to find jobs or live our normal day-to-day existence. Populations are displaced and have to constantly move about for security. What is happening in Darfur, Sudan is a dire reflection of the tragedy wars bring. Some are scarred emotionally and physically for life.\n\nThus, humans must avoid wars at all cost. The only way we can protect our lives and ensure stability in our country is to practice tolerance and respect for each otter. Or else, we too would become extinct like the dinosaurs!"

        "title": "You are the secretary of the Ethics Society of your school. The editor of the school magazine has asked you to write an article for the magazine on the issue of declining ethics among students and ways to reverse that.",
        "content": "Declining ethics among students\nSchool is a place where students learn the importance of ethics. Ethics relate to good behavior whereby one conducts one's behavior according to set rules and regulations which are based on moral values. The school also provides an environment for students to realize that unethical behavior would not go unpunished.\n\nHowever, statistics indicate that worrying number of students are behaving unethically. There has been a steady increase in number of students playing truant. The statistics compiled by our Ethics Society show that almost every day, a student plays truant. Most of these students skip classes and have been reported as loitering in shopping complexes and some in the company of bad crowd. There are also students who fake illnesses so that they would be excused from attending classes. One of our teachers has even reported a student forging a medical certificate so that he can avoid class to attend a concert!\nIn addition, discipline teachers in secondary schools complain that the number of school bullies has gone up. Incidents of physically weaker and younger students being terrorized and extorted for money are rising. Many of the victims have been beaten and in fact, a killing of student by a group of bullies from a religious school has made newspaper headlines recently. It is tragic that a fourteen year old boy lost his life due to bullying and ragging. The future of the perpetrators remain uncertain and most probably they would be sent to a juvenile detention centre. Their career prospects and future upon being released would be very bleak indeed.\n\nSchool authorities are also worried that vandalism is on the rise. School equipment in our very school has been vandalized. Some students even broke into our laboratory and stole some equipment. They have not been caught. Most school authorities also believe that vandalism and stealing is directly connected to students being hooked to drugs. This is another big problem among students. Declining ethics among students see many engaged in illegal and harmful activities.\n\nThus, urgent steps need to be taken to reverse this worrying trend. Schools should emphasize on civic education. Most students look at civics education as a subject rather than something that has to be applied in their daily lives. Teachers play an important role in encouraging students to behave ethically by demonstrating the importance of good and moral behavior.\n\nStudents should also be encouraged to get involved in community projects. Assignments and projects which involve the community must be introduced. These assignments should be graded. Hence, students would gradually learn the how to act in accordance to rules and regulation when interacting among members of society.\n\nPunishments for wrongdoing can act as deterrent. However, it should be reserved only for those caught for severe wrongdoing. Instead, counseling would be a better tool. School counselors play a vital role in drumming into the perpetrators on their acts are so detrimental to society at large and also to their own future.\n\nI am sure the school can halt the problem of declining ethics among students. The school authorities, especially teachers, have an important role to ensure only students of high moral caliber are produced."

        "title": "Write an article for a local daily expressing your views on why you think that schools should allocate more time for reading English books",
        "content": "Instilling the culture of Reading in schools\n\nAs a form five student studying at a local school, I must admit that we have a long way to go to making Malaysia a reading nation. At schools, I have found that most students only focus on studying and preparing for important examinations. Their reading is limited to schools books and hence, they possess restricted knowledge.\n\nAlthough the ministry of education had introduced the English literature component at the secondary level, the standard of English leaves much to be desired. I personally feel the prescribed novels and short stories are inadequate to increase the standard of English among students. Thus, I propose that schools allocate more time for reading English books, especially non-academic books such as novels and short stories which have literary values and merits. Books that can enhance one's general knowledge are plenty and should be suggested as part of a regular reading campaign.\n\nThe reading culture must be instilled at a young age. Admittedly some students speak and write well in English largely due to their parents encouragement who are either highly educated or encourage their children to read widely and extensively. A large number of students are not that lucky and those who come from poor background do not have the advantage of reading and improving their language skills. Thus, schools play a very important role in encouraging the reading habit among students. Merely emphasizing on reading is not enough. Schools must set the trend.\n\nAt least two free periods must be allocated for reading. Each classroom should be well stocked with books and students instructed to read at least three books in a week. An English language teacher or the existing English teacher should be appointed to discuss the books that students have read. The discussions can centre on the literary merits of the books as well as literary criticisms. Hence, in this way students are taught critical thinking skills and nurture the ability to think and discuss openly about a variety of issues. The school library should also be well stocked. Currently, school libraries mostly stock academic books. Very few acclaimed works of fictions by great writers such as VS Naipaul, Salman Rushdie, Timothy Mo and even classical writers such as Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, RL Stevenson, John Steinback, Vladimir Nabakov and local writers are stocked.\n\nStudents should also be given assignments related to the books they have been assigned to read, and not merely confined to the prescribed novels in the examinations. In this way, they would strengthen their writing skills and would not feel intimidated when they enter university and having to research books mainly written and available in English.\n\nIt is my believe that if the above suggestions are taken seriously and incorporated by the schools as part of the curriculum or even extra curriculum, the low esteem that overwhelming number of students feel regarding their English language ability will be a thing of the past. in fact, students themselves would eventually develop an interest in the language and would try their best to improve themselves without the prompting of school authorities and their teachers."

        "content": "It was a very cold morning as it had been raining very heavily the previous night. As my mother was feeling a little under the weather, my sister volunteered to drive me to school. I had overslept and as a result, was running a bit late for school. We got into the car hurriedly. The road was already congested with traffic. It appeared that everyone was late as well.\n\nMy sister was a careful driver and despite the fact I was already late, she refused to drive fast on the slippery road. I was lucky she was such a resolute and careful person because a few hundred meters away from the school, we witnessed a tragic accident. it all happened very quickly, as most accidents do. A car full of school children had made a left turning without signaling and as a result a school bus crashed into it. A few cars behind the school bus rammed into the bus as they could not brake in time and soon it became a pile up. The already congested road became jammed with vehicles that came to a crawl. I told my sister that I wanted to help the victims and she nodded silently. She brought the car to a halt not too far from the accident spot.\n\nThe scene that greeted us was something I would never forget. It left an indelible imprint in my mind to date. The impact of the accident had plunged three school children out of the car. The driver, a lady, lay lifeless on the steering wheel. I rushed to the children who were preschoolers. Two of them were seriously hurt and bleeding profusely from the head and hands. they were conscious although too weak to realize what had happened. One of them had her left hand severed and appeared unconscious. I think she was killed on the spot. In the meantime passers-by had called the ambulance and while waiting we tried as best as possible to help the victims.\n\nThe passengers in the school bus too were injured. I dashed into the bus and saw the driver laid slumped on the wheels. He had severe injuries on the head. While my sister helped him down from the bus, I told the injured school children to stay calm. Most of them appeared to suffer from minor cuts and bruises on their arms and bodies. it was really fortunate that nobody was badly hurt. By then a few adults had entered the bus and together we instructed the children to come out of the bus slowly. The children were crying and screaming for their parents and we had to hug them to keep them quiet.\n\nMeanwhile, two ambulances had arrived. A traffic police car was there too. Two policemen were taking down statements from eye-witnesses. The injured and the dead were whisked away to the hospital. My sister and I later gave an account to the police of what had happened.\n\nI was late for school. In fact, many drives were also late for their work. I informed my teacher of the accident and both felt that it could have been prevented if the drivers had been more careful. Innocent lives would not have been lost otherwise."

        "content": "A report on a study program in Osaka, Japan\n\nI was one of the 30 Indonesian participants who were selected to participate in a three-week study program in Osaka. Japan. The selection criteria were stringent. in fact I had to sit for an oral test. Luckily, I was coached by my teachers to prepare for it. The questions basically tested our general knowledge.\n\nThe program was organized and funded by Mombusho, the Japanese Ministry of education. the ministry sponsored our return airfare, food and provided us with a generous living allowance. we were grateful for their generosity as Japan is among the most expensive countries in the world.\n\nThis was my first ever trip to Japan. I have read about Japan in books and heard about their amazing culture from relatives who had visited the country. But nothing prepared me for the fabulous experience I had there.\n\nEach of the participants stayed with a Japanese family throughout the duration of the program. The family I had stayed with was very kind, generous and humble. I was treated like a prince literally ! Their son was studying at the same school that I was attached to for three weeks ad we took the train daily to our school. The public transportation is very efficient though rather expensive. I did not experience any traffic jams or congestions on the road.\n\nI was a splendid learning experience for me at the school. I picked up basic Japanese language skills which allowed me to converse with the pupils without much difficulty. The students there were ever ready to help me with studies especially with complicated mathematical problems. The average Japanese student is well rounded. He or she is also good at sports and able to think and write creatively and critically. Many of them also work pat time for pocket money. they are well mannered, well dressed, always polite and humble even though many of them hail from rich families. they treated me very well and of course whenever we go to the restaurants, they always treated me !\n\nOne very interesting and peculiar habit of them which I have acquired is bending the upper body to acknowledge the other. I think it is a good custom that shows respect for the other.\n\nThe food is another experience. Japanese like sea food and that explains why majority of them are slim and health. They also eat lots of vegetables and I actually picked up the habit of eating more vegetables from them. the tempura and other sea food dishes ere heavenly ! But their peculiar liking for raw fish and prawns is something I do not share ! However, I noticed there is an increasing number of western fast food restaurants which are gaining popularity among the younger Japanese. I guess it would not be long before they too battle obesity problems like us !\n\nI had experienced lots of memorable events there. There was once I was lost in a shopping complex. My Japanese hosts were in a boutique nearby and I could not find them. A kind elderly old man actually helped me to find them. In fact, he even treated me lunch despite my refusal !\n\nMy experience in Japan had been invaluable. My only hope is more Indonesian students would be given the opportunity to experience the culture and school environment there."

        "content": "An influential figure is basically a role model for a person to follow. Most people I know cite their parents or well known political leaders or successful business persons as influencing their perception of life. As for me, the most influential person in my life is a historical figure and he died many decades ago. The person is Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nBorn as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi into a strict vegetarian Brahmin family, Mr Gandhi has always been my role model despite the vast generation gap between us. Mr Gandhi's passion and commitment to uplift the conditions of the poor in India as well as heal the animosity between the Muslims and Hindus in India are highly commendable. In fact, there are no words to describe his achievements, except he was a great man. Thus, the Indians gave him the title \"Mahatma\" which means Great.\n\nMr Gandhi was very passionate about the ethical treatment of animals. He abhorred the killing of animals for food. According to him, a person's morality can be measured by his or her treatment of animals. Thus, I became a vegetarian at a young age despite parental objection. I fervently believed in his compassion for animals and like him I believe we can be called truly moral only if we learn to respect another life.\n\nAs a firm believer of non-violence, Mr Gandhi was upset with the hardships and discriminations faced by the Indians under British colonial rule. The people were treated like slaves and the British were not committed to bringing the Muslims and Hindus together. In fact, Mr Gandhi sacrificed his life for that. A radical Hindu nationalist gunned him down because of his unhappiness towards Mr Gandhi's compassion for Muslims. like Mr Gandhi, I believe that as human beings we must have shared ideals and religion should not be a barrier for unity. Thus, I joined the Multicultural and Multi religious Society in my school in which I am the secretary. We regularly hold programs that would bring students from different race and religion to participate in the activities and learn from each other.\n\nI would say Mr Gandhi has been very instrumental in my success now as the secretary of the Non-Violence Association. Though the post is only at the state level, I am proud of my achievements as I am still relatively young. The president of the society had approached me one day and offered me the post. He found out about my active involvement in societies at schools as well as the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n\nMr Gandhi was a small and rather fragile looking person. one can be deceived by his appearance as being weak and uninspiring. However, beneath that appearance, he is a firebrand. As a qualified and trained lawyer, Mr Gandhi even fought for the rights of the colored and African people in South Africa during the Apartheid period. He was jailed for his outspoken views that all of us are equals, no matter our color, race or religion.\n\nI do not think that Mr Gandhi had any weaknesses. Of course as a human being, he would have his own flaws but his impressive personality traits far outnumber and supercede his weaknesses.\n\nI would like to emulate Mr Gandhi and pursue a law degree and later specilize in human rights law. That would give me the necessary qualifications to join a non-governmental organization to fight for the rights of the down trodden and the discriminated."

        "content": "Every nation aims for a developed or advanced status. Only through development, the nation can progress and ensure the people enjoy a high quality and standard of living. Deforestation clears land of trees and bushes for development. Houses, industries, parks and public infrastructure are built on the cleared land. However, rapid deforestation as a result of greed for quick wealth is endangering both the wildlife and our health.\n\nIn Malaysia, the last decades since independence have witnessed massive deforestation and clearing of land for development mainly to build houses, condominiums, theme parks, industries among others. The purpose is to provide facilities and amenities to the citizens. However, this is causing major problems to wildlife as their habitat is destroyed. Our indigenous and unique flora and faun is also being threatened. Protected species such as tigers, elephants, rhinocerous and others are dying due to the destruction of their natural habitat. Many are forced to find new areas which may not be conducive to them. We often hear in the news how wild tigers and elephants encroach into human habitat and have killed or maimed humans while foraging for food.\n\nWe need to preserve more forests and reserve areas for these animals as sanctuaries. Aside from providing a haven for these creatures, preservation of forests is also good for us as trees provide fresh and health air. As human population increases, so does pollution. Forests and jungles provide natural protection against pollution by providing uncontaminated air and trapping pollutants.\n\nThe government and nongovernmental organization must collaborate to protect the green lung. the presence of factories and increase in number of vehicles on the roads have resulted in an unhealthy atmosphere. In addition Malaysia regularly suffers the haze problem due to forests fires from Kalimantan as well as open burning here. This combined with indiscriminate felling of trees have contributed to a host of medical problems among citizens of our country. Doctors confirm that there has been a dramatic increase in people suffering form lung and breathing complications. A major factor is the destruction of forests coupled with pollution.\n\nHence, it is vital that the government take immediate steps to prevent this situation from worsening. the state governments should designate more forest reserves and great care must be taken to relocate wild life if their habitat is being cleared for housing or industries. In fact, the government should reduce the number of licences being issued to developers and timber logging companies. They are the main culprits threatening the existence of wild life as well as our health. Fresh air provided by natural forests is important for human survival."

        "content": "Report on a seminar to ban sale of soft drinks and junk food\n\nOur parents and teachers always stressed the importance of eating fresh and nutritional food because they are packed with vitamins and have low fat and sugar content. In fact, a healthy diet ensures that we do not contract diseases such as heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure and others. Eating healthily also prolong sour lives.\n\nThe recent seminar I had attended also emphasized the same principles of consuming foods that are rich in nutritional value. The health experts who spoke at the seminar suggested that students and teachers should join forces to ban vending machines which sell soft drinks. they also urge us to make efforts to ensure canteens do not sell junk food.\n\nSoft drinks are spiked with sugar and have no nutritional content. The main ingredients of these carbonated rinks are water, sugar and colorings which are harmful to us over the long term. excessive sugar consumption contribute to diabetes which is life threatening. those who consume too much sugar too are at risk of becoming obese which can lead to medical complications. Thus, schools should only allow the presence of vending machines that stock health drinks such as soy bean milk, yoghurt drink, herbal teas and others. The latter has low sugar content but rich in protein and carbohydrate.\n\nJunk food or fast food such as burgers, fries, donuts, cakes, cookies, chocolates and savories are not good for our health. Junk food contains harmful additives and colorings. Thus, school canteens should not stock these food. Instead, canteen operators should be allowed only to sell rice, noodles, pasta, bread, fresh salad and other raw vegetables as well as fruits and juices.\n\nThe experts stress that only through healthy eating can we ensure students perform well academically. students in fact waste their parents' money buying food that provides zero health benefits. The link between eating nutritious food and performance in examinations has been well established. Junk food only makes a student lethargic as he or she is deprived of essential vitamins.\n\nThe health experts also suggested that the ministry of education subsidizes food costs at canteen so that students have access to quality food. It is a common knowledge that nutritionally rich food tend to be more expensive and thus canteen operators are reluctant to sell them. However, if the government provides subsidies to these operators as well as food coupon to make health food more affordable to students, it would be successful in creating a society which is health conscious."

I am glad you actually bothered to send me a \"snail mail\" instead of the more popular electronic mail !\n\nI am very sorry to hear of your mother's condition. You mentioned that she is recovering from chemotherapy as a result of breast cancer. it must have been a very traumatic experience for her as well as all of you. I know it is difficult to care for an immediate family member especially one that has suffered tremendously. Chemotherapy can be very debilitating and I am sure she has lost a lot of hair and not to mention regular vomiting and weakness. I feel honored that you wrote me for advice.\n\nThe efficacy of herbs and vitamins has long been established both by traditional and modern doctors. The benefits of these are tremendous especially for those who are recovering from a serious disease. even before the advent of modern medicine and surgery, humans have been using traditional medicine such as herbs and roots to treat sickness and diseases as well as cuts and bruises. As you know my sister is a homoeopathist and hence, my extensive knowledge of this subject matter ! In fact, many patients and even pet owners consult my sister for advice on herbs and traditional therapies.\n\nWestern medication has side effects and is ineffective for certain people. If you had consulted me about your mother's condition before, I would have advised you not to proceed with chemotherapy. the latter's side effects are known and it can be very damaging for an elderly person like your mother. However, all is not lost.\n\nMy advice for you is to approach pharmacist and traditional healers to identify appropriate herbs and vitamins for your mother. explain to them your mother's health condition and status and do not forget to mention that she had just undergone chemotherapy for cancer. However, I would strongly recommend that you consult your mother's oncologist first before buying the herbs and medicine. the doctor would have prescribed some western medication for her and there can be adverse side effects if you mix traditional medicine with modern pills. Nevertheless, if you feel the doctor's medicine is ineffective, I suggest you stop the medication and try the herbs and vitamins instead.\n\nPlease also feel free to contact my sister for advice. Her patients speak very highly of her and many have told me how homeopathy has produced better results for them compared to western medicine.\n\nI have to leave you here now. Do write or call me if you need further advice. send my warmest regard to your mother and the rest of the family. take good care of yourself.\n\nYour caring friend.\n\nMichael"

        "content": "Alcohol is the natural substance found in alcoholic drinks such as beers, wine, hard liquors and liqueurs. It is formed through the fermentation process. Alcohol can also be artificially manufactured and added into drinks. There are many types of alcoholic drinks sold in the market as well as illegal ones known as samsu. The alcoholic drinks are both locally manufactured as well as imported.\n\nExcessive alcohol consumption is unquestionably bad for one's health. Numerous researchers indicate that alcohol consumption on a regular basis destroys the liver and oesophagus. Thus alcohol advertisement in the print media and cinemas which encourages one to consume alcoholic drinks should be banned.\n\nAlcohol consumption also impairs one's ability to drive or concentrate on certain activities as the alcohol which enters the blood stream rapidly distorts one's coordination. In fact, police statistics show that drunk driving is among the major contributors to fatal accidents. many innocent lives have been lost as a result of irresponsible drunkards on the road. Alcohol advertisement portrays that those who drink are macho and manly. It indirectly presents the view that only man who drink are \"real man\" and those who don't are weaklings.\n\nThus, the number of alcoholics in this country has seen an exponential increase. To be sure, Alcohol Anonymous (AA) has reported that more and more people are seeking help for alcohol abuse. This attests tot he popularity of alcoholic drinks despite the high government taxes on these \"sin\" items. According to AA, alcohol advertisements play an important role in influencing particularly the young to pick up the habit.\n\nMore and more working women too are getting hooked on drinking. Instead of relegating drinking alcohol to social occasions, we se an increasing number of both men and women drinking alcohol excessively and regularly. Alcoholic drinks give a false sense of confidence and boldness. it is quite common to see those who had too much to drink behaving inappropriately as the alcohol looses one's inhibitions. In fact, many young female teenagers report of how their males friends introduce them to alcoholic drinks and force them to get drunk. In fact, it is quite common to hear of date rape as a result of this.\n\nThus, the media should be more scrupulous in terms of its advertising content. Advertisement is an important source of revenue particularly advertisements related to alcohol which generates huge sums of profit for the media companies. However, the media must be more responsible in how it sources its revenues. It has an important role to play in ridding society of its vices. It can begin by banning alcohol advertisements and instead run advertisements that shows the public the dangerous consequences of alcohol consumption.\n\nThe money spent on consuming alcohol can be diverted into better buying products such as health supplements and health food. The media should instead encourage these products to be advertised by offering an attractive rate.\n\nHence, it is clear that advertisements directly influence alcohol consumption. Hence, the ban on alcohol advertisements should be effected immediately. Too many families and individuals have been destroyed by this vice."

Ever since its inventions few decades ago and the subsequent introduction of the Internet, it has become an essential tool for many students and adults alike. Computer is used at work and even at schools which usually have computer laboratories.\n\nHowever, although computers are a great technological invention contributing tremendously to human kind, it is not necessary that each student should own a computer to be intelligent and smart. firstly, as mentioned above, most schools have computer labs which are accessible for students. thus, poor students who are unable to afford computers can utilise the facilities at their school or assignment and research.\n\nSecondly, research has shown that many students do not use the computer wisely. Most computers have internet connections that help students with research as it contains volumes of data. However there are students who use it to watch illegal and pornographic sites. some even download pornographic images and distribute it to other students. Thus, if students possess individual computers, they may be tempted to visit these sites as there is no supervision from school authorities. These smuts cannot be accessed via school computers as the sites are barred by school authorities. There is thus, better control and supervision of students at the school computer laboratories compared to students who own personal computers.\n\nIn addition, many cyber and internet cafes are sprouting in malaysia. It is relatively inexpensive to use their facilities. Thus, it is not necessary for students to own computers which are expensive and whose technology becomes outdated every year. Computers at the cyber cafes are constantly upgraded as it is patronised by the public and the latter is charged a fee. It is ridiculous to expect students to buy new and upgraded computers every year.\n\nFinally, there have been many complaints regarding plagiarism. Since the internet has mountains of information and data, many students download or copy the articles and submit them as part of their assignment. Thus, internet does not allow for creativity to flourish and students become too dependent on it. The conventional research is better as it forces students to visit the library and plough through the books to help them with assignments.\n\nThough there are arguments that can be advanced to support the advantages of having one's own computer, it is not necessary for a student to own one. There are many computer facilities which can be used for the purposes of research and assignment."

She has a unique voice and a very likeable personality. Ning Baizura is also an actress but I personally believe she is a much better singer than the former. I have many pictures of my favorite artist and I never miss any of her concerts just to catch a glimpse of her.\nTwo weeks ago, my friends celebrated my 17th birthday at a five star hotel. These are my inner circle of close friends who also happen to be very rich and lavish. thus, they invited me to usher in my birthday in style with an expensive buffer lunch. I agreed as I rarely get the chance to dine at the Hilton Hotel. In fact, it was my first dining experience in that luxury hotel known to be the favorite spot of the rich and the famous.\n\nWhile I was busy chatting with my friends surrounded by sumptuous food and delicacies, my friend, Sarah, tapped my hand urgently. Startled, I turned to her and she pointed at the direction of a table near a secluded corner. I almost dropped my fork. It was Ning Baizura! I was thrilled to note there were other famous celebrities at the table having drinks. My friends pestered me to approach her convincingly arguing that I would never ever get the chance of such a close encounter. I plucked up courage and approached the table very diffidently.\n\nShe flashed a smile. Gosh, she looked even more gorgeous in persona and elegantly dressed too! I smiled hesitantly. I suspect now she must have noted how nervous I was and quickly extended a handshake. I shook her smooth hands observing her beautifully manicured fingers. She had style ! I sat next to her upon her invitation and she quickly ordered a glass of orange juice for me. She then proceeded to ask some questions about myself. I told her briefly about my background and the reason I was there. she grinned widely and wished me \"happy birthday\" before placing her hands in the bag to withdraw an expensive looking pen. It was for me, birthday gift, for a unique person like me she said. I was overwhelmed with emotions.\n\nI thanked her profusely and Sarah who had quietly approached the table asked permission to have a group photograph. Ning Baizura obliged gracefully. My other friends had surrounded us by then and everybody shook hands with the great singer. After snapping a few shots, we thanked her. She was truly humble and pleasant character. she had to rush for a work out at the gym, she said. Before she left with her friends, she handed a visitation card and told me that I can call her whenever I want. She also told me that if I am looking for a modeling career after my studies, I should get in touch with her.\n\nI was floored and nodded happily. she waved us farewell before running towards a chauffer-driven Mercedes Benz. that must have been the happiest day of my life - catching my idol in person !"

I knew she did not believe that I had extra curricular activities every day and arrive home after 5pm. However, realizing she had little choice but to accept my explanation, she told me that dinner was in the refrigerator and to warm it up in the microwave oven. She had to rush for her night shift at the local clinic.\nEver since we lost our dad in an accident, my mother became the sole breadwinner. I was the eldest among the four siblings and it fell upon my shoulder to ensure that they become responsible adults. Aside from helping mother with the household chores, I regularly coach them in their studies. Thankfully, they are obedient children and never once did I have have to raise my voice or force them to complete their homework. But all of us missed dad tremendously. He was a model father and husband. Life was cruelly snatched away from him at a very young age of 40. It was a freak accident that killed him. He was walking towards his car parked at a construction site when a crane accidentally dropped a huge metal on him. He died instantly and mom had never recovered from the tragic incident.\n\nHowever, she managed to pull through for our sake and secured a job at the clinic. It was very tough on someone like her who had never worked before in her life. But money was scarce and there were five mouths to feed. Dad did not leave much behind. He never suspected he would die so young. we stopped dining out and had our meals mostly at home. we basically lived from hand to mouth. That's when it dawned on me that I had to do my part for the family. I knew mother would not agree but I threw caution out of the window and managed to get a part-time job at a fast food joint. I worked three hours a day and managed to bring home money so that my siblings and I can go out for occasional movies or meals.\n\nI am sure mother suspected something amiss. But she could not quite point the figure to the source of her suspicion. However, I was guilt-ridden and had to constantly reassure myself that contributing financially tot he family was the least I could to alleviate my mother's burden. One day, while I was busy serving the customers, I was startled to see mother standing opposite the counter waiting to place an order. She appeared perplexed and shocked at the same time. I took her orders and saw her returning to a table occupied by my siblings ! My supervisor who saw my worried expression and who knew about my family situation quickly volunteered to take over my duties. Slowly, I removed my apron and joined my family.\n\nMother was already crying and so were my siblings. She covered my hands with hers and told me that she was grateful for my help.

Thus, imagine my delight when my father told me that he was taking us on a holiday to Bangkok and from there to visit a remote tribe that lives about 200 kilometers north of the capital city. My father explained the tribe lives a secluded life and the members are cut off from the rest of the world in terms of their unique (some would call it weird, he said) cultural practices.\nThe Thai people are very friendly and their greetings are very similar to the Indians. They bring their palms together in a prayer-like position and bend their bodies a little as a way of welcoming and acknowledging you. I was rather overwhelmed by that and took to doing that during my entire trip there. we spent only two days in Bangkok before heading towards the remote village which was going to be the most exciting time of our lives, dad promised. we hired a cab to take us there in a journey that lasted more than four hours. It was an exhausting trip but well worth the trouble.\n\nThe tribe called Sam Ponh are very friendly and bold despite the fact they are still very traditional and conservative in their outlook. The ladies wear coils around their neck as a symbol of beauty. I was rather startled when I saw them in the marketplace selling vegetables, fruits and handicrafts. Their necks are elongated and according to one of the women I spoke to, the coil is worn around their necks at a tender age of two or three. The coils, made of steel, are removed when the ladies retired to bed. When asked whether they feel comfortable without them, the older among them smiled and said she did feel kind of naked without the coils!\n\nThe younger generation women of this tribe do not appear to appreciate this fashion and many have refused to wear them. the tradition in terms of dress code appears to be dying out though still alive among the older ones. One of the elderly women told us that in matter of decades, there would not be a single woman wearing the coils. Just like many other ancient customs, the process and invasion of westernization is slowly eroding these values, my father said.\n\nWe bought lost of handicraft and also dined in one of the restaurants there which looked more like a stall! The food was delicious and I noticed people of this tribe eat a lot of raw food. they did look healthy and fit. The Sam Ponh people still use many items that we consider ancient and outmoded like the spinning wheel to make textile.\n\nI truly appreciated their lifestyle and the fact they appear very contented with simplicity. They are not in the least materialistic, my dad said. However, it was my belief that sooner or later, the tribe would be forced to modernize and they would lose many of their age old customs.\n\nWe left the village the next morning and took a flight back to hometown from Bangkok. It had been a refreshing and splendid cultural experience for me."

        "content": "When I visited my brother who lives in Australia, he took me to a must-visit place -- the National Art Gallery. Selva knew I was an amateur painter and hence, loved all types of paintings such as still-life abstract and others.\nIt was the beginning of spring when I arrived in Canberra. The temperature was about 17 degrees Celsius and though my brother did not require warm clothing, I was all wrapped up -- it was just too cold for me coming from a hot country like Indonesia. The National Art Gallery was located at the heart of the city surrounded by fountains and beautiful rose gardens.\n\nThere was no entrance charge and the architecture was both impressive and unique. There were many types of paintings on display based on the painters' country of origins, ethnicity and even theme of the painting. The paintings on display were categorised into Asian, Aboriginal (native Australian painters) and Caucasian (white painters from Australia, America, United Kingdom and other western countries). I estimated least a thousand paintings on display, a far cry from our own Art Gallery in Indonesia. the painters ranged from the most experienced to the amateur ones. There was even a section where paintings by Art students were on display and I must say, the quality and the sheer imagination of the painters despite being mere students, were breathtaking.\n\nI was most impressed by the aboriginal paintings. There is a sad history that surrounds the natives of Australia. When the white settlers mostly from United Kingdom came to Australia in the 19th century, it was inhabited by natives. A violent confrontation ensued between these two ethnic groups. Most of the children of the aboriginals were forcibly taken away from their parents and brought up by white parents. the adults were taken to settlements where there was hardly any cultural inter-mingling. The children of the natives were known as the stolen generation named such because they were deprived of the opportunity to grow up with their family. Some of the paintings depicted this theme. They were heart wrenching which moved me to tears.\n\nThe paintings covered many themes such as landscapes during the colonial period, scenes of mountains, oceans and festivals among others. Since it was a public holiday, the gallery was crowded with students, parents and their children. It was amazing to see even small children appreciating such abstract paintings. The price of paintings almost made me faint. They ranged from AUS$1500 to a few million Australian dollars ! It was such a huge display of paintings that I was sure the government must have paid big sums of money to purchase these works of art. After three hours I was tired yet refreshed by the visit.\n\nWe later adjourned for tea and pies at a cafe located on the third floor of the building. I told my brother of my intention to contact some of the Australian artists for comments and display my own paintings which I had brought along. He told me that the Australian painters were very humble and helpful. I made up my mind to contact them the following day."

        "content": "Traffic congestions or traffic jams on our roads especially on the by ways and expressways are a common sight. Even in housing estates, one encounters traffic congestion or slowdown and thus, a trip to the local store located just minutes from the house can take up to half an hour due to this. according to the police, congestion also leads to other problems such as road rage and road bullies in addition to fatal accidents.\nThere are may ways we can help ease traffic congestions in our country. The main reason contributing to our roads being clogged up is the increasing number of vehicles, especially private ones, on the road. Most families nowadays have at least two cars. Thus, there has to be ongoing campaigns on the benefits of carpooling. Parents can make an effort to drive their children to work rather than helping him or her to purchase a car. Those with school going children should use school buses rather than sending them on their own. There is always congestion near schools as most parents prefer to send their children for reasons of safety or convenience. Thus, a regulation must be introduced that bans parents sending their children in private vehicles. They should be instead encouraged to use school buses.\n\nThe recent hike in petrol prices should be welcomed rather than criticized. Most people are able to afford cars not only because they are cheaper compared to say Thailand but also because petrol prices are relatively low. The increase in petrol prices by 30 cents a liter however, appears to have little impact in reducing traffic in major cities. Perhaps, the government should increase further the price of petrol to discourage people from spending idle time on the roads.\n\nAnother way to help our country overcome traffic problems is to increase the price of vehicles. The recent announcement of a drop in price of cars would only aggravate the traffic situation in our country. The government should take a cue from our neighbor country and introduce a steep levy on ownership of cars. It should at the same time make public transportation more efficient, effective and affordable. In our neighbor country, cars are very expensive because of the levy imposed on them but the traffic situation is much more manageable. The latter is mainly due to the fact there are less cars and most people use the MRT, buses and cabs which are highly efficient.\n\nIt can be a nightmare to be on the road during weekends. Most people either dine out or go shopping during the weekends thus, jamming up the roads. The government should impose a weekend levy or congestion levy on those who use private vehicles during weekends. it would discourage people from using their cars and instead use the public transport to arrive at their destinations. This would also indirectly reduce the accident rates.\n\nHence, with the above measures in place, I am sure our country would be able to overcome or at least reduce traffic congestions and accidents on the roads."

        "content": "A healthy lifestyle means maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet as well as engaging in sports or other fitness related activities. A healthy diet alone however is inadequate to ensure a healthy body as physical activity helps to keep one in shape and free of sickness and disease.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, only one in ten people exercise regularly and a majority do not follow a healthy diet. The main culprit is our penchant for junk food as can be seen from the popularity of fast food chains and other western eateries. even local foods such as fried noodles, friend rice and snacks and savories are laden with fat and calories. Thus, consuming this type of food on a daily basis can contribute to weight gain. Overweight and obese people suffer from many health complications such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and even cancer.\n\nHence, the emphasis on healthy lifestyle should start at a young age. Parents must urge their children to eat more vegetables, fruits, juices, wholemeal and wholegrain foods. Many parents, due to time constraint, usually find the easy way out by cooking two-minute noodles or heading towards the nearest fast food joint for  quick meal. They do not realize however that sets the stage for an unhealthy lfestyle for their children who quickly become addicted to such foods. Thus, parents can counter this problem by cooking or preparing meals that do not take up time such as cheese sandwiches, soup, stir friend vegetables or buy pre-packed meals from supermarkets which can be warmed up in the microwave oven.\n\nDining out usually involves eating heavily and unhealthily. Most of us are prone to ordering deep fried food and oily dishes as opposed to steamed or baked food. Thus, though eating out is unavoidable, parents of children and adults as a hole should order fresh food and foods that are nutritious and not laden with oil, fat or sugar. Once a pattern of healthy eating is established, it would be easier to carry through such a lifestyle and for the children to follow suit.\n\nSchool canteens must be urged to sell only highly nutritious food and drinks. Vending machines that sell soft drinks and drinks that are spiked with sugar should be banned. Hence, school going children would be exposed to healthy eating form young.\n\nDaily exercise is vital. In fact, schools should implement Physical education on a daily basis rather than twice weekly. Only the minority are actively involved in sports. Most students are sedentary and prefer to concentrate on their studies as they consider indulging in physical activities a waste of time. By enforcing regular exercise daily, these students would be exposed to the importance and benefits of exercise.\n\nMany parents and adults do not allocate time for physical activity. A large number of them work long hours and return home late thereby depriving themselves of the benefits of exercise. Parents must lead an exemplary life which can benefit their children by increasing awareness on the health benefits of exercising regularly. Bringing their children for walks in the morning or evening is a good start to achieve this goal. They should become members of clubs which have swimming pools and gym facilities. During the weekend, the family can strengthen their bond by adjourning to clubs for exercise and a healthy meal after that.\n\nIn short, leading a healthy lifestyle is a conscious decision. One can ignore that and lead a life that exposes one to many healthy hazards. it is important to recognize that a healthy living ensures a longer life span as well as a life free of disease and complications."

        "content": "Pets have become a common sight in many households. In fact, one would be hard pressed to find a household without pets such as fish, dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters and even turtles. In France dogs and cats are the most common pets.\nThere are many advantages and disadvantages of owning a pet. The latter plays an important role as companion to its owner. Dogs and cats in particular are considered very close to humans and have been domesticated for thousands of years. They no longer live in the wild but amidst human habitats. These animals can form very close bond with their human owners and in fact dogs are even known as men's best friend. Dog owners would tell you how their best friend would snuggle up close to them for comfort and follow them everywhere and know well their routines such as feeding time and the time when their owners return from work. Experts say that pets are very therapeutic and can even prolong the lives of human being, especially elderly folk or these widowed and living alone. Even young children and the recluse respond well to animals rather than their human companions.\n\nWalking one's dog keeps one in shape. Since these four-legged creatures need lots of exercise to keep them fit and healthy, most do owners have to allocate time daily to walk or jog with them. This not only provides the opportunity for pet owners to establish close contact with their dogs, it also force them to exercise and keep themselves fit in the process.\n\nApart from being a source of comfort and constant companion, a dog in particular would lay down its life for its master or mistress. There are countless stories of how dogs have warned their owners of an impending disaster such as fire, accidents, break-ins and eventually saved their lives. Dogs are also kept to provide security for the home front against intruders and robbers. Service dogs and sniffer dogs are used to extensively in the west such as America, United Kingdom and Netherlands among others. Service dogs such as Labradors and Golden Retriever are trained to assist the blind and elderly to help them with basic tasks such as crossing the street, answering the phone, collecting the mail and others. Sniffer dogs are used by the Customs Unit and the police force has a Police Canine Unit that has dogs specially trained to detect drugs and other dangerous substances like bombs.\n\nThe disadvantages of having pets relate mostly to responsibility of caring for them. Pet owners must discharge their duties responsibly by feeding these animals under their care with proper food, exercising them and ensuring they get medical treatment as well as the required yearly vaccination. There are many irresponsible pet owners who do not feed their dogs and cats, in particular, on time as well as ensuring these animals are taken for walks, bathed regularly and taken to the vet when they require medical treatment. We see, read and hear many sad stories of dogs and cats being abandoned as soon as the owner feels the animals have outlived their usefulness. Many are abused and ill treated.\n\nPet owners must ensure the surroundings are kept clean by collecting and disposing of animal waste properly. There are many complaints we read in the newspapers of how neighbors are exposed to the stench from animal waste as well as dogs being chained up for long hours and hence, bark incessantly creating nuisance and discomfort in the neighborhood.\n\nHence, there are more advantages than disadvantages of owning a pet as the animal plays an important role in providing companionship and comfort for the owners."

        "content": "Schools play an important role in imparting knowledge and producing individuals with high moral and ethical values who contribute to our country's development.\nHowever, there have been accusations that Asian schools are not churning out well-rounded individuals. The main culprit they say is the education system which is heavily exam oriented and although students excel academically, they are not good in sports or extra curricular activities. even straight As students are considered only paper smart lacking common knowledge or even skills-based knowledge. Thus, schools play a vital role in ensuring its products are not only academically well qualified but also confident, intelligent and have multiple skills.\n\nThe most important step schools should take with the cooperation of the Education Ministry is to place less emphasis on scholarly achievements and examination grads. Currently, due to heavy stress on examination results, many, if not all, student study to excel academically rather than have a balanced approach to studies. they study had and attend tuition classes so that they are able to get straight As in all the subjects. This leaves them little time to indulge in extra-curricular activities or sports. Thus, a markedly different way of grading and assessing students should be adopted like in the West. In order to produce well rounded individuals, grades should be given for assignments, extra curricular activities as well as involvement in sports. Ideally, only 50% of marks should be allocated for examination and the rest for participation in non-academic activities. This would produce students with a innovative, intelligent and creative personality as progression in school would not be based solely on examinations.\n\nIn addition, a system should be introduced to make it compulsory for students to volunteer with community-based organizations such as orphanages, centers for the disabled and other social non-governmental organizations. Assignments related to involvement in these organizations can form part of the examination system. Thus, students will be compelled to participate in various kinds of extra curricular and sports activities, under the guidance of their teachers of course. That would ultimately enable them to acquire people's skills such as communication and writing skills through the ability to interact with others and engage in stimulating discussions.\n\nStudy environment can be made less mundane and monotonous by introducing outdoor learning experience. More emphasis on outdoor learning activities rather than those confined to classroom activities should be made part of the regular teaching method. Students thus, will acquire interest in their studies and would be able to expand their general knowledge Schools would stop churning out \"book worms\" and diffident students. Rather, this novel approach would produce students who are smart, intelligent, bold and inquisitive.\n\nIn all, the task of producing well rounded students and hence, individuals lay heavily on the shoulders of the education ministry and teachers. It is the step in the right direction towards creating a generation that is inquisitive and smart. these individuals can then contribute tremendously to our nation's development and standing in the world."

        "content": "Indiscipline among students is one of the major problems faced by schools today. Gangsterism in particular has become a menace due to its violent nature. Gangsterism involves bullying, extortion and even physical assault. The victims are mainly fellow students and there have been a few cases in the Philippines where the act of bullying and assault had been fatal.\nIf I am the discipline teacher, I would first undertake to study the extent of the problem in my school as well as the reasons why students would get involved in gangsterism. I would then haul the bullies and suspected gangsters in the school to determine further the reasons behind their individual behavior.\n\nStatistics and studies on gangsterism indicate most student gangsters hail from poor backgrounds or broken families whereby they lack attention and love from the family members propelling them to behave in such a manner. Poor students become gangsters as a means to gain extra cash by extorting money from other students. Those who are a product of broken families normally indulge in these kind activities to seek attention and as a outlet for their frustration and unhappiness.\n\nThus, by engaging in a discussion with these gangster students from my school, I would be able to find out which category they belong to. I would then proceed to advise them on the dangers of their behavior which could land them in jail or in correctional institute for juvenile delinquents. If this method does not work, I would then engage the assistance of inspectors from the local police station to give regular talks at our school on why gangsterism is a crime and the penalties faced by the perpetrators.\n\nA school-wide campaign would follow suit on how students and teachers can tackle the problems of gangsterism. the campaign would involve talks by former gangsters and reformed criminals who resorted to bullying and violence to achieve their goals and how that in turn has affected their lives and their families. Students would then be required to take a pledge not to resort to such behavior even if they face severe pressures from other students or as an easy way to make money from others.\n\nInstead of caning or punishing gangsters, I would counsel them and use the soft-handed approach. These facing financial troubles who resort to extortion as a solution would be given assistance pending their promise not to repeat such behavior. These who engage in gangsterism to seek attention would be sent for professional counseling. Students facing constant pressure to become part of gangs, would be exposed tot he dangers of such behavior and encouraged to report, without fearing for their lives, to the school authorities. I would collaborate with the other teachers to expose students to fun-filled activities and outdoor learning experience to make school a more exciting place. This would prevent bored students from contemplating joining a gangster group to seek excitement and acceptance.\n\nThus, I hope with all these measures in place, the problem of gangsterism would be dealt with effectively and efficiently."

Environmental pollution is the biggest challenge facing humanity as pollution of the air and sea directly affects our lives. The human existence can come under threat if pollution level increases to hazardous level. In fact, some country frequently faces the haze-related pollution yearly due to wild fires in their neighboring country aggravated by the practice of open burning in our country. Factories too are culprits as they emit pollutants and hazardous waste substances either into the air or into the sea. The increasing number of vehicles which emit the dangerous carbon monoxide and green house gases add to the danger we face from pollution.\nThe earth's atmosphere is constantly being exposed to hazardous materials due to rapid development and human activity to advance their lives. The industrial west like America and Europe is the biggest culprit as they are the world's biggest polluters.\n\nStudents can play a ole in helping to reduce pollution and create a healthy atmosphere for us to engage in activities without fear for our health. They can contribute to reducing the emission of harmful gas into the air by either walking or cycling to school. Most students go to school either by car or school bus and the carbon monoxide released by these vehicles is very harmful when breathed in large quantities. it can even cause deaths. Those who stay at a distance from their school should either car pool or use the services of a school bus. This can drastically cut down emissions from vehicles especially during peak hours.\n\nOpen burning is another major source of air pollution. Burning rubbish openly releases many harmful chemicals and gases and thus, should be avoided altogether. many adults themselves are unaware of this. It is the duty of students to spread this awareness and even set an example by tying up garbage or garden refuse in garbage bags to be collected by council workers.\n\nSmoking too pollutes the atmosphere. The number of smokers in the country has not declined despite nation wide campaigns against smoking. Smoking among students has become a trend and thus, it is vital that these students top smoking to ensure an environment free from cigarette smoke. The later causes cancer and heart diseases among others.\n\nIn addition, students can play their role as responsible citizen by reporting to authorities if they come across vehicles spewing out smoke on the roads or factories emitting smoke and hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere. Immediate action would stem this problem as there are many factories use the river as an outlet to channel their dangerous waste materials.\n\nHence, each student has a role to play in reducing pollution. The latter is already contributing to global warming which threatens our existence in the not-too-distant future. The understanding of the dangers of pollution has to start at a young age and students especially are well poised to live a life that is pollution free as well as spread awareness on the importance of a safe future."

In Laos, the concept is rather alien as may look at volunteering as rendering help without expecting payment in return as a waste of time and effort. However, there are many benefits one can gain through volunteering.\nWhen one volunteers to help out someone such as a friend, teacher or parent, one is immediately seen as selfless and helpful. When you help a teacher to clean he classroom or get involved in cleanliness campaign at the school level or other community projects, your standing would be elevated. Teachers and adults would look at a young person who volunteers his or her time for a certain activity as mature, responsible and deserving of respect.\n\nIn addition, volunteering with an organization such as orphanages, community centers and other non-profit organizations such as the Society for Prevention of Cruelty towards Animal and other welfare organizations allows you to interact with society at large. In addition to helping these organizations carry out their duties, you not only gain experience but can learn a variety of skills. This is especially beneficial for students. Even though one is not being paid, through volunteering time, effort and skills one would learn more than what money can buy. You can learn to be bold, assertive, independent as well express your opinions and gain communication and interpersonal skills. In Laos, this is lacking. Thus, the responsibility falls on the teachers to encourage students to volunteer their times not only for school activities but to spend their leisure in helping out community-based organizations.\n\nVolunteering also allows one to become more mature at a relatively younger age. When you are exposed to volunteering at a young age be it at the home front, school or their organizations, you would learn the importance of responsibility in carrying out your duties to the best of your ability. Embarking on volunteer activities would enable one to learn survival skills such as responsibility, ability to express ideas as well as the importance of hard work and diligence.\n\nVolunteering also exposes one to many interesting ideas and issues. For example, if you volunteer your time regularly at a charity organization, you would learn how the organization works and the importance of team work, and other essential ideas related to the day-to-day operations. of the organizations. You will not only enhance your general knowledge, but also learn how to deal with problems, challenges as well dealing with different types of personalities.\n\nThus, there are many benefits to be gained by volunteering. Students in particular should be allowed to participate in volunteer activities to enhance their knowledge as well learn useful interpersonal and organizational skills."

The influence of western ideas and culture is widespread namely in dressing, mannerisms, food, books, entertainment and even education. However, western culture can also corrupt a person morally especially young people.\nThere are many aspects of the western culture that are deemed not suitable for Asians namely its sense of fashion, moral values regarding pre-marital sex, pornography and wild entertainment. The young mind is easily influenced and corrupted. When one enters shopping complexes, restaurants and other public places, the first thing that catches one's attention is the way the young dress. Many follow the fashion nuances of the west with little regard to Asian values and perspectives related to modesty. Many young teenagers can be seen clad in low cut tops, low waist jeans and in short very revealing outfits. They mimic western style of clothing as well free intermingling of sexes.\n\nThis situation has led to many undesirable consequences. Chief among them is the practice of free sex among students. The Asian values of saving oneself for marriage or until the right person comes along is discarded and considered archaic. Since many teenagers lack awareness on safe sex, they expose themselves to unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS, gonorrhoea, syphilis and other life-threatening disease. WE read newspaper reports almost on a daily basis on how unborn babies are being dumped in toilets, houses of worship, hospitals and other public places. There are yet many students who upon finding themselves pregnant resort to abortion. The later can be fatal if not done by professional gynaecologists. Many charity organizations report of teenagers coming for advice when they find themselves jilted by their boyfriends. There are also many reports on teenagers contracting STDs and other dangerous diseases.\n\nAnother strong influence of westernization is in the arena of entertainment. Teenagers find it exciting and fulfilling when they visit video arcades, discotheques, nightclubs and other places of entertainment. Thus, they expose themselves tot he morally deficient elements at this kind of places. Apart from picking up bad habits such as smoking, drinking alcohol and other behaviors unsuitable for people of such a young age, these teens also expose themselves to abuse and exploitation. Many young people have admitted to being sexually abused this way by friends or strangers who spike their drinks with drugs only to awake next morning in the bed of strangers.\n\nThus, though not all elements of westernization corrupt young people morally, the latter seem more susceptible and even naive with regards to western influence in the arena of entertainment, fashion and behavior. Many teenagers demand unfettered freedom without realizing the consequences o their behavior which brings harm to them. In their desire to be westernized, they accept those elements which provides pleasure but places them at great risks."

Money is an important exchange for food, shelter and clothing.\nMany people believe that money si the root of all evil. But contrary to that, I believe and agree that money is the key to human happiness. it has become indispensable in our lives when humans began using money for exchange of goods and services instead of he barter trade which was popular hundreds of years ago. Humans work to earn an income that would enable them to bring food to the table, clothe themselves as well as indulge in pleasures that can be obtained only through money.\n\nWhen we are able to afford goods and services, it inevitably grants us a lot of happiness, satisfaction and stability in our lives. In many poor countries such as Africa, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and others, millions live in misery due to extreme poverty. They are deprived of happiness, dignity and a sense of direction n their lives as they live from hand to mouth and their future is at best uncertain. Thus, it would be foolish to think that money causes distress, and is the root cause of immorality and evil behavior. On the contrary, most of us earn an income through legal means which allows us to maintain a good standard of living. it enable us to travel for holidays and have access to good food, medical facilities, and a lifestyle that grants us much happiness and satiety. Many parents admit that they slog at work so that thy could provided comfort and stability to their offspring. Money especially comes in handy when a family member is stricken with a disease and cash is needed for treatment.\n\nUnhappiness results when we are denied the above. Many families struggle to make ends meet and the lack of money almost inevitably sows seeds of unhappiness. They are exposed to continuous bickering, quarrels and ultimately, misery.\n\nThere are of course those, due to greed for more material wealth, resort to illegal means to become rich quickly. They commit robberies, murders and cheat to get ahead in lives. However, this does not grant them the happiness or the peace of mind. In the case of robbers and murders, the constant threat by the law enforcement authorities closing in on them, creates jitters and a life full of uncertainties and fear.\n\nHence, money would always be looked at as the most or at least one of the most important keys to happiness. it has become a part of what defines us as human beings as it allows us to live a life of dignity, happiness and contentment."

One would not be able to earn an income becoming a burden to family and friends (though the latter are usually encouraging and supportive).\n\nMany cancer patients and others who suffer from debilitating sickness spend huge amounts of money for treatment. In addition to that, they have to undergo very painful medical procedures. A cancer patient for example typically has to undergo chemotherapy and radiotherapy which have undesirable side effects such as vomiting, hair loss, weaknesses and other unpleasant symptoms. Despite all that, there is no guarantee that one would survive such sickness.\n\nThus, our good physical and mental well being provides us the opportunity to enjoy life without any hindrances. The \"wealth\" one derives from good health is actually a life free from circumstances that afflicts us in some way and hence, affects our happiness and comfort.\n\nThere are many people in this world who are extremely wealthy but due to poor health, they are unable to enjoy their material coins. Their daily performance is hampered by physical and mental incapacitation and hence, they can be actually considered \"poor\". A materially poor man or woman but rich in terms of health actually can be termed as \"wealthy' as he or she is not hampered by sickness. the later does not have to fork out money for treatment and can enjoy a peaceful and blissful life.\n\nIn short, good health si wealth as no amount of money can cure one of terrible sickness. Good health ensures a fulfilling and enriching life."

        "content": "Vitamins are also known as supplements. Nowadays, one can get many types of vitamins as well as herbs in capsules or tablets from the pharmacies, clinics or even the supermarket. There are basically two types of vitamins : natural and synthetic. The latter is manufactured in laboratories whereas the former is extracted from natural sources. Supplements have become very popular since the last few decades both in the East and the West.\nAlthough most physicians and specialists recommend the intake of vitamins only if the person is suffering from certain deficiency in his or her diet, it has become almost a trend for most people to consume vitamins on a regular basis. There is widespread belief that vitamins promote good health, aids in weight loss and improve complexion among others. There are others who believe that certain vitamins help prevent cancer and other dangerous diseases.\n\nThe multibillionaire dollar vitamin industry is a rapidly expanding one as increasing number of people including children and teenagers consume vitamins to enhance their health and general well being. there is some truth tot he belief that vitamins form an essential part of a person's diet. This mainly springs from the fact that most of our food (except foods such as lettuce, fruits and juices) are cooked using heat and hence loses its properties. Not may of us eat salads and raw vegetables such as carrots, cauliflowers, broccoli and leafy vegetables. Hence, overcooking or even steaming these vegetables which employs extreme heat results in us eating food which have lost its nutritional content.\n\nIn addition, most of us also tend to eat more refined than complex carbohydrates. The former is more popular such as polished rice, pasta, white bread and others which have almost no nutritional benefits. polishing is a process that strips carbohydram of fiber and other essential vitamins. Hence, vitamins provide these important elements that are missing in our diet. Unlike in the west, Asians generally do not consume much fresh vegetable or fruit juices and most of our drinks here are spiked with sugar. Many of us also tend to drink copious amounts of soft drinks which can cause diabetes and other health complications. young people too tend to avoid or reduce vegetables and fruits in their diet, preferring junk food or fast food.\n\nHence, vitamins play a role in ensuring we maintain a balanced diet. supplements provide the essential vitamins lacking in our meals due to our unhealthy eating habits."

        "content": "Disability refers to the condition of being physically or mentally disabled or challenged. The physically disabled are those physically handicapped such as the crippled, the blind, the mute as well those having some form of physical deformities. Those mentally disabled suffer from mental retardation such as cerebral palsy and down syndrome among others.\nThere are thousands of disabled people in Asia and many face discrimination on a regular basis which takes many forms. Very few employers hire disabled people as the latter is considered more a liability than an asset in the organization. However, these fears are completely unfounded. Many a blind and hearing impaired persons have contributed tremendously to organizations they are attached to. In fact, there are many cases of how disabled personalities have done themselves proud by being their own bosses. Their success stories include those how run their own business such as shops, restaurants, handicraft centers in addition to those who have become teachers and professionals through sheer hard work and determination. Many have even become successful sports persons participating in Paralympics Games and winning medals. It is a folly to think that only physically able people can make one's country and nation proud.\n\nHowever, those who are successful are only a handful. Since many encounter discrimination, they tend to alienate themselves from society as they feel unwanted and rejected, Our mind set has to change to accept these people and integrate them into our society.\n\nThe government should introduce steps to ensure all the disabled people have access to education and employment. In fact, special legislations and laws ought to be introduced that makes it compulsory for employers to allocate a certain number of jobs for the disabled. The Welfare department too should provide financial assistance and medical access to disabled persons who come from poor backgrounds.\n\nOngoing campaigns to educated society on the need to accept and live in harmony with the disabled, rather than treat them as burdens or pariahs, need to be launched. In fact, the awareness should start from a young age. Instead of setting up special schools for the disabled, the government should institute regulations that abolish such schools and the disabled children sent to regular schools. this would enable the regular students to understand and accept their peers despite the latter being obviously disadvantaged. the disabled children too would not suffer from low esteem or even feel embarrassed mixing with regular children.\n\nIn addition, most of our public infrastructure, public transport and government buildings are not disabled-friendly. There has to be a concerted effort to ensure the disabled have access to these places and not feel hampered in anyway.\n\nThus, it is high time that we accept the disabled as an important component of our society. Despite their handicap, they play an important role in our lives and at the same time the need our respect, acceptance and understanding."

        "content": "Religion plays an important role in the lives of majority of human beings. Humans compared to animals or plants are endowed with a sense of spirituality and yearning for a close contact with our creator. Irrespective of our religious background and faith, religion is considered an essential part of our lies as a source of inspiration, morality, and comfort and provides solace during times of trouble or grief.\nHowever, although religion provides a moral code on how to live a peaceful existence and helps one to deal with problems, it can be misused. In fact most of the troubles in the world stem from religious fanatism or extremism. Religious fanatics take their religious ideology to extremes and in their desire to propagate the teachings of their faith and ensure all the religious principles are adhered to, they resort to violent methods. The bombing of the World Trade Center in New York in 2001 is a perfect example as well as the killings of Muslims in Gujarat, India in 2002 ad the Bali bombing in that same year. Thousands of innocent lives were lost in these tragedies.\n\nDespite religion teaching tolerance, acceptance, good deeds and moral values, these fanatics hijack their own religion for personal ends. Religious fundamentalists are to a certain extent irrational as they defy universal values of respect, freedom of belief and other fundamental human rights. it is almost an impossible task to encourage them to think about the rights of others -- all they care about is to achieve their goals through killings and destruction. There is little respect for other faiths and human values as they consider the former as infidels who deserve \"God's\" punishment.\n\nReligion too can be abused. many so-called religious leaders have exploited religion to their own ends and the sad irony is that many of us have fallen victims to such irrationality. In multicultural and multi-religious nation, there is a vital need for them to understand, accept and practice tolerance vis a vis other faiths. Thus, it is very important that we inculcate respect for other faiths and do not stray into fundamentalism which would ultimately destroy the harmony in the country.\n\nChildren should be exposed to the multi faiths in the country. They should be encouraged to learn about other religions, their principles and commandments. This would to an extent allow the younger generation to appreciate various beliefs that exist in the country. the government too must play its part. Any form of religious extremism should be resisted and those caught inciting religious hatred put behind bars."

        "content": "Friends are very important in our lives. Friendships are easily formed when we are young and do not demand too much out of it. According to studies and research, humans tend to form highest number of friendships at kindergarten and primary level. However, one tends to have less friends as one grows older and wiser. This is because we realize there are good friends and bad ones.\n\nThe saying that a friend in need is a friend indeed is very apt in this scenario because good friends are those who are reliable and trustworthy. at a younger age, our demands are not too high regarding friendships as we rely mostly on our parents, siblings and relatives for important things. The friends we formed at this age are merely considered playmates rather than companions and confidants. Thus, our expectations of them are not high.\n\nMore serious friendships are formed when one enters puberty and achieves certain level of maturity. the latter allows one to forge fellowship with those who share the same interests, passion as well as similar moral and religious values. Thus, it is not surprising to observe that in some Asian country, mature students at the upper secondary level have friends of the same ethnic and religious backgrounds. At the university level, it is even more apparent. Even the Ministry of education has voiced concern over this phenomenon where polarization is prominent. The Indians, Chinese and Malays hardly mix with each other and are seen usually in the company of their own kind.\n\nOne of the main reasons for polarization among university students is that as they reach a certain level of maturity, common binding factors such as religion, customs and traditions play important role in selection of friends or mates. In addition, since majority of these students come from rural backgrounds where there is not much cultural interchange, they feel rather awkward to forge friendships with students of other races. However, this does not mean the students are racist or suffer from superiority complex. Thus, the university should introduce more programs that allow cultural and religious mixing and understanding of the other.\n\nNevertheless, in the working world, a different scenario prevails. One finds Indians, Chinese and other races forging stable and long lasting friendships. This is most probably due o the fact that to be productive in one's work, one has to believe in team work. The latter actually enhances the bond between the workers and eventually long lasting friendships are formed. In fact, this situation has even led to many inter racial marriages between the three major races. the products of the intermarriages are very unique as they have friends and relatives from both ethnic backgrounds."

        "content": "Media refers to mass media such as broadcast media, print media and the web media. Television and radio are considered broadcast media while newspapers, magazines and journals are known as print media and internet news, the web media. The media is an important source of information through its news segments, entertainment and allows for exchange of ideas, suggestions and comments.\n\nConsumers nowadays have a variety of media outlets compared to a few decades ago. The advent of the Internet and services provided through it, has enabled many of us to gain access to instant and a variety of news and entertainment. In fact, the presence of Internet also has led to creativity among the young consumers with the latter setting up personal websites, blogs and others. It has inadvertently led many students to take advantage of the prevalence of information by copying and plagiarizing writings from the internet news. While the internet has been hailed as the most important advances humankind has made in the 20th century, it is nevertheless open to abuse and exploitation that presents danger to humans.\n\nHowever, although most of us get our news through the media as many of us have little time to read books or journals, the news presented to us can be biased and one sided. During the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by the United States and its allies, casualty figures of their military personnel were highlighted and hardly any news on the figures for Iraqi civilians and its military personnel. News reported on websites appears more reliable and transparent though one has to be careful about the accuracy of the facts reported. the media news too can misrepresent information to serve the objectives of certain people or authorities in power.\n\nIn many Asian nations, there are limits to press freedom. Although the media is allowed to present news and its views as well as perspectives, it is barred from providing news that can potentially create unrest and violence. The government has instituted the Official Secrets Act and Internal security act that allows it to detain anybody including those working in the media for inciting racial or religious violence. However, there is still a degree of freedom in these countries' press compared to other more conservative countries. we have access to news from all around the world and readers are invited to send their views and contributions to be published in the media.\n\nThe media is not only an important source of news and opinions but also entertainment. Most young people usually turn on the television for movies, MTV and other entertainment programs. the adults however, prefer news and more educational programs.\n\nThus, the media plays an important role in our lives as we cannot envisage a life without the daily reporting of national, regional and international news. It would be like returning to the Stone Ages. However, consumers must ensure the news reported in the media is accurate and not one-sided by looking at its contents critically and voicing their views on certain issues."

        "title": "Examinations — good or bad ?",
        "content": "\"Examinations\" - This is a word that causes sleepless nights, a word can change a cheerful person into a nervous wreck. So, what are examinations, and how can they be any good?\n\nAn examination can be defined as a detailed inspection or analysis of an object or person. For example, an engineer will examine a structure, like a bridge, to see if it is safe. A doctor may conduct a medical examination to gauge whether a patient is healthy. In the school context, it is the students who take the examinations. These are usually a series of comprehensive tests held at the end of each term, year or, in the case of public examinations, after a few years.\n\nOne of the main purposes of school examinations is to improve the quality of education. From the results of the examinations, the teachers and planners of the curriculum will be able to gauge the extent to which the students have acquired the knowledge and skills of the course material. This would, first of all, provide an evaluation of their teaching methods, so they can improve them, if necessary.\n\nExaminations are also used as a yardstick for measuring the capability of the candidate, for further education or employment. For example, examination results are the main criteria when selecting students for entrance into universities. It is assumed that the examination results would indicate whether or not the student will be able to handle the course. In the case of employment, it is felt that the examination results will indicate whether or not the job seeker has the skills or intelligence to handle the job.\n\nHowever, does the school examination system provide an accurate yardstick of the candidate's ability? Albert Einstein, at the age of 16, took the entrance exam to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, but failed and so was rejected by this elite school. Yet, Einstein went on to develop the theory of relativity and quantum theory, winning the Nobel Prize in Physics at the age of 42. Other examples of famous achievers who failed in school examinations would include Winston Churchill, Thomas Edison and Bill Gates.\n\nOne may also question whether the present examination system results in better teaching in schools. In fact, some teachers are so pressured to produce good examination results that they are forced to practise poor teaching methods. They may race through the syllabus, ignoring the fact that the weaker students have not grasped some of the concepts. Some other teachers may concentrate on popular examination topics, ignoring the topics which are rarely tested in the examinations.\n\nPressure to succeed in examinations may also be detrimental to the students. They may be so filled with anxiety and stress that they do not enjoy their school years. They may be studying only to get good examination results, rather than a rounded education. Some of the weaker students, who cannot seem to achieve good examination results, may lose interest in their studies. In extreme cases, students may be so frustrated or disappointed in their results that they may consider ending their lives.\n\nIn conclusion, I realise that examinations are necessary and useful in many areas of our lives. However, within the school system, they should be given less emphasis or conducted in a different way. Furthermore, educationists, employers and students themselves should be reminded that examination results may not provide the best assessment of an individual's talents and capabilities."

        "content": "A popular saying goes, \"Marriage involves three rings: the engagement ring, the wedding ring, and the suffering.\"\n\nIf it is commonly felt that marriage is so difficult, why do most people wish to get married? Probably, the instinct to find a mate is inherent in human beings; and I am no exception. Somehow, I believe that there is someone out there who was made specially for me, and, once I find him, we will fall in love, and get married; and only then will I feel complete. So, how will I recognise my Mr Right? What qualities should I be looking for?\n\nFirst of all, I am not looking for \"Mr Tall, Dark and Handsome\". Character is more important than looks. I cannot deny that I am attracted to good-looking boys, but marrying solely for physical attraction will probably lead to short term pleasure but life-long regret. I have also noticed that handsome boys are often vain and arrogant, which I find most unattractive. One of the main things that I admire in a man is humility. Such a man will not boast about his wealth, intelligence or achievements, but, instead appreciate other people's abilities and achievements. He will also readily admit when he has made a mistake. Such a man would be a joy to live with.\n\nGood communication is the key to any solid relationship, most of all, marriage. I would want my future husband to share his thoughts with me. I want to hear his dreams and to share in his struggles. On the other hand, I will also need someone who will be ready to listen to me, and interested to know what is happening in my life. There should be no secrets between us.\n\nLife is full of challenges. We can expect to face failure as well as success; heartache as well as joy; boredom as well as excitement. So, the perfect husband should have a positive attitude and a good sense of humour. He should be witty and say things which make me laugh. The perfect husband would also be one who can see the silver lining behind every cloud, rather than focus on the flaws in every situation. With such a man, I will be encouraged to look at life in a happier and more positive way.\n\nAbove all other qualities, the perfect husband will be faithful. He must be someone who really believes in that marriage is made to last \"till death do us part\". He will be totally committed to our relationship, and willing to stay for the long haul, \"in sickness and in health, for better or for worse\"; as couples promise in the wedding vows. The perfect husband would not be distracted by other women; not even when I have lost my looks. He would be a \"one woman man\". In return, I will also promise my total loyalty and faithfulness to my future husband.\n\nActually, there are many other qualities that make a man perfect husband material. For example, one obvious quality would be the ability to provide; and, though it is not the most important quality, physical attraction must be a part of the equation for a marriage to work well. However, while it is easy to make lists, finding a man to live up to them will be very difficult. Furthermore, instead of focusing on my requirements for the perfect husband, I think I should recognise my own imperfections, and set about correcting them. As Barnett Brickner said, \"Success in marriage does not come merely through finding the right mate, but through being the right mate.\""

When I felt a few big drops on my head, I decided to head for a bus stop, about a hundred meters away. As I was nearing the bus stop, I saw a lady rushing towards it from the opposite direction, tugging a little boy behind her. The little boy was finding it hard to keep up with her, so, finally, she just picked him up and carried him.\n\nSuddenly, a motorcycle roared past me, almost knocking me down. \"Hey! Are you mad!\" I shouted at the motorcyclist. He turned to look at me, and for a split second, I saw his face - cruel, glaring eyes and menacing expression. However, he just sped on. Then, I realized that he was heading right for the woman and little boy!\n\n\"Watch out! Watch out!\" I shouted. I saw the lady turn to look at the motorcyclist, dismay etched on her face.\n\nIn an instant, the motorcyclist had reached the lady. He stretched out an arm and grabbed hold of her handbag, hitting her on the back at the same time. The impact sent the lady hurtling forward. The mother and child fell on the road, landing right in the path of a van.\n\n\"Stop! Stop!\" I screamed at the van driver, waving my arms wildly in the air. Thankfully, the driver had seen what was happening. With a squeal of brakes, the van stopped a few meters from the spot where the mother and child lay sprawled on the road.\n\nI saw the lady crawling on the road towards the wailing child. There was blood all over them. Tossing my bicycle to the side of the road, I ran to help them. By the time I got there, the van driver had reached them. He was cradling the child and examining his limbs.\n\n\"I think your little boy is all right. Nothing is broken,\" he said. \"How about you? Do you feel pain anywhere?\"\n\n\"Please help me. I am pregnant,\" the lady replied, weeping.\n\n\"Don't panic. You'll be all right. I'll take you and your son to hospital,\" said the man.\n\nThe lady could not walk, so the man carried her and settled her in his van. I carried the whimpering child to the van. The man asked me to go along with them so that I could help make the police report. I realized that, by this time, the motorcyclist would have gone far from that spot, with the lady's handbag.\n\nA few days later, I was told that the lady had suffered only minor injuries from the incident. She had some rather deep cuts on her face and limbs, and her knee was twisted. Thankfully, her unborn baby was unharmed. The snatch thief was never apprehended and I doubt I will ever see him again. However, I will never forget the menacing look he had given me."

        "content": "R-i-i-i-ng! The bell signaled the beginning of the six week long school holidays. The pupils burst into a loud cheer, thinking of the break they would have from dreary school lessons. \"Freedom!\" they shouted. The teachers heaved a soft sigh of relief. They would also be glad for the freedom that the holidays will bring.\n\nTeachers have a very stressful job, keeping a classroom of children in the seats for a whole school day. Some of these children may be hyperactive, some may be badly behaved or uncontrollable. Their own parents may be unable to cope with just one of them, yet teachers have to deal with as many as forty children at a time. Furthermore, a teacher's job is tedious and monotonous. They have to prepare lessons day in and day out, standing in front of one class after another. The long holidays will give them a chance to relax and recharge their batteries. Furthermore, teachers can attend courses during the long holidays. These courses will give them more ideas, skills and inspiration.\n\nLong holidays also give a break to the children, who active by nature, are cooped up for hours in a stuffy classroom. Then, after school, they are faced with piles of homework. On top of that, some children have to attend extra tuition in subjects they are weak in, or extra lessons in piano, violin, or guitar, ballet, or martial arts.\n\nWith so many structured activities, some children have no time to choose their own leisure pursuits. They have no time to \"stand and stare\". They also lack the time to bond with their family members, and relatives. The long holidays would give them the opportunity to go on holidays with the family; perhaps they can even spend time with relatives who live far away. They can also take part in other enriching activities, such as educational trips to a foreign country, or attend youth camps, such as Outward Bound, which will help in character development.\n\nYet, we have to take a realistic view at the other side of the argument. How many families can afford to send their children on overseas field trips or courses like the Outward Bound? In fact, in many families, the parents will be out working all day, and the children will be left unsupervised. This may be dangerous for younger children. As for older children, they may be drawn to undesirable and anti-social activities, like theft, gangsterism, gambling and drugs. Furthermore, for some children, school provides their only exposure to academic learning. Thus, the long period away from their studies may cause some children to regress badly in their academic skills.\n\nSo, in conclusion, long holidays are beneficial for some people and not so good for others. The teachers, who need a break from a stressful and tedious routine, will definitely welcome the break. Long holidays will also give opportunities to children from privileged homes to take part in enriching out-of-school activities. However, long school holidays may be detrimental for children from less privileged homes. In my opinion, for the good of the general public, schools should not have very long holidays. Or, if long holidays are to remain a part of the school year, certain activities or services should be provided for less privileged children to keep them occupied in a safe and useful way."

If they manage to get away, it will be on the weekend, usually arriving very late on Friday night. So, Saturday is my favorite day of the week for that is the day I get to see my parents.\n\nIt is a joyful feeling just to know that my parents are in the house and sleeping in their room. I know that my father will be very tired, after driving all the way home after a demanding day at work. So, I keep very quiet, allowing them to get all the rest they need. My mother usually wakes up first. \"Where is my big girl?\" is her usual greeting, followed by warm hugs and kisses. I will make her a cup of black coffee, just the way she likes it, and we will sit on the balcony, sharing our experiences since we last met. This is my favorite part of the day, pouring out my heart to my Mum, my closest confidante.\n\nWhen my father finally wakes up, we go out for breakfast. It is usually dim sum, my father's favorite breakfast food. This is a jolly family time. My father's jokes never fail to make us roar with laughter. Sometimes, my grandmother will tell my parents the news concerning our other relatives, including their illnesses or the bad behavior. My father will comfort her and try to encourage her to be patient and happy. When my grandmother gets into this mood, I cringe inside because I wonder whether she will mention my misdeeds. Fortunately, my parents are both understanding, and try to keep our breakfast a light-hearted occasion.\n\nMy father has two sisters in Bentong, and we usually go to his elder sister's house after breakfast. His younger sister's family will also drop over, if they are free. While the older folk chat in the living room, we usually go out to the orchard and relax under the trees. My aunt and grandmother will cook up a storm in the kitchen. They are excellent cooks, and, somehow, we always find space in our stomachs for the delicious food.\n\nIn the afternoon, we often go to the supermarket to buy the household necessities. Then, sometimes, we go for a movie. We usually have dinner at the stalls. Sometimes, our relatives will come along for dinner or the movies, adding to the fun. Later, my father will look at my schoolwork. He will praise me for my achievements, and correct me gently when he feels I have slacked. Sometimes, when I face difficulties in my studies, such as Additional Mathematics, or Physics, my father will explain the concepts to me. I look forward to this time with him, as I want to do well for my own sake, as well as to make my parents proud of me. When, we have finished, we just chat or watch television.\n\nActually, nothing very exciting happens on the Saturdays when my parents come home. We do very ordinary things - eating, chatting, grocery - shopping, and revising schoolwork. However, it is not the activities I look forward to but the people I am doing them with. This is the time that I feel most secure and loved. I know my parents will have to leave the next day. So, I treasure the time we have together."

I walked there quickly and put my tray down. Just as I did so, I felt a bump against my hip. Then there was a clatter as a tray dropped on the table and curry splattered everywhere. \"Yikes!\" Someone yelled, followed by gales of laughter.\n\nCurry was dripping all over my new camp shirt and my new jeans, and I could not find any humor in the situation. \"Can't you look where you are going, you clumsy oaf! And what's so funny anyway?\"' I shouted, glaring at the culprit, a lanky boy with wild hair.\n\n\"Sorry! Can't help laughing! You look so funny!\" the boy sputtered, bent over with laughter.\n\nI was too annoyed to answer and just stomped away to change my clothes.\n\nThe next morning, we were all assembled for roll call, when I saw the same boy come sprinting out of the quarters to join the lines, his unbuttoned shirt flying behind him. Before he could slide into place, he was spotted by the Camp Commandant. As a punishment for being late, he was made to do a hundred pushups. As we walked past him, on the way to breakfast, I let out a loud chortle. \"Sorry. I can't help laughing. You look so funny,\" I said.\n\nSo the war of words began with the wild-haired boy, whose name, I found out, was Ben. A few days later, when I had trouble rappelling, it was Ben's turn to laugh at me and make rude jokes. Then, I had my revenge when Ben capsized his canoe. By now, however, I was beginning to regret this \"war\"; there was something mean-spirited about it.\n\nOn the last day, we went for an extended mountain trek. On the way down, I hurt my ankle slightly. I was able to stumble on but got left further and further behind my patrol. After some time, they were out of sight. Though, I knew I would get back to the camp if I just kept on the track. I was getting anxious as evening fell. I tried to walk faster but my ankle was getting worse. Then, as I was negotiating a path that clung to the mountain side, I tripped. My unstable feet slid on the muddy ground, and, unable to stop myself, I slid right off the path and down the ravine.\n\nFortunately, my fall was stopped by a clump of bamboo. I saw that I was about ten meters below the track. There was no way I could climb up the slope, with my hurt ankle, which now seemed broken. I shouted for help, but in my heart, I knew it would be in vain, as I had been left far behind the group. All I could hope for was that they would send a search party for me. So, I could only wait.\n\nIt got dark and I became afraid. Then, I saw a faint light, and heard a voice calling out my name. I recognized the voice as Ben's.\n\n\"Ben! Help! I'm down here!\" I shouted.\n\nSoon, I saw Ben's wild-haired silhouette on the top of the ravine and the light of his torch shining down at me. \"Hold on. I'll be there soon,\" he said. In a few minutes, Ben was rappelling down the slope. He examined my ankle and, after pronouncing it was not broken, bound it up, gently and expertly. As he was doing so, some others from the search party arrived. I was brought back to camp, not much the worse for my misadventure.\n\nThe next day was a flurry of activities so I was unable to speak to Ben until we were boarding the buses which would take us back to our respective homes. Ben came from a state up north whereas I was from Johor, in the south. \"Thanks for finding me yesterday. I'm really sorry for my stupid behavior,\" I started to apologize.\n\n\"That's okay. I was stupid too. We missed the chance of being friends but, perhaps, we'll meet at another camp,\" Ben replied, grinning.\n\n\"I'd like that,\" I said. Then it was time for the buses to leave the camp site. So, we said our goodbyes and went our separate ways."

        "content": "My early childhood memories consists mainly of foggy, erratic images. I have a few memories from the days of my first few years. Mostly, I recollect watching television and playing games with my younger brother, who is two years my junior. There is one object, though, that has stayed with me throughout my young life, lying in my cupboard in most recent years -- my \"po-chim\".\n\nBack in those days, most newborn babies were given a bolster, more familiarly known to the Hokkiens as a \"po-chim\". My parents, being indulgent, had bought me several. Every night, they would place me in my crib and arrange my bolsters and pillows about me. They must have meant well, but for a small child, it was like being surrounded by a forest of cushions. So, I would exhaust most of my energy flinging all the paraphernalia out of my crib ... all except for one blue-and-white bolster.\n\nEventually, my parents got the message. At bedtime, the only bolster placed in my crib was my favorite blue-and-white \"po-chim\".\n\nWhen I finally learned to walk, I set myself to perfecting this exciting new skill. All over the house I wandered, meandering hither and thither. Nothing could stop me, be it chair, carpet, door or my parents. And, everywhere I went, so did my bolster, clutched in my hot little fist. Up hill and down dale went my bolster and I, searching for trouble and always finding it.\n\nMy brother, as I have mentioned, was born when I as two years old. i knew him for my brother the firs time I set eyes on him. Marching to his crib, I plonked my bolster in it and mumbled, \"Baby brother also needs 'po-chim'. \" Of course, I never fully relinquished my claim to the bolster. It had been and would always be mine. My baby brother did not really seem to like it anyway.\n\nLater, as I grew older and stronger, my rough play took its toll on my \"po-chim\". Originally three feet long and plump with stuffing, my bolster ended up being almost empty, with one lone foot of stuffing left. The rest had long escaped through the numerous tears and splits in the material. Undeterred, I put half the stuffing in each end of the bolster and made myself a trusty ninja weapon, a nunchaku. I would whirl off in flights of fantasies, imagining myself in ninja warrior, ever ready to attack my brother, father, other, or anyone else for that matter.\n\nMost children grow out of their soft toys and bolsters at any early age. I kept my old bolster by my bedside long past the age of ten. I never stopped playing with it, either. The games just got more sophisticated. Once, I built a miniature obstacle course using my bolster as a cable car sorts.\n\nThen, one day, the material just got too soft to be used nay more. I could poke my finger through it without exerting pressure. That night, I placed my bolster in my cupboard and went to sleep, a sad little boy.\n\nFor the next few weeks, sleepless night after sleepless night followed. Finally, I gave in and started using the old bolster again. Patching up the hole as best as I could, I returned the old bolster to my bedside.\n\nIt did not take long before it happened. One night, unable to handle the job any more, my bolster tore in half. It was a heartbroken and sorry boy who sewed up the tear one last time.\n\nSince then, my bolster has lain in a shrine of its own in my cupboard. I still take the occasional glance at it. It no longer represents pleasant dreams at night for my \"grown-up\" self. But it does represent something more intangible\n\nThat bolster, lying there, had been my first friend, my faithful comforter. It represents my childhood.\n\nGoodbye, \"po-chim\"."

        "content": "The price of goods and services seems to be increasing year by year. Nevertheless, there is much that we consumers can do to fight this seemingly unending inflation. How do we go about it ?\n\nFirst and foremost, we can start at our very home. Eat more often at home and cut down on eating out. After all, own cooked food is tastier, cleaner, and healthier with less oil and additives. If hawkers have fewer customers, they are sure to think twice when they want to increase the price of food. They may even reduce the price to attract customers.\n\nNext, encourage school-going children to bring home-cooked food to school. In doing so, children will avoid eating junk food or unwholesome food sold in school canteens. It is good for their health. Working adults can also bring own food to work although this may not be a popular practice.\n\nNow let's tackle your shopping spree. Buy in bulk at a lower price. If possible, share with the others when buying in bulk. It would be a good idea to set up cooperatives to cater to consumers' needs. Members have a lot to gain in terms of cheaper and quality goods and services.\n\nOf course, consumers should avoid compulsive spending, especially when the hypermarkets offer cheap sales and contests. Before you go shopping, it would be advisable to prepare a shopping list so that you will not buy unnecessary items. In fact we should spend less in times of inflation.\n\nIt would be a good idea to grow own vegetables at our backyard. After all, it is a good pastime and you will enjoy the very vegetables that you grow, knowing that they are fresh and free of pesticide or herbicide. Plants like chillies, brinjals, okra Mid others are easy to grow.\n\nWhen coming to fruits, preference should be given to our local fruits. Perhaps you can even grow your own fruit trees, like guava, papaya. and mango. Eating more local fruits instead of imported ones will help in foreign exchange.\n\nLast but not least, we should not waste. This is especially ii) when we organise parties or even wedding dinners. We often loud that there is plenty of food left and all this will go to waste. I lit% c, ills for a better planning and budgeting.\n\nIf we are serious in fighting inflation, and meticulously carry out some of the ways suggested above, we will certainly help stabilise the price of goods and services."

All that changed when I had a paranormal experience one fateful Sunday just a year ago.\nI had gone to Malacca with my three friends. Ali, Alex and Bishek, during the school holidays. we went to a quiet village and a relative of my friend's had made us welcome and offered us the use of one his rooms. The village was a far cry from the city where we lived. There was no hustle and tussle of the rat-race found in the city. the days moved at a leisurely pace and we had lots of fun fishing in the river and climbing trees to pluck rambutans and mangoes. It seemed that life in the village was absolutely carefree.\n\nOne day, Ali claimed that he had heard that there was a haunted house at the outskirts of the village. He said that the house was very old and was in a badly ruined condition but none of the villagers would go near it. We thought that Ali was just pulling our legs when our host, Mahmud, stepped in. We asked Mahmud if there was such a house and he assured us that indeed there was. he also advised to stay away from the haunted house. He seemed to be in earnest but we brushed aside his admonitions. None among the four of us at that time believed in the existence of ghosts and we attributed such tales to overworked human imagination and folklore.\n\nThat night, Alex suggested that we go to the presumed haunted house and prove to the rest of the superstitious villagers once and for all that there was no such thing as ghosts. We readily agreed to this plan and we made our way to the house in question.\n\nWhen we reached the dilapidated house, we felt an eerie chill, yet not even a gentle breeze was blowing. We flashed our torchlights and made our way to the house. The house had no door and we boldly walked in. There were still bits and pieces of old furniture strewn all over the floor and there were cobwebs hanging on the walls and ceilings. Insects and birds had built their nests inside the house. we smiled at this sight for this is an excellent example where the tiniest of God's creatures had made this place their home when man in his false superstition had abandoned.\n\nJust then, we heard a terrifying scream. We had goosebumps and felt our hairs standing on ends. We looked at one another n fright. Then, a light formed in the middle of the room and a ghostly apparition appeared right before our eyes. The face was that o the ugliest woman we had ever seen. Her face had long line of open scars and we could see maggots and worms oozing out from the open scabs. She was floating in the air and her feet were not visible.\n\nFor a few seconds, we were dumbstruck and then in unison we fled from the house as fast as our legs could carry. We ran all the way to Mahmud's house and stopped to catch our breath only we have locked ourselves in our room.\n\nThe next day, all of us were down with a high fever. Mahmud called the doctor and we were each given an injection and prescribed a course of medicine. We were bedridden for three days. When we had recovered, we told Mahmud what had happened. He smiled and said that he had guessed as much as it was odd that all four of us should be taken ill at the same time. He told us that certain things cannot be proven scientifically but that does not mean that they are not true.\n\nI cannot argue with that now."

I was even given a good thrashing from my father from time to time. But I did not mend my ways until this incident.\n\nI had just finished lunch at home and I was feeling very bored. My brothers and sisters, all of them older than I, had not returned home from school. I decided to walk around the neighborhood and I brought my trusty catapult with me.\n\nSoon, I came to Mr. Lingam's house. His pet dog, a giant Schnauzer, was tied to a post outside his house. I looked around and saw that no one was in sight. I decided to make good use o my catapult and picked a few small pebbles from the ground and aimed at the dog. A few of the pebbles hit the poor dog and it began to howl and help in pain. Eventually, the dog's anger was aroused and it began growling and barking fiercely at me while it strained against the ropes to free itself. I laughed at the dog, feeling amused by my sadistic deed.\n\nSuddenly, the rope that secured the dog snapped and the dog was free from its bonds. With a few powerful strides the dog was on me. Its teeth sank into the flesh of my calf. I screamed in pain and fright and fell to the ground.\n\nLuckily, my screams brought Mr. Lingam running out of the house and he managed to free the dog's teeth from my calf. He brought the dog into his house and quickly brought me to the clinic. The doctor gave me an injection and dressed the wound.\n\nI related the incident to the doctor and Mr. Lingam. The doctor chided me for being cruel to a helpless animal and asked me to be kind and considerate to all creatures in future.\n\nI learnt my lesson that day. I have since stopped playing pranks and being cruel to helpless creatures."

His leg had been set in cast and he could only walk with the aid of crutches.\nSamuel picked up the cordless phone by his bed and sat thinking. Who could he call then ? He knew that all his friends were in school. He was about to replace the handset when a thought occurred to him. He disconnected the telephone wire from the phone and pressed the 'talk' button. He put the phone to his ear and listened. At first he could only hear a static crackle. He kept changing channels to see if he could eavesdrop on any conversation. he knew that it was sometimes possible to pick up conversations of other users but they would not be able to hear him.\n\nAfter some moments, he did pick up a conversation between two people. And what a conversation it was ! Apparently it was a conversation between two smugglers. They were planning to smuggle in cigarettes illegally into Singapore from the Riau islands of Indonesia. Samuel listened carefully and took down the details of the smuggling operation. Samuel carefully noted down the details as the men spoke.\n\nAfter he had the necessary details, Samuel plugged in the telephone wire again and quickly dialed the police. He gave his particulars tot he police operator and repeated what he had overheard. The operator thanked him and said that the police would investigate the matter.\n\nA few days later, a senior officer from the Singapore Checkpoints Authority and a Superintendent of Police paid a visit to Samuel's house. the police had apprehended the smugglers as they tried to smuggle in the illegal cigarettes an the visiting officers thanked Samuel for his timely information."

In a materialistic world, money is an indispensable commodity which everyone, young or old, man or woman, seeks.\nEveryone has their own reasons for seeking wealth. I have mine as well, and these are my reasons.\n\nFirst, I would build my dream house. It would be in a quite and secluded area, away from the busy city. It would be built on a large tract of land which would also include facilities such as a swimming pool, a tennis court, a badminton court and a jogging track that would run around the perimeter of the estate. It would also have a beautiful garden and a barbecue area for garden parties.\n\nThen, I would also like to own a large yacht in which I could sail out to the sea. The yacht would have a well-stocked larder with the best foods an drinks available so that my guests and I could stay at sea for several days or weeks at a stretch.\n\nI would have my own jet plane in which I could fly to anywhere in the world at a moment's notice. I could be in New York one day and in Paris the next and then in Shanghai the following day.\n\nThen, I would also like to help people. I would start a charity foundation to help the needy. I would award scholarships to exceptionally talented youths so that they would be able to further their education without thought of financial worries. I would also set up homes for the aged and the handicapped.\n\nFinally, I would donate a princely sum to medical research. Scientists have not found a cure to diseases such as cancer and Aids. It would be good to render y help to such worthy causes.\n\nThese are my reasons for wanting to be rich."

My favorite television programs have been the likes of \"Star Trek\", \"Space 1999\" and \"Battlestar Gallactica\".\nSince the beginning of time, man had used his inventive faculties to create machines to make life easier. We now have machines that would have been thought to be children's fantasies at one time.\n\nWe now have jet planes that can transport people from one corner of the globe to the other in a matter of hours where our forefathers could have to spend months or even years to cover the same distance. with the advent of the computer and Internet, information can be sent and received by millions of people all over the world. In deed, the last fifty years had seen such a rapid progress in science like never before in the entire history of mankind. So, it is not a mere fantasy of mine to see certain inventions coming into being in the future. I have many in mind but the following three are what I consider to be of utmost importance.\n\nFirst, I would like to see improved household appliances. There are already mixers, grinders and cookers. But I would like to see the integration of these machines into one. I imagine a machine where all the ingredients are placed into different compartments. The front of the machine would have a menu with selection buttons. All the user would need to do is to press the button for the meal she wants and the machine who do the rest. The machine would perhaps be a model based on the one featured in the futuristic cartoon show \"The Jetsons\".\n\nThen, I would like to see the transportation systems portrayed in \"Star Trek\" become a reality One would only need to stand in a 'transporter' and be sent to the place he wants to be. Roads would become a thing of the past and the precious land could be made full use in building residential and recreational facilities.\n\nFinally, home based education. We have already seen the changes in the past twenty years since the introduction of the personal computers and the widespread use of the Internet. A further refinement on this technology and there would not be a need for schools. Pupils can study at home through computer-based teaching systems or they may study through the use of virtual reality. they would just have to put on their virtual reality headsets and they would find themselves in a virtual classroom where they can study the subjects of their choice.\n\nThese are the inventions that I would like to see in the future. They may seem far-fetched or even impossible today, but then, so did the possibility of flight a mere century ago."

The stall holders are friendly folk and the food is inexpensive.\n\nI quickly walk to the school canteen and head for my favorite nasi lemak stall. The stall is run by an elderly Malay woman whom we affectionately call Mak Haji. She is assisted by her son and daughter. Mak Haji also sells fried chicken, fried prawns, fried fish and anchovies, hard-boiled eggs and baked potatoes to go with her delicious nasi lemak.\n\nAfter buying my meal, I walk over to the drinks stall and buy a tall glass of mixed fruits juice. The drinks stall belongs to Mr. Chan, a thin Chinese in his mid-thirties. He runs the shop alone but he is a very fast worker. His hands seem to move at lightening speed as he serves his customers.\n\nThen, I scan the dining area for an empty seat and having found one, I rush to be seated. I finish the sumptuous meal in a matter of minutes and gulp down the refreshing juice. Having thus filled my stomach, I rise with the empty plate and glass in my hands. There are others waiting to have their meal and I have to make space for them.\n\nAll too soon, the school bell rings again to mark the end of recess time.

Busy with my studies, here have been quite a number of new books that I have not read. Novels from Sidney Sheldon and Lawrence Block, two of my favorite authors, have been released recently. Then, there are also some issues of National Geographic and Readers' Digest magazines that I have bought in recent months which I have not had the time to read.\n\nThen, I would have to watch the numerous television programs that I have recorded on video cassettes. I have missed out many episodes of \"E.R.\" and \"X-Files\", not to mention the critically acclaimed \"Desperate Housewives\". Television programs are not the only ones that I have missed out. There have also been a few good movies which I have not yet watched. I would have to rent DVDS to watch those as well.\n\nFinally, I plan to organize some fun activities with my classmates. I intend to go fishing by the stream and go trekking through the nearby woods with them. And if there is keen interest, we might even go camping for a week. We would, of course, have to bring the necessary camping items like tents, sleeping bags, insect repellents, cooking utensils and sufficient food.\n\nI look forward in earnest to the activities I have planned for the holidays. I am sure that the coming holidays will be a time of cheery rest and cheerful recreation."

        "title": "Tuition",
        "content": "The word `tuition' refers to remedial teaching in small groups. In the past, students who are weak in their studies engage the services of a tutor, one who was an expert in his field of study. Today, it is a different scenario altogether. Tuition has become a major money spinner for many teachers. Almost every student who can afford it go for tuition and parents are willing to fork out huge sums of money just to ensure that their children are not left behind in the rat race or paper chase.\n\nThe rationale for sending students for tuition is to provide opportunities for students who are weak in certain subjects to catch up. In schools, teachers have limited time to teach students. For example, there are only five lessons per week for subjects like Mathematics and English. The time allotted is certainly insufficient for weak students to understand a particular subject. Moreover, with increasing paper work and a load of other duties, teaching time may actually be further reduced. Teachers may rush through the syllabus leaving weaker students in the lurch. These students who have difficulty assimilating what is taught may then resort to tuition.\n\nNowadays, due to work commitments, parents stay away from home for the greater part of the day. Parents would then prefer to send their children to tuition classes just to keep them from getting involved in undesirable activities or just to prevent them from idling their time away. Some educated parents may be too busy to help their children with their studies. On the other hand, there are parents who are unable to help their children because they do not have a sufficient level of education. For these groups of parents, tuition is helpful.\n\nTuition classes, nowadays are no longer confined to small groups of students. Many tuition centers have a large enrolment. It is not uncommon to find tuition classes which have bigger enrolments than classes in schools. In such instances, students cannot get personalized attention from tutors and this defeats the whole purpose of tuition.\n\nThe authorities should come down hard on such tuition centers which are out to fleece students. Otherwise, such centers will be churning out teachers who give their wholehearted attention and devotion to tuition and slacken in school."

Even Mr. Lee our mathematics teacher is fidgeting quietly in his seat, looking outside every now and then.\nThe bell rings, exploding the subdued silence of the school. I feel a tangible change in mood among my classmates. The brooding atmosphere immediately gives way to an excited chatter of happy voices. Mr. Lee strides quickly out of the class. We run.\n\nWe run toward the tuckshop, slowing down every time we encounter a teacher in our path. Teachers are so slow. They block the way and waste our precious twenty minutes of break time.\n\nNevertheless I am always one of those first at the tuckshop. I order a plate of mee and ladle a generous helping of gravy onto the mee. The thin Indian man sells the best mee in the world, especially the gravy that goes with the mee. Next I move over to the refreshment stall of the tuckshop and buy a glass of fruit juice. By this time the tuckshop is crowded with jostling pupils all trying to buy their favorite food. i sit down at one of the huge tables in the tuckshop. For a minute or so I am oblivious to my surroundings. What matters most is the delicious taste of mee in my mouth, and the subsequent thirst-quenching feeling of cold fruit juice running down my throat to my stomach.\n\nAh ..., a full stomach is a happy stomach.\n\nWhen I become aware of my surroundings again, I can see one of my classmates sitting opposite me gobbling down his food. I look around. the tables are all fully seated. I see heads all bowed down and mouths feverishly chewing. One boy is gesturing frantically with his rice-filled spoon at his friend opposite him. Obviously he is trying to press a point home but I do not think he is having much success except for the bits of rice that keep flying out of his mouth. You should not talk when eating, my mother always tells me. How true it is.\n\nSomebody nudges my shoulder. He wants me to get up because I have had my meal and he has not. He holds a plate of rice in his hands. I get up.\n\nThe din in the tuckshop is terrific. I see some blue-shirted prefects unsuccessfully trying to keep the pupils in line when buying food. The tuckshop sells many things -- mee, rice, drinks, sweets and other titbits. Money changes hands quickly. the shopkeeper and his assistants are working at a frantic rate. Young boys crowd around, pushing and shoving, trying to buy their food. Hunger is a very powerful force, indeed.\n\nWhere are the girls ? We have girls in the school too. I look around, Ah, there they are, demurely seated at a table, one table out of a dozen, eating slowly and gracefully unlike the boys who behave as though they have not eaten for days. Elsewhere I see groups of girls standing and waiting for the rush to be over before they buy their food.\n\nGradually the number of buyers at the stalls peter out and the girls move in. The difference is so great. the girls do not rush. In fact they take their time buying their food and they even help one another in buying. what contrasting sets of human beings they are, the boys and the girls.\n\nA few minutes before the end of break time, the stalls are almost deserted. The mee seller has already packed up. There will be no mee for latecomers. The pupils move out of the tuckshop to gossip in unrestricted areas.\n\nAll too soon the bell goes, signaling the beginning of the rest of the lessons. I walk slowly toward my classroom. Nobody runs. Some stall for as long as possible before moving. Like worker ants we make our way to our classrooms. Like soldier ants the prefects move the opposite way -- toward the tuckshop, they have to eat too, whatever is left."

        "content": "Teluk Kemang – eight miles from Port Dickson town, is a very popular holiday spot. The beach is covered with lovely white sand and the sea is usually calm and inviting here. Furthermore the water's edge does not change appreciably during low and high tides. So a bather does not have to wade far to get to a decent depth.\n\nCome Sundays and holidays, the beach is packed to capacity. This Sunday is no different. When I arrive by car with a group of friends, I have to hunt high and low for a parking space. After some time I find one a few hundred meters from the beach. We do not complain for we are lucky to find one.\n\nIn double-quick time we are in the sea, swimming to and fro and generally having a good time. From the water I can see throngs of people on the beach. Some are standing, some are sitting while the rest walk leisurely around. Some children are making sand-castles and a couple of white bodies are spread out on the beach, presumably sun-bathing. Too bad for them, the sun is hidden behind black clouds.\n\nBlack clouds! The thought suddenly occurs to me that it is going to rain. As if in direct response to my thoughts, the rain comes, thick and furious. I can feel the sting of the raindrops falling on my bare shoulders. The sea seems to boil under the incessant onslaught of falling raindrops. I can see the bathers, including me, crouching down as low as we can get into the water to avoid the painful drops.\n\nThrough the blurring rain, I see people on the beach rushing madly for shelter. Most of the holiday-makers who come here are in their best Sunday clothes. They have no intention of swimming. These people are mainly harried city workers who come here to join in the happy Sunday atmosphere. However this Sunday is not for them. Soon most of them who do not find shelter quick enough are soaked to the skin – their clothes, hairdo, makeup and all thoughts of a cheery holiday ruined by the relentless rain. They huddle remorsefully under whatever shelter that are available – in the stalls, in the hotels, under the huge trees, in the bus. Some bravely stand in the rain with their umbrellas. What a pathetic sight they present. The beach is completely deserted.\n\nThe souvenir pedlars are more prepared for the rain for they cover their wares quickly and effectively with plastic sheets. It is obvious that they have had a lot of practice at this.\n\nThe speed-boats that take holiday-makers for a ride around the bay for a fee are idle. The drivers sit forlornly in the boats, waiting for the rain to stop.\n\nThose of us in the sea carry on with our fun. The feeling of getting caught in the rain while in the sea is quite invigorating. Water, water everywhere and enough for anyone to drink. All he has to do is to open his mouth, above the sea that is.\n\nEventually I can feel the waves becoming larger and the wind stronger. In a few minutes swimming becomes impossible as the waves become huge and angry and the wind begins to get cold. I signal to my friends to get out.\n\nEmerging from the warm sea into the cold driving rain is like stepping from a warm bed into a refrigerator. We shiver uncontrollably. So we run to the car. It is so wonderful to be inside the warm car but what a mess we make inside the car; sand, water and salt everywhere. I will have to clean the car when I get home.\n\nWhen I start the engine to move off, I can see buses and cars leaving the beach. It seems like these people have decided to go home too. Judging from the intensity of the storm, I reckon it will carry on for a few hours. There is no point hanging around. Still there are many stubborn holidaymakers braving the pouring rain, waiting for the rain to go away till the seaside becomes cheery and sunny once again."

Without exception, each person held either a large envelope or a paper file in his or her hand. Everyone was nervous and expectant though each tried to look nonchalant and relaxed.\n\nThe room that Mat and the others were sitting in was air-conditioned. A pretty young girl sat in front of a telephone switchboard and was busy handling calls. The room was tastefully furnished and decorated. Mat thought: so this is the place I might get to work in; not bad, not bad at all. He checked the contents of his envelope - certificates, reference letters, identity card, resume, etc. Yes, everything seemed to be in order. This was the first interview he was going to attend after applying for various jobs advertised in the newspapers. He wondered how he would face up to the interviewers when his turn came. Being a recent school-leaver, he had absolutely no experience in being interviewed. He had consulted some older working friends about the correct way to present oneself at an interview, but they gave him contradicting advice that left him no wiser.\n\nThe door marked \"Conference Room\" opened and a young girl, presumably one of the secretaries, stepped out. Everybody turned their eyes on her. She held a piece of paper in her hand and from it she called out a name. Mat held his breath, heart pounding. Maybe this was his turn.\n\nAn unfamiliar name broke the tense silence and the young man next to him stood up, adjusted his tie and followed the girl into the room. Mat and the rest settled back on their seats.\n\nTen minutes later, the young man emerged. Another name was called. Still it was not Mat's turn.\n\nAfter an hour of waiting and watching others getting into the room, Mat was feeling edgy. When would his turn come? He fidgeted about, fiddling his tie and rolling up the corners of his envelope.\n\nHe must have started to day-dream because when he heard his name being called, the young girl was standing right in front of him.\n\n\"Ahmad Nordin, are you Ahmad Nordin?\" She asked Mat, raising her voice.\n\n\"Er, Yes, Yes!\" Mat muttered. \"It's your turn now, come.\"\n\nAhmad jumped up and and followed her into the conference room.\n\nInside the room, three men with ties were seated together behind a large long table. They looked as though they meant business. In front of them was a chair on which Mat was indicated to sit. Mat managed to say \"good morning\" and \"thank you\" before he sat down.\n\n\"Ahmad Nordin?\" boomed the man in the middle. \"You wish to be a sales representative?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Mat replied. \"I want to give it a try.\"\n\n\"What experience do you have?\"\n\n\"None, sir. But I am a fast learner.\"\n\n\"Maybe, maybe\" the same man commented.\n\nAfter this opening exchanges, Mat felt himself answering their questions confidently and spontaneously. He did not feel uneasy at all. In fact he was beginning to enjoy the interview. Soon he was talking cheerfully as though he had known these men for years. Then suddenly the man in the middle gestured to him to stop.\n\n\"Okay, Encik Ahmad, that's all. We shall inform you as to whether we want you or not. You may go now and thank you.\"\n\nMat stood up, wishing that he could stay longer. There were other things he wanted to say. Nevertheless he had to leave. So he uttered \"thank you\" and shuffled out of the room.\n\nWhen he stepped into the busy street outside, the sun was shining brightly. He squinted his eyes to get used to the glare. The day was hot but the sky was a beautiful blue. Mat felt happy and relieved. He had just attended an interview which he reckoned to have done quite well. He had just cleared a fearful hurdle and he came out unscathed. With a smile on his face he half-walked and half-skipped down the road."

It was the day after Christmas, a Sunday. In Malaysia, schoolchildren were also enjoying their end-of-year holidays.\nOn Penang island, the hotels were fully-booked and people thronged the beaches. Besides Malaysians, holiday-makers came from all over the world to the resort hotels in Ferringhi Beach and Tanjung Bunga. The Dillon family had come all the way from Europe to escape from the coldness of winter. They had arrived the night before but were up early to swim in the sea and eat a late breakfast in the Crystal Restaurant on Fisherman's Pier.\n\nWhile enjoying their Asian breakfast in a cosy private room facing the water, they saw a strange sight through the glass windows. People were gathering on the beach and pointing at the sea which was receding quickly into the horizon. Some people were excitedly picking up shell and even fish that had been exposed. Then Mr Dillon heard the Japanese man at the table next to theirs shouting `Tsunami! Tsunami!'. The Japanese man and his family jumped from their seats, gesticulating wildly to everyone, and dashed for the exit. Although no one understood Japanese, Mr and Mrs Dillon sensed that their lives were in danger.\n\nAll of a sudden a gigantic wall of water came crashing through the restaurant windows, knocking over every person and object. Mr Dillon and his wife grabbed their two children's hands. However, Tom Dillon's little hand slipped from his mother's grip and he was tossed by the waves. By some miracle, somebody saw his head bobbing above the water and snatched him up in time. Just as forcefully, the waves pulled back, tugging along whatever it could. Fortunately, the Dillons and everyone else in the restaurant had escaped onto drier ground. They dashed out to the street, shaken and bruised by he onslaught of the tsunami. The children, overcome by shock at first, burst into tears. Everyone literally trembled with fear.\n\nThe survivors tried to go as far inland as they could. They had to trudge in thick mud all the way. Seeking refuge in a hill-top hotel, some even tried to check in there instead of returning to their beachfront accommodations.\n\nThe devastating tsunami of 26th December 2004 killed more than 60 people in Malaysia. Its seismic force was most destructive in Aceh in northern Sumatra, the western part of Thailand, parts of Sri Lanka, and India. There were also casualties in Somalia, the Maldives and Myanmar. Altogether, about a quarter of a million people were killed, thousands went missing, and more than half a million lost their homes. Never has a natural disaster traumatized so many nations."

        "content": "Describe the Machu Picchu in Peru\n\n \nThe Machu Picchu is a breathtaking sight. One has to climb 2,500 meters up the Andes mountains to visit it. Down below are forests and dense bushes that hide it from view.\nNestled between two peaks, the Machu Picchu complex was built between 1460 and 1470 AD. Comprising 200 buildings, mostly residences, temples and storage structures, it was a royal and religious estate serving the first great Incan Emperor Pachacuti. Today these structures remain as solid as when they were first constructed, although smallpox ravaged the Incan communities in the 16th century and by 1527, half of the population had been wiped out. When the Spanish conquerors came in 1532, Machu Picchu was abandoned.\n\nThe re-discovery of Machu Picchu revealed many archaeological wonders. The structures were professionally built with granite blocks fitted together perfectly without the use of mortar. What makes it even more amazing is that the interlocking blocks are of different sizes and shapes. Each block is multi-faceted, and some have more than thirty faces! Moreover, the joints are so tight that only razor-thin instruments can fit between the blocks. The ancient builders must have used bronze and stone implements to cut the blocks and sand to smoothen them.\n\nThere are other marvelous aspects of Machu Picchu. One is the beautiful harmony between its structures and the rocky landscape. The existing stone formations were used in the construction of towers, walls and columns. Sculptures were carved into the rocks and temples perched precariously on cliff edges. Another impressive aspect is the design of the residential area. Houses surround village squares and are connected by roads and alleyways. Stone cisterns and channels were built for water to flow through. The agricultural system is also astonishingly advanced, utilizing efficient terracing and irrigation methods to plant the main crops, which were potato and maize.\n\nHiram Bingham, the American historian who rediscovered the Mach Picchu in 1911 mistook it for the lost city of Vilcabamba, the last capital of the Incan Empire. Nevertheless, this archaeological find is considered the most spectacular in the world."

Yet they have never said a nice thing about him in front of their children, who adore him. They speak disapprovingly about him to their children, but they have never turned him away. Maybe they feel sorry for him, as he lives alone. He had been married once, for a very short time, and has no children.

And there was Uncle Kevin, with a snake, an iguana, a frog, hermit crabs and different kinds of slugs. The creatures were all housed in plastic and glass containers. Kim screamed and banned them from the house. So the children played with them in their tiny garden. Uncle Kevin taught them a lot of interesting things about those creatures. He also said he was going to open a pet shop selling small animals. Kim predicted that this project would be abandoned as soon as he took up a new hobby.\n\nTrue enough, he turned up one weekend wearing an apron and a chef's hat. He was loaded down with a paraphernalia of cooking utensils, piles of vegetables, and jars of spices. Announcing that he had taken up cooking and was going to be their `chef' for that weekend, he marched straight to the kitchen. Although Kim shook her head despairingly and said, `Another new hobby?', she did not try to stop him.\n\nThe children were breathless with excitement and anticipation. Chasing his sister out of the kitchen but allowing the little ones to be present, he proceeded to wash, chop, slice and heat up several pots and pans. They watched him, fascinated. He clowned around and parodied Bollywood movie scenes while he cooked.\n\nTheir favourite part of the cooking sessions was when he made them taste what he was preparing. Some of the stuff tasted strange, but every time someone grimaced, he asked for suggestions on how to improve the dish. At the dinner table, the tastier dishes were quickly eaten up, and the less popular ones were finished by Kevin himself. Nothing was wasted. After each meal, his sister made sure the children helped with the dishes.\n\nHe has declared that he wants to start a restaurant. Who knows what will become of that plan, says his brother-in-law. As for the children, they cannot wait for his next visit."

Ever since Dad took up a job on Penang island ten years ago, we have been living in Dad's ideal house that faces the sea. As he was born and bred in a fishing village, the sea had always been part and parcel of his life. My siblings and I also share the same affinity for the sea.\nSchool, assignments and household chores usually keep us busy during weekdays. However, come weekends, there is nothing more exciting than the sea to lure us to its beaches. My favorite spot is a secluded one not far from my house. Nestled among tall coconut trees, it offers an impressive view of the beach. Here, I will spend hours sunbathing on the dazzling, white sand.\n\nThe waves race towards the shore with its frothy white foam. It is a beautiful sigh to behold. I am reminded of the splendor of nature. The lapping of the waves and the sounds they make upon reaching the shore remind me of the swishing of skirts by a row of dancing maidens. It sounds like an orchestra in performance.\n\nI am always in awe of the different sounds made by the tireless wind. Sometimes, it is a gentle breeze that caresses my skin and ruffles my hair. Sometimes, it sounds like a beloved's soft murmur. At other times, however, the wind sounds disgruntled as it shrieks and howls. Then, I can feel its sting as it blows my hair onto my face.\n\nHowever, I am not alone on the beach. Along the edge of the water, I can see tiny hermit crabs scurrying about aimlessly on the sandy beach. Once in a while, a flock of birds will soar above me, flapping their wings gracefully as if they do not have a care in the world.\n\nI am content to spend hours at length at the beach. However, as the aroma of Mum's cooking wafts in the air, I am suddenly aware of my hunger pangs. I head for home, knowing that the beach will still be there tomorrow."

        "content": "News headlines about heinous criminal acts against children such as kidnapping, abuse, assault, murder and rape are more than just disturbing. They are shocking. It is right that we condemn these despicable acts. While our hearts go out to the aggrieved parents who may never see their children again, we must realize that we live in a time and age where it is no longer safe for children to roam about freely. Protecting children from harm and violence is not just the duty of parents and the authorities concerned. Society has to play its part as well.\n\nFor starters, action needs to begin with parents and the family. Parents must be vigilant and know the whereabouts of their children all the time. They nee to watch out for their children especially when they are outside, be it in the playground or while shopping. Moreover, they need to chaperone their children constantly, even if the distance traveled is short. Leaving a child unsupervised and assuming that a child will ultimately return home safely is unwise. Parents should set boundaries about places that children may go, people they may see and things they may do. Children should also be taught to say 'no' to strangers offering lifts and gifts.\n\nThe authorities, including the police, can ensure better protection for children by implementing several measures, for example increasing patrols in high-risk areas such as shopping malls and playgrounds. They can also carryout awareness campaigns on child safety. Installing CCTVs in areas frequented by children ill also go a long way towards ensuring child safety.\n\nSchools should place special emphasis on child safety education. As young children are the most vulnerable, child safety education should start in primary schools so that children can learn how to be safe from strangers. Children should also be taught to trust their instincts and seek help whenever they feel threatened.\n\nIt is a harsh but true fact that the world is no longer a safe place for innocent children as sexual predators lurk in every nook and cranny. A safe environment for children to live and grow can only be realized when all parties, including parents, schools, communities and the authorities work together."

Facilities are, no doubt, better in cities, but city life has become associated with stress, crime and pollution.\nLife in the city is very hectic. Traffic congestion is a perpetual problem. At work, fierce competition, deadlines and meetings await the city dweller. Always in a hurry to avoid the rush hour traffic jams, to be time for appointments or to stay one step ahead of other, people in cities have little time to relax. In the countryside, life is much more relaxed, there is little hassle and no point in competing. Villagers go abut their tasks during the day and rest in the evenings.\n\nLiving in towns and cities is also becoming dangerous. Houses in cities are fenced in and many house owners also install grilles and alarm systems to safeguard their homes. With the rising crime rate in cities, a woman walking alone at night or displaying jewellery is courting danger. In the countryside, houses may not even be locked or have fences. People there usually know one another and outsides are easily spotted. Any villager who commits a crime will be ostracized or punished, or both. Furthermore, villagers help each other.\n\nAt the same time, pollution has become a household word in cities. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles pollute the air, and there is always the noise of the traffic. Anyone who has lived in one of the crowded housing areas in the city also knows that residents are often involuntary eavesdroppers to a neighbor's family quarrel or are forced to listen to music from somebody else's radio. In the countryside, houses are further apart but there is close rapport between villagers or townspeople as they meet frequently. Furthermore, the countryside is known for its fresh air and quiet surroundings, which is good for one's physical and mental health. The countryside, ahs, unfortunately, a few job opportunities and places for leisure. It also has an inadequate public transportation system.\n\nIf I could live in the countryside and yet have the same opportunities as I have in the city, I would definitely prefer the countryside because life there is not as stressful as that in the city and yet is much safe and healthier."

It was an incident that changed my life forever.\n\nIt was a Saturday morning, like any other weekend and I was on the way to school for extra classes. I had to take the city bus to school. As I walked down the street from my house I noticed that the road was very crowded. Buses, cars, taxis, motorcyclists and pedestrians created a hustle and bustle that would easily unnerve anyone. I kept my cool as I walked down the pedestrian path towards the bus stop. My thoughts were however far away, as I was preoccupied with the mid-term exam that was just around the corner. Suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, a motorcyclist who was just passing beside me, tugged at my bag, which was dangling from my shoulder.\n\nI spun around and reeled from the force of the moving vehicle. I felt a harsh pull. Within a split second I was sprawled on the pavement. I felt numb and everything around me became blur. I heard people shouting, but I was too dazed to talk and too shocked to even get up. I did not remember anything after that. When I regained consciousness. I was in the hospital and my legs and arms were bandaged. Yet I felt no sensation or pain. I was just too weak to even move.\n\n'What happened ?' I kept asking myself. How could this have happened to me, I thought ? My parents, my sister and my brother were there and their grim faces told me that things were not right. The doctor finally broke the sad news to me. I was now paralyzed and would not be able to walk again. I was shocked and did not know what to say. there was a lump in my throat. The tears that rolled down from my eyes slowly wet my pillow.\n\nI am now stronger but must learn to be more confident of myself. I have learnt to pray and hope that I will be able to move around in my wheelchair. It is one incident that has changed my life and I will never be able to forget."

        "content": "Wetlands are areas of marsh or peat land with water that is static or flowing. They are ecosystems whose formation and characteristics are determined by water. The major types of wetlands in Asia are mangroves, freshwater swamp forests, peat swamp forests, lakes and river systems.\nUntil recently, people thought that wetlands were soggy, useless land that would only be valuable if they were drained and developed fro agriculture, housing or infrastructure projects. Besides the direct physical destruction, wetlands are also threatened by chemical contamination and other pollutants.\n\nWetlands prevent flooding by holding water like a large sponge. Water moves slowly and this prevents flooding. Wetlands store water during storms when water levels are high. Then, when water levels are low, wetlands release water. Wetland plants have roots planted firmly in the muddy bottom, but with stalks that rise high above the water surface. This can slow down the flow of water. By doing this, they counter the water's erosive forces.\n\nWetlands clean the water by filtering out the sedimentation. Because of this, wetlands have been referred to as the 'kidneys' of the ecosystem. Even harmful chemicals are converted into useable forms in this cleansing process. Many government are now converting lands into artificial wetlands to filter out pollution.\n\nWetlands are the habitats for a very large variety of plant and animal life. Wetlands provide the breeding, nesting and feeding grounds for may endangered species. Even animals that live in other habitats use wetlands for migration and reproduction. The plant diversity of wetlands provide a breeding site for crabs, prawns and fish.\n\nThe many diverse products of wetlands generate numerous socio-economic benefits that are important for the livelihood of local communities. Among the many products that are obtained from wetlands are water supply for domestic us, fisheries, forage resources, craft materials and medicinal plants.\n\nWetlands are also treasured for their aesthetic value. They are wonderful places to visit. Their intrinsic natural beauty make them the favorite haunt of tourists, where opportunities for activities like boating, fishing and bird-watching exist.\n\nThe many benefits of wetlands is reason enough for conserving them. Reclamation of wetlands for development robs many types of flora and fauna of their habitats and ultimately leads to their extinction. Conservation efforts must therefore be taken before our natural wealth is lost through the selfish pursuits of man."

Write an article for your school newsletter on the dangers of smoking.\n \nSmoke that kills\n\nA smoker can easily be identified in any group. Not only does he reek of stale smoke, he also has bad breath, much to the dread of non-smokers. However, the effects of smoking are far more insidious than the offensive smell associated with smokers.\nCigarette smoke contains many toxic substances like carbon monoxide, nicotine and carcinogens that not only cause irreparable damage to the smoker, but also to those around him who inhale the smoke.\n\nCarbon monoxide reduces blood capacity to carry oxygen, thus causing fatigue and panting even with the slightest physical exertion. The lack of oxygen in the body acts as a catalyst that accelerates the aging process, causing wrinkles.\n\nNicotine contained in cigarette smoke reduces the activity of the brain and nervous system. It also raises the risk of high blood pressure. Nicotine causes the contraction of blood vessels and decrease of blood supply. This ultimately leads to heart attacks.\n\nSmokers are at a higher risk of developing certain kinds of cancers because cigarette smoke contains carcinogens. Long-time smokers often develop cancers of the mouth, larynx and lungs.\n\nSmoking not only endangers the smoker himself but also those who inhale secondary smoke -- smoke exhaled y smokers. In view of the many dangers of smoking, more smoking cessation programs should be introduced to smokers."

With loads of homework, assignments and exams, exercise seems to be a monotonous chore. The increasing demands made upon us by our studies, exams and the high expectations of our parents and teachers leave us with little time for pleasure and leisure. The need to exercise becomes a bitter pill to swallow. Nonetheless, health experts prescribe exercise as a prerequisite for  along, healthy life -- a life free from diseases and ailments.\n\nPhysical exercise not only stimulates and develops muscles, it has a host of other benefits. Regular exercise can prevent obesity. When we exercise, our bodies burn up all the extra calories which would otherwise be converted into fat and lead to unwanted bulges. Being overweight also carries with it a number of other health problems, so, exercising not only keeps us trim, it also keeps away weight-related problems.\n\nExercise improves blood circulation which, in turn, provides constant nourishment to the millions of cells in our body. When physical exertion takes place, the rate of breathing increases. Thus, the capacity of blood to carry oxygen is increased. At the same time, it helps the body to get rid of harmful carbon dioxide.\n\nVigorous exercise also eliminates modern-day stress. The number of people suffering from insomnia is on the rise. The increasing pressure and nagging worries of work and study often keep us awake at night. For many of us, the dawn of a new day brings no cheer. Exercise can be instrumental in helping a person obtain a more relaxed sleep. A tired person will be refreshed and high-spirited after a good night's sleep. A few hours of exercise will help in getting sound sleep and is the perfect, soothing balm for a tired body and a restless mind.\n\nIncreasing affluence has caused changes in our eating habits. we indulge in rich food, high in calories and cholesterol. Medical evidence substantiates the fact that exercise can significantly lower the levels of sugar and cholesterol in our bodies. In other words, consistent physical activity can actually provide relief from ailments such as hypertension, diabetes and heart disease.\n\nThere are many benefits to be gained from exercise. A person who exercises regularly has good health and more vitality compared to someone who does not exercise."

One day, during recess, I was standing alone in one corner of the canteen when Mrs Justin spotted me. She gestured for me to follow her. We headed for the library where she beckoned me to take a seat next to her. I sat with my head bent. 'Helen,' she called. I lifted my head and looked at her.

Moreover, the refrigerator was well-stocked with chocolates and ice-cream so I helped myself to all the goodies. That night, I woke up with an excruciating toothache. No amount of aspirin could stop the pain.\nWhen morning arrived, I had to do the inevitable -- make an appointment with the dentist. My dental appointment was at 2 p.m. that afternoon, which was just another four hours away. The thought was enough to kill my interest in everything else. I had butterflies in my stomach. I arrived at the dental clinic an hour before the appointment. After registering, I walked unenthusiastically towards a chair. I did not even bother to look at the other patients. Picking up a few magazines, I tried to read, but I could not concentrate. All I was aware of was the terrible pain. The sight of patients coming out from the treatment room, with large pieces of gauze sticking out from their mouths, only seemed to worsen my pain. One o my New Year resolutions was made while I was fidgeting in my seat. I vowed never to taste another jam tart or take a chunky bite of chocolate in future.\n\nWhen my name was finally called, I staggered into the treatment room. I heard the dentist greeting me, but I could not bring myself to respond to his greeting. The sight of the drilling equipment and the hypodermic syringes only increased my feelings of nausea. When the dentist summoned me to take my seat and asked me to open my mouth, I felt my heart pounding very fast. I was sure that I was going to get a heart attack. The dentist probed the offending tooth with various instruments. He informed me that it was best to extract the tooth. I nodded and closed my eyes and tried to think of other thing. the next minute or so was one of the most terrifying moments of my life. I grabbed the dentist's hands more than once. At first he was quite taken aback and eyed me suspiciously. Then he warned me that I would have my hands tied if I were to repeat my antics. I did not think that he was joking !\n\nSoon the pain gave way to a soothing sensation. When the dentist told me that it was all over, I could hardly believe my ears. After paying for the extraction, I walked out of the clinic confidently and headed for the nearest bus stop. I swore that this would be the first and the last time I stepped into a dental clinic."

        "content": "The accelerating rate of obesity among Asians, especially children, is indeed alarming. If left unchecked, it will soon become the major cause of preventable death. Once obesity develops in childhood or adolescence, there is an increased chance that it will persist into adult life, and that is why it is important for overweight people to lose weight.\nThe phenomenal increase in the levels of obesity among children can be attributed to unhealthy eating habits. The food we eat is extremely high in calories and fat, and more often than not, children tend to prefer processed foods over fresh foods. Moreover, more and more people tend to eat out at restaurants and fast food outlets nowadays. Fast food contains more calories and a single meal at a fast food outlet provides a person with the total number of calories he needs of an entire day. There are numerous vending machines in many schools selling carbonated drinks, while school canteens offer students unhealthy food choices.\n\nToday, as a result of technological advancements and conveniences, we tend to be inactive and lead sedentary lifestyles. Children spend hours in front of televisions and play computer games. Many children are not active enough to use up the energy provided by the food they consume. The many conveniences which are available such as elevators, cars and the Internet reduce the level of physical activity. The lack of physical activity means fewer calories are being burned, leading to weight gain and obesity. The lack of physical education classes in schools for children further compounds the problem.\n\nObesity has many attendant risks and effects. If you think that the bulging mass of fat under your arms or in your belly, thighs and other parts of your anatomy is the only effect of obesity, then you are sadly mistaken. Obesity is not merely a cosmetic problem that denies you the pleasure of looking smart and fit. It is a health hazard that puts you at risk of developing various life-threatening diseases. Many serious medical condition have been linked with obesity, including heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer and stroke. Obese people are also likely to feel depressed as they often become objects of ridicule.\n\nThe best way to avoid obesity and its effects is to maintain a healthy weight through healthy eating habits and regular exercise. Children should avoid eating fast food and junk food. They should also exercise regularly and be active throughout the day. At the same time, they should avoid watching too much television or using the computer for hours at a stretch.\n\nChildren must realize that if they take in more calories than they burn, they will gain weight. On the other hand, if they burn more calories than they ingest, they will lose weight."

Despite this, Grandpa was always in high spirits. He started working at the young age of 16. He started work as a laborer and later, a gardener. His honesty and diligence got the attention of his employer who soon asked him to take care of his large orchard. Grandpa saved whatever little he could.

I knew that the heavy rain during the past week must have taken its toll on the hill slopes.

Most of them play truant because of negative peer influence. they follow their friends who skip school. Financial problems can also cause a student  to stay away from school. This explains why students who play truant are mainly from the lower income groups. Learning problems is another cause of truancy. Students who find academic subjects difficult or boring would prefer to play truant. Some students who are addicted to drugs or alcohol will frequently be absent. The fear of bullying or harassment may also cause timid students to play truant.\n\nIf left unchecked, truancy can lead to juvenile delinquency and numerous other negative outcomes. Youths who play truant have an increased risk of dropping out of school. School dropouts are more likely to be unemployed as prospective employers are concerned about attendance of their potential employees. Regular school attendance is also important for academic success. If a student often plays truant, he may fail in his examinations. Students who play truant also have low self-esteem and become social misfits.\n\nTo curb truancy, initiatives must be taken. Prevention is the key. Early intervention can tackle the problem. Students who often skip classes should be given counseling. Parents should check with teachers and school authorities periodically to monitor students' attendance. Police patrols will also deter repeat offenders."

        "content": "The mass media is flooded with advertisements of every kind. One only has to flip through the pages of magazines or newspapers or sit through a television program to see the wide coverage that advertisements receive in terms of space and time. Companies fork out large amounts of money just to advertise their products or services.\nWhat, the, are the benefits of advertisements ? Advertisements offer a wide variety of options to both potential buyers and sellers. Through advertisements, employers can recruit workers. People who wish to put up their properties for sale can find buyers or vice versa.\n\nAlthough there are grouses about advertisements, the numerous benefits of advertisements remain undisputed. Advertisements are the lifeblood of many television and radio stations. Many companies build a reputation for their products through advertisements. Sometimes companies sponsor major sporting events and help in the development of sports in the country.\n\nAdvertisements inform the public about the wide array of products that are available in the market an dhow much they cost. Customers can compare the prices and merits of the different products and then decide which product to buy. Advertisements help increase the sales volume of products. In this way, companies expand their business and enjoy economies of scale.\n\nAs with most things in life, advertisements can be both a bane or a boon. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the advantages of advertisements far outweigh the disadvantages and it is up to the discerning public to discard the advertisements which do not profess the truth."

        "content": "A recent health survey indicates that lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, heart attacks, strokes and certain types of cancers are on the rise. Bulging waistlines, obesity and clogged arteries are becoming more common as the Chinese continue with their unhealthy lifestyles. Our preoccupation with tasty but unhealthy meals as well as our increasingly inactive or sedentary lifestyles have taken a toll on our health. The government's call for the Chinese to live healthy lifestyles have fallen on deaf ears. As a result, we have a growing generation of couch potatoes.\nThe Chinese have to give top priority to ways of keeping fit if they wish to live a disease-free life. Keeping fit requires sacrifice, determination and discipline.\n\nOur exotic cuisines are enough to whet anyone's appetite. Our choice of food almost always includes food that appeal to the taste buds regardless of whether they have nutritional value or otherwise. As a result, we gorge ourselves on food that has a high oil content such as fried chicken and french fries. To make matters worse, many of us have a sweet tooth. When calorie intake exceeds output, the inevitable is bound to occur -- obesity and an inactive lifestyle.\n\nWhat we need to do is shed all the extra weight by reducing our calorie intake and by exercising. Choosing nutritious food that is relatively low in calories is a move in the right direction. If we need to go on a diet o weight reduction program, then it is best we consult a qualified nutritionist or dietician.\n\nWhen buying food, choose products with healthier ingredients. When you eat out, choose dishes that have less fat or oil content.\n\nExercise is an integral part of keeping fit. Regular exercise not only helps to manage weight, but also increases fitness levels. A person need not have vigorous workouts in the gym to keep himself fit. Brisk walking or even walking up the stairs instead of using the life are good forms of exercise. Health experts recommend that an individual exercise at least three times a week with each session lasting for about 20 to 30 minutes.\n\nKeeping fit also requires changes in other aspects of our lifestyles. Smoking and drinking alcohol can wreak havoc on our health. Smoking increases the risks of developing certain types of cancers while heavy drinking can lead to liver damage. A chain-smoker and a heavy drinker cannot hope to live a long, disease-free life. Habitual smokers and drinkers not only have to fork out large amounts of money for cigarettes and alcohol, but also for higher medical bills.\n\nLife is a precious gift from God. It is the duty of every individual to value this gift. Keeping fit is therefore our responsibility. Shirking from our responsibility indicates either ignorance of indifference. We have to get our priorities right before we become victims of our own careless habits."

Since moving into our new home in the countryside, my brother, Jim and I used to often sneak out to the pond where we would meet another friend. Dad had warned us not to venture anywhere near the pond area, especially after a friend informed him that an alligator had been spotted there. We took no heed of his advice though. This was our favorite hideout and we were certainly not going to give it up.\n\nOn this particular afternoon, the three of us had just finished swimming. Jim and Syed were reluctantly making their way towards the spot where they had left their clothes. I stayed back and was bathing in the waist-deep water when I suddenly became aware of ripples forming in the surface of the water. I cocked my head and looked at the ripples. My eyes caught a motion in the water. A log, I thought. Then I saw it -- its snout and its two reptilian eyes. 'Jim ...\" I whimpered. Then I screamed with all my might.\n\nJim turned his head in my direction and immediately recognized the danger. 'Get out of the water, Jeff. Hurry ! It's just behind you.'\n\nI waded clumsily in the water. After a few stumbles and fumbles, I reached the edge of the pond. I looked over my shoulder. Moving swiftly towards me was an enormous alligator. I froze. Then suddenly I felt a searing pain in my leg. Meanwhile, Jim and Syed screamed and started throwing stones at the alligator and managed to distract it. The alligator went for them now. As it opened its jaws, I could see its jagged teeth. I tried to move but a stabbing pain shot through me. I slumped onto the ground, sprawled in a pool of blood.\n\nMeanwhile our screams were heard by two hunters who were in the vicinity. On seeing the alligator, one of them fired a shot in the air. It had the desired effect. The alligator stopped in his tracks, retreated a few steps and slithered hurriedly into the water. Then, I passed out.\n\nWhen I regained consciousness, I found myself in a totally unfamiliar environment. The smell of antiseptic told me that I was in the hospital. I later learnt from my mother that I was rushed to the casualty ward. I was treated for puncture wounds on my right ankle and a long gash which required fifty-six stitches. Mum reminded me how fortunate I was to have escaped from the jaws of the alligator. It was a narrow escape."

What are these events and what causes them ?\nThe earth is a dynamic entity that is undergoing changes all the time. Normal changes such as those occurring to the weather and the seasons are part and parcel of living. We live our lives according to these changes regardless of whether we like it or not. However, sometimes the forces of nature cause great and drastic changes, and for us puny human beings, the effect can be disastrous.\n\nThere are many types of natural events that can spell disaster for us. They include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, droughts, tidal waves, tsunamis, fires, landslides, and avalanches.\n\nThe earth crust is made up of a number of plates that sit on a sea of lava beneath. At some places on the crust, lava, ash, smoke etc breaks through and the result is volcanic eruptions. Sometimes the eruption is so violent that it destroys living things that are near it. The eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD destroyed the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum. In 1883, the catastrophic explosion of Krakatoa off the west coast of Java generated tsunamis that killed hundreds of thousands of people in Indonesia. In 2004, underwater volcanic eruptions in the Indian Ocean caused tsunamis that again killed hundreds of thousands living nearby.\n\nThe plates of the earth crust are not static. They push and grind against one another producing earthquakes that sometimes cause widespread destruction to the affected area.\n\nIn addition to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, other natural phenomena also brings destruction. In Malaysia, the Northeast monsoon rains that come around December bring floods to the east coast of the peninsula. In Australia, bushfires in summer destroy vast tracts of land. Snowstorms in the polar regions of the earth cut the residents from the rest of the world. Droughts in parts of India and Africa cause famine and tragedy.\n\nNo place on earth is totally free from disaster-causing events. We can only do our best to deal with these events when they occur. People and property are inevitably destroyed. Those who survive pick up the pieces and continue living."

The restaurant was about half full.\n\nDirectly in my line of view were several other customers, but I noticed one man in particular who was sitting with his back to me. He was seated in an awkward position, hands on the table but with the top half of his body slowly but surely leaning more and more to one side, as if he was about to fall off the chair. Just as I thought he would surely fall off, his body pulled itself upright. Wow, he must either be very sleepy or very drunk. Judging the beer bottles in front of him, it must be the latter.\n\nMy food came and I started eating, but I could not help but notice that the man in front was again leaning more and more to one side. And once again he pulled himself upright at the last moment.\n\nI took my eyes off him and concentrated on eating my food.

This time he had actually fallen off his chair. Miraculously the beer bottles were still on the table.\n\nMy first reaction was to go and help him up but I noticed that no one in the restaurant had moved. In fact they were behaving as though it was small matter. Most of them took one look and continued their meal. Strange, I thought. This made me hesitate. I did not know what to do.\n\nFor a minute I just sat there looking at the prostrate figure wondering if he was still alive or merely sleeping, should I help or should I do something. Not knowing what to do is a terrible feeling. Finally, the restaurant owner appeared and muttered in Chinese, \"This useless fellow.\" He then got hold the man's hands and dragged him out of the restaurant onto the five-foot way and out of sight of the customers.\n\nAfter finishing my meal, I stepped out of the restaurant. I saw the drunk lying next to a pillar, sleeping and oblivious to everything around him. What a pathetic sight."

        "content": "Rainforests make up some of the most valuable resources we have, yet they are being destroyed in massive proportions. Many medicines, foods, natural insecticides and oil producing trees are found in the rainforest.\nThe rainforest also holds endless possibilities for useful, undiscovered resources. These could include cures for disease and new food crops that will be wiped out before they are found because of the destruction of the rainforests.\n\nThe rainforest is also home to millions of species of animals, plants and insects as well. It is estimated that five out of six rainforest species have never been seen. This adds up to millions of organisms that have never before been encountered. This demonstrates that more species live in the rainforest than any other ecosystem on earth, and we are obliterating their on habitat.\n\nThe rainforest is also a big producer of the world's oxygen supply. When we destroy the rainforest, we are destroying our own oxygen supply. Massive destruction of our precious rainforests is caused by logging, colonization due to overpopulation, and cattle ranching.\n\nThe first major cause of mass destruction of the rainforest is logging. There can be as many as 200 different species of trees on one acre of land.\n\nThis high number of different species of trees means there is only a few commercially valuable trees per acre. Trees considered commercially valuable are mahogany and tropical cedar. These trees and used for panelling, and building boats an furniture.\n\nLoggers must bulldoze roads through the forest to find enough of these valuable trees to make a profit. This consumes many other trees that are in the way of the road. The trees in the rainforest are connected a the top with vines, so when one commercially valuable tree gets cut down, on average 17 other non-commercially valuable trees fall down with t. Because of these practices, the logging industry can eradicate 30 percent of a rainforest where only a few commercially valuable trees were cut down. At this rat, they will be able to clear out whole rainforest sin a few years. After the loges themselves destroy so much rainforest, the roads they leave behind induce the next phase of rainforest destruction: colonization.\n\nAnother major cause of mass rainforest destruction is colonization. Roads left behind by loggers make the rainforest accessible to farmers looking for a place to live and grow crops. Farm families clear and burn the remains of the forest to plant crops to keep and sell. These families clear more land than they need to show others that they own it and have \"developed\" it. These colonists are forced to move to the rainforest because there is no room anywhere else for them to live.\n\nMost of the land is owned by large corporations, so families feel lucky if they are fortunate enough to have their own land in the rainforest. Population growth forces the people to move to the rainforest. Even if farm families can get their own plot of rainforest land, it is not long before they have to move again and clear out more rainforest. Rainforest land loses nutrients quickly after it has been cleared, and it soon becomes eroded and infertile. Since crops won't grow after this happens, farm families willingly sell the bad land to commercial companies. These companies then use the acquired land to form large produce export plantations or cattle ranching: the most destructive form of land use.\n\nThe final major cause of mass rainforest destruction is cattle ranching. Cattle ranching in the rainforest yields very low amounts of beef, but it is replacing farming that was more productive.\n\nCattle ranching yields 91 pounds of beef per acre per year, where as corn yields 5,000 pounds per acre per year. This is a very inefficient use of the land, and is also bad for the economy. After five to ten years of mediocre beef yields; erosion, weeds and loss of fertility force the ranchers to look for more land. The ranchers keep moving farther into the rainforest and clearing more land in a big cycle. Also, raising cattle requires less labor, so there are fewer jobs. The people without jobs are just more people who wan to move to the rainforest. The land just keeps getting cleared and burned until there is no rainforest left.\n\nThe rainforest gives us so much, and has so many possibilities, yet we are clearing and burning it down. Animals, plants and insects are being eradicated at the rate of 1,000 species per year. If the rainforest keeps being destroyed at the current rate, it is 10,000 species will be wiped out per year. If we want to save the earth, we must start with the rainforests. They are the connection between man and nature, and if the human race wants to save the planet, the first step is saving the rainforest. The rainforests are the most valuable resources we have."

Most of the residents in my area remained confined indoors. Apart from people scurrying to and from work and school, there was little outdoor activity.\nThe town where I live, Kuantan, faces the Pahang River. After three days of incessant rain, the swollen river burst its banks and unleashed its fury on the residents. Many of the residents ere caught off-guard.

However, the sudden floods in the middle of the year caused jitters among the residents.\n\nHouses were inundated. The heavy downpour also triggered landslides, causing further damage to houses. The heavy rain caused traffic woes as many vehicles were stalled. Some motorists were seen pushing their stalled vehicles while others were stranded.\n\nWhen the rain did not abate after two consecutive days, people began to be evacuated to higher ground. Many took shelter in a secondary school nearby which was turned into a temporary relief center. Most of the residents did not have time to salvage their belongings. Several residents from nearby villages were marooned in the area after road links were cut off by the floodwaters.\n\nVarious authorities were deployed to help evacuate and supply food to the flood victims. Strong winds aggravated the situation as several trees were uprooted. Roofs of houses were ripped off and went hurtling away n the fierce winds.\n\nAfter a week of continuous downpour, the rain finally showed signs of abating. The overcast skies finally cleared. The faint glow of the sun's rays brought cheer and relief to the people affected by the floods. People started to return to their homes.

There were only 12 cases of bullying in 2010. The number increased to 18 cases in 2009, 20 cases in 2011 and 25 cases this year. This is an unhealthy trend and if left unchecked, it can become a problem.\nVerbal bullying, which includes name-calling and insulting remarks, accounted for 45 per cent of bullying cases. This was followed by indirect bullying, which includes spreading nasty and malicious stories. It accounted for 35 per cent of all bullying cases. Physical bullying accounted for one-fifth of the cases.\n\nBullying occurs for a number of reasons. Often, bullying behavior develops in response to the environment, whether it is at home, school or within a peer group. Bullies usually come from homes where physical punishment i used. In such a scenario, physical punishment is seen as a way to handle problems. The child then resorts to aggressive behavior. Negative peer influence can further aggravate the problem. With the absence of a proper role model both at home and in school, children have no opportunity to learn behavior skills. As a result, bullies tend to derive satisfaction from inflicting injury or suffering to others without feeling empathy for their victims.\n\nClose monitoring by parents and school authorities can curb bullying. Parents must monitor their children's activities. Those who are at the receiving end and bystanders must report all incidents of bullying. The school must enlist the help of parents when dealing with such cases. Schools must have clear rules against bullying. Repeat offenders must face the music. If the offender does not turn over a new leaf, he should be suspended or expelled from school. The use of deterrents sends a clear and strong message to perpetrators that bullying is unacceptable."

If this mountain of waste is disposed of properly, then we have little to worry about. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Litter is strewn all over the country -- in car parks, empty lots, back lanes, drains, rivers -- practically everywhere. the sights are all so familiar, the stench is overpowering, yet we display our indifference. The crux of the problem is attitude.\n\nIn response to this, the government has begun a recycling campaign as a long-term measure to ensure the efficient management of waste. Recycling involves the separating of rubbish -- metal, glass, plastic and paper. the waste is then taken to collection centers which turn the waste materials into reusable products. Recycling is an efficient method of reducing waste without polluting the environment. It also cuts down the use of raw materials and energy required to produce new products.\n\nOther waste disposal methods come with attendant risks to health and the environment. One of the most common methods of waste disposal is landfills where waste is dumped and left to decompose. While landfills are convenient and cheap, they release toxic gases. Landfill gas can kill vegetation. Methane, a greenhouse gas, is released when landfill waste decomposes and this also contributes to global warming. Besides, decaying waste also attracts pests such as rats and carrion-eating birds.\n\nWaste materials can be burned in incinerators. When waste in burned, carbon dioxide and other hazardous air pollutants are released into the atmosphere. Thus, although this method is a convenient and quick way of getting rid of waste, it has its disadvantages as well.\n\nNow that we all realize the environmental degradation that ensues from the country's waste, let us be more responsible citizens. The more waste we generate, the more we have to dispose of and the more waste we dispose of, the more money we will have to pay. We have no choice but to heed the government's call to reduce, reuse and recycle."

The title of my speech is 'Social ills among teenagers'. A lot has been said about the deviant behavior of teenagers. Our education system, the media, teenagers themselves and their parents have been blamed. here is no need to point an accusing finger at any particular group, but keeping mum over the issue is tantamount to condoning it. Our youths are our most valuable assets. They are the future leaders of the nation. The harm has already been done and it is now up to us to undo it.\n\nOne of the main reasons why our youths go astray may be the lack of parental supervision. Nowadays, both parents go out to work. Children are left in the care of foreign maids and child-minders. As a result, they are faced with the threat of the disintegration of the family values and thus, the rising trend in social ills and crimes among teenagers. Parents should closely monitor the activities of their children and be understanding.\n\nWhen parents are often too busy pursuing their own careers to spare some thought for the welfare of their children, children grow up with little religious or moral guidance. When they do not get love and attention at home, they seek attention from others who may or may not come from similar backgrounds. Thus, the social ills affecting our youth may be a reflection of a much larger problem, such as the disintegration of the family unit.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the media may also play a part in the moral degradation among teenagers. Television programs which show violence and sex and glorify other negative aspects should be restricted. There should also be stricter enforcement of the ban on pornographic material.\n\nTeenagers with little or nothing to do during their spare time usually take to the streets. Therefore, recreational facilities such as those found in sports complexes should be available to all youths. at present, existing recreational facilities seem to either be exclusively for the rich or for older people. the establishment of teen clubs and community centers, that do not charge high fees and that specially target teenagers, should be given top priority.\n\nIn conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, everyone, including religious, educational and social institutions, as well as individuals and the media, must cooperate with the authorities to combat the social ills afflicting our teenagers. It is important that people, especially youths, do not get into the rut of moral decay. There should be a thorough study of the problem before a proper strategy can be mapped out to channel our youths towards healthier lifestyles.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and have a nice day."

This type of rain damages trees, crops and buildings. Industries and power stations release a lot of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Exhaust fumes and open-air burning release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. When these gases enter the atmosphere, they mix with rain water to form acids like carbonic acid, sulphuric acid and nitric acid. They then form acid rain.\n\nAcid rain occurs as a result of pollution. Acid rain is thus common in large towns like Bangalore, New Delhi, Mumbai. This is attributed to rapid industrialization and urbanization in these areas. However, acid rain is by no means confined to these areas as it may be carried by wind to other areas.\n\nAcid rain has many adverse effects. Lakes and rivers cannot sustain aquatic life if acid rain flows into the water. It will also lead to a reduction in crop yields. There will also be irreparable damage to forests and wildlife. Being corrosive, it can cause extensive damage to buildings. An example of an important building that has been corroded by acid rain is the Taj Mahal of India. Acid rain cal also affect human beings. Skin problems such as rashes and itchiness, hair loss and respiratory problems have been linked to acid rain. Heart and lung problems can also be aggravated by it.\n\nAcid rain affects the biodiversity of the ecosystems. As lakes, streams and other freshwater bodies become more acidic, the number and types of fish and other aquatic plants and animals that live in these waters decrease.\n\nAcid rain causes poisonous metals to seep into underground drinking water sources, thereby making it unfit for human consumption.\n\nWhen acid rain falls in forest areas, it releases toxic metals such as lead and zinc which cause the stunted growth of trees and plants. In this way, acid rain brings about slower growth and the ultimate death of forests.\n\nScientists agree that the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas is a major cause of acid rain. Thus, industries which use fossil fuels such as the automobile, paper and chemical industries should reduce emissions of harmful gases, which will in turn reduce the acidity of rain."

        "content": "Write a speech on the topic: preventing burglary at home.\n \nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Until recently, our residential area had been one of the few residential areas in the country to enjoy a zero-crime rate. However, a spate of break-ins and snatch thefts has occurred in our area in the past three months. If we are not vigilant, there could be an upsurge in such incidents.\nIn my speech today, I would like to outline several measures that can be taken to reduce the number of break-ins in our area.\n\nBreak-ins often occur when the occupants of a house are not at home. They can also occur due to the carelessness of house-owners. So the first thing to do is to fix grilles and to get reliable deadbolt locks. In some isolated cases, there have been reports about burglars prising grilles open. Installing a burglar alarm reduces the risk of forced entry.\n\nThe next precaution that should be taken is to avoid providing any telltale signs of your absence. Should you and your family go on holiday or outstation, inform your immediate neighbors. Ask one of your neighbors to collect your newspapers and mail. Uncollected mail and newspapers gives the impression that the house occupants are away. it is always better to inform the police when you are going outstation. The police will then be on the lookout and send police cars to patrol your neighborhood.\n\nMake sure the areas outside your house, especially the porch and the backyard, are well lit. A brightly-lit area deters a burglar from breaking into the house.\n\nOnce inside your house, make sure the doors and windows are properly shut. Install peepholes with magnifying lenses to let you see who is at the door without opening it. Have telephones within reach. Place emergency numbers near every phone. Keep your handphones switched on before you go to sleep.\n\nIf you can afford it, you can even install a closed-circuit television to monitor activities inside and outside your home.\n\nThese are some of the ways to prevent burglaries in your home. If you have not taken any of these measures, then perhaps you should do so now. It is always 'better to be late than never.'\n\nThank you"

        "content": "Write a speech on the measures that should be taken to preserve wildlife\n \nGood morning, teachers and friends. Never has a wildlife faced such great threats of extinction as in the last few decades. We bulldoze forests to make way for concrete jungles, depriving many species of the flora and fauna native to their habitats. We dump all types of waste into our rivers and seas, doing irreparable damage to freshwater and marine species. We hunt for sport and use animal parts to cater to our exotic tastes. All our actions are resulting in the dwindling of wildlife. We are losing plant and animal species at an accelerated rate.\nLadies and gentlemen, what can we do to stop this massacre ? Firstly, wildlife trade should be banned. The authorities should strictly prohibit the sale of animals and animal parts whether it is for medicinal or for other purposes. Forests are habitats for numerous species of flora and fauna. Dwindling forests means dwindling wildlife. Therefore, forests should be preserved. Promulgating laws alone will not be an effective deterrent. Offenders should be punished. The authorities should invoke the full weight of the law to make offenders cease their illegal trade.\n\nFor wild life species that face the threat of extinction, the authorities should make a concerted effort to conserve them. The creation of forest reserves and animal sanctuaries will prevent animal and plant species from being wiped out. The success of the Sepilok Orangutan rehabilitation Center is Sabah is a clear example of how effective such conservation programs are. Similarly, the establishment of marine parks can protect both marine life and their habitats from being destroyed.\n\nScientific research can single out threats to flora and fauna species and also discover ways of tackling these threats effectively. Monetary incentives such as grants from the government will encourage scientific research. the mass media and television programs like National Geographic can instil awareness in the public on the need to preserve biodiversity. Coverage of wildlife issues should be increased.\n\nThe public, too, should play its part. As green consumers, we can refuse to buy products that make sue of animal parts.\n\nIf the authorities, the private sector and the public play their part, we can put a stop to practices that endanger wildlife."

        "content": "Write a speech on ways of reducing pollution which is to be delivered during assembly on World Environment Day.\n \nGood morning teachers and friends. In conjunction with World Environment Day, I would like to give a talk on the ways of reducing pollution.\nPollution was once thought to be the inevitable price of modernization and industrialization. Today, efforts to reduce environmental pollution are slowly gaining momentum.\n\nFirst of all, existing laws and regulations aimed at reducing pollution should be strictly enforced. Toxic waste and fumes from industries are among the major causes of pollution. Instead of indiscriminate dumping of waste and unchecked emission of toxic fumes, industries should be equipped with proper waste-treatment systems. The move towards installing catalytic converters and using lead-free petrol is also commendable, as exhaust fumes from vehicles contribute greatly to air pollution. The Department of Environment and the Road Transport Department, respectively, should ensure that industries and vehicle owner comply with environmental regulations.\n\nAnother important step to curb pollution is to educate the public on the effects of pollution and how they can help protect the environment. Many people are still ignorant of the effects on the environment due to the use of materials such as aerosol sprays with cholorofluorocarbons, which destroy the ozone layer, or disposable plastic products, which are virtually indestructible. Many people also do not know that plastic, glass and paper can be recycled and thus prevent pollution by reducing waste. when the public is better informed, efforts to reduce pollution will be more effective.\n\nLastly, we should buy environmentally safe products and these should be reasonably priced to be attractive to the average consumer. For example, not many consumers are aware of the existence of biodegradable products and their benefits in cutting down environmental pollution. furthermore, many consumers who would be interested in buying recycled or environmentally friendly products are put off by the high prices charged for them. As such, there should be more encouragement for consumers to buy environmentally friendly products.\n\nReducing pollution requires efforts by all parties concerned -- the government, industries and consumers. Stricter control, more public awareness and reasonable pricing for 'green' products will all help in reducing pollution in the country. So ladies and gentlemen, let us do our part in reducing pollution.\n\nThank you"

It was almost 1 a.m. Mrs Lim was one of my neighbors who lived down the street with her old, invalid husband. My instincts told me that Mrs Lim needed help.\n'It 's my husband. I think he's having a heart attack. Can you help me ?' she blurted out, in between sobs. With lightning speed, I changed my clothes. Then, I followed Mrs Lim to her house. The whole house was a little musty. As this was my first visit to the Lims' residence, I had a quick glance around the living room. There were wall panels covered with watercolor landscapes, engravings and cross-stitch pieces. Along the corridor leading to the kitchen was Mr Lim, slumped in an armchair. He appeared to be gasping for breath. With Mrs Lim's help, I managed to carry him to the porch where their car was parked. when we finally managed to get him inside the car, I drove to the hospital.\n\nWe rushed him to the emergency and casualty ward. The doctor on duty informed us that Mr Lim had suffered a mild stroke. Mr Lim was admitted tot eh intensive care unit. Mrs Lim and I kept an all-night vigil. It was then that Mrs Lim asked me to contact her son and convey the news. I never knew that Mr and Mrs Lim had children. All this while, I thought that the Lims had no children. I could not recall a time when they ever mentioned a son. I tried to contact the son at the given address, but I was told that he had moved to another town with his wife and children I could see the pain in Mrs Lim's face as I told her the news.\n\nAs I was driving home, I told myself that I would call my own parents. I had not contacted them for almost a month and my conscience haunted me. They had looked after me for a good part of their lives. I was sobbing terribly all the way home, ashamed of my neglect.\n\nMr Lim was discharged after ten days. He made a speedy recovery. Apart from his slurred speech, he appeared hale and hearty a month after the incident.\n\nThe incident has helped me to get my priorities right. It has also made me realize that when we give a helping hand to those who need our assistance, the world will be a better place to live in."

        "content": "Tuition centers have become a booming industry, raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars. On the average, parents fork out about $100 to $200 for each child per month. Today, more and more teachers are giving tuition as it has become a major money-spinner for them. What has triggered this phenomenon ? Are schoolteachers shirking their duties or are parents just afraid that their children will be left behind in the paper chase ?\nThe rationale in sending students for tuition is to help them better understand what has been taught in school. Students who are slow in grasping what is taught in schools can attend tuition classes to catch up and improve their performance.\n\nMoreover, in schools, teachers have a limited time to teach students. There are only about five to six lessons a week for most subjects, including English, Mathematics and science. The time allotted is clearly insufficient for weak students to understand a particular subject. A the same time, teachers have less teaching time due to increasing paperwork and other duties. Teachers are forced to rush through the syllabus because of time constraints, thus leaving students in the lurch.\n\nClasses in school are too big and teachers do not have enough time to give personal attention to teach and every student. On the other hand, tuition classes have a smaller number of students, making personal attention possible. Thriving on the education system's weaknesses, tuition centers have gained popularity among both students and parents.\n\nParents, too, prefer to send their children for tuition. Parents who want their children to excel in their studies are willing to spend large amounts of money on tuition fees. Nowadays, due to work commitments, parents are away from home for the greater part of the day. Parents would prefer to send their children for tuition just to keep their offspring from getting involved in undesirable activities or from idling their time away. At the same time, parents who are not highly educated prefer to send their children for tuition.\n\nFor students who are unable to get personal attention in school and for those who have difficulty assimilating what is taught in schools, tuition is definitely a must, as the gain is more than the cost. Teachers should be allowed to give tuition to improve students' performances."

        "content": "The death penalty should be abolished. Do you agree ?\n \nThe death penalty or capital punishment is still being practiced in many countries. Criminals who are put on the death row include those who are arrested for drug trafficking and those who commit murders.\nIn Asia, death by hanging is the most common method of capital punishment. Among the countries, lethal injections, electrocution and death by a firing squad are more common.\n\nShould the death penalty be abolished ? The proponents for the death penalty feel that the punishment meted out to a criminal should reflect the seriousness of the crime. If this line of argument is followed, then a person who kills deserves to die. In other words, a person who takes another person's life, forfeits his won right to live.\n\nAnother argument is that the death penalty is an effective deterrent to crime. If murderers and drug dealers know that they will be punished by death, they will be less likely to commit the crimes.\n\nThe main purpose of capital punishment is to isolate criminals from society so that they will not have the opportunity to repeat their crimes.\n\nWhatever the reasons are for defending the death penalty, I feel that it is an archaic form of punishment that has no place in a modern, civilized world.\n\nIt is true that crimes of a serious nature deserve severe punishment. But taking a person's life in return is equivalent to taking revenge or 'an eye for an eye'. Two wrongs do not make a right. Hence, when we put criminals on death row, we are stooping to their level. Instead, if a serious crime is committed, the criminal should be sentenced to life imprisonment. By spending the rest of their lives in prison, these criminals would have time to reflect on their misdeeds and repent.\n\nNo matter how careful and fair the judicial system is, the possibility of perjured testimony and human error always remains too real a threat to be brushed aside. If a member of the jury makes a mistake, a person can be falsely accused of a crime. If the death penalty is meted out to a person who did not commit the crime, then the sentence cannot be revoked.\n\nIt is not true that the threat of capital punishment reduces the number of violent crimes because most crimes are committed on the spur of the moment or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Many offenders, therefore, do not think about the consequences of their crimes.\n\nPreventing crimes from happening is the most effective way to deter crime. Increased surveillance or police patrols, an increase in the number of police officers and a strict control on the availability of weapons are more practical alternatives in the practice of crime prevention.\n\nFor these reasons, capital punishment should be abolished."

As more and more women are also getting an education there are greater employment opportunities for them.\n\nIn spite of this, there is a greater need for women to stay home and be homemakers. Young children and growing families require the attention of mothers. If women are to spend eight hours each day at work, then the children, especially the very young ones, would have to be left at day care centers, nurseries, with maids, grandparents or relatives.\n\nIt cannot be denied that mothers are the pillars of strength in any family. If they give up their role as homemakers and thrust it onto others, such as maids, then there may be some unpleasant consequences. In some cases, children have been abused and in other cases, they have been greatly influenced by the maids, who are usually foreigners. The children would not only have to learn the language of the maids, but would also be susceptible to the mannerisms, customs and practices that do not belong to their own cultural background.\n\nAs it is expensive to hire maids, in some cases children are left in the care of others who may exert a negative influence on the children's upbringing. It is therefore imperative that mothers should stay at home to care for their children, especially during the crucial period of their growth. Furthermore, mothers would be able to guide and supervise their children in their daily routines and therefore act as role models for their children. When mothers stay at home, they will be able to mould their children better.\n\nIt is said that the generation of tomorrow depends on the mothers of today. Social ills and other socio-cultural problems, faced by both young children and teenagers, could be eradicated if mothers stay at home and not go to work. They will be able to devote more time to caring for their families."

Gone are the good old days when we could roam the streets freely and safely without fear of being robbed, assaulted, kidnapped, raped or even murdered. There have been comments that the authorities have not done enough to fight crime. What people fail to realize is that crime prevention is a shared responsibility. Crime prevention should include the authorities, such as the relevant ministries and government departments, the police, as well as the various NGOs and the public.\nFor their part, the authorities have beefed up the police force and put more police officers on the streets. Non-uniformed personnel have been assigned crime-prevention duties. Moreover, Mobile Police stations and Mobile Police Vehicles have been placed in crime-prone areas. Law enforcement alone is not enough. Law enforcers can only patrol areas periodically. They cannot possibly be everywhere all the time. It is the members of the public who can provide the police with relevant information, report the dangers that lurk in their neighborhoods or report suspicious characters. We have to be the eyes and ears of the police if we wish to eradicate crime.\n\nWe can also play our part in fighting crime by organizing neighborhood patrols. Residents can form their own residents' associations and link up with police stations nearby. It is only when the public become more vigilant and work hand-in-hand with the police that we see a significant reduction in crime.\n\nMore crime prevention campaigns should be organized to reinforce public awareness on the need to act together to combat crime. The media should not only report sensational news, such as brutal killings and grisly murders. It should educate the public on crime prevention. With responsible reporting, the media can help to create awareness and make the public more safety conscious.\n\nCrime prevention is a collective responsibility. Although police presence has a strong impact on fighting crime, the public too can play its role by improving security on the streets and our neighborhoods. Only then can we help to mitigate crime. We must come together in a true spirit and be resolved to fight crime."

We enjoy higher incomes and better standards of living as a result of progress and development, but happiness has remained a rather elusive goal for many of us. Our pursuit of material wealth and worldly possessions has robbed us of the contentment that we long for.\nWhat is happiness and how can we obtain it ? Happiness can be defined as a state of mind characterized by feelings of contentment, satisfaction and pleasure. People always think that their achievements, education, career, family and financial security can make them happy but later find that happiness is not always the end result. We can own and live in a beautiful home, afford a lavish lifestyle, wear designer clothes or drive expensive cars and yet we may be unhappy. It is a misconception to think that having lots of money can make a person happy. What then can provide lasting happiness ?\n\nAbraham Lincoln once said, 'You are as happy as you make up your mind to be.' Happiness is a matter of choice. We can make a choice to be either happy or sad. Being satisfied with who we are and what we have can make us happy. Unfortunately, there is no short cut to happiness. we should first set our goals and determine the areas in our lives that are important to us. Then we should strive to attain these goals. we should make a conscious attempt to change what we can and accept what we cannot.\n\nBeing optimistic can aid in creasing our happiness. Always think that life is going to get better. It helps to have a positive outlook. Dwelling in the past and ruminating about something that went wrong can lead to depression. At the same time, we should never try to compare ourselves with others. It will only lead to unhappiness. Instead, we should count our blessings and be thankful for all the good things we have -- good health, family, friends and education. Happiness starts at home. Therefore, we should all try to improve our relationship with our parents and siblings.\n\nResearch ha shown that happy people live longer, are healthier and are more successful. they also enjoy more fulfilling relationships and are respected by others. Therefore, instead of brooding over our pains and sorrows, we should always keep ourselves busy and find pleasure in small things."

Snatch thefts tend to escalate during festive seasons and holidays. Hotspots of snatch thefts are quiet and deserted areas such as residential areas, by the roadside, in lifts and around the bank.\nSnatch thieves choose their targets carefully. They often strike when people are off guard. They home in on people who are alone and those who are distracted. Women and senior citizens are especially susceptible as they may be unable to defend themselves. Often the victims are seriously injured or even killed. To avoid becoming potential victims, we should take simple crime prevention measures.\n\nDo not walk alone especially in dark and deserted areas. Take your handbag only if necessary. It is better to carry your purse. Always hold handbags and personal belongings close to the body. If a snatch thief tugs at your handbag, do not hold on to it. Just let it go.

Keep important or valuable items out of sight and be careful of suspicious-looking motorists or persons. Always be alert and attentive to your surroundings.

Students are absent from school every day without a bona fide excuse. The Counseling Club of our school carried out a survey to find out the reasons why the students are absent.\nMost of the students who are absent say that they find the lessons boring. In the light of this revelation, teachers should try and explore creative technologies and teaching ideas to increase student attendance. Obtaining poor grades was another reason for frequent absenteeism. If the school becomes a place where students feel unsuccessful, then they want to avoid it. Therefore, special tutorial programs should be initiated to equip students with adequate academic skills.\n\nPeer influence also has a significant bearing on student attendance. Students often miss class to be in the company of friends. Students who associate with delinquent peer groups are at risk. Student absenteeism may also be a red flag for a more serious problem such as anxiety, loneliness and stress. These students should be sent for counseling sessions. In addition, after school sports and other programs will enable students to make new friends and experience a positive environment. Results of the survey show that lack of parental supervision may also lead to absenteeism among students. As parental involvement relates closely to student attendance and academic progress, parents should be reminded of their responsibilities. School authorities should liaise with police and the local community to patrol neighborhoods where truant students are likely to spend school hours.\n\nOccasional absenteeism among students can be excused. However, frequent absenteeism is a cause for concern as it has often been linked to serious problems such as violence, substance abuse, gang involvement and criminal activity such as burglary and vandalism. Left unaddressed, absenteeism can have significant negative effects on students, the school and on society. Therefore, it is critical to determine the reasons fro absenteeism and identify strategies to tackle the problem."

In conjunction with 'Road Safety Week,' I wish to give a talk on why road accidents occur and the ways to reduce them.\n\nNews about road accidents and road accident fatalities always appear in printed and electronic media. In many cases, schoolchildren are the victims. It is for this reason that our school has decided to launch a 'Road Safety Week' campaign with the aim of raising awareness among the students on the need to be more responsible and cautions while on the road.\n\nWhy do road accidents occur ? According to police statistics, much of the carnage on the roads could have been avoided if road users had exercised patience and caution. Instead, drivers tend to speed, drive recklessly and race on the roads. Motorists are responsible for various other misdemeanors such as weaving in and out of traffic and not paying heed to road conditions. Sometimes road conditions such as the existence of potholes can cause accidents. Another major cause of accidents is the poor maintenance of vehicles. Vehicles with brakes and lights that do not function properly are potential hazards to other road users. Long-distance public transportation drivers can also cause accidents if they drive for long periods and are tired.\n\nSummonses and penalties are ineffective in curbing road accidents. Stiffer penalties such as increasing fines and suspending driving licenses of offenders should be introduced. If a motorist causes an accident, the authorities should confiscate his driving license and suspend him from driving for a certain period of time. Stricter enforcement of traffic rules by the authorities will reduce the number of accidents.\n\nOnly roadworthy vehicles should be allowed on the roads. Vehicles which break down often should be taken off the roads. There is also a clarion call from many quarters to increase the age limit for new drivers. This is one way of getting young motorists off the roads.\n\nIf we do not want accidents to happen, then it is time we changed our driving and riding attitudes. Motorists must ensure that they are courteous on the road and that their vehicles are roadworthy. There should be more awareness campaigns aimed at inculcating good driving habits, especially among schoolchildren.\n\nWhen road users ensure their vehicles are roadworthy, respect the law and think about their safety as well as that of others, then the number of fatalities can be reduced.\n\nThank you"

        "content": "What are your views on condominium living ? Are you in favor of it or not ? State your view\n\n \nThe increasing number of unsolved home burglaries and the horrendous tales of snatch attacks at entrances has made condominium living attractive.\nFirstly, a condominium complex provides security twenty-four hours a day. The guard house at the main entrance with uniformed personnel doing shift work provides an aura of safety. Residents know that any visitor especially strangers have to identify themselves, produce identification and convey information about unit or people they are visiting. Visitor and vehicle screening is very comforting. Patrols are undertaken around the complex to ensure a fair amount of defense.\n\nHowever, not all security firms provide top-rate service. The employees may have a suspicious background, all unknown or unrevealed to the employer. Trusting security personnel to carry out their work without checking into the background can prove to be very damaging to the residents.\n\nSecondly, there are certain facilities which are provided at the condominium. There is normally a swimming pool, an outdoor park and playground, tennis and squash courts. Sometimes, some come with golfing facilities or even subsidized affiliation to golf clubs which come under the flagship of the developer.\n\nThe maintenance of all exterior premises and facilities and the facade of the building is under the condominium management. They ensure that the parking bays, the gardens, the common corridors, the lifts, the facilities (eg. the swimming pool, games courts) and the exterior walls are properly maintained.\n\nHowever, maintenance is more often than not efficiently done and the work is not up to par. To add insult to injury, all residents including owners have to pay monthly maintenance fees which can come up to a princely amount annually. If the maintenance is well done, then it is worth doling out the payment but not otherwise. Then maintenance of the interior is the onus of the resident or owner. This in itself can be quite an arduous task.\n\nThirdly, the management advocates a uniformity in certain aspects of condominium living. Flower beds are to be planted with the same variety of flowers and plants. Curtains have to be of a certain material and color. It does take away the tedium of selection and doing all the tedious humdrum tasks and makes life less of a chore.\n\nOn the other hand, such uniformity can be dictatorial and takes away the versatility of tenants and owners. There is no freedom of choice. Everyone has to kowtow to a regime.\n\nIn the final analysis, condominium living has more plus factors. Security exists which does not exist in non-gated communities. Facilities are provided at a fee with certain perks thrown in without having to pay an astronomical entrance fee to certain \"royal\" clubs. Maintenance is a \"stressfree\" affair with the condo management getting all the headaches.\n\nIn conclusion, if I have the money, I think I would opt for an apartment in a condominium. All my troubles are over ! I can sleep in peace, without being awakened from sleep staring at a stranger's face !"

You could say it is lower middle class but my parents manage to put food on the table, send us to school, pay the fees and occasionally treat us to \"cheap\" school outings [which actually are school sponsored] or an annual fast-food treat (yummy KFC). We are happy, united and able to laugh at our lack of nature comforts. Being able to accept our lot make us more determined to create opportunities. The environment is our teacher.\n\nHowever, when I look at some of my schoolmates who come from broken homes and are traumatized by their conditions, I realize the environment can have a negative effect on the child.\n\nMy first conclusion is that the environment is important to the extent that the individual can cope with the lack or the excesses.\n\nMy second evidence stems from my entry into the residential school system. I was plucked out from my 'stable' home environment and thrown into the wilderness, a completely alien world to join 13-year old girls and boys in a boarding school. Here, we have wardens to keep a vigilant eye on us and the school has rules and regulations which cover the whole gamut of our life for the days we are in school. Occasionally during weekends, term breaks and holidays, we make the journey home but we come to regard the school as our first home. we learn discipline and time management.\n\nI find that many take to the system like a duck to water but there are some who could not adapt to it. Some of them come from good homes, rich background with some from marginally deprived situations. The figures show that from within each group, there are a few dropouts or some who manage to swim and not drown. some from poor homes made fantastic improvements, some ho were high achievers did not succeed eventually. To some the environment spurs them to excel, to some the environment is a hindrance.\n\nThe second conclusion is a mixture of the environment and heredity working in tandem so it really boils down to the individual to utilise all that he possesses to achieve his dreams.\n\nMy last evidence is when I compare my abilities with those of my siblings. I am good at languages, science and mathematics but a fumbler when it comes to nuts and bolts and art. My younger brother could dismantle a bicycle and put I all together again in a jiffy. My demure quiet sister draws and colors \"dreams\". My brother repairs my bicycle, my sister puts the finishing touches to my artistic goofs while I coach all in languages and Mathematics. I could not put our \"achievements\" to the environment but to the genes inherited from both parents.\n\nThe third conclusion leans towards heredity as the \"element\" responsible for the latent talent which only needs to be nurtured by the environment to flower and bloom.\n\nLooking back in retrospect, I believe that the environment fine tunes the inherited characteristics and makes room for latent talents to emerge. Added to these two elements is the inherent nature of the individual who nurtures his dreams into reality and realization.\n\nThe evidences and the conclusions point towards the fusion of the two: in some cases the environment determines the future and in other cases heredity dominates. Which reigns falls solely on the individual; he charts his own course in life."

        "title": "Civil service or government employment",
        "content": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of employment in the civil service ?\n\n \nEmployment in the civil service refers to employment in the government sector as opposed to the private sector.\nWhat attracts the job seeker to the government sector ad not to the private sector ?\n\nFirstly, there is the job security factor. Once an applicant is successful in being offered employment, he is well assured of being employed as long as he does not create anarchy or break too many General Orders. Even if he is guilty of a few indiscretions, he will most probably get away with it without any serious repercussions. At the most, he will be given verbal then written warnings, even counseling. Sometimes he is downgraded and his job is not at stake. The starting pay may be low and promotions are few and far in between, but with Cuepacs, the umbrella body for civil servants unions, speaking up for them, there are provisions for bonuses and pay revision. In a nutshell, the job is his for life.\n\nUnlike the private sector, it is not so stable. The work ethics are more stringent and employees have been known to be dismissed for the flimsiest reasons. Then, there are the uncertainties when companies downsize followed by retrenchment or businesses go bust. The plus factor for the private sector is the higher starting pay, higher bonuses, quicker promotions and better increments based on performance. The work is more challenging and stimulating. The minus factor for private sector employees is the growing trend to employ contract not permanent staff.\n\nSecondly, there is the pension. To make it even more attractive, the employee has the option of choosing either to stay a contributor to the EPF (after the probation period) or go for the pension scheme. If he opts for the pension scheme, he has an income for life and if survived by a wife, it is hers too for life.\n\nThirdly, there is the additional perk of almost free medical treatment for life for himself, his wife and his children who are minors.\n\nAdmittedly, there are some private companies that do offer medical subsidies but with certain medical panels only.\n\nNext, comes the relaxed working environment. Almost all government departments are air-conditioned or quite conducive. Although there is the clock-in and clock-out routine, there is little urgency in the government departments.\n\nSimilarly, the conducive working conditions do exist in the private sector. However, the relaxed working environment is not so apparent, in fact the private sector is like a pressure cooker for performance is linked to profits and contracts. Employees are under pressure all the time to perform.\n\nFinally, the most appealing factor about government service is that the employees are in a privileged position. The public go to them for help. They endorse, approve or reject applications and appeals, interpret existing laws and regulations: the power is in their hands.\n\nIn the private sector, due to competition between similar brand product and service providers, the employees have to ensure that their clients are well treated and well served. After all, the consumer is always right.\n\nHaving looked at the pros and cons, we can now understand why people are lining up to join the government service despite detracting facts like low pay and poor pension. Applicants for government jobs look to other factors to be a part of the government machinery. However, if complaints about the public sector are anything to go by, there has to be a change in the mindset of those joining the public service. As the Prime Minister says, \"We do not need Little Napoleans.\"\n\nIn conclusion, it depends on the individual to decide where to serve: in the government or private sectors. If you are thinking of security, then go for government service. If you are thinking of challenges, opt for the private sector. An employee in whichever sector who does an honest day's job and who sometimes goes beyond the call of duty will receive his rewards in more ways than one."

        "content": "If you were put in charge of fundraising for a needy cause, what would you do ? would you recruit volunteers or employ paid professional fundraisers ?\n\n \nWho would I turn to should I have to raise funds for a needy cause ? I would have to take into consideration several relevant factors: the objectives of the fund raising, the target amount to b raised, the initiators or the organizers, the nature of the fundraising project and the beneficiary or beneficiaries among others.\nBefore deciding on whose shoulders the task should fall on, it is fundamentally sensible to consider both aspects.\n\nIn the first instance, if the organizers undertake the fundraising on its own with volunteers, then all the monies collected minus permitted expenses go directly into the coffers of the organization.\n\nHowever, if professional fundraisers are the \"workers\", then they need to be paid. Some organizations have rules concerning the minimum and maximum allotment going to professionals and in essence there should be no hanky panky in such projects. Unfortunately, some professional fundraisers are rather unprofessional in their dealings with genuine charitable fundraising.\n\nIn the second instance, volunteers are truly enthusiastic and go all out to raise funds. There is a natural passion for the worthy cause. The handicap is that most of them may be greenhorns at this game or unschooled in the art of fundraising. Such a situation can be demoralizing.\n\nHowever, the professionals are just doing a job and that is as far as it goes. They have an added advantage in that they are trained personnel at fundraising and have more than a dozen tricks up their sleeve, quite unlike the motley crew of volunteers.\n\nIn the third instance, members of the organization could use their connections to solicit funds in a legal way and could request for periodical contributions or donations (monthly or annually) from giant corporations. Such corporations are known for their company policy of returning in kind or cash to Mother Earth and the community. At the same time, genuine fundraisers have to be aware of bogus fundraisers who get on the bandwagon and fleece generous donors.\n\nOn the other hand, some mega companies already have their pet projects and are no longer interested or have no other allocations in sponsoring any new charities. It is like talking to a stone wall. In addition, there is the danger of volunteers and professionals overlapping in collecting funds, all for the same purpose and for the same company.\n\nHaving looked at both sides of the coin, I am more in favor of volunteer fundraisers. My primary reason is all the funds collected would become the \"property\" of the organization. The objective of the project is to raise as much money as possible and if a percentage goes as fees to the professional, then the quantum coming to the fund is reduced. My second reason is when volunteer fundraisers continue to raise funds, they would gain experience and even be better than the professionals one day.\n\nSo welcome to the world of fundraising, volunteer fundraisers."

        "title": "Retention vs automatic promotion",
        "content": "How would you advise a friend who has been given the option of either being retained because of unsatisfactory results or being automatically promoted as is the norm ?\n\n \nI believe it would not be fair to him if I state my stand without presenting an objective view of the situation.\n\nTo begin with, I would present the advantages of remaining in the same form for another year. After that, I would look at the disadvantages of being promoted to the next level.\n\nIn the first place, retention gives him the opportunity of relearning all that he had learnt previously. Furthermore, his previous learning would be further reinforced with relearning and revision. Compared to other learners of the same age, he needs extra time to learn and to understand. What is more important is that he becomes more confident. Besides, he knows all the stuff; therefore, he just needs to apply them.\n\nSecondly, he has to improve on his study skills and techniques. I believe that an additional year at the same level would polish his learning abilities. In addition, not being in an examination class, there is less pressure. He has more time to study at his own pace. Be doing so, it would enable him to perform without any pressure. Once he does just as well as his form mates, his zeal for learning would return. His achievements would raise his own self-esteem.\n\nThirdly, different children develop physically and mentally at different rates. No two persons are alike. Einstein and Winston Churchill were not brilliant students in school. One became a famous scientist and the other a much-admired politician. Some people are late developers and some are early bloomers.\n\nI have presented the three advantages of retention. Now, I shall give my views on automatic promotion.\n\nThe first disadvantage is that another level means new materials to be learnt. He has not yet truly comprehended the old materials that he learnt the previous year. The crux of the matter is that whatever is learnt in one year is the basis for the next year's work. A weak foundation can bring about a tumble. Not only has he to study hard, but he can also find it nerve racking. It cannot be doubted that when an average student finds it difficult to understand, what more a struggling student ?\n\nThe second disadvantage is, he has no time to brush up on his previous year's work for he has loads in the current year to understand and to learn. Undeniably, he may find it such an uphill battle that he loses courage and just surrenders. That cannot be allowed to happen. A student must see light at the end of the tunnel for him to continue to persevere in spite of great odds against him. Giving him a second chance of \"recouping\" his losses would set him on the road to success.\n\nThirdly, no two persons learn, understand, retain and assimilate then regurgitate at the same constant. There are too many variables and preconditions and hypotheses.\n\nHaving presented both views: the advantages and drawbacks, I have to let him decide for himself. He has to take into consideration his own sense of humble pride and his particular talents besides all the other factors. There is no shame in accepting his shortcomings and bravely acting on them. There is no wrong or right decision. It is right for that moment in time. Then only can he make a decision which should assist, not hinder, his progress."

        "content": "Would you accept an offer of a scholarship to study for a course at university or college ? What would you do and why ?\n\n \nI have two options: to accept or to decline the offer of a scholarship.\nStudents stand in line to be awarded prestigious scholarships by government and other mega corporations. Should not I just grab this scholarship ? However, I would like to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the scholarship offer before I make a momentous decision.\n\nThe first favorable consideration is that my parents would have their financial undertaking replaced by the scholarship award. Furthermore, they can breathe easily because all the expenses are no longer their responsibility. In addition, they can keep their retirement savings intact. What is more satisfying to them, is to know I am a cut above the rest to be offered this scholarship.\n\nThe second favorable consideration is I am assured of employment when I complete my course. I have a bond to serve the government. The bond is tied up with the government employment.\n\nThe third and last favorable consideration is the award entitles me to pursue my tertiary education abroad at a prestigious ivy league institution. What is most exciting is that not only can I come into contact with but also exchange information with the minds of other young elite. I believe such contact would come in most appropriate when I enter the governmental and business arenas.\n\nOn the other hand, the first unfavorable consideration is when I am awarded this scholarship, a more deserving and needy applicant is rejected. His dreams have gone up in smoke.\n\nIn addition, the second unfavorable consideration is. I am bonded to serve the government in a position anywhere where my training is needed. Government service is steady and safe but as with any civil service, there are procedures and regulations, seniority and promotion, General Orders and ethics: they are good for morale and discipline. However, the situation calls for red tape and work can be agonisingly slow. There are exceptions to the rule where the staid government machinery can be ultra-modern.\n\nMoreover, the third and final unfavorable consideration is, at this present moment I am in two minds about the course I wish to pursue. On top of that, I may not like the scholarship coming with a certain course. Appeals are often not entertained. In fact, scholarship boards have their own setup, rules and other factors when awarding scholarships.\n\nIn the final analysis, I think I shall accept the scholarship, enrol in the discipline that is part and parcel of the scholarship, serve y bond faithfully and efficiently (plus happily). When my \"debt\" to the nation is repaid, I can go in search of newer (not necessarily greener) pastures to graze and work out my passion for my chosen career. By the, I would know exactly what the \"what\" is. To cement it, I should be the most grateful one to say a big \"thank you\" for the scholarship."

        "title": "Online shopping",
        "content": "Online shopping is better than conventional shopping. What are your views ?\n\n \nThe Internet has revolutionized the way we do our shopping. The businessman regards the Internet as a modern effective tool for business transactions. Online shopping is the act of purchasing products or services over the Internet.\nLet us compared online shopping to traditional or conventional shopping. Online shopping, particularly during a festive holiday season, alleviates the need to wait in long lines o search from store to store for a particular item. Conventional shopping in the brick and mortar building entails leaving the home to jostle with the traffic, crowds and long queues.\n\nWhat are the advantages and benefits of online shopping over conventional shopping ?\n\nFirst, there is the convenience of being able to shop 24 hours a day for any type of product imaginable. The ability to shop from home allows many people (the elderly, the disabled, young mothers) to still purchase the products and services they need. Then it is more comfortable, doing it in the comfort of your home, instead of running around in the store. Online shopping allows you a 24/7 shopping time. you can surf the Internet at any time of the day and buy your goods. You can find and buy products from all over the world.\n\nSecond is that goods are often cheaper as the seller does not have the costs of running a shop. You have the opportunity to compare as many products and prices as you want without having to spend the time and money to travel between several different shops. You get cheaper deals and better prices with discount coupons and rebates thrown in.\n\nThird, you will also be able to read reviews y previous buyers and select your purchases with additional information from satisfied customers. The photographs and illustrations help you choose and recommendations from others help you decide.\n\nLike in other forms of business, there are disadvantages too.\n\nFirst, online shoppers face fraud and security concerns. It has also been widely criticized for being very insecure. Even with the latest security ware, hackers still manage to find a way to steal your data. Online shoppers should first familiarize themselves with online stores and how they protect their data before going on an online shopping spree.\n\nThe majority of online shoppers are unaware of various hacker attacks, phishing scams, and how they affect them. Not knowing how to keep yourself safe is the biggest disadvantage of online shopping. despite warnings from Snopes and other cyber \"police\" sites, the store may be a scam put up to gather people's credit card data and social security numbers.\n\nSecond, online shopping puts you at a disadvantage. You can't see and feel first hand or try for size your purchase. You take the word of the description of the product which is usually cleverly crafted by online stores to make it sound appealing to people. There is no hands-on inspection, nor visual or physical impact for product suitability. Only when it arrives at your address, do you have the opportunity to check the purchases for what it is advertised as. The greatest rip is the inaccurate transactions which could result in no savings or additional expenses to the buyer. this is probably one of the biggest disadvantages of online shopping that turns many people off.\n\nThird, there is no means for you to check for full cost or hidden cost not until something unexpected happens. Online shops do not always list the other additional charges. All these hidden costs: handling fees, packaging costs, shipping or transit costs, replacement costs, return costs, fluctuating currency rates, can add up to quite an exorbitant sum. Are they borne wholly by the buyer ?\n\nThere are many other online issues which are more technical in nature: usage of the computer, slow online connectivity, viruses and time zone differences. Other aspects would be personal to buyer: credit card payment, no cash transactions, immediate gratification, invalid warranties, no refunds and non-delivery of purchases.\n\nIn summary, the main advantages of shopping online are convenience and cost savings, while the main disadvantages are security risks and reduced hands-on purchase gratification.\n\nIn conclusion, to benefit truly from online shopping, one has to be an intelligent experienced Internet user as well as a streetwise e-commerce online shopper."

        "content": "You have been offered placement in a residential school. How would you convince your father to let you remain in a day school ?\n\n \nI did not apply to study in a residential school but I was offered placement in one. So claimed my parents \"I was selected !\". According to them, I made the grade and I should say yes. There are others waiting for this golden opportunity. I do not fall into the eager beaver category. I still want to study in a day school.\nI do not deny that a residential school has several plus factors in its favor.\n\nFirst, for many, a residential school is a home away from home. It is a foster home complete with wardens and teachers who are surrogate fathers and mothers. The school is fitted with the best if not better facilities than day schools. The hostels resemble home facilities. The hostelites receive a better and advanced level of education.\n\nSecond, it is expected that a boarder's potential is exploited to the maximum where he has the upper hand over his peers in day schools. Not only does he develop physically, psychologically and emotionally, he is also groomed to face life's challenges. He builds up a strong mental framework. He learns lessons of self-reliance and care for others. A residential school is the mini-university of life.\n\nThird, adapting to a new environment would ease a boarder to enter into other worlds as he grows. He becomes self-reliant and tackles problems independently. He cultivates self-respect within himself. He is confident as he learns to believe in himself. He grows in maturity as he takes appropriate decisions to recognize his aptitude and talents.\n\nI have enumerated the factors in favor of residential schools. Despite the scales being heavier, I still wish to opt for a day school. These are the minus factors of residential schools.\n\nFirst, day schools may have a dense population per class. The facilities may not be the best but students make do with whatever they have and learn to do without what they do not have. the teachers may not be the best but one thing I do know, they are genuinely concerned for their students and give of their best. they are also our surrogate fathers and mothers. Their goal is to make us worthy of ourselves and for us to peak academically.\n\nSecond, the challenging school environment under the tutelage of both teachers and parents allow us room to metamorphose into dynamic personalities. Day schools set high goals too so that students mature into self-confident, independent and responsible adults. I have the trust and the faith in my teachers that they would not abandon us but allow us to bend with the willow, as they had executed for the past students who are living testimonies of their guidance. The school alumni is a potent force to be reckoned with.\n\nThird, I prefer the last two years of my secondary education to be in a day school because I wish to be with my family. I won't have much time once I enroll in a tertiary course and embark on a career. I want to maximize the time with my family. Please let me have the complete unadulterated dose of family time."

        "content": "Parenthood is no mean feat. How do you personally feel about the ups and downs of parenting ?\n\n \nThe person who says parenthood is a breeze should have his head examined by a shrink. If I look at how my siblings and I drive our parents up the wall, I think a century of parenting would never prepare any parent for parenthood. Despite the \"horrors\" associated with parenthood, many would-be parents have no qualms about enrolling for the grand initiation.\nFirst, there is the squabbling baby. The baby cries when he is hungry, full, wet, dry, happy or sad. Being unable to express itself in any intelligible fashion, it makes sounds which only my mother can interpret. Sometimes, she is spot-on, sometimes, she is way out. When that happens, the whole house turns upside down and rescue operations have to be launched. We never would know when reinforcements are needed. Believe me, they have no respect for time or situation.\n\nSecondly, there is the preschooler. She is a person with the most imaginative mind in the world. She can cook up the most ludicrous ideas to escape getting into the school bus. She wants poor overworked, sleepy-eyed Daddy to send her to playschool. She likes to arrive in style. Only Dad sees through her subterfuges. Mum gets fooled sometimes but never with Dad. How in Heaven's name does he know that she's testing his deductive powers ?\n\nThirdly, there is the child who is on the verge of blooming into a gawking teenager, pimples and all. She is always gazing into the mirror, lamenting the woes of all the unsightly spots on her otherwise pretty face. Mum must have the patience for this job, having to listen to her moans and groans of the tediously long wait to turn into a Princess. That one is Dad's fault, calling her Princess on her eleventh birthday. Since then, she never ever allows us to forget she was Princess for a day.\n\nFourth, that is me. Me with the raging hormones and the teenaged angst. I need an outlet, I want that motorbike. Dad and Mum would rather trade their lives than allow me on a motorcycle. I can promise the world but the answer is always no. No one in the family is going to be called a \"Mat Rempit\": there are enough candidates on the highways to be listed. My name is not going to be on the list. When I see the photographs of victims and the testimonies, I say a prayer of thanks for such strict parents. Would I too be a statistic like the rest if my parent shad been indulgent ?\n\nFinally, there is my brother who is standing, sandwiched between youth and adulthood. He is about to be an adult but he is still being treated like a child. To my parents, he is still their first-born and he is so very precious. They are so protective of him, yet they want hi to be a good role model to his brothers and sisters. He can do what he likes but he still has to be home by 12 midnight. Sometimes, he has to account for his movements and that can be rather embarrassing. However, my parents do give him lots of reins of freedom, provided eh does not violate any of them. He has yet to be grounded, unlike me.\n\nNow, what I can say about parenthood ? It is a never-ending process of learning. No one can be trained for parenthood. Parenthood is trial and error -- one learns from experience, one learns from observation, one learns from mistakes, one learns from successes.\n\nWho of the two parents is the desciplinarian, who is the listener, who is the comforter, who is the sole breadwinner or are both the breadwinners ?\n\nHowever, one learns too that each child is a unique individual. What is applicable to one is non-applicable to another. What works for one does not work for the other.\n\nIn a nutshell, no one is wrong and no one is right either. Many have come up with unique formulae to parenting. Some are viable, some are not. To each his own. I feel that with the ups and downs of parenthood, I might just stay single."

What constitutes happiness for one and not for another ?\n\n \nNo, this is not a review of the film starring Will Smith as Chris Gardner in \"The Pursuit of Happiness\". Yes, it is looking at happiness through your and my eyes.\nWhat is happiness ? There is no one answer that is relevant to everyone. Happiness is relative to the individual. Happiness is a state of being where there is joy in the heart and smiles on the faces. But happiness comes in different forms for different reasons.\n\nA young child's happiness is mirrored when he receives the two-wheeler that he has been eyeing for the past year. He laughs himself hoarse in sheer happiness when he meets his Disney characters in Disney Land.\n\nTeenaged fans of Mawi, Rain, Awie, Siti Nurhaliza, Andy Lau, S.H.E are in ecstasy when they are face to face with their pop idols. It is no different when the mature men and women rub shoulders with the likes of Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lopez, Brad Pitt, Reshmonu and Bollywood stars.\n\nA student who scores As in his examination is in seventh heaven when he is given that coveted scholarship to study overseas. However, a struggling student who is not academically inclined is deliriously happy when he passes well enough to be admitted into a university college. To add further to his happiness is when he receives a scholarship to complete his studies locally. The straight A student is disappointed when he does not get his first choice but the average student is happy at even being considered for a bursary.\n\nA poor man would be happy owning his first motorcycle that he has saved for years to pay off the loan. The homeless sighs with happiness at receiving keys to his low cost one room house. The family whose house has been razed to the ground is so grateful for the financial aid from the government and non-governmental organizations to rebuild the house.\n\nThe unemployed would find happiness in securing a job for the first time. The job offers him a promise of better things to come. However a highly paid employee may find lots to grumble about -- the low pay, the slim chances of promotion and an overbearing boss.\n\nIt is only when one has fallen to the bottommost pit that one appreciates the little opportunities that come one's way.\n\nTo some it takes so little to receive and give joy. To some others it takes much to receive and give joy. In our pursuit of happiness, there are times when happiness can be so elusive. We have to work towards happiness and believe that happiness is our birthright. We all deserve to be happy."

        "content": "What is your basic understanding of nutrition ?\n\n \nWhat is nutrition ? Nutrition is the process by which living things receive the food necessary for them to grow and be healthy.\nWe associate food with nutrition. Food is needed to maintain health, as a source of energy and to carry out life processes such as breathing, growing, excreting and reproduction.\n\nWhen we think of food, we think of it in terms of its calorific value. The calorific value is determined by the calorimeter and defined as the energy content of food. Food energy is measured in calories (cal) or kilocalories (kcal). One calorie is equivalent to 4.2 joule and one kilocalorie to 4.2 kilojoule.\n\nThere are factors that would affect the calorie requirements of humans.\n\nThe first factor is sex. Males generally need more calories than females because they are more active than females. Active females would definitely need more calories than a male who does no exercise at all.\n\nThe second factor is body size. a bigger body size requires more energy because there is more weight to support.\n\nThe third factor is the physical activity of an individual. A person who carries out more manual work needs more calories than an office worker who does more sedentary work.\n\nThe fourth factor is the state of health of the individual. Sick people need more energy than healthy people to fight against diseases and repair damaged tissues.\n\nThe fifth factor sit he surrounding temperature. People who live in cold climates need more energy to maintain a constant body temperature.\n\nGood nutrition intake results in good health. The individual is energetic and healthy and all his basic life processes function smoothly. He does not fall ill easily, does not catch the flu when he comes in contact with a person who has the sniffles and is usually cheerful and good natured.\n\nOn the other hand, should a person indulge in poor nutrition intake, he may face immediate health ailments and face more serious health problems in the long run. Poor nutrition intake means not having a balanced diet of sufficient proteins, carbohydrates, fats and vitamins. he may consume too much red meat and too much fats. he stays away from vegetables, fruits and drinks very little water but drinks too much soda.\n\nFirstly, a person with bad nutrition intake may suffer from malnutrition. He lacks proteins and vitamins. He may suffer from undernourishment, scurvy, rickets and even night blindness. His body weight drops. he becomes thin and lethargic.

        "title": "What is your basic understanding of nutrition ?\n\n \nWhat is nutrition ? Nutrition is the process by which living things receive the food necessary for them to grow and be healthy.\nWe associate food with nutrition. Food is needed to maintain health, as a source of energy and to carry out life processes such as breathing, growing, excreting and reproduction.\n\nWhen we think of food, we think of it in terms of its calorific value. The calorific value is determined by the calorimeter and defined as the energy content of food. Food energy is measured in calories (cal) or kilocalories (kcal). One calorie is equivalent to 4.2 joule and one kilocalorie to 4.2 kilojoule.\n\nThere are factors that would affect the calorie requirements of humans.\n\nThe first factor is sex. Males generally need more calories than females because they are more active than females. Active females would definitely need more calories than a male who does no exercise at all.\n\nThe second factor is body size. a bigger body size requires more energy because there is more weight to support.\n\nThe third factor is the physical activity of an individual. A person who carries out more manual work needs more calories than an office worker who does more sedentary work.\n\nThe fourth factor is the state of health of the individual. Sick people need more energy than healthy people to fight against diseases and repair damaged tissues.\n\nThe fifth factor sit he surrounding temperature. People who live in cold climates need more energy to maintain a constant body temperature.\n\nGood nutrition intake results in good health. The individual is energetic and healthy and all his basic life processes function smoothly. He does not fall ill easily, does not catch the flu when he comes in contact with a person who has the sniffles and is usually cheerful and good natured.\n\nOn the other hand, should a person indulge in poor nutrition intake, he may face immediate health ailments and face more serious health problems in the long run. Poor nutrition intake means not having a balanced diet of sufficient proteins, carbohydrates, fats and vitamins. he may consume too much red meat and too much fats. he stays away from vegetables, fruits and drinks very little water but drinks too much soda.\n\nFirstly, a person with bad nutrition intake may suffer from malnutrition. He lacks proteins and vitamins. He may suffer from undernourishment, scurvy, rickets and even night blindness. His body weight drops. he becomes thin and lethargic. He may have a pot belly, and dry skin. Vitamin deficiency can be seen in swollen and bleeding gums, soft bones and poor vision.\n\nSecondly, poor nutrition can result in anorexia nervosa. It is an eating disorder where a person limits eating and weighs at least 15% less than his ideal weight. He fears being fat. the victim is thin and depressed. In very serious cases, the victim dies.\n\nThirdly, Poor eating habits can result in obesity. Excessive eating results in excess fat being stored in body parts like the abdomen, buttocks and limbs.

        "content": "Explain how the ecosystem has been endangered. What human activities can and have endangered the ecosystem ? What can be done to ensure a balanced ecosystem ?\n\n \nHuman beings depend on the ecosystem to survive. Plants, animals and humans interact with one another in the environment. Misuse and overuse of earth's resources can cause negative effect on the ecosystem.\nThere are many human activities that can and have caused negative effects on the ecosystem.\n\nIn the first instance, there is the deforestation or clearing of natural forests. In the name of development, land is cleared for construction projects, mining, timber production, building of dams and draining of wetlands\n\nSuch activities result in flash floods, landslides and soil erosion. Wild animals are robbed of their natural habitats. With less trees, there is an increase in carbon dioxide but a decrease in oxygen production.\n\nMan's need for food keeps on escalating. In the second instance, farmers use excess chemical fertilisers: nitrate, phosphate, herbicides and pesticides.\n\nWhat follows next is the excess fertilisers are washed into lakes and rivers, thus stimulating algae growth. At the same time, the water quality in these waters is affected and fish die. Overuse of herbicides and pesticides produce toxic that affects the food chain which filters into agro-based food products, ending up in the human body.\n\nIn the third instance, man's switch from agricultural to industrial based economic activities, from horse drawn carriages to motor vehicles, and open burning have produced various air pollutants.\n\nIn the air there is invisible carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, oxides of hydrogen, carbon particles, lead and carbon monoxide. We get smog (eg. the yearly haze) and acid rain. Then we experience heat because of the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion.\n\nIn the final instance, man dumps domestic and industrial waste. In addition, we have an improper and inadequate sewage system.\n\nThe ecosystem (the air and the waters) is endangered with chemical-polluted waters or micro-organisms that are dangerous to health as well as emitting foul and stale smells.\n\nWhat can we do to ensure a balanced ecosystem ? Concerted effort is needed to develop and manage a viable system to protect the ecosystem.\n\nFirst, there should be enforcement of environmental laws. Implementation of laws to control pollution eg. Environmental Quality Acts 1974 (water quality) and1989 (waste treatment) should be strictly enforced, without fear or favor.\n\nSecond, there should be the preservation and conservation of the forest. Where deforestation has taken place, it should be followed by reforestation. In areas where land has been laid bare, there should be preservation of soil through the use of good farming techniques.\n\nThird, further to agricultural policies, there should be biological pest control.\n\nNext, every citizen, from the young to the old, should be educated on the benefits and ways of recycling, reusing, reducing and renewing in and of the environment.\n\nLast, but not least, technology has to be stringently and systematically applied to the ecosystem. There should be catalytic converters to clean up the gases released. There should be more people using unleaded petrol and even better, biofuel. There should be more sewage treatment plants.\n\nIn conclusion, knowing about the abuses of the ecosystem while implementing steps to ensure a balanced ecosystem is not enough. What is more urgent is for constant co-operation plus action by all Earth's residents."

        "content": "Write about budget accommodation plus the changing image of budget hotels for local and foreign budget travelers.\n\n \nThroughout the country, there are budget hotels for budget conscious travelers besides the regular hotels. It is not uncommon for a budget hotel to be a few doors away fro a 5-star hotel.\nIn the past, images of unkempt men and women, bug-filled mattresses, filthy toilets, pilfering and robberies came to mind. Then whenever anyone was to mention that he was putting up for a night or two at a budget hotel, there would be raised eyebrows, knowing winks and nudges, sometimes followed by protestations of horror and advice to scurry to a better place, may be a4-star regular hotel.\n\nFortunately, such images are outdated and no longer true. These days, budget hotels and guesthouses are trendy and modern. They offer comfortable accommodation with Internet connection. What beats all other considerations is the room comes at a fraction of the price you would pay at a regular hotel.\n\nBudget hotels in and around the country have evolved from grimy dirty looking down trodden old shop houses into modern, clean, affordable accommodation offering first class service at reasonable prices. Old colonial buildings have been modified into stylish guesthouses. Budget accommodation include lodges, chalets and dormitories. No-frills hotel concept is expected to boost the image of budget accommodation by focusing on what is important to the shoestring budget traveler: sleeping on a bed in an air-conditioned room, having a shower in a bath where there is soap and a towel, among others.\n\nNo-frills budget hotels offer clean and safe hotel accommodation with basic facilities like bed and shower. Guests are offered accommodation at rates as low as US9.90 a night during promotional periods and pay an additional low sum for other facilities like towels and air-conditioner.\n\nGuesthouses strive to make the traveler feel at home in the relaxed atmosphere. The guest can make use of the facilities like the living room, pantry, dining table and books. Those who run guesthouses provide travel information to customers and treat them as though they are guests who visit their homes.\n\nSome other budget hotels emphasize cleanliness and house rules like no smoking and drinking. Guests would then feel safe and comfortable.\n\nThese budget hotels are usually located near to eating outlets which serve cheap delicious local food as well as within walking distance to the many watering holes for those who want to drink to savor the ambience of a local night out.\n\n60% of the guests are walk-ins. Rooms, however, can be reserved online as these hotels have their own websites. while it is very common for most hotels to be happy with a 70% occupancy rate on a regular basis, almost all budget hotels especially the more popular ones have a much higher occupancy rate. What is most encouraging for budget hotel proprietors is that they get repeat travelers who stay for months. What is even more satisfying is that they are highly recommended to \"new\" travelers by satisfied guests.\n\nBackpackers who travel on a shoestring budget see budget hotels as their first choice accommodation because they suit their taste and their budget."

        "content": "How do you deal with Examination stress ?\n\n \nHello, Examination ! Your name is Stress !\nWhat is examination stress ? It could be defined as a type of heightened anxiety affecting a candidate before, during and after an examination.\n\nIt is a common issue dealt with by students throughout their academic life. Stress is a normal human feeling that is part of life and can often serve as a god form of adrenaline. Stress is your mind or body's natural response to what it views as a threat. When threatened, your body triggers a number of physical (somatic), emotional and mental (cognitive) reactions. Each category is connected to the other, so anything that can be done to lessen one reaction will lessen the impact of the other two categories.\n\nThe butterflies in the stomach, the sweaty clammy hands, the urge to visit the toilet, the weak knees, the unreasonable panic attacks: these are vital signs of stress.\n\nThe two types: anticipatory stress experienced while studying and thinking about the ifs, and situational stress experienced during the examination itself, can cause loss in concentration, physical distress and emotional upset. These outcomes could affect performance excellence.\n\nHow is one able to diagnose the stress and act on it to maximize performance ? The sufferer notes the triggers that create stress. He charts his physical, mental and emotional reactions to better analyze his ability to overcoming stress.\n\nSymptoms of stress vary from person to person. Some students are mildly affected and exhibit few symptoms, while others experience severe reactions. Physical, mental and emotional symptoms are seen before, during and after the examination. They run the whole gamut from appetite changes to excessive tiredness, stomach cramps, dry mouth, fainting and vomiting.\n\nExamination stress is more common than most students realize, and the symptoms are generally the same for almost all students who experience it. Certain people are more prone to stress attacks. Almost everybody feels a certain degree of stress. However, the intense worrier, perfectionist, ill-prepared learner, masters of avoidance, procrastinators are likely to be more highly stressed. Sometimes a vicious circle comes into play.\n\nExamination stress can be a real problem, especially when the stress reaches a height where nervousness takes over and the candidate cannot even focus on the test questions and do his best. However, there are steps you can take to keep stress at a manageable level.\n\nTraditional strategies such as developing improved studying and examination-taking skills can make a significant difference. Stress management and physical health care enable the sufferer to lessen his stress level.\n\nExamination stress is often treated using conventional prescription medicine. While there is a place for prescription medication, consideration and caution should be taken regarding possible side effects.\n\nThere are also many herbal and homeopathic remedies which can help maintain harmony, health, and systemic balance in the brain and nervous system, without side effects or sedation.\n\nIn dealing with stress, there are Dos and Don'ts. The many Don'ts include not to be negative or rushed or be influenced by those more stressed than you. The Dos include positive statements, natural breathing techniques and believing in yourself. After all, it is just an examination !\n\nOn the Test Day itself, be fresh and alert, think of past successes and put things into their right perspective with success visualization.\n\nA little stress helps. Heightened stress paralyses. One can have no stress, too little or too much stress. In the first instance, the candidate is overly confident. In the second instance, the candidate is spared much stress. In the third instance, the candidate is a bundle of nervous energy. Which category do you fall into ?\n\nSee you soon, Examination. Goodbye, Stress !"

        "title": "Models (Approach: personal opinion, description & types)",
        "content": "What are models ? To me, these are models.\nThe first model to me was that dinky tractor model Dad bought me for my third birthday. I had it in my grasp, morning, noon and night. No one could prize it out of my hand, not even the tempting offer of my favorite ice-cream.\n\nThat dented toy model was soon replaced on my fourth birthday by a three-wheeler. I was a daredevil, causing accidents and breaking priceless porcelain heirlooms as I raced in the living room which I had turned into my miniature race track.\n\nI soon outgrew the outdate old fashioned tricycle and graduated to a two-wheeler. The gardener kept out of my way as I trampled all over his lovingly tended garden. I did not bother about the thorny rose plants or the stony walk paths. Many a time I fell and bruised myself as I sped recklessly in his kingdom. I conscientiously polished my bicycle whenever it rained. My overzealousness to make it as good as new prompted my elder sister to comment that I would soon polish everything off. The bicycle remained my faithful companion until I left for boarding school.\n\nModels became something quite different especially whenever I accompanied Mother on her shopping sprees. She would drag me round the stores as she rummaged for bargains. In those days I was quite a patient kid, standing quietly by and looking up at plastic human models (mannequins). Some of them wee without clothes or without one leg or arm. Some were complete with beautiful clothes draped over them. Observing them I wondered how prosperous-looking Mum managed to find clothes to fit her as all these male or female models were skinny and seemed to be largely undernourished.\n\nI then had the urge to take up modeling. No, I do not mean swaying on the catwalk but I caught the fever of modeling cars, airplanes and toy men. It was fun gluing all the parts and building a model from minuscule parts. Getting my fingers stuck with glue and dirty was fun. My collection has been framed and boxed. According to my impish young sister, it was so that I could hand them down to my children. How wrong can she be ! If I were ever to get married ( at this juncture, it is furtherest from my mind) I would not let any one come within touching distance.\n\nMy interest in modeling soon petered out. I was not in the least interested in clay modeling or building models from matchsticks, so I skipped this module in art, much to my mum's consternation because she thought she could mould me into a budding artist, sculptor or architect.\n\nI was into reading so I read voraciously, soaking up information. I read about famous men and omen who have made good in school and who have contributed to world development. Albert Einstein was no child genius but his later scholastic years and work have etched a name for him in the science chronicles. I read about Mother Theresa and her charitable work in the slums of India. Her mission in life was to help the underprivileged and the poor. I am no young Einstein or a junior Mother Theresa but I would like to regard them as enviable role models.\n\nWhen I read about the world's public figures and the uproar they created in the august Halls of Justice, I shudder to think of the adverse effect on young impressionable minds. I am sure many youngsters would not regard them as role models. Money and rhetoric cannot buy them respect for respect has to be earned.\n\nI look around me and I see the ordinary man-in-the street doing an honest day's work efficiently and diligently. I then realize that eh role models in our life need not be that rich man who has amassed millions or the woman who talks the loudest or is the best-dressed figure in that gathering.\n\nMy parents work hard to place three square meals on the table, a decent roof over our heads, a warm bed to sleep on, the opportunities to pursue our dreams. My mother often laughingly but seriously tells me that she has faults. Her shortcomings and character deficiency do not make her less a mother. But her frankness and acceptance of her humanity endear her to me. I would very much prefer to regard her as my role model. she is not perfect but she is sincere and trustworthy.\n\nOn one hand models are miniature objects that we possess. On the other hand, role models are people we admire for their humanity and whom we wish to emulate."

        "content": "What kind of travelers have you met on your bus trips, train rides, boat rides, taxi trips and plane flights ? Do you like them or are you wary of them ? To some, traveling alone is an interesting proposition but to some it is a traumatic experience turning into a nightmare.\nOn short bus trips, where you just want to get on and hop off after a few bus stops, the people you meet are the daily commuters who are in a hurry to get to work or home. They are not much of a bother, some of them have even turned out to be very useful, helping you with your shopping bags or giving way to you.\n\nHowever, on long haul bus journeys, it could well be a different situation altogether. Sometimes you sit alongside a pretty huge person who takes up more space than she should. To make matters worse, she is apparently not aware that she has taken up your seat space. It is all right if you are as thin as a rake but if you are somewhat nearer her size, it could be a tight squeeze. Whenever this happens to me, I remember a friend who buys two tickets, one for her portly figure and the other for her bag of goodies. sometimes, there are considerate fellow passengers who try not to encroach on your space.\n\nComing to train rides, on day trips, a train journey is quite boring. Co-passengers keep to their seats except for some who come heavily laden and shove all their belongings under their seats and yours as well. If there is not enough space, they hog the table and the upper luggage decks. Night journeys are normally quiet except when you get a snoring sleeper on the upper deck. If you are a light sleeper, then it is a night of lost sleep and tired limbs.\n\nRiding in a boat is not a norm in urban areas, not discounting the river cruise. For someone who does not get seasick, a boat ride is just like any other means of transportation. However, on long boat rides, it can be rather intimidating when you turn a funny kind of green and blue. Your stomach does a funny churning and you feel like throwing up but does not. What irks you most of all is hen your traveling companions are fine and they look at you with strange looks at your clearly visible signs of discomfort. They obviously have no sympathy for you.\n\nTaxis can be a quick means of getting from point A to point B. However, the picky taxi driver who refuses to use his meter or travel to a certain place can spoil your day. In another instance, the taxi driver who weaves his way in and out of traffic can put the fear of the Devil in you. On long distance taxi trips, if you are sandwiched in the middle between two passengers in the rear seat, rest assured you are not going to have a comfortable journey. You should have purchased a bus ticket at a lower rate and arrive at your destination an hour late.\n\nPeople who are frequent air travelers have strange tales of their co-passengers. some get drunk and become a nuisance as well as pose a danger to other passengers and the craft itself. there are some who reek of body odor or perfume (Remember the cheap perfume purchased at the duty-free airport shops ?) or even of some food they have consumed earlier.\n\nThen passengers who recline their seats do so a bit too much and obstruct the space of the back passenger. On the other hand there are passengers who scream blue murder and would not allow you to recline the seat at all.\n\nWhatever mode of transport you are traveling in, just brave the discomforts and bear with them. in a way, you are going to reach your destination sooner or later and be comfortably resting in the comfort of your home."

        "content": "The scene that greets my eyes are the giant skyscrapers amidst the lush greenery of the surroundings. Then like a blot on the skyline the beauty is marred by a monstrosity of a block of concrete with square windows and jutting rusty iron bars.\nIt strikes me. The unfinished block is an abandoned construction lot. Before the economic downturn of the 1980s, the site was a scene of thriving activity with sounds of cranes and cement mixers, hammering and brick laying, shouts and instructions, conscientious workers and malingering co-workers. Now it is abandoned. What we see is an empty shell, devoid of any human activity but home to four legged creatures and crawlies. Nature's lushness has invaded some places with moss and lichen an creepers.\n\nWhat was planned as a shopping mall, and an underground parking facility has been abandoned.\n\nThis, unfortunately, is not the only site to suffer the fate of abandon. There are many other sites in the cities and towns and proposed giant schemes that have met a similar end.\n\nThese abandoned projects that were earmarked for hospitals, complexes, offices, hotels and \"you-name-it-you-have-it\" business ventures are real eyesores. They remind us of our failure to recoup our losses. They remind us of the billions lost in investment. They remind us that we do not have the gumption to start anew.\n\nThese \"unprofitable' ventures must be mad viable again. Entrepreneurs must be willing to invest in failed projects. if private entrepreneurs are not willing to take a calculated risk, then the government and its investment flagships must take the lead. Why can't the mega corporations that have reaped billions in profits in good years be the forerunners ?\n\nIt is not a good economic practice to allow abandoned construction sites to remain as they are. Not only does it portray a pedestrian attitude, it also manifests the country's attitude towards progress. development ahs to be on all fronts and the abandoned buildings need refurbishment. Cosmetic changes need to be put into practice so that in whatever way our economy is measured, we come out tops.\n\nLet us have no more abandoned buildings, complete or incomplete. Either tear them down or complete them. Firm action is needed to restore the country's image."

        "content": "There are two types of bonds : the visible bonds and the invisible bonds. At times, the visible merges into the invisible.\nThe visible bonds are the certificates that you obtain for years of study. The pledges of loyalty to King and country, the promises and vows to parents, teachers, family and friends are bonds that bind you to the material and tangible aspects of life. You are tied to the physical bonds with family and friends, to the community and to the country.\n\nNext comes he bond of contract that you sign with the sponsor who pays for your studies at tertiary level ( in the future ). If it is a loan, you service the loan on graduation and on getting a job. If it is not a loan, but a scholarship, you have to serve out the terms of your contract and you might be posted to some remote area to waste away the best years of your young adult life. Should you want out, you have to sever the bond by repaying the sponsor. Bonds are not that easy to break but you can if you want to especially if they are paper bonds.\n\nThere are more paper bonds in the marriage certificate and the rings. It seems that there is no way to get away from these bonds.\n\nThen if you have money to invest, in trust funds or the money market or the stock exchange, then you accumulate more paper bonds. But these are the risky, volatile bonds that can evaporate into nothing.\n\nWhat about the bonds that one cannot see but they are there, waiting to be tapped ?\n\nThese are the family bonds; parents with children, between siblings. Some bonds grow in strength, some grow farther apart. Some do not bond although there are blood ties. The ways of man are strange and unpredictable.\n\nBeside family bonds, there are bonds between friends, and even between enemies, friendly or otherwise. Some best friends do not feel like best friends after years of separation. Some remain friends despite the distance and the lack of contact. Yet those who had not been friends bond instantly when they meet after years of not bonding.\n\nLast but not least is the spiritual bond a human has with his Creator. Whatever religion you practice, the bond which you merge with your spiritual self will be your personal bond.\n\nIn summation, bonds come in different packages: the tangible, the intangible and the spiritual."

Starting with the uniformed personnel down to the fashion conscious, the populace dress accordingly.\nFamous fashion designers have often made fashion statements and dictate the fashion trends. Some have managed to maintain a clientele that have remained loyal to the fashion icon but others have moved on to other avant garde newcomers.\n\nThe legal fraternity has their black and white attire. The policemen are in their blue uniforms. The army personnel are in their typical jungle khaki wear. Each profession is recognizable by the color.\n\nWhat about the schoolchildren ? The drab dull dark blue with a white top has a saving grace in that the dark blue can be dirtied and pass muster. But the secondary blue with white and the male dirty green are not that eye catching. Fortunately preschoolers have quite colorful attire if they need to be uniformed.\n\nI am all for decent dressing. Of course, I am in favor of fashion but there is a time and place for everything. Some young adults do not know how to dress for the occasion or the place. They do not know the meaning of decorum or respect. If young adults break the dress rule, what can we expect of the teenagers who are still wet behind the ears ?\n\nTeenagers should know when not to come in shorts or funny T-shirts. Female teenagers should not be attired in flimsy clothes or short-short skirts for formal occasions. their shoe attire should be appropriate. Flip-flops, unbuckled sandals or dirty sport shoes are no-nos as school fashions.\n\nSometimes, I do not blame these teenagers for their parents are seemingly attired and sometimes we find that mothers are older versions in their daughters' attire. With such role models, is it of any wonder that young ladies fail to see the logic of being appropriately dressed ?\n\nI feel that older adults should set a good example to the younger generation. I believe that it is fine to adhere to changing fashion but there is always a limit to being overdressed or underdressed for occasions. You do not want an observer or a fashion editor to say that you look like a Christmas tree or an overstuffed turkey. On the other hand, someone might comment that you did not have the cash to buy enough material to sew that outfit.\n\nNevertheless, there are some mothers and fathers and grannies who are fashionable yet decently clothed. These are the ones to be emulated.\n\nBlind pursuit of fashion is not the way to keep you in the spotlight. Learning to have a sense of fashion, knowing which style, color or cut suits you would go a long way to turning you into a svelte lady or a smart gentleman."

The Roman symbols for numbers use the letters of the alphabet. The Chinese use strokes and the number of strokes depict the number system.\n\nDo you know that some students have an illogical fear of numbers ? Mention Arithmetic or Mathematics and they go berserk !. I was the bane of my Mathematics teacher. I could never understand why two minuses make a plus. It is most illogical but ask a mathematical buff, and the genius would raise his eyebrow, look at me as if I am from outer space, an alien and from then on, would deem it beneath his dignity to speak to me.\n\nDespite my fear of Mathematics, I had a fascination for numbers. It must be due to all the card games I played with grandpa. Some educationists did say that exposing a young child to number card games would make him a gifted child. There has to be a short circuit somewhere for me not to lay claim to such a prediction. For all I know, it is some old wives' tale. However, I did get a distinction in Mathematics at Form Three. It was either the paper was such an easy one or it was sheer good luck. Seriously, I think it was the gem of a Mathematics teacher. he erased my irrational fears of numbers and patiently and laboriously taught me the basics of Mathematics. I made it.\n\nFrom my personal experience, I believe that if a child is given the right grounding in the basics, the child would be able to do singularly well in the subject. Everyone is teachable and given the right opportunity, everyone can learn to add, minus, multiply and understand all the funny equations and formulae.\n\nAs in teaching the 3Rs of reading, writing and arithmetic, so too the same principles are applicable in the finer rudiments of mathematical understanding.\n\nA basic knowledge of mathematics is necessary in this world where everything has to do with numbers.\n\nThere are the queue numbers at banks, offices, and seat numbers for buses, trains and planes. Even hotel rooms are numbered, so too are the floors except that in certain high-rise buildings the 13th floor does not exist.\n\nOur identification papers are numbered and not remembering them can be rather embarrassing. From MyKad to passports, birth certificates to registration numbers for cars, land titles, admission numbers -- all documents are printed with numbers. To the government we are figures, just numbers. To the police, we are statistics in accident cases. If numbers do not exist, the world would be terribly chaotic. Therefore, to make our life a pleasure, try to remember all the important numbers. It has been known that if your number is stolen and used by an impersonator, you might lose your identity.\n\nIt is no wonder that science fiction has turned to using palm prints, eye iris and access entry code to prevent impersonation and false entry into maximum security buildings. However, everything can be cloned so nothing is tamper proof or security proof.\n\nThe series \"Numbers\" illustrates how the various variables can be used to predict answer and solutions to crimes. A mathematical genius utilizes all the variables and promulgates a theory and proves the hypothesis right.\n\nAs long as man is a thinking individual whereby he does not allow the robot to manipulate and control his life, numbers will continue to dominate the fabric of daily life."

Huge billboards are put up at strategic places. Even the media (television, radio, newspapers) have been used but there is still smoke billowing in the air.\n\nPrevious to saying no to cigarettes, it was to drugs and bad traffic manners, road bullies. You name it, we had these campaigns.\n\nIt could be that when asked to \"Say No !\", the curious wonder why and they are tempted to try. Once in, it si sure difficult to come out of the jungle. Even jungle guides and trackers have been known to lose their way in hills and the forests, what more a greenhorn ?\n\nMoreover, it could be that be emphasizing \"Say No !\", the message that gets across is not \"No\" but the product that is banned.\n\nA case n point could be the continued presence of \"Mat Rempits\" on our highways. Come the weekend, the whole future racers are on their machines, waiting for just the right opportunity to test their skills against the forces of luck and chance. Despite being maimed and despite lives being lost, these adrenaline-seeking youths have to qualms about competing with one another. What are a few bruises and cuts compared to the thrills and spills ?\n\nWould it not be better to conduct campaigns where the message is to \"Say Yes !\" Wouldn't it be better to encourage safe driving, legal races, good nutrition and healthy living ? Wouldn't it be more rewarding to say yes to continued education, good moral values, obedience to parents an caring for one's life.\n\nThe fact that we are emphasizing the negative by the motto: \"Say No !\" is tantamount to adults and authorities telling youths to indulge in that we said to say no to ? It has been proven by psychiatrists that the more you say no to, the more rebellious they become and the more eager they are to break rules.\n\nI believe it would be far more effective to use the positive approach to curb social ills. A positive attitude assists in brining out the innate goodness in youths. Before teenagers mature into mature adolescents, their raging hormones need an outlet. There must be avenues for them to release this burning desire to prove themselves.\n\nGiven the opportunity to expand their energies and live life to the fullest, let us change the way we exhort youths to mend their ways. \"Say Yes !\" to all the positive values that ensure a happy life."

To turn Eliza Doolittle from a flower girl into a refined lady, Higgins used words to transform her and transform her, he did.\n\nPeople with a literary slant usually have a way with words. They can outtalk any one, and spin a yarn with words. not only do they have a way with words, they have a gift of the gab. There are some people where you cannot get a word in edgeways and they must have the last word. Often, they would not even eat their words. Take my word for it that he is as good as his word. the above overdose is a play on words.\n\nIn some professions, words are necessary. The lawyer needs words to demolish the witnesses and win the case. The journalist uses words to ply his trade. The honorable Members of Parliament employ words to make his stand quite clear to the opposition. Candidates who wish to be elected use words to sway listeners to their camp.\n\nA writer of best-sellers uses paper and pen to earn millions. Once he has topped the best-seller list a number of times, he has it made. Even if his books turn out to be a flop, he is still hailed as the best writer of this century or in this part of the world.\n\nScriptwriters have turned books into films and churn out series after series, sequels after sequels and make the cast into household names. Famous quotes are ascribed to the characters in the films. In fact, they are the words of the scriptwriters.\n\nHowever, many a time words are used to inflict pain and hurt on humans. Some words can cut young children to the core. A young sensitive child would burst into tears when reprimanded too harshly. He might need tender loving words to understand the errors of his ways. The rebellious teenager needs firm words to realize that he might be put in a juvenile home if he does not change his ways.\n\nSome people have said that a pretty face like that belonging to Helen of Troy can destroy a nation. Some people disagree and say that a thousand words can launch a thousand ships. The potency of the written word cannot be denied. Words used by leaders of nations have thrust them into anarchy or into wars. these very same words have created history and changed its course.\n\nSo how important are words ? Words are important but at certain times and in certain cases. Their strength lay not in the words but in the way the words are put together and the state of mind of the listeners.\n\nAt the right time and in the right environment and to the right type of listeners, words can wrought wondrous changes."

The only person who could put in a word edgeways was her favorite youngest daughter and I happened to be the beloved granddaughter. But I made sure that I did not incur her wrath unknowingly.\n\nAs for my grandfather, he tolerated her ways, indulging her whims and fancies but he stopped short of letting her have the upper hand when his business cronies were around. Then you would see my grandmother in a different light: a demure, obedient, dutiful wife.\n\nGrandmother ruled the kitchen. She could because she was an excellent cook. She could whip up a feast for a banquet in a jiffy. She remembered all the recipes passed down to her by her grandmother and mother, both matriarchs before her. There was no need for her to measure the ingredients. Just a handful, just a cup, just a pinch and it was all just right.\n\nHowever, Mother told me that there was one recipe which no one knew anything about. Whenever she needed to cook it, everyone was barred from the kitchen. Then she would do everything from buying the ingredients to preparing to cooking to cleaning to serving. We did not know what it was called but we gave it our own tag: Grandma's Magic Tonic.\n\nThe dish would only be served on special occasions. Grandmother was adamant in not revealing the recipe to anyone not even to her favorite daughter and granddaughter.\n\nThen, it happened out of the blue. Grandmother had just cordoned off the kitchen when we heard a loud thud. We Mother and I ran to the kitchen and saw her sprawled on the floor, grimacing in pain. Her face was ashen and we could almost feel her pain. the excruciating pain was all over her alabaster face.\n\n\"Help me up, please. These ageing legs are a minus factor in the kitchen. Since you two are the only ones at home at this moment, you two are to be the recipients of my secret recipe.\"\n\nMy jaw dropped. Mother looked at me, with her eyes about to pop out. We held our breath, unwilling to expel any cries of glee in case the \"old tyrant\" changed her mind, a stance often employed by her devious mind to subject us to immediate obedience.\n\nShe measured out all the ingredients with her antique measuring cup. he gave an indulgent smile. It was a \"new\" grandmother: she was never this \"entertaining\". Indeed, she was all sugar and spice, serene and tranquil.\n\nThen she spoke softly and sweetly. \"Take a scented bath before you commence cooking. Become serene and give thanks for the good life. As you prepare the ingredients, concentrate on the ingredients and think peaceful pure thoughts. Give thanks that those about to consume this dish will enjoy it and be blessed. Continue in this frame of mind throughout the preparation, cooking, serving and eating.\"\n\nI could hardly believe my ears. Grandmother was advocating peaceful pure vibrations to create the atmosphere for healthy living.\n\nGrandmother had given us the family secret recipe: to enjoy doing what we do and to give thanks for a good bountiful life."

They were direct opposites in every way -- from the top of their heads to the tips of their toes. They were labeled the inseparables by their mutual friends.\nThey first met when they were in Form One. It was not one of those thunderbolt meetings but ordinary and mundane. Both were eyeing the second seat in the middle row in the classroom. Both rushed for the chair but a bumbling giant of  classmate plumped himself into it. So they looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders nonchalantly and placed themselves on either side of the giant. However, the class teacher summarily rearranged their seating positions. As fate would have it. Mack and Zack found themselves seated beside each other.\n\nPhysically, Mack was thin and lanky. He looked undernourished but actually he could eat. On the other hand, Zack was plump and stout and ate like a bird.\n\nMack was a bookworm and a star student whereas Zack was an easy-going student who managed to scrap through his schoolwork. Mack enjoyed tutoring Zack and Zack found himself responding well to Mack's tutoring.\n\nMack was a dreamer and was quiet and reserved unlike Zack who was boisterous and outgoing. Mack listened while Zack chattered. Mack could be seen laughing quietly with Zack clowning around and the life and soul of any gathering.\n\nDespite their differences, there was an invisible rapport between them. How did it happen that between these two teenagers there was a silent unspoken understanding ?\n\nIt happened that while they were both in Form I, a bully of a classmate made Zack's life a misery. While everyone steered clear of this big bully, Mack was the one who made mincemeat of him. Though thin and lanky, he packed a powerful punch and the bully stayed well out of his fists. Zack adored Mack and they were inseparables since the day Zack was \"saved\" from being pulverized to a pulp by the bully and his like-minded friends.\n\nSoon news of Mack's fighting spirit spread like wildfire and many wanted to be his buddies. But, Mack stayed a true friend to Zack. They continued to be friends even when Mack chose to be in the science stream while Mack decided to be practical and opted for the arts. Not being in the same class did not prevent the two inseparables to continue to be inseparables.\n\nIt was a friendship where looks, interests, abilities and distance could not put asunder."

Coughing spasmodically, I peered through the darkness and the sight that I saw sent shivers down my spine.\nThere were still figures on the pavements, road kerbs and even in stalled vehicles. Moving vehicles had lifeless faces and miserable looks. Eyes were listless and bodies looked numb. They looked dead but they were not. They were like the living dead or dead living. I could not tell the difference.\n\nI was mesmerized by the scene before my eyes. This was my very first experience. Such a situation had never happened to me before. What had happened ?\n\nThen it hit me like a thunderbolt. The Environmental Department had pitched the Air Index at Orange two hours ago. All citizens had been warned to stay indoors and not venture outdoors for Orange meant Be Prepared. The level could go to Red and Red would be when all hell would break loose.\n\nThe world had become horribly polluted that the populace had to be prepared for any eventuality when the oxygen level would spell death for those without an adequate supply of oxygen. The United Government had contingency plans in such an event. Oxygen drills and practices had been carried out. Some people took them seriously, others were nonchalant. I was sceptical but I was a low-abiding citizen so I was somewhat prepared.\n\nIt was unfortunate that I had gone on a work assignment to the other side of town and it would take me four hours to get back to the safety of my home. I had my mini oxygen device with me which would only ensure a three-hour oxygen supply. At Orange Alert, no LRT tram would stop to pick up passengers. One had to be at the \"Safe Station\" Pick-up Point.\n\nIt was one of those mishaps that could only occur once in a blue moon. Within an hour of Orange, the Air Index hovered at Red.\n\nI was within five minutes of Haven Point when the sky turned into a swirling mass of darkness. Everyone panicked and ran blindly in all directions. I was knocked down by the mass of human bodies.\n\nWhen I managed to steady myself, it was still dark and my first thought was, \"This is the end !\"\n\nThe sight of the prostrate bodies numbed my thoughts and limbs until I heard a concerned voice, \"Come, Mister, share my tank. I have two masks.\" I peered in the smog and saw an outstretched hand of a black man with a face mask. Thankfully, I put out my hand and together we breathed in the unpolluted man-made oxygen.\n\nWe were the only two survivors that day when the polluted city was on Red."

I look so unsightly!\"\n\nTheir banter was broken by a greeting at the front door. Rose walked up, wondering who it could be, not expecting any visitor at this time of the night. She was not too surprised when she saw a familiar face. It was Minah, her mother's trusted companion, someone she had not seen or heard from for sixteen years. The last time she spoke to Minah was after the birth of Sarah.\n\nShe ushered the fifty year old lady into her sparsely furnished sitting room. They sat in silence as Mina looked at Rose.\n\n\"You look well, Rose. You've aged graciously, quite unlike your younger sister who looked years older than you. Where's David?\"\n\n\"With the angels,\" was the quiet rejoinder.\n\nMinah was about to express her condolences when she thought better of it. She herself had never approved of David, Rose's husband, he being poor and to her, quite unworthy of being the husband of her favorite charge but then, strange is the world of love.\n\nAt that moment, Sarah walked into the room, bringing with her a cup of tea and a plate of some local cakes. She greeted Minah politely and sweetly and Minah could not help it but stare at her for she was the spitting image of her mother.\n\nRose smiled and decided it was time she revealed the secret to Sarah that she was one of two. In fact, before David passed away, they wanted to tell Sarah but as she was sitting for her grade S Music examinations, they decided against it. They were afraid that Sarah could not handle three shocks at one time - her father's demise and the revelation plus sitting for the examinations. She invited Sarah to sit with them. \"Take a seat, Sarah. This is your grandmother's best friend, Mrs. Minah.\"\n\nSarah looked up, her eyes wide open. Mum never ever mentioned grandmother. Like her mother, she was a free spirit too, ever-ready for adventure and surprises and frankly, nothing her mother did ever really surprised her. She always expected the unexpected, she would be shocked if her mother did the conventional.\n\nRose quietly began her story. She remembered the moment she broke the news to her mother she was going to marry David and the conditions her mother laid down. Her first-born was to be surrendered to her mother when he or she was two years old and returned to her at eighteen. She was to have no contact with the child for sixteen years. She refused absolutely but David knew the mettle of his future mother-in-law and if he allowed his beloved to lock her life in the staid old mansion, she would die slowly, suffering the deprivation of a stifled free spirit. He agreed. They left the town which was practically his mother's-in-law town and settled in a serene village, away from her domineering influence.\n\nFate was kind to Rose and David. They had twins, a boy and a girl.\n\nOn hearing this, Sarah could not contain her excitement. \"I have a twin! Wonderful!\"\n\nMinah was nonplussed. Sarah was not angry at her mother for separating the siblings.\n\nRose turned to Sarah, \"Remember. Sarah, the boy you collided with in Putrajaya two years ago? You took a photograph with him and his school friends. They were the ones who insisted on taking the photograph. That's your twin brother.\"\n\nSarah reminisced. \"The younger version of Dad minus the wrinkles and grey hair.\"\n\nTurning to Minah, Rose said, \"There was no condition that my children could have no contact with each other. It was only David and I. There was no condition that my sister, Jane was not to tell Samuel about his real parents. She did and he knew all about us. Jane's marriage was an arranged one and she found happiness in sharing my son.\"\n\nMinah smiled, \"Let bygones be bygones. Your son is in the car. In fact, he's waiting to meet his mother and his twin sister.\"\n\nBefore Minah could say anything, Sarah was out of the door in a flash as she hurtled down the stairs to the car. Her brother saw her and as she drew near, they both looked\nat each other and smiled. They were unlike two peas in a pod. They had kept in touch with each other since that \"lucky\" accident two years ago.\n\nLucky, it seemed but actually it was pre-arranged, on Jane's insistence. Even David had met his son and had exchanged more than a dozen words with him.\n\nSamuel ran up to his mother and gave her a warm hug. He did the same with his sister.\n\nFinally, the family was complete. Sarah was beaming from ear to ear. Samuel was ecstatic as he echoed his sister's words, \"How wonderful to have another half!\""

She blessed the day and the delivery boy who accidentally spilt lily-white flour all over her as she ran towards a Mercedes. At that split second, her soon-to-be new mistress caught sight of the beautiful white stray. Her whole life underwent a magical transformation from a life of scrounging to a life of pure luxury.\n\nShe went down memory lane as a bolt of lightning lit up her old home, the alleyways. Her mother died within days of her birth in a wet dirty smelly paper box but a kind tabby cat took upon herself to milk her with her other litter.\n\nSince that day she learnt to fend for herself and fought for and over food with her adopted siblings. They were a wild unruly indisciplined bunch. They learnt the law of the alley, to keep quiet during the day and night, to ferret for food among the dustbins and the kitchens, to fight for dominance among the four-legged creatures, to proclaim their ownership of certain choice stretches of the alley. It was the survival of the fittest and the most cunning.\n\nEmerald, as she called herself, was sometimes too clever for her own safety. There was once she inspired her adopted siblings to raid a restaurant. They had a feast but it was the day that the exterminators came to rid the kitchen of its rodents and they were caught right in the middle of the exercise. They barely escaped with the skins on their backs. For a week she was boycotted and it was this week that gave her the opportunity to spread her paws.\n\nBeyond the alleys, she saw the cosy comfortable life of pampered cats and dogs. She became envious of the choice food she saw in the supermarkets - the whiskas, the cat's food on the shelves. She saw cats being groomed and manicured and clothed in cats' pet shops. She spied cats walking daintily behind their mistresses as they went on walks in five-star hotels and shopping malls.\n\nShe continued to try to make out familiar shapes and sounds. She thought she saw a face she remembered from those days but it could he her imagination. Not many that she had known would survive long in those alleys and it was not uncommon for alley cats to be run over, beaten, chased, given a hot bath or rounded up by the cat pound. How she managed to be a survivor was a musters to her these days. She was tough and there were many times she realized she had more than nine lives.\n\nEmerald's stomach had an empty feeling at the clammy thought of the days and nights she went thirsty and how thankful they were for the rain for that gave them a respite from the days of thirst. But cold days spelled hours of discomfort and fever and dampness, too.\n\nEmerald's eyes clouded over but she shook off the reverie as she stretched her stiff limbs. Her nose against the window sill was numbed.\n\nThe day was coming to a close. The rain had turned into a heavy downpour. Unconsciously Emerald shivered as images of her thin squalid-looking siblings interrupted her vision. She reassured herself that they, if alive, were fine or maybe they were no longer around.\n\nHer sad thoughts were broken by the cajoling voice of her beloved mistress. She purred contentedly as she ambled towards the voice and soon was tickled and patted as she jumped happily onto the cushioned lap of her saviour.\n\n\"This is the life!\""

Months of hard work had gone down the drain. The vegetable patches were starved of water, the land was strangely silent.\n\nEven the animals were quiet, having lost the desire to make even the slightest noise, exhausted to the bone by the unrelenting heat.\n\nSuch a climatic catastrophe had never appeared in all the years that Maniam first ventured into vegetable planting. Together with his best friend, Ah Seng who happened to be his schoolmate, they applied their academic qualifications in the field of agriculture and business to farming. Nature was there for the taking - to be man's partner in bounteous returns.\n\nThe first two years were difficult times. However, they managed to make ends meet and they enjoyed the great outdoors. Besides they were their own bosses, being equal partners. In addition, they were not interested in making millions, they did not want the stress of the rat race, neither the thought of making millions for others and being paid pittance. They worked when they liked, and they had fun when they liked.\n\nIt was the third year when things started picking up. Profits came, slowly but surely. With the current fad of healthy living, where the health fanatics ate more greens, Maniam and Seng were delirious with great expectations. Nature was kind and merciful.\n\nAlas, their happiness was short-lived. The weather became erratic. Some days it rained that the plants were flooded out. Some days, it burnt until the plants were parched and dried. It was a nightmare but the situation was under control. They could still plant, they could still harvest, the farm was still surviving and fortunately, there were the profits.\n\nThen, the drought had to descend with all its fury on the vandalized land. It had not rained for months. The lakes and rivers had dried up, the reservoirs were almost empty. Water rationing was in force.\n\nSeng applied his engineering skills to extract water from the thirsty earth. He did whatever was humanely and scientifically possible but it seemed as though the elements had deserted him.\n\nManiam tried to use all his business contacts to get financing and buyers but they too were facing financial setbacks.\n\nSomehow, by a quirk of nature, the hot days turned cooler and the rains came. The rain fronts seemed to have come from nowhere and the air was dense with moisture. Maniam and Seng were relieved but their relief was cut short.\n\nThe rains were different from the rains of the past. It did not rain to please mankind, it rained to please no one, not even the elements. Earlier, just a year ago, they had to contend with heat, sun and drought, now they had to be enemies with water. It rained and rained.\n\nThe whole land turned into raging swirling waters of mass destruction. The dramatic change was beyond imagination. One minute it was scorching hot, the next second, it was a Waterworld. The waters showed no mercy. Maniam and Seng had an instant swimming pool.\n\nSeng and Maniam could only look at each other. Twelve months ago, they had the sun for company, this time, they had the water as their enemy. It was fun to have them in small doses but when they were in excess, they were monstrous agents of destruction.\n\nThe two friends decided to allow nature to reign supreme again as they resigned themselves to the fury of nature one more time."

She herself had a peaceful confinement month unlike her colleagues who were kept on their toes the whole night. Mum was so pleased with me.\n\nBut immediately after my first birthday, there was a drastic change, I became the most irritable one-year-old monster. I cried at the slightest whim, at even the softest whisper. I whimpered when the lights were switched off. I wanted brightness and darkness was my forsworn enemy.\n\nThe electricity bill rocketed with my unreasonable demands to have lights in every room. Mum and Dad despaired. They prayed it was a passing phase but the nightmare continued into my kindergarten years.\n\nGrandma had to be my constant companion when I first attended kindergarten and she had to follow me everywhere I went. Even the teasing and the boos of my little brave companions did not shame me in the least. I was just plain scared to be alone, without a familiar face, although there were twenty other chubby cherubic faces who were sheer daredevils.\n\nWhen I turned seven quid was enrolled in a co-ed school, my parents had practically to drag me, with hands and legs bound, to school. In those days, there were no rules of child abuse and they escaped scot-free. To make matters worse, I was sandwiched between a dark-skinned Indian girl with white teeth and a fair-skinned yellow-haired English class. Could you imagine the horrors that haunted my first year in post-kindergarten? My parents just ignored my rantings, protests and tears in the mornings and I had to be in school, rain or shine.\n\nAn unforgettable incident occurred when the imp in the class sneaked a black harmless spider down my collar. I was paralysed with fear, my face turned chalk white, my hands and legs trembled lifelessly, I was screaming as though I had been murdered. My Year One teacher, a young inexperienced greenhorn, was petrified that her face was whiter than mine and she was transfixed to the ground. Fortunately for all of us, the mischief-maker had the presence of mind to run get the Headmaster who summarily returned the situation to normalcy. Whenever I meet this Year One teacher, there is an instant rapport of those days and should we be witness to any such scene, both of us would be amused now but on that fateful day, it was no laughing matter at all, not to me.\n\nTo say that I was afraid of my own shadow, was an understatement. I soon grew out of these unreasonable fears: afraid of the dark, sudden loud noises, unexplained rattles and shakes, a shout out of the blue and numerous other silly fears. As I grew older, wiser and more logical, I relegated these wild imaginations to the recesses of my mind. Frankly, I must admit, occasionally, I swing into unconscious panic attacks. However, I believe them to be the pains and joys of growing up.\n\nI hope that as I mature into a gracious adult from this insecure untutored teenager, I will look at my own shadow and play hopscotch with it."

My stepmother and my step-siblings hanged around, seemingly busy.\n\nMy stepmother, Maria whom my father married after five years of my mother's death, treated me with kid's gloves for I was then a rebellious sixteen-year-old teenager. I was too old to be bullied and too rebellious to be tamed. I got on well enough with my step-siblings though we had our differences and petty quarrels. After my high school, I left to study overseas and returned after ten years to learn my father's trade. The ten years spent overseas as an undergraduate, then as a practicing corporate financial figure, had matured me.\n\nI bore my father's second family no malice. I returned home as a world-renowned financer and threw myself into my father's company, chalking up success after success. Father built up his business empire on my mother's wealth and his business acumen. Her untimely death was a big blow to him but he buried himself in his work. When he married my stepmother, I accepted it because he needed a wife. When she proved her worth as a businesswoman, he invested in the fashion industry, giving her a free hand to handle this subsidiary.\n\nFather's failing health two years before his demise, meant that I handled all the financial affairs of the parent company. Maria was not too pleased with my control but I gave her no reason to question me. I gave her a free rein to run the fashion industry her way. My step-siblings [Mark, Marx and Mari] and my half-brother [Johan. Yes! There was an addition to that union!] whom I liked well enough to ensure that he had the best upbringing and education that money could buy, were members of the Board of Directors. They had their own designations in the company which they had to earn on merit. They\nknew that blood connections did not assure them of safe employment.\n\nThe lawyers were coming that evening after dinner to reveal the details of the will to the family. Dinner was a silent affair. Everyone seemed closeted in their thoughts. I did see Maria surreptitiously glancing at me.\n\nThe two senior lawyers, Mr. Jack and Mr. John, arrived at 8.00 sharp. We were seated in the family room, waiting for them.\n\nMr. John read the will. In short, I inherited everything -- lock, stock and barrel! There were a few bequeaths to distant relatives and some favorite charities but the bulk was to me. I was shocked but in a way, I expected it. Father had hinted his intentions on the many occasions when I stole time from work and rest to be with him. I spent ten years overseas. Now that I knew he did not have much years left, I felt a need to spend moments talking to him or just sitting in silence in his presence, enjoying the pleasure of his much-missed company. We did laugh a lot and even had some emotional moments which bonded us.\n\nThe other members of the family were stunned. Maria stood up and was about to say something when Mr. Jack shook his head. She sat down, clearly annoyed. My step-siblings and my half-brother were agitated and stared at me.\n\nI signaled to Mr. John. He cleared his throat. \"There is a second will.\" Maria smiled. She must be thinking that she would be the main beneficiary, not me. Mr. John opened his brief case, took out an envelope and handed it to me. Maria's eyes were puzzled. What now?\n\nI opened the envelope, drew out the will, the second will. I read out the contents. I had decided to divide my property which I had just inherited. I had prepared two wills. One was if I should inherit all and one was if my father's property was divided among the wife and the children. Father needed not bequeath anything to his stepchildren but they were loyal to the company and had worked to earn his trust and respect. Any bequeaths to them would be seen as fair. Having explained that, I went on to my \"will\".\nMaria was to inherit the fashion industry subsidiary but not remain on the board. Her children would hold a 8 % share each and be directors on the board. My half-brother would hold a 18 % share and be appointed Vice -Chairman. I would be the principal shareholder with a 58% share and be the Chairman.\n\nMaria kept quiet because she had retained her \"company\" although I knew she disliked not being on the board. Her children got their share too so she should not complain.\n\nSo the one more will had surfaced. Did it mean all was well that ended well? Only the survival of the company would be the benchmark."

You get easily chipped and you melt when hot water is poured into you. As for me, nothing flaks me, hot or cold, chilly hot or water hot. I can take anything.\"\n\nThese exchanges were heard, day in and day out in the pantry where Mrs Locke kept all her containers that were made of plastic, metals of copper, tin, aluminium, stainless steel, porcelain and wood. You name the material, she has it. If only Mrs Locke could understand what her \"prized\" possessions were saying, she would be surprised at their lofty and arrogant talk.\n\nLittle square keeper gave a contented sigh. \"My sisters and I come in such lovely hues. Mrs Locke looks for us whenever she wants to pack her sandwiches and tea cakes. We are never ever forgotten. We love the cries of pleasures whenever she drops us off at her Thursday tea party.\"\n\nThe bamboo \"bakul siah\" turned up her nose and snorted. \"You are absolutely wrong. You can't beat my status. You can see my family members at all Peranakan engagement and wedding ceremonies. Without us, the authenticity of the traditions is missing.\"\n\nHer arrogance was met with a stony silence as all rudely ignored her. She was really a pain and no one could be bothered with her claims and self praise and glory.\n\n\"Friends, stop acting like spoilt brats. We all have our uses. Some are used more often than others but they get tainted, chipped, broken and discarded faster. Look at the cheap plastic containers that are in abundance in the \"2 dollar plastic shops\" - they are used but once. Can you see the flying Styrofoam food containers , the plastic water containers that lie in agony on the streets and drains, the expensive water bottles with all the famous trade marks are abandoned just as well when they turn smelly or discolored. We should demand for quality production so that we can serve mankind longer.\" The words came from a scarred Tupperware tumbler that had seen better days but now was left to fend for herself in some dark corner, practically forgotten.\n\n\"Serve mankind better! You must be out of your mind. Years ago, they said plastic is non-biodegradable, now they say we're recycleable. And I won't be too surprised if they say we're unreliable or even indispensable.\" The grumblings emitted from a dark corner in the pantry.\n\nSome of the plastic receptacles nodded sagely in agreement while some others feigned ignorance or intolerance.\n\nA sudden stream of light filtered into the pantry as the pantry door was pulled ajar. In the doorway stood rotund Mrs Locke and her long-suffering domestic help. \"Anna and May told me to get rid of all these plastic, wooden and metal stuff. They're getting for me a completely new set of durable stuff and I need storage space for them. So, Siti, throw away those that no longer look presentable or pack them into black plastic bags to be donated to anyone who fancies them.\"\n\nThose words put the fear of abandonment into each and every resident in the pantry. Who would be the unlucky ones? Who would get a second chance of survival?\n\nAll were struck dumb until a quick-witted small pair of plastic chopsticks slipped off the shelf and whoa!, as Mrs Locke turned her back to exit, she slipped. The impish chopsticks had lodged themselves in the path of the feet. She gave a loud cry as she caught hold of her maid and both of them fell, the fat one on top of the puny one.\n\nFor once, the whole pantry was united. They were vastly amused and their glee knew no bounds or limits as they laughed themselves silly at the bizarre sight.\n\n\"That reminds me, we should stick together against mankind. We have to be the masters, not the slaves at the whims and fancies of man.\" Injected an unfamiliar voice from the floor - a rubber ball."

        "content": "Write a story about a person born with the gift of the sixth sense.\n \nYan-Yan was as ordinary as the next child. He had all the childhood ailments, from which he suffered and recovered without much ado. He strolled past play-school and kindergarten, reveling in play more than study.\n\nIt was in primary school that he displayed some strangeness. He got on well with most of the boys but he was particularly kind towards the small and puny, those who were bullied. He stood up to the school bully and class bully. He was not a giant, being the average size for his age. They were wary of him, keeping their distance. He did not have to fight them but his posture was enough to make them think twice about challenging him. There was a hidden strength in him that caused bigger sized boys to respect him.\n\nYan-Yan was indeed different. His paternal grandmother, Por-por took him under her wings. She saw in him the tenacity, a trait he acquired from her. She knew that he was special and she promised herself that he would inherit all her skills and knowledge which she had acquired from her paternal grandmother. She plied him with her natural and learned knowledge and he took to them like a duck to water.\n\nAt first, he was afraid of what he could see in the people around him but as he learned the skills to face them, to claim their power and to use them for the benefit of mankind, his fear disappeared. His sixth sense, as his Por-por said, would be his wisdom and strength to use for good, and never for evil. All humans are born with two eyes but he had the sixth sense.\n\n\"This is your gift. Use it well!\"\n\nHis afternoons after completing his homework and studying, were spent assisting his Por-por when the ancients [the elders] came to consult her about health complaints for which modern medicine seemed to have done little for. These elders trusted Por-por's herbal concoctions and though sometimes bitter, took them without a murmur. Sometimes, he heard her advising them to consult the men and women in the white coats.\n\nOn weekends, Yan-Yan would accompany his Por-por to the jungle to look for herbs. She painstakingly taught him how to identify the myriad trees, plants and shrubs and their medicinal uses. She warned him not ever to destroy the greens of the jungles but to preserve those that he could grow in the garden plot.\n\n\"We have to protect the environment. Be Nature's friend.\"\n\nIt happened that one day, Por-por fell quite ill. Even her own potions could not help her to recover. Yan-Yan sat deep in thought and as he meditated, he had a vision of the plant that was to be the herb to heal his grandmother. He hurriedly went into the jungle and trekked to a plot where he had not ventured before. There he saw a colourful plant [of seven colours]. He took seven leaves, went home and boiled them. His Por-por drank the soup. He did it for seven days. On the seventh day, his grandmother got up and went about as though she had never been ill.\n\nPor-por smiled. \"Thank you, Yan-Yan. I'm proud of you! You have learnt well!\"\n\nYan-Yan smiled, \"Por-por, you are a great teacher!\"\n\nYan-Yan continued to go to school and continued to learn his grandmother's profession. He was particularly kind to his friends who were from poor homes. He gave them \"the sixth sense\" treatment so that their energy level remained high. He gave them courage and determination to face the battles of life.\n\nYan-Yan spent his holidays learning the scriptures in the temple. He also learnt meditation to strengthen his inner resolve.\n\nYan-Yan knew what he had to do in the future. If it was so willed, he would pursue a medical career which would allow him to practice healing. Then he would study traditional and natural medicine. This was his dream: to combine the modern with the traditional and bring about wellness.\n\n\"Would I be able to fulfill my dream ? Only the passage of time would give him the answer."

He was just a ten year old child but he knew more pain than any adult and spent almost half of those years in hospital surrounded by men in white and women in green, not by his toys and his siblings.\nPaula had asked herself repeatedly for ten years why she did not let him go but held on to him, keeping him alive, praying for a medical miracle that would return him to the normal life of a child, one where he could fall, bruise himself and one where he could eat all the childhood goodies. But it was not to be. From the day he was born, he was diagnosed with an immune system that was not immune to the environment.\n\nAny sudden change in the weather would send him into coughing spasms. Any vigorous outdoor activity would leave him gasping for breath and even turning blue. Any childhood treats would result in vomiting and stomach cramps. When he turned one, anything new he ate would bring on the shivers and the lethargy.\n\nSpecialists in every discipline of medical science had examined and tested him. They could find really nothing wrong with him. He was as healthy as the next child but his reactions to food and environment were mysterious and unexplainable. Medical specialists were baffled. There were some who made ludicrous theories which his bewildered parents were only too willing to try to alleviate his suffering but all was in vain.\n\nOne psychiatrist had the audacity to suggest that it was all in the mind and he suggested the implant of a computer chip in his brain to program his brain to react positively to food and environment. It worked for a good while and his family were deliriously happy at the outcome. However, the effect was short-term and the whole medical routine started all over again when the brain chip failed to register any improvement. Newer and more sophisticated chips were \"planted\" in his brain but whatever effect was temporary,\nnever ever permanent.\n\nDarren, in his agony and in his fear, often questioned his parents why he was so unlike other children of the same age. Why was he not allowed to run, jump and play like them, why was he not allowed to eat anything he liked or go anywhere he wanted? His parents had no answers to give him nor any words of comfort; they could only love and be with him.\n\nLife was a struggle, life was lonely. He had no friends, even if he had, they had to visit him dressed in sterile attire. In the beginning, these companions found it a thrill but they soon tired of the sterile bacteria-free environment for there were no toys nor games nor fun when they were with Darren. It was an alien world.\n\nSometimes, in the days when Darren was home, he looked out of the bay windows into the garden. He was no longer envious of them as he looked at and heard them. Although he was cloistered in his air-conditioned, lonely, empty bedroom, he was there with them in spirit.\n\nThen, one day, during one of those hot spells, when a careless maid left a window opened, Darren became seriously ill. He was rushed to hospital, from where he never was discharged. It was here where he spent his last few days, under the watchful eyes of the doctors and nurses and the tender loving care of his mother.\n\nPaula never left his side and between the mother and the child, there developed a bond that was so special. Even when she had to leave him for a second, it was as though she was still there.\n\nDarren faced his plight with a stoicism that would put many-a-man to shame. He was strong and brave, serene and peaceful. It was he who comforted his parents when they were down. It was he who gave them courage. From him, they grew to be strong and full of hope. He was their pillar of strength.\n\nOn the day that he breathed his last, Darren said, \"Thank you, Mum and Dad, for giving me the best years of my life.\"\n\nHe smiled as he closed his eyes while they put him to rest. He lay, quiet and peaceful minus all the tubes and wires, as he was and shall always be. He was life's\nperfection, complete and whole."

He had made millions from his crime novels and he was taking a breather from work before he started work on his next crime trilogy.\nHe was happy with himself, just having received a one million advance on his next writing project but his idyllic state was rudely interrupted by his personal assistant who appeared with a rather dirty looking envelope.\n\nAs it was marked private, Benjie left it beside him. Lazily, he tore the envelope and read the contents.\n\nHe sat upright. \"Hi, Uncle Marcus, Mum said I could be at your summer house for the holidays as you are holidaying in Bali and won't be needing the place for at least six months. Some schoolmates will be joining me for the Easter break. I promise to take care of the place. You will find the premises spick and span on my departure.\"\n\n\"NO! They mustn't be there. They would go snooping in the wine cellar\".\n\nMarcus sprang into action. He hurried to his hotel suite, shouted for his PA to book three airline tickets, one for him and his PA and the third for his latest lady companion.\n\nWithin minutes, they were at the airport, ready to return to KLIA. In the plane, Marcus was moody and irritable and Sally knew better than to question or to comment. She kept quiet and pretended to be asleep due to exhaustion.\n\nMarcus kept playing the scene over and over in his mind. His newly divorced wife of ten months had visited him one late evening at his summer retreat. She was dissatisfied with the divorce settlement and wanted more. She did not make an angry demand, neither did she fight him. She was quiet but firm. In a very calm but in a sinister tone she said, \"Triple the settlement and whenever I want or I'll tell on you. I've spent the best years of my life during your days as a poor struggling writer. Now that you are a billionaire, you are casting me aside. I bear you no ill-will. I'm too old for you, not attractive enough to grace your table. I don't want to work for a living. I want to lead a lifestyle of the rich and famous.\"\n\nMarcus knew he was caught for she knew everything about him, all his misdeeds, indiscretions, his shady deals, his connections with the underworld. You named it, she knew about it. She was never a part of his secret dealings but she was in the know. Her knowledge was lethal to his future, to his reputation. She could destroy him with a word to the right ear.\n\nFuming and feeling helpless, he was stupefied for a while but then his sly mind hatched a plan. He invited her over for dinner and as he put it \"for old times' sake\". She came, unsuspecting and as the evening dragged into the small hours of the morning, they ran out of wine and he suggested going to the wine cellar to retrieve their favorite wine. So they did. While in the darkness of the cellar, he knocked her\nunconscious and dumped her into her favorite wine cask, the 1977.\n\nHe closed up the house and took off for exotic destinations until that morning when he received his nephew's letter. He had to return to dispose of the \"wife\" before anyone discovered she was missing.\n\nPretending ignorance, he asked his personal assistant to send a birthday card to his wife and to have her favorite flowers delivered to her \"official\" residence.\n\nFaking an excuse that he wanted some quiet and peace to start on his latest project, he hired a black Sedan to drive to his summer retreat but of course before that he made several calls to many places: to his favorite hair salon, his favorite fashion designers, Rizalman and Chandran, his usual watering hole and of course to his local mamak stall, greeting every one loudly and heartily. Only then did he hit the highway to his sanctuary.\n\nOn reaching it, he saw a police car and the pompous looking Chief Inspector, Encik Rosman who had never liked him, directing operations.\n\nHis irrepressible nephew, on seeing him, ran towards him, hugged him and said,\" Guess what we found in your wine cellar? Your ex-wife in your favorite wine casket. She must have fallen into it when she was trying to fill up her wine bottle. Don't worry, Uncle Marcus, the police would find the person responsible. Uncle, I've just had a brilliant idea. This could be the theme of your next novel.\"\n\nMarcus's face turned ashen but he kept his composure. He smiled weakly and greeted the police inspector, offering to help in whatever way he could.\n\nA month later, splashed on the front page of The New Straits Times morning edition was the headlines: \"Crime Writer Detained for Murder of ex-wife\"."

You have to convey to them that there are fields where their subjects are still in demand.\n \nGood morning, students.\nWelcome to this session where I hope I can point to you towards the right direction. The fact that you have either opted or forced to take up an Arts bias package does not deprive you of careers. There is more than meets the eye.\n\nIn fact, many of you have come to see me, bemoaning that you are lost about choosing a career. You feel that the world is for the science students and the arts students are left with the leftovers. How wrong can you be!\n\nThe world of medicine, dentistry, scientific research, pharmacy, psychiatry have always attracted scores of students because of the accolades given to holders of Dr, Ir and Mr. However, do you know that there are Drs and Professors in the Arts arena and there are many who do not have any titles before their names who have made millions before their thirties?\n\nAn accountant, a financial planner, an investor and hotelier are not pure science students. They are Arts students. It does not take IQ to reach the top of your career ladder, it takes EQ too. A combination of the right IQ and EQ would be the catalyst to reach the stars.\n\nA person who learns languages, who has a flair for languages and who can articulate and express himself well is better off. He can communicate intelligently and Arts students are comparatively better in this aspect. An event organiser or hotelier deals with people, with their needs and their requirements. Being able to understand their needs and their requests come from understanding people. Thus, communicating effectively leads to efficiency and success.\n\nArts students delve more into human nature and are more exposed to social interactions through their intrusions into history, geography and the liberal arts. They make inroads into the world of commerce and economics. It is not that they are exempt from the sciences. They do learn the rudiments of mathematics and science although they do not delve in as deeply as the science students. Such teachings give them the basics which with experience will further sharpen their skills.\n\nBoys and girls, believe me, there is a future for Arts students as there is a future for science students. Take where your heart leads you.\n\nIf you are inclined towards careers which are person-orientated, then go in for fields where the human element predominates - in finance, banking, marketing, telemarketing, public relations, human resources, hotel hospitality, journalism, news broadcasting, graphic designing, advertising.\n\nIf you are interested in an outdoor life, be an environmentalist officer, a naturalist, or even an event organiser.\n\nIf you like to work indoors or work individually, choose to be a librarian or even a researcher.\n\nIf you like to talk, the television stations have hosts of careers. If you like to write, all the publishing houses and the media giants are there for the picking.\n\nIn today's society, there are a myriad of careers for you to choose from. The world is your oyster. There is no need to think you are getting a raw deal. I believe arts students are fortunate in that their choices cut across the board.\n\nAfter my pep talk, how do you feel ? I bet you are now thinking that you are on the right path. I could not agree with you even more -- you definitely are.\n\nThank you and no more regrets and no more low self-esteem. You are arts students and be proud you are !"

        "title": "Benefits of drinking water",
        "content": "You have been asked to give a speech on the benefits of drinking water in conjunction with World Health Day. Write out your speech.\n \nGood morning everybody. Today is World Health Day and today I am going to talk on the benefits of drinking water.\nWater is ranked second to oxygen as essential to life. A person can live for only a few days (only three to seven days) without it. In the human body, water makes up 60 to 70% of body weight and is important in numerous bodily processes and functions.\n\nEvery person loses approximately 2.5 litres of water per day through urination, perspiration, respiration and bowel movements. Very few people replenish this loss.\n\nThe health benefits of drinking water are many and varied. We cannot and should not understate the importance of drinking water.\n\nFirst, water revitalizes the skin. The skin is the body's biggest organ. If you are dehydrated, your skin suffers. Water is nature's best moisturizer. Drinking sufficient water rehydrates your skin from inside. With age, skin tends to become drier, so drink more as you age. Do tell this to your parents and grands.\n\nSecond, water rehydrates your body. Sunken eyes or dark circles are a sign of being drained of fluid and severe dehydration. Waste products that are normally washed out of the body are left in a higher concentration in the throat and mouth. The bacteria that builds up (other than poor dental hygiene) can lead to bad breath.\n\nThen, one main cause of constipation is lack of fluid in the intestine which slows the free flow of the bowel.\n\nNext, blood carries oxygen to the muscles. If water levels are low, you could develop muscle cramps because the process of oxygenating the muscles is inefficient.\n\nThe conditions above can be avoided by drinking adequate amounts of water daily.\n\nThird, water recharges your mind. A healthy mind is just as important as a healthy body. How many of you feel a lack of concentration on a hot day? Low concentration levels could be due to a dehydrated liver unable to eliminate toxins, causing sluggishness.\n\nHeadaches start in the mind and headaches are often a sign of dehydration. The brain is made up of 85% water, so before reaching for a headache pill or 2 Panadols, try a glass of water instead. It could well be the cure.\n\nFourth, water detoxes. Detoxing is valuable for the body as it cleanses and rids the body of toxins which are present in the air we breathe, the foods we eat and in many drinks. The body stores these excess toxics as cellulite or oily patches. Toxic overloads can lead to headaches, skin eruptions, constipation and that sluggish dull feeling in the morning. Using water to detox, eating a healthy diet and exercising\nsensibly boost the immune system and give you lots of energy.\n\nFinally, drinking cool (not cold!) water after intense physical activity reduces the body temperature and replenishes water lost through natural perspiration. The body's temperature rises above normal during exercise. A loss of only 3% of your body's water content causes a 10% drop in strength and an 8 % loss of speed. Such losses reduce athletes' performance and records. Hence it is important to drink more\nthan the recommended minimum during intense exercise.\n\nHow are we to know that we need water? Thirst is your best indicator. The thirst mechanism is one of the most powerful and sensitive of all the body's regulatory mechanisms. Listen to it. Be sensitive to its needs. The recommended daily intake of water for an average adult is 2 litres or 8 glasses.\n\nYou could try these tips to monitor your water intake. Take water breaks instead of coffee breaks. Choose decaffeinated coffee and tea. Drink water before scheduled physical activity during and after it. Keep a water bottle beside you. Spice up your drinking water with fruit juices or add a slice of lime or lemon to flavour that cool drinking water.\n\nIn conclusion, let us be concerned not only with monitoring our water intake, we have to be just as concerned about the water we consume - its quality and safety.\n\nThank you."

In your speech, talk about the objectives, benefits of reading, the various competitions and activities to promote reading as a hobby.\n \nGood morning, The Principal, Teachers and friends.\nToday, I stand here to talk about the Reading Campaign which is to be launched officially today by our Principal. The campaign is for a whole month. The first of September is the start and the thirtieth is the end where the winners of our various competitions will receive their prizes.\n\nAs the Head Librarian, I find my role very challenging. Today, I wish to state the objectives of the campaign.\n\nThe Board of Librarians would like the library to be the resource centre for all forms of reading and research. Our first objective is to gender interest in the library as the nerve centre of learning. When interest has been planted, our second objective is to promote the reference materials and the non-reference materials especially the fiction section [as in graphic novels] to the students. Then when students come to know the titles of both reference and fiction texts, the third objective is to make reading an activity of knowledge and entertainment. Our objectives are three-pronged.\n\nWhat are the benefits of reading? There are many but for this moment, reading is a source of knowledge for all ages, be it for studies or work. Then reading exposes you to the wonders of this earth. Your thirst for knowledge grows when you are assailed by facts and figures of events in this world. In addition, reading entertains you. Reading is entertainment in that through the printed form, your thoughts are magically transported to unknown realms. Reading can develop into a family tradition which leads to bonding. Make it your hobby! Even surfing on the net requires reading, so read, you must!\n\nNow I come to the part which would interest all. We are conducting a few competitions to get you interested in reading fiction works. The library is presently stocked with the latest editions of bestsellers.\n\nThe first competition is Marathon Reading where the winner has to read as many books as he could. The three winners would be interviewed by a panel of judges who would ask them questions on plot, characters and author of any books.\n\nThe second competition is Book Review. Pick any book you have read and write a review. This competition is divided into 4 Languages with 3 winners per language.\n\nThe third competition is Suggestions and Ideas on how to make the Library Your Second Home. The suggestions and ideas must be accompanied with concrete examples and viable applications. Again, there would be 3 winners.\n\nThe fourth competition is Writing Slogans. Write a slogan to catch a reader's attention. In this case, there would be ten winners.\n\nThe fifth and last competition is a class effort. In this competition, the class works as a team to select 30 fiction books. They would then have to write the plot summary and put forward reasons why the book is a good read.\n\nAll prizes are sponsored by Popular Book Store.

        "content": "You are the Chairman of the Rotoract Club in your school. As a service orientated club, you want to follow in the footsteps of your parent clubs, Rotary Club and Inner Wheel Club. Give a talk about Soup Kitchen where members can offer service in cash or in kind.\n \nGood evening, friends. We are gathered here to look into how we can be of service to the community. One of the ways is to volunteer to be part of the teams involved in a Soup Kitchen. I recommend the Pertiwi Soup Kitchen. The Pertiwi Soup Kitchen is a Community Outreach Effort.\nWhat are Soup Kitchens? Soup kitchens can be found in many of the world's cities. They exist to provide basic meals to those who go hungry, not because they are lazy or are looking for handouts, but because they simply cannot get enough food or proper nutrition. Those in need may include children, parents and the elderly. Some of them are homeless, jobless and infirmed, unable to find jobs to live a decent life. They do not ask for cash handouts. They want any paying job which can give them a roof over their heads and 3 decent meals a day. Their advanced years prevent many from being employed.\n\nMalaysia's economic success and prosperity has ensured that hunger is not a matter of not having any food at all, but whether those in needs are getting enough food on a regular basis. Moreover do we care enough to provide food to them?\n\nHow did the Pertiwi Soup Kitchen get started? The PERTIWI Soup Kitchen has been established to provide regular meals at various locations around Kuala Lumpur on a regular basis. This community outreach effort has been established and managed by Pertubuhan Tindakan Wanita Islam (PERTIWI), one of Malaysia's longest running NGOs. It had the initial support of the Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur\nDiRaja and some individual sponsors.\n\nSoup kitchens provide an important way to give back to the community. They offer a healthy meal to those who are in need. The few soup kitchens that do operate in Kuala Lumpur are already providing this critical service. However, there are still too many hardcore poor and homeless people in our city who are unable to eat on a daily basis. This project will complement these existing efforts.\n\nThe Pertiwi Soup Kitchen has the following objectives:\n• To distribute basic pre-packaged healthy meals and clean water 4 nights a week in inner city neighborhoods where various recipient groups are located.\n• To raise awareness of the number of hardcore poor in our city.\n• To encourage corporate and media sponsorship, and regular volunteer participation to feed the hungry.\n• To operate the programme in a sustainable manner that will enable it to serve an increasing number of people.\n\nThe PERTIWI Soup Kitchen project provides a humanitarian food-aid service to the hardcore poor irrespective of race or religion. By interacting with various destitute inner city communities on a regular basis, additional support programmes would be established to assist those ready for assistance to become more independent. A Job Agency could be set up to source employment for the healthy and\nable-bodied. Temporary hostel facilities could be set up for those unable to find cheap and affordable lodgings on getting employment. A Lending Agency could be established to tide new employees over the first month of employment until they are paid.\n\nTo help kick-start this important community effort, the Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur DiRaja had donated a Nissan Vanette C22 van to be used for the distribution of meals.\n\nNow what Pertiwi wants are more volunteers to help in the preparation of meals, the packing of food packets, the logistics of loading onto the transport vehicles to go to designated places to hand over these meals to those unable to get to the soup kitchens themselves.\n\nCurrently, Pertiwi goes to the homeless and the hardcore poor. But in the foreseeable future, Pertiwi is looking into the service which offers a one-stop centre for the soup kitchen to function. Besides preparing hot meals, Pertiwi hopes to provide baths and laundry facilities whereby the homeless and hardcore can avail themselves of such basic needs.\n\nWe, as members of the junior Club, should volunteer to help the Soup Kitchen on a regular basis. We can be kitchen helps, food packers, members of the cleaning and washing teams as well as accompany the food distributors as they go about in the city to hand freshly cooked food to the poor and the homeless.\n\nIt does not mean that we spend all our time at the Soup Kitchen but we sacrifice our free time to lend a helping hand to a NGO to lift up the spirits of the destitute.\n\nThink about what I propose. At our next meeting we will take a vote on it and liaise with our parent clubs to inform them of our intentions.\n\nThank you for your time. We'll meet again."

        "content": "You like watching futuristic films. Write a review of the film.\n \nThe film, Avatar is directed by James Cameron. It stars Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, and Sigourney Weaver. The cinematography is in the hands of Mauro Fiore with Joe Letteri handling the special effects and music by James Hormer. This action film runs for 2 hours and 43 minutes.\nThe film tells the story of a paraplegic marine, Jake Sully, played by actor Sam Worthington. After Jake's twin brother dies, he is asked at the last minute to go to a new planet called Pandora in his brother's place. Jake is sent on a special mission, along with his new virtual avatar body (so that he looks like the natives), to integrate himself with them and gain their trust.\n\nJake meets Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) a member of the Navi, the indigenous, primitive humanoid race that resides above a plot of land on Planet Pandora. The US Army lands on Pandora, an earth-sized satellite in outer space, to mine its valuable minerals from Pandora's soil. But before their objective is established, the army has to fight with the peace-loving inhabitants of the alien world of Pandora. Giovanni Ribisi's Parker Selfridge, the company executive has the choice of peace or superior firepower.\n\nAfter several weeks of learning their ways, Jake begins to develop feelings for the big blues, and even finds himself falling in love with Neytiri.\n\nBut Selfridge has no time for pleasantries. He has a battle-hardened colonel (Lang) just waiting to unleash military hell, and Jake has given them just enough information to begin their campaign.\n\nTwo groups of people lead the invading humans. The character Dr Grace, played by actress Sigourney Weaver, leads the kind-hearted scientists. Their mission is to learn and understand Pandora's physical environment and also learn about the Navi and how to possibly relocate them in a humane way. Colonel Quaritch played by actor Stephen Lang, leads the warriors. Their main goal is to destroy and kill the\nPandora Navis and their land.\n\nHowever, Jake finds himself leaving his human colleagues and joining the indigenous race of life forms in their battle for survival.\n\nAvatar has received attention because it is the first film to be released in 3D. The 3D effects were smooth and mesmerizing. They made the file come to life with the feeling that the breathtaking scenery was directly in front of you and that you were there with the characters and among the landscape.\n\nAvatar truly marks the coming- of-age of 3-D cinema with its pure technology, special. effects, beautiful finesse, aesthete, shock, fearfulness and eye for detail. The director's vision inside the Pandora is a pure art that is made more beautiful with the tall and wide eyed people, lush greenery and the post-modern creatures. With its simple straightforward narration, the movie's evergreen romance between. a human and an alien blended beautifully with the strong anti-war statement, giving Avatar its simplicity and heart.\n\nDirector and Screenwriter, James Cameron has no doubt created a burly and visually thrilling appeal to save the world, before it is too late. Cinematography by Mauro Fiore is excellent and the special effects by foe Letteri are truly mind blowing. Music given by James II pier goes off smoothly with the flow of the movie. Both Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington perform their roles excellently and have shaped up the warm love story of the Navi woman and the blue skinned human avatar perfectly.\n\nI enjoyed the film for its uniqueness, its storyline of survival set against power and violence. I would rate it 8/10. If you like futuristic films with a dash of incredulity plus romance and 3D magic, Avatar is for you."

        "content": "You enjoy reading novels. Write a review of a novel you have read.\n \nThe 2006 Booker Prize \"The Inheritance of Loss\" is Kiran Desai's second novel. Kiran is the daughter of Anita Desai who had been nominated for the Booker prize but did not bag the prize. It took Kiran seven years to complete her award winning novel and she used her own personal experiences of an Indian living in the United States to write her novel.\nThe story is set in the mid-1980s in a Himalayan town in India by the foot of Mount Kanchenjunga and New York.\n\nThe novel focuses on the lives of Jemubhai Popatial, a retired Cambridge-educated judge living in Kalimpong, his orphaned granddaughter, Sai who moves to live with him and his cook.\n\nThe peaceful fabric of their lives is disturbed when a Nepalese insurgency disturbs the region. Jemubhai becomes vulnerable because of his penchant for hunting rifles, the one sport he indulges in.\n\nTo add to the intricacies of the novel, the revolution threatens the blossoming relationship between 16-year-old Sai and her Nepalese tutor, Gyan.\n\nThe lives of these four main characters are intertwined with the story of the cook's son, Biju. He experiences the negative aspects of life as an illegal migrant in New York.\n\nKiran chooses not to formally introduce her characters to the readers but instead weaves them into her flashbacks. Then she constantly introduces minor characters. Her individualistic style sometimes makes it difficult for readers to engage with the characters and the readers need to concentrate or lose track of characters and events and in the end, the plot itself.\n\nThe pace is fairly fast and Kiran draws on the different characters' stories, sometimes going back in time and then bringing the readers back to the present day of the novel. The readers have to be attentive to the plot or will lose the flow of the storyline.\n\nThe book is beautifully written. Every word has been carefully selected giving the text an overall thoughtful and thorough description. However, there is an overemphasis on descriptions so much so that in some places the plot is overshadowed by an overdose of words. Then again, Kiran has the ability to write lines that are thought provoking, This is often at the end of the chapter to allow the readers to pause and think about the implications before proceeding with the text. In her writing, Kiran seems to be conveying a message to the readers about the importance of things in life. Kiran tells us not to overlook the simple implications of life. \"Time should move. Don't go for a life where time doesn't pass\".\n\nThroughout her novel, Kiran touches upon many different issues such as globalization, multiculturalism, inequality and the different forms of love.\n\nThe teenage readers can look through the eyes of the 16-year-old heroine, Sai. Maybe the introspective teenagers can comprehend the complexities of adulthood and an unequal borderless world that is constantly \"shrinking\". I would recommend this novel to the introspective teenagers but for those who are not into \"serious\" stuff, I suggest you give this book a miss.\n\nIn conclusion, the Asian element in English fiction has been taken on another literary ride in this multicultural, multilingual universe, making it a universal trait."

        "content": "Describe your favorite member of the family\n \nI looked at the photograph of the elegantly neatly styled beauty in her Lunar attire. Ah Ma, the endearment I used for her, has always presented her best to the world and this photograph is testimony of her principles.\nAh Ma stands just 160 cm, neither thin nor overweight but I like her perfect grandmother size: ever so slightly plump and very huggable. According to Mum, her daughter, my mother, she was beautiful in her youth and her sculpted cheekbones meant that she aged handsomely. She is still a handsome lady although more prosperous looking.\n\nShe has her favorite scent, instantly recognizable and when we get a sniff of it, we, my sister and I would be thrilled for it means an outing. Ah Ma \"smells\" a combination of Shiseido \"Beautiful\" and Revlon's Floral hairspray. Then there is the signature copper lipstick and permed short dark graying hair, sometimes falsified with a bun. As her eyesight deteriorates with the years, often too much powder appears on her face and we would have to take it off her. We do so with much glee and enjoyment.\n\nMum has to go out and work so we are left in the care of Ah Ma. A day help comes in for a few hours to assist Ah Ma. Ah Ma enjoys bossing the family around, even her favorite son-in-law, my father, who treats her with genuine respect or feeding us. On one hand, she is a mother hen, clucking away at her brood, nurturing and fiercely protective of her family. On the other, she is a respected matriarch,\nstrong-willed and fierce-tempered. She is usually listened to and obeyed.\n\nShe is generous, sometimes to a fault. She puts the needs of the family above her own. One of the numerous ways she expresses her devotion to us is through her cooking. She is a skilled and ingenuous cook, often improvising ingredients and I am sure she must have added that spoonful of love into all her dishes. She has a fantastic memory for all her recipes which she passes verbatim to her daughters and\ndaughters-in-law, unfortunately none to her grandchildren.\n\nShe has her eccentricities. Taught thrift from an early age although from a wealthy clan, she does not like to throw away anything. She hoards old toys, books, clothes and general bric-a-brac. Her attic is a trove of treasures.\n\nMy sister and I love to rummage through all the drawers and cupboards and we come up with little treasures, like the photograph of Mum in her baby suit and younger versions of all of us. Our shrieks of laughter at our discoveries leave Ah Ma bemused and exasperated but she indulges our childish escapades in her treasure chests.\n\nAh Ma likes to look at what we wear. She would raise her eyebrows at our brightly-colored T-shirts or faded denim jeans and mutter audibly under her breath: Modern - this is what girls wear nowadays - pants just like boys.\n\nAh Ma has this ritual every Lunar New Year. She would lay out all our new attire on our beds on the first morning. She takes great delight in overseeing our clothes, punctuating our preparation with subtle remarks: Comb your hair, use this ribbon, use your new socks, change your shoes.\n\nAs I grow with the years, I see the world more and more through her eyes. Ah Ma is the embodiment of the values of her generation, values that are traditional and eternal. This is in great contrast to the values of my generation, the \"me' generation, the \"I' in me which is inherently more selfish and inward looking.\n\nThe gap in years between Ah Ma and I would take half a century to cover but as I bridge the gap with my maturity, I believe \"next time I will see\". I am now at the crossroads where I can see through Ah Ma's wise eyes. Now I can see and appreciate. Thank you, Ah Ma !"

        "content": "Describe a place which has special memories for you\n \nI stood in the driveway with the dry dust swirling around my boots. I stared straight ahead of me at the wooden house with its main door and windows hanging loosely from the hinges.\nAs I looked at the dilapidated empty ruins, my mind traveled nostalgically to my years as a toddler and a teenager. I stayed here until I was 15. Now the house was a shadow of its grandeur when it was our family home. It was abandoned after a heavy thunderstorm when strong winds carried off the roof one dark wet night.\n\nLocated in a spacious compound dotted with fruit trees, tall giant trees and flowering shrubs and bushes, the \"Big House\" stood like a palace among the quaint, small kampong houses. The far end of the compound was bordered by a tributary of the main river where we fished and swam. The front faced the busy main road.\n\nThe house had a sprawling look, with annexes added as the clan grew in size. My fraternal grandparents stayed with us so did my bachelor uncles and spinster aunties. My parents and the brood numbering 7 were residents too.\n\nMy eyes moved to the side of the rickety door as I spied with my third eye the row of sandals and slippers that adorned the entrance. We were not allowed to run barefoot in the compound so there were hundreds of foot attire lined up for our use.\n\nI entered the house into the spacious living room. It was lighted by the sun through the sky roof. I spun round and saw the \"coffee-shop\" set-up in the right corner. Here was where Papa and his cronies would sit in their plastic easy lazy chairs and chat about business, football, government and families. Mother just prepared hot tea and hot coffee, setting them down on a low square wooden coffee table and leaving them to indulge in men talk.\n\nAt the other end, far away from the men was the TV corner where the womenfolk would be glued to their soap operas. Sometimes the children joined in but they were usually shooed off to complete their homework.\n\nIn the centre were the sofas and settees for guests and visitors or for us, the children to laze on and jump up and down. This area was usually empty, despite the cool comfort of the seats. Male visitors would seat themselves at the \"coffee-shop\". Female visitors would migrate to the kitchen where Mother was busy with her chores to chat with her.\n\nThe dining room which actually was the old kitchen was adjacent to the \"new\" modern kitchen. Dinner was a family affair at the gigantic round dining table surrounded by high backed chairs and stools. Everyone had to sit down to dinner with grandpa presiding over the meal. Lunch was never an issue because of school.\n\nBeyond the sitting and dining areas were the ten bedrooms altogether, of various sizes. They were furnished haphazardly with antique and modern furniture placed side by side. There were enough bathrooms although we still had to line up and fight over the use of the facility, especially in the morning.\n\nAbove the bedrooms was the attic room, a treasure house of the old and the new, the valueless and the priceless. Anyone who was taller than 4 feet could not stand up straight. I remembered hitting my head many a time when I forgot to crawl or creep. We loved playing hide-and-seek among all the chests and boxes. Now the attic was home to some of the homing pigeons.\n\nThe kitchen was my mother's pride and joy. Papa had equipped it with all the latest gadgets imaginable and we, the children spent almost all our time here, doing our homework on the large work table and watching our cartoons on Mother's color TV and listening to the music and serial stories on the portable radio.\n\nMy eyes misted as I remembered this old home, now sold to an entrepreneur who intended to convert it into an eco-tourism centre. According to papa, he was going to retain the pristine look of the surroundings.\n\nI was glad. The pleasures of my childhood in this country home would be available for nature lovers."

        "content": "Describe a priced possession\n \nThe postman was at the door with a parcel for me. It was from my sister who was pursuing a degree course in multimedia graphic designing in England.\nI tore the packaging paper and what I had in my hand was a book that traced my mother's walk of life from the day she was born up to today. There were altogether 50 pages for each year of her life.\n\nI had emailed all the documents, photographs and even couriered a host of other things that I could not email. She had utilised all that she needed into a gem of a momento for Mama on Mother's Day.\n\nThe cover was a stained glass rose design of a fusion of Mama's favourite colours.\n\nAs I turned the pages, I was taken on a walk down memory lane. The first five pages depicted her entry into this world: her birth certificate, photos of birthdays, rides, swims and cries.\n\nThe next few pages illustrated her years in kindergarten: the concerts and her graduation photograph wearing a mortar board and holding a scroll, she gave a toothy grin.\n\nHer thirteen years in primary and secondary school were enshrined in pictures of her sports activities, bicycle rides, school excursions, science projects of pressed flowers and leaves as well as candid photographs of her teenaged peer activities.\n\nShe next left to pursue tertiary education in Kuala Lumpur where she met Papa. I managed to siphon photos of them together culminating in their \"akad nikah\" and \"bersanding\" ceremony. She was resplendent in her wedding attire, so was Papa in his Malay suit.\n\nShe embarked on a teaching career and I followed her posting to the interior of Pahang prior to her wedding. Being young and inexperienced, she reveled in her totally new experiences which we read about in her letters. These letters to her family, fiancee and friends provided us with interesting snippets of her early years.\n\nThen we came on the scene, the five of us, commencing with my eldest brother and ending with me. She has her favourite photographs and Lia knew just the one of each of us to include in the chronicles of events.\n\nNext were photographs of Bang Long's graduation with our proud parents. It was followed immediately by Kak Long's entry into the medical profession and Bang Ngah setting up his accountancy firm.\n\nThen came photographs of Papa and Mama's pilgrimage to Mecca with \"Tok\" and \"Nek\". The serene looks on their faces were crystal clear to us.\n\nThe children sponsored mama and papa's first overseas tour of the Western world. Although we stayed home, we were the armchair travelers when they showed us candid shots of their tour.\n\nThe last page of the never-ending \"Saga\" was the celebration of the 25th wedding anniversary of Papa and Mama. It was a joyous occasion for everyone and the emotional outpourings could be seen on their faces and heard in the recordings made on the CD.\n\nThe souvenir ended with the words: \"the saga continues -- Happy Mother's Day !\" and to accompany it was another CD with messages from all her five children.\n\nI closed the book, wrapped it up with batik cloth, tied it up with a ribbon emblazoned with the words \"We love U !\".\n\nWithout a doubt, Mama was going to treasure her chronicles of  \"Mama's walk of life\" in her \"Chronicles of Ina\". You bet !"

The event started with the lovely rendition of the school song by the school choir.\n\nIt was next followed by a speech from the Principal of the school, Puan Indra Sidhu. In her speech, she presented a holistic view of the present scenario.\n\nThe hundred-year-old school has seen many changes from principals to students to buildings. The school buildings with dangerous structural cracks are in terrible need of repair. The PWD had declared some areas unsafe and sealed off these classrooms. Repairs are also needed to replace the electrical wiring which are years old and could pose danger to both building and people. On top of that, basic facilities in the school are lacking. Despite government aid, the school is poorly equipped to cater to the 21St educational needs of its students.\n\nTherefore, it is pertinent for the school administrators, its Board of Governors and friends, present and past teachers and students to extend a helping hand to return the school to a safe and secure condition.\n\nThe school requires almost a quarter of a million ringgit to repair the school and to purchase basic facilities for the welfare of the students.\n\nIn her appeal message, she appealed to all, well wishers, friends as well as the government to help. In the same breath, she expressed her profound thanks to everyone, from government to non-government agencies, who had rendered unstinting assistance in every aspect to the school, in whatever way, small or big.\n\nHer appeal speech was followed by the speech of the guest-of-honour, Datuk Salleh Krishnan who donated on the spot RM100,000. This was greeted by a thunderous applause from the audience.\n\nWhat followed next was a speech from the Principal who announced that she had received anonymous donations totaling another princely RM100,000 from diners in the hall. This did not include collection from the sale of dinner tickets and souvenir programmes.\n\nPrayers from and for the various communities were offered. While dinner was being served, the audience was entertained by songs, traditional and modern dances, and a video presentation of the school achievements and activities through the years. The dinner was interspersed with chat-shows and lucky draws of sponsored donated prizes. The presenters did a fantastic job, chatting up the audience, ex-students and teachers and even the VVIPS.\n\nEverything good had to come to an end. The dinner had been served. The concert was over. It was time to leave and it was time for the school to count their blessings. To all who had contributed, the organisers said a heartfelt thank you. The charity dinner was a success."

He invented something we didn't know we needed and now we can't do without it. His hard work and dedication made a difference in the world.\n\nBillions of people in the future will no doubt benefit from his inventions, some of which have yet to be seen. Jobs changed how we listened to music, communicate, consume and create, inventing the personal computer, the iPod, the iPhone, and the Wad, to list four of the 338 things he patented before dying at age 56 from cancer complications.\n\nSteven Paul \"Steve\" Jobs (February 24, 1955 - October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate and inventor. His numerous awards and acknowledgements by influential mass media and iconic fellow players and practitioners bore testimony to his talents and recognition from the industry itself and the adoring public.\n\nIn the late 1970s, jobs, with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Mike Markkula, and others, designed, developed, and marketed one of the first commercially successful lines of personal computers, the Apple II series.\n\nTo Jobs, \"Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. Apple make money by innovation. It requires a lot of disciplines to turn really interesting ideas and fledgling technologies into a company that can continue to innovate for years.\" Disciplines got jobs where he was - he started building kits in a garage!\n\nHis innovations were not only functional but entertaining: \"We're having fun. Our customers really like our products. We're always trying to do better. I want to put a ding in the universe.\"\n\nIn the early 1980s, jobs was among the first to see the commercial potential of the mouse-driven graphical user interface which led to the creation of the Macintosh.\n\nIn 1984, jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT. Apple's subsequent 1996 buyout of NeXT brought jobs back to the company he co-founded, and he served as its CEO from 1997 until his second leave of absence in 2011, before his demise.\n\nJobs emphasized the importance of design and understood the crucial role aesthetics play in public appeal. The development of his products that are both functional and elegant earned him a devoted following. \"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.\"\n\nWhile jobs was a persuasive and charismatic director for Apple, some employees had described him as an erratic and temperamental manager. Jobs was both admired and criticised for his consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship. Much has been made of jobs' aggressive and demanding personality. Fortune wrote that he \"was considered one of Silicon Valley's leading egomaniacs\".\n\nJobs had his individualistic approach to management, business and work. \"A lot of companies have chosen to downsize, and maybe that was the right thing for them. We chose a different path. Our belief was that if we kept putting great products in front of customers, they would continue to open their wallets.\"\n\nJobs had this to say of his management style. \"My model for business is The Beatles: They were four guys that kept each other's negative tendencies in check; they balanced each other. The total was greater than the sum of the parts. Great things in business are not done by one person, they are done by a team of people. The people who are doing the work are the moving force behind the Macintosh. My job is to create a space for them, to clear out the rest of the organisation and keep it at bay.\"\n\nJobs was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs of California. Jobs' biological parents, Abdulfattah Jandali, and Joanne Simpson (graduate students) later married, giving birth to and raising jobs' biological sister, the novelist Mona Simpson.\n\nJobs married Laurene Powell, on March 18, 1991. The couple have a son, Reed Paul jobs, and two other children. Jobs also has a daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs (born 1978), from his relationship with Bay Area painter Chrisann Brennan.\n\nHe usually wore a black long-sleeved mock turtleneck made by St. Croix, Levi's 501 blue jeans, and New Balance 991 sneakers. His car choice was a silver 2006 Mercedes SL 55 AMG, which had no licence plates.\n\nHe saw Apple as \"a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected.\"\n\nApple Co-founder and CEO Steve jobs leaves behind an indelible legacy that will forever remain in the world's imagination."

She had pushed her trolley from one end of the cashiers' counters to the other end. There were some unmanned counters. Those manned boasted of long queues.\nSighing in resignation, she mechanically pushed her trolley to one she thought was not that long. How wrong she could be! Three of the customers had heavily laden trolleys while two others had double trolleys. She was the ninth person in the line. Before she could relax, she was sandwiched when two more customers lined up behind her.\n\nShanti smiled sympathetically to which one responded with a casual shrug and a knowing smile. Then she heard the cashier calling out to her assistant to get the first customer's fresh vegetables weighed and priced. A quiet voice told the cashier she would forgo those two purchases. Shanti nodded her head sagely at the lady's understanding. After arranging all her purchases into her green bags, that customer paid for her purchases.\n\nThe next in line was very quick and left the counter with two small plastic bags. The third customer had a heavy load. She was quick in clearing her trolley of purchases and the cashier's assistant was just as quick in repacking into the trolley after the cashier had scanned the prices.\n\nThen it came to the fourth customer. She had a full trolley too. She was a tortoise in putting the purchases on the conveyer belt. She wanted to arrange them into the different categories. She even told the assistant off for packing her things wrongly. \"The customer is always right.\" The flustered assistant unpacked and did not venture to continue to pack for this customer.\n\nBy the time the fifth customer was attended to, a good forty-five minutes had elapsed. The double-trolley customer did not have many purchases. She had two trolleys because she had four big cartons of can drinks plus six cartons of box drinks. The cashier just scanned the price code without taking out these things from the trolley. That saved lots of waiting time.\n\nHowever, the sixth customer's two trolleys had assorted items. She took some time laying out her purchases and the cashier had more scanning to do. All three had to work fast so as not to hold back the others in queue. Even then the whole operation took about thirty minutes.\n\nThe seventh and eighth customers had their trolleys emptied, the goods scanned and repacked into plastic bags. They both took about twenty minutes.\n\nThen it came to Shanti's turn, the ninth in line. She was searching for her member card as well as her credit card in her handbag. She had to look into three compartments before she found them. Luckily she did not leave her wallet at home. She had been guilty of such absent-mindedness in the past.\n\nShe tried to put her things on the belt but in her hurry, her butter fingers made her clumsy. She laughed nervously at herself. Fortunately the two staff members were patient and understanding. They waited quietly. It could be they were taking a breather after clearing the trolleys of eight customers.\n\nShanti had her eco-green bags hanging on the trolley. The packer packed all the purchases into the bags and arranged them with the heavy ones at the base and the soft and perishable on top.\n\nShanti smiled her thanks at the sensible packer. She signed on the credit card printout. She took her receipt and credit card slip. She checked the receipt quickly for items and pricing.\n\nShanti pushed her trolley away from the counter. She was glad she did not have to queue too long. From the time she queued up to the time she was served, it took less than two hours for her to be served. She heaved a sigh of relief that she had chosen the right queue. She noticed that some queues were quite slow.\n\nShanti reminded herself for the umpteenth time not to go shopping for essential goods during the weekends or public holidays. She could not do it in the early morning hours or late at night. Shanti is a career woman. Maybe she should do shopping during her Friday long lunch break. But almost everyone thinks likewise, especially the career women.\n\nShanti consoled herself that it did not take too long, despite the long queues at almost all counters."

        "content": "Describe some local fruits\n \nI relish eating local fruits. In my youth, I climbed rambutan and guava trees to pick and eat the fruits right off the trees.\nThese days, I pick the \"kedondong\" (great hog plum) or the starfruit or even the Thai mango off its stalk, standing just below the trees. More often than not, I buy them from the fruit seller.\n\nMy favorite is the Indian mango. The fruits vary in size and shape. They can be as big as my palm or double that of a huge man's hand, averaging between 4 to 7 inches long to 3 inches wide. When ripe, the skin is either yellow or orange or greenish-yellow with a yellow or orange-red flush. In shape too, they vary from almost round to narrow oblong or oval. They are slightly beaked at one end with a bulge at the other side.\n\nThe mango flesh is bright yellow, very juicy and sweet to taste. It has an aromatic smell which is sometimes strong or almost absent. The stone or seed is fibrous and large, sometimes flat in the new strains but in good species, the fibers are short.\n\nAnother favorite of mine is the nona. There are two varieties: the \"Nona Capri\", the custard apple and the \"Nona Seri Kaya\", the sugar apple.\n\nThe fruits of the custard apple are almost round, about 4 inches wide. The color is dull green with a pinkish flush, ripening to a dull red. The skin is thin but quite tough and is covered with faint, criss-cross markings which are slightly raised but are not easily separated into segments.\n\nThe flesh is creamy white and slightly granular. It has a thick custard-like consistency, rather sugary and flavorless. There is a slightly fibrous central core. Round this core are many unattached black seeds embedded in the flesh. The small oblong seeds look shiny and smooth and are smaller at one end.\n\nThe other nona, the sugar apple has fruits which are almost round, about 3 inches wide. The fruits are covered with round knobs easily separable. The skin is pale green when ripe and covered with a greyish bloom. Some may have a dull pink look. When ripe, the fruit is soft and squashy, often falling into small segments. The flesh is granular, thick and white. The rather scented flavor is pleasant and sweet. Many black pips, about half-an-inch long, are embedded in the flesh.\n\nThe last local fruit is the hog plum, the \"kedondong\". The fruits are oblong, measuring about 3 inches, with several fruits growing on a drooping stalk. They are bright green at first, ripening to yellow flecked with brown. They are usually sold while still green. The skin is smooth with five faint, long depressions down three quarters of the fruit. The flesh is white and pulpy. It has a rather harsh unpleasant smell though some strains have a sweeter odor. A large, fibrous leathery stone is attached to the flesh. The seed has 5 cavities when cut open.\n\nExcept for the nona, the mango and the hog plum can either be eaten raw or pickled or cooked into jam or chutney. They have proven to be fantastic appetizers."

He collected his luggage from the carousel and quickly made his way to the arrival lounge, hardly able to contain his excitement at meeting his family after six years abroad.\nHe looked around expectantly, hoping to hear his voice being called out but he heard no sweet voices. He turned round and saw his parents, their dear faces shining with pride and pleasure but of his teenage twin sisters - none. There was no sign of them.\n\n\"They must be hiding somewhere - they love to play hide and seek.\"\n\nHe greeted his parents, and raised an eyebrow. His father smiled but said nothing. His mother was gushing all over him, not allowing him to say anything but kept on hugging him.\n\nHis father murmured, \"Let's get home. They're waiting for us at home.\"\n\nRadzi smiled, relieved to know they were at home. He kept on talking about his tour of Europe and he was rather puzzled whenever his parents exchanged glances. He dismissed them as his imagination.\n\nThey reached home quick enough as traffic was scarce that early morning, it being a non-working day.\n\nHe spied a lone figure at the door. \"Why one? There should be two.\" The twins were inseparable but it could be that six years had made all the difference.\n\nHe jumped out of the door and as that lone figure rushed towards him, he thought it was Wani but she said she was Wati. So it must be. He really could not differentiate between the two of them and they had fun deceiving him all the time.\n\n\"Where's Wani?\"\n\n\"In your bedroom.\"\n\n\"Wani, Bang's home.\"\n\nHe walked into his room and read the words `Welcome Home, Dr Radzi!' Trust his twin sisters to be so dramatic!\n\nAfter a late lunch, Wati invited him to go downstream to their favourite hideout. \"Bang, I wish to be alone with you without Wani. Wani can wait her turn.\"\n\nAt the hideout, Wati became all businesslike. \"Please, whatever I say, don't interrupt. Just listen, please.\" There was a quiet desperate plea in her tone.\n\nRadzi nodded for it was quite unlike Wati to be so serious, just the opposite of Wani.\n\nIn a quiet sombre tone she related what had happened to Wani. A year ago, Wani fell seriously ill and was diagnosed with cancer. Everyone wanted to tell Radzi but Wani begged them not to as he was sitting for his finals and she did not want him to lose all concentration and be so upset. Everyone had to promise and even after his finals, she wrote him to tour Europe before coming home. She sent him photos of her with Wati, smiling, cheerful and healthy.\n\nRadzi was stunned and asked in agony, \"How could she? Why did you let her do it? Why? Why?\"\n\nWati kept silent. All she could do was to hug her brother, comforting him as he sobbed his heart out. When the tears dried up, Wati held out a letter. Radzi recognised the handwriting.\n\nHe took it and walked to the graveyard. Wani went with him, then left him to read the letter and to be alone in spirit with his beloved sister.\n\n\"Bang, please don't grief. Remember me as the healthy, cheerful, fun-loving sister. Treasure our past moments and keep me always in your heart. Wati is with you. In her, you see me. I want to be a doctor like you. I can't but you are one now. Be the best doctor I know. I am proud of you.\" As he read her letter, a strange peace fell on him. It was as though she was beside him, comforting him and holding his hand. She was the elder and he the younger.\n\nHe looked up and saw her smile. He looked around, saw Wani and she smiled. In Wani, he saw Wati.\n\nHe walked up to Wani, took her hand. Together, the brother and sister walked home in the silence of the quiet evening."

Born in the same year, Hock was a day older than his cousin.\nThey were inseparable, a fact known to their mothers who were kindergarten bosom friends. But Chuan, Hock's father and Seng, Huat's father were sworn enemies and what was strange was that the fathers were blood brothers, having the same father.\n\nBut their friendship was the best kept secret of the town. Even their mothers were their allies. The two cousins behaved like total strangers in the presence of their fathers.\n\nHock was curious how Uncle Seng could be his father's favourite enemy and vice-versa. Hock and Huat tried to squeeze the secret out of their mothers but their mothers pleaded ignorance and they really had no one to appease their cat's curiosity.\n\nBut one night Hock's parents had a visit from a China lady, dressed in traditional blue samfoo and black trousers. She spoke a strange Cantonese dialect but she was warmly welcomed by Chuan who started behaving like an indulgent child. She spent a night with them and boy, was she feted!\n\nThe next day, she visited the family house and spent some quiet moments with Hock's grandmother who was as pleased as Punch to see her. Huat informed Hock that she had dinner with them that same night and Seng was thrilled to bits at her visit.\n\nHock and Huat could not but be intrigued by the lady's visit. It just could not be a coincidence that she came to visit both their fathers and was treated majestically by both of them. So the two boys cornered their mothers who happened by a strange act of fate to be having tea the next day together.\n\nThe two mothers knew they could not wrangle their way out of the situation and so graciously revealed the family skeleton.\n\nChuan was the eldest son of the first wife while Seng was the youngest son of the second wife. Chuan's mother passed away after his birth and that China lady was his milk mother. Huat's mother, their grandmother married into the family so that she could ensure the growth of the clan. Altogether she had six sons and three daughters. She treated Chuan justly. Unfortunately her husband died suddenly of a heart attack. She was forced to take over the business and ran it so efficiently that she turned it into a multi-million business empire. Her household was run by the China lady who favoured only Chuan and Seng. She just concentrated on her business. Her right-hand man influenced her to cut Chuan out of the business and install her favourite son, Seng as the sole heir.\n\nOf course, Chuan protested vehemently seeing that he too had played his role in stabilizing the company after his father's death. Even Seng tried to talk his mother out of it, an action known only to both mother and son as Seng had to be wary of the cunning sly right-hand man. Chuan thought Seng had a hand in stealing his birthright from him and he was furious. He refused to talk to his stepbrother and since that day, he acted as though Seng never existed. This was the scenario for five years until the right-hand man died.\n\nThe matriarch realised her mistake and on the influence of the China lady, reinstated Chuan as an equal shareholder together with the other six sons. She held an equal share. Despite his reinstatement, Chuan did not forgive his stepbrother and continued to have nothing to do to him.\n\nThe return of the China lady brought the two brothers together. She revealed the truth. The old family feud ended.\n\nThe two cousins could now openly be friends, much to the pleasure of the two mothers. Seng rumpled Huat's hair, \"You didn't fool me. I knew you two were friends.\"\n\nChuan smiled sheepishly, \"That was our quarrel, not theirs. Hock, I wasn't fooled either !\""

        "content": "The crashing sounds of wine glasses followed soon after the shattering of the expensive Ming vase. Emily crouched even further into her corner, willing her mind to stop taking in the sounds of her parents arguing again. She could not remember exactly when these arguments first started, but she always knew how they invariably ended. Mummy would send the bedroom door banging as she retreated in anger to that refuge. Daddy would come by and hug her before leaving the house for the next few days.\nEmily thought back to the first argument. It started soon after Mummy had come back from the hospital. She had looked wan then, such a far cry from her usual radiant and beautiful self. The first thing she did was to take Emily into her arms and squeeze her hard. Emily remembered wriggling irritably, making little noises to show Mummy her discomfort. But nothing she did then registered Mummy's mind. Suddenly, she felt a strange dampness on the collar of her dress and struggled free to look at Mummy's face. Her make-up had streaked all over her face, obviously ruined by her tears. At that moment, Daddy walked in and started speaking to her. She kept shaking her head and refusing to listen. In the end, Daddy was so angry that he stormed out of the house.\n\nFrom then on, increasingly, Mummy would smash things around the house whenever they argued while Daddy would seethe with impotent fury. Later on, Emily learnt that Mummy had lost the baby brother who was living in her stomach.\n\nNow, she was awakened from her thoughts when a missile shot past her face. Emily looked at the pieces of porcelain on the floor next to her and squeezed her eyes shut tight. The sounds of her parents' controlled fury and biting words persisted in driving themselves into her consciousness. She opened her eyes and looked up timidly at her parents. She saw the anger palpable in their stances-Daddy's hands were clenched tight around a photo frame while his mouth was forming words that were obviously hurting Mummy, who had buried her face in her hands and was sobbing uncontrollably.\n \n\nSuddenly, Emily realised what Daddy was holding onto so tightly. It was the framed photograph of their family on her fifth birthday party last year. She recalled that it was taken a mere few weeks before Mummy lost the baby. In the midst of her recollection, she heard her Mummy saying something about not wanting the baby to die and how she had suffered all this time. Daddy was implacable. He stared at her angrily and asked her, \"What about Emily?\" Emily's blood froze in her veins as she heard Mummy's reply, \"I don't care.\" The coldness with which that was said sliced right through Emily's heart. In a flash, she realised what the problem was. She was obviously the reason why her parents were arguing all the time.\n\nHot tears scalded her eyes as she felt the shame enshrouding her. She was unwanted. Suddenly, the piercing sound of glass shattering filled the air. Emily looked up. Mummy's voice shrieked the unforgettable words, \"Let it break! Let it break! Let it all go to pieces!\" The words resounded in Emily's ears. Even Mummy did not want her now, the same loving Mummy who used to rock her to sleep gently every night. Daddy looked so shocked that he was speechless. In the end, only seven words escaped him, \"Yes, let it all go to pieces.\"\n\nEmily felt a wave of fear. Daddy was giving up too. He did not want her either. They both did not want her. Besieged by the knowledge, Emily turned from the room and ran towards the front door. She heard her parents shouting her name, but she did not look back. Suddenly, glaring lights blinded her and she stopped. She only had time to say \"Oh!\" before the car rammed into her little body."

        "content": "Cries of distress and moans of pain filled the air. I looked around at the almost surreal setting, stunned by the confusion around me. The entire area was still reeling from the shock of the bomb blast just minutes ago. I knew I was coming to a war-torn country, but even that knowledge could not prepare me for the horror of the real thing. I could not imagine what I was going to suffer in the days ahead in my search for the child prodigy.\nMy company had sent me here to locate a child who had demonstrated signs of musical competency during a competition created to select a representative for the country at an international competition. Unfortunately, before the boy could unveil his talent to the world, rebels in his country had overrun the government and seized control. The upheaval in the days that followed had also seemed to swallow up any signs of the boy. My company directors were ardent admirers of musical talent, especially when such discoveries would bring in lots of publicity for their recording company. Hence, I was despatched with much unceremonious haste to the country to bring the boy back. This was despite the reports of civil unrest in the region.\n\nI resolved to locate the boy quickly before I became merely a statistic on the casualty list. I pushed my way past the dazed crowd in the area, trying to get to the next street where I had been told the boy was last seen. When I reached there, the same scene of devastation greeted my eyes. I was demoralised. What if the boy had been killed in the blast? Quickly, I rushed to the fourth house down the street, trying to keep my flagging spirits up despite the sight of the burning house. The heat was so great that I could not get into the house at all. All I could do was stand outside calling out the boy's name, hoping against hope that he would answer my call. But it was futile. No longed-for voice answered my desperate calls.\n\nFinally, I decided to make my way back to the hotel, or rather, what was left of it. As I neared it, I suddenly became aware of footsteps behind me. Fear prickled along my back as I quickened my footsteps, hoping to outpace the pursuer. But try as I might, the footsteps remained steady behind me. At last, my stamina fell flat, and I whirled around to confront my pursuer. To my surprise, it was a bedraggled little boy. Hope soared in my heart as I realised that, underneath all that soot, was the face of the prodigy I was seeking! My search was over! Almost delirious, I picked him up and asked if he was Nikolai Nostri. He nodded grimly, a lifetime of fear and agony imprinted on his every feature. He was clearly tired and frightened, fanning the embers of pity in me. I led him back to the hotel, holding his tiny hand tightly.\n\nLuckily, the hotel was not greatly affected by the blast and could still function. I telephoned my company to tell them the good news. After dinner, I brought Nikolai to the grand piano proudly displayed in the hotel lobby. Nikolai was a genius who could allegedly coax heavenly music out of the most cantankerous instrument. And he had absolutely no formal training! I told him my wish to hear him play and seated him gently before the piano. He reached out tentatively to touch the keys, and after a long while, he began to play. The resulting music that filled the room quietened everyone.\n\nSuddenly, the music stopped and Nikolai's head slumped loudly onto the keys. I rushed to him. Mutely questioning, I wiped the tears from his eyes. In a quavering voice, Nikolai answered my unspoken question, \"I'm no good. If I were, all this wouldn't have happened. Papa would not have died. It's all because I am not good enough. It's a punishment for me daring to try!\" The awful words hit me like a pail of ice-cold water thrown at me. I had never met anyone with so much talent, and yet so little confidence. How was he to face the demands of the company directors who would insist he produce music, whether he liked it or not. The joy of the evening suddenly turned to ashes for me."

It was already late afternoon, and sleeping was not going to help him stave off the hunger any more. He slowly lowered himself from the ledge he was on and made his way home from the disused bridge he was napping on.\nHome was a dilapidated mud shack with so many holes puncturing its walls and roof that the wind practically whistled through it when the rainy season approached. Ah De loved the music of the wind then; it helped him forget the chill that permeated his emaciated body. Though his house was in a pathetic condition, Ah De still smiled as he thought of his mother's face. She was a wonderful woman who never forgot to make him feel treasured. They were alone in this remote part of China, his father having died in the war. She made a meagre living washing clothes for other families, while Ah De did his part by eating little and staying out of her way. But in the evenings, she would put her arms around Ah De and tell him the loveliest stories of courage and adventure. Ah De knew that he would do all he could to make his mother happy.\n\nSuddenly, the loud din of cymbals clashing and trumpets playing a merry tune cut the air. Ah De swung around to where the sound was coming from. He saw a procession of people coming down the road, heralding the brightly-coloured sedan chair that was carried by four burly men. The children of the village were all dancing around the sedan chair, delirious with joy. Ah De's curiosity was piqued. The children were usually dour and listless. Why were they so chirpy now? He rushed after the procession.\n\nHe finally found out that the man in the sedan chair was an important man in the capital, someone who wielded great power and was back in the village to find a successor. He was a native of the village who had left many years ago to eke out a living somewhere else. Now that he was close to retirement, he needed to find a smart little boy who could carry on his work. Ah De felt a glimmer of hope. He could do it, he was sure. After all, his mother had always said that he was smart. Ah De found out that the rich man was leaving the next day and would bring the chosen boy with him. His heart surged with hope as he went home.\n\nHis mother was appalled at his intention. Ah De was surprised. Did she not understand that he wanted a better life for both of them? He would love to see his mother luxuriating in silk instead of having her skin roughened by the coarse cotton that she now wore. He would make sure that she partook of the finest delicacies once he was rich. He wanted her to be happy, not suffering. But his mother cried hopelessly, pleading with him not to go to such lengths for wealth. He simply could not understand it.\n\nSuddenly, he realised why she was crying. She did not want him to leave her! Of course he would not! Ah De laughed and assured her that he would definitely bring her along to the capital. He loved his mother too much to even leave her for a day. But his words did not reassure her. She merely cried louder. In the end, Ah De fell asleep, exhausted by all the excitement.\n\nAh De woke up with a start the next morning. The day was unusually bright. He scratched himself irritably, wondering where his mother was. Suddenly, he realised what it was that troubled him. He was late! He had to get to the rich man's house for a chance to be selected as his successor. Ah De rushed out of the house, tugging at his clothes and trying to slip his feet into the shoes at the same time. When he arrived, all he could see was an empty courtyard. All the trumpeters and musicians were gone. There was no sign of the feasting and celebration that had taken place the day before. Ah De sank to his knees in tears. He was too late. He would not be able to give his mother a better life or buy her silk and delicacies."

Young children were running around, high in spirits as they enjoy the simple game of `catching'. Their tattered clothes were by no means a deterrent to their ebullience. Awangku was the leader of this community, and he watched the children in their game with much envy as he thought of how their innocence shielded them from the harsh realities of survival that plagued their parents.\nHe recognised what many would have missed when he first saw the squatters. They were a family, bonded by years of common suffering. Where there was no one to care about their lives, they had each other. Even in the face of the rightful owners coming to claim this piece of barren land, their solidarity had stood strong to ward off the rich and greedy landowners. Finally, the latter had given up trying to force them off the land and turned their attention to more profitable ventures. Awangku was sure that they had all finally found a place of their own.\n\nHowever, a report appearing in the local newspapers the following week threw the once congenial village into a stagnant pool of suspicion and hate. Some geologists had discovered that the village was sitting on a wealth of oil, one of the last few natural oilfields hitherto unexploited. The news shook the equanimity of the villagers and crumbled the once solid feelings of amity they had for each other. Overwhelmed by the thought of being rich, each began planning his future, a future suddenly cushioned by real money.\n\nThe weeks following the news report saw hostility erupting in the once amiable village. Neighbours who had once shared meals with each other now became combative as the worry over the fair allocation of wealth loomed. The villagers were unsure over how the money would be distributed. Those with a brood of children claimed a share for their offspring, while those with none or few decried such allocation. Awangku was in despair. His villagers were hurling accusations and displaying hatred towards one another, even before anyone came to confirm the existence of the oilfield. Almost overnight, the village was\nsundered by the prospect of wealth.\n\nIn no time at all, the prospect of wealth disappeared as quickly as it had come. The landowners were quick to reclaim what was legally theirs and sent survey teams to plan the construction of oil wells on the now precious land. The hue and cry raised by the villagers were to no avail as the landowners refused to be thwarted by such inconveniences. Within a month, the villagers found themselves tossed out of their 'homes'. There was no more land, no more village, no more family homes. For the first time since they became ensnared by the obsession with wealth, they saw clearly the foolishness of their actions. They had destroyed their only real wealth by their divisions and by hankering after an illusion."

Lenny was more frightened than he had ever been. Going into the deep forest was revisiting a nightmare he had wanted to forget all these years. He could still remember the first and last time he had walked this trail. His father had been killed by a man-eating tiger that was prowling the area. It may have been over ten years ago, but the terror that he felt still held him in its icy grip.\nBut now, he had to walk the trail again to search for Emma. She was the pride and joy of his life, the only treasure he had from a marriage that was blissful but unfortunately short-lived. After Sara's death, all that comforted him in his barren existence was Emma's cheerful nature and loving ways. She had wandered off into the forest while playing by herself in the backyard. That was where her footsteps imprinted on the soft mud led. It indicated that she had gone on the dreaded trail.\n\nWith a deep breath, Lenny plunged into the forest on the trail, calling out for Emma as he went on. But all he heard were the wild shriekings of forest insects and creatures. He ploughed on, determined to hold the terror that threatened to overwhelm him at bay. Yet, he could feel once again the familiar fear that gave him nightmares each time he recalled the horrific spectacle of the tiger tearing his father apart. His father had placed him on a high branch before the tiger pounced, safe from the physical attack but not the sight of his courageous father brought down by the beast. He saw it all, heard clearly the hoarse cries of pain that his father gasped even as his throat was being torn out by the mighty jaws of the tiger. But he had to shut out these thoughts; they were only impeding him from his search. He pushed on into the dark forest.\n\nSuddenly, he heard Emma's high-pitched scream. Without a thought for his own safety, Lenny lunged in the direction of the scream, concerned only with getting to his precious Emma was. He came into a clearing and saw Emma huddled in a corner and crying fearfully. He rushed to her side immediately and suddenly heard a low growl behind him. Frozen in his tracks, he finally turned around slowly, only to face the tiger of his nightmare. The latter even bore the scars inflicted by his late father's hunting knife. Slowly, he lifted his gun, his mind whirling with only one thought. If he failed, Emma would die. He did not want to even entertain such a thought.\n\nThe tiger fixed its eyes on Lenny. It gave him a deadly glare, but Lenny continued to take aim. Almost as if it could sense what he was going to do, the tiger snarled and leapt into the air at him. The gun exploded and caught the beast just before it landed. Writhing in pain, it rolled over and over until it finally lay dead, just metres away from the shaking Lenny.\n\nEmma ran to him and threw herself around his neck. He felt her warm little body and hugged her tight. His Emma was alive and the nightmare was dead. For a long time, he had not enjoyed the beauty of the forest, but now he did. It was so beautiful."

After all, he thought, Simon had the advantage of a rich family and so, he should be taught a lesson about how the less well-off people had to really work hard for themselves. Jerry's familiar refrain to all his friends whenever he sought to discredit Simon was: \"Sometimes, we have to treat people unkindly for their own good.\"\nIn fact, both boys were in the same class. This made it even more convenient for Jerry to carry out his exclusionary policy on Simon. Whenever the class had to form groups to carry out research projects, Simon was inadvertently left out. The teachers found themselves having to force groups to include Simon in the discussion and they were puzzled at the students' antipathy towards the quiet and thoughtful boy. But the class remained hostile to Simon. Jerry was acknowledged as the leader in class, being the captain of the school soccer team. The other students looked up to him as their hero.\n\nHe had known about Simon even before the latter was transferred to the school. After all, his mother worked as the housekeeper in the large mansion that was Simon's home. Since young, Jerry had looked at all that Simon had with envy and anger. Why should Simon be so privileged and he so poor? Jerry seethed each time he remembered how he had to bow his head whenever Simon or his family walked by. Jerry's mother ensured that Jerry treated them with a great deal of subservience, unaware that each time she made him do so, her young son's hatred intensified.\n\nWhen Simon was finally transferred to Jerry's school after his parents had lost their fortune and been forced to downgrade their lifestyle, Jerry knew that it was payback time. He would show Simon that he was the superior one, even without all the trappings of wealth. Jerry leant back and thought of how he had accomplished his revenge so easily, even managing to convince the other students that he was doing it all for Simon's good. His lips curved into a tight smile as he remembered his success.\n\nSuddenly, his team-mate Suresh ran to him with the message that his form teacher and soccer coach wanted to see him. With a sense of foreboding prickling his skin, Jerry ran to the staff room. The grim expressions on the faces of his teachers worried him. He sat down quietly, hoping that the worst would not happen. He knew that he had not managed the minimum academic score required for a school athlete to remain on the school team. But he was cocksure that his superb performance in the school tournament would overcome all those poor results. The look on the faces of his teachers now showed that he was mistaken.\n\nAs he left the room later after the interview, Jerry was depressed. How was he to achieve the results required by the school before they would let him play in the tournament due to start in a month's time? To catch up on all his schoolwork in a month was clearly impossible. His mother would never be able to afford a private tutor for him and he had no good friends who were capable of helping him.\n\nJust then, Simon walked by, his eyes downcast. Jerry brightened up. Simon was the top boy in his class and would surely be able to help him. Jerry's smile broadened even more as he thought of how grateful Simon would be to be given a chance to help a popular boy in school. Jerry strode quickly over to Simon and outlined his proposal to Simon who was to stay back in school after lessons every day to help Jerry achieve the required results. In return, Jerry would try to bring Simon into the `in' group. Jerry smiled as he thought of how clever he was to have been so attentative to his side of the bargain. He looked at Simon as a strange expression crossed those aristocratic features. After a long pause, Simon's voice rang out loud and clear.\n\n\"Thank you for your kind offer, Jerry But I'm afraid I cannot do it. I have other things to do. You may think that I'm unkind, but sometimes, we have to treat people unkindly for their own good.\"\n\nWith that, he turned around and walked away, leaving a shocked Jerry at the corridor."

They all knew the friendly shopkeeper, Ah Keong, who kept all their dinner needs supplied. His wife was also a genial lady who had a way with plants and usually gave the people tips on how to manage their greenery. They had no idea that the couple was in trouble over money; they always kept up their smiling demeanors.\nRumors soon floated about, whispering of Ah Keong's son owing the loan sharks a great sum of money, which the couple could not pay. After being threatened continually, they packed up and went into hiding to avoid the harassment. Everyone gaped at the drama that unfolded in the juicy gossip. But little did they know that soon, they would be the actors in an even more thrilling drama.\n\nOne morning, the loud screams of Sophia, a young executive whose habit was to jog around the neighborhood in the early morning, woke everyone up. Rushing to see what had happened, they were greeted by a horrifying sight. The bloody head of a pig was hanging at the entrance of the store, its rawness smelt of menace. The freshly slaughtered pig was still dripping blood all over the porch, swinging slightly as if it was still alive. The limp body of Sophia lay on the road, having fainted from shock. When she awoke, she told of how she had come upon the pig's head and later lost consciousness. The neighborhood was now hushed in dead fear.\n\nBut there was more to come. The next day, the residents woke up to find the store covered in a chaotic coat of obscene graffiti. The threats that were sprayed all over the front of the shop were grim in their warnings: if Ah Keong failed to pay, human blood would be shed next. The residents were now truly alarmed. It seemed like no one was safe from the loan sharks. After all, no one knew where Ah Keong was and the presence of the police after the pig's head incident was reported did not seem to deter them at all.\n\nThe next few days grew even more tense as groups of rough-looking men began to sit outside the store for hours on end. They smoked, cursed loudly and even leered at the young girls passing by. Everyone felt their presence like a disease in their lives and dreaded when the worst would come. It came sooner than expected.\n\nOne night, the sirens of police cars and ambulances driving into the neighborhood drew the residents out from their houses. The prostrate body of a little boy lay on the ground, blood still flowing from a deep gash on his back. Some of the gangsters were handcuffed; they sat on the curb in a daze. The residents soon found out that the boy was chased by the gangsters, mistaken for the grandson of Ah Keong. The boy had tripped and fallen on his back onto a protruding rock and lost consciousness.\n\nThe entire episode drew to a tragic close. It took the blood of an innocent boy to end the loan sharks' tyranny over an unpaid loan of a mere RM10,000."

But his simple lifestyle belied that fact that he was the richest man in their neighborhood. Yet, Mr Chai never once lorded his wealth over them. He always took care of them whenever they needed help. Even the bridge over the busy expressway nearby was built by him for the residents, who had to walk a long way around to get to the other side before the days of the bridge. Everyone saw Mr Chai as the guardian of the estate.\nOne day, a young shifty-looking man came to look for Mr Chai and ended up living in his house. Mr Chai's housekeeper revealed that the young man was Mr Chai's nephew. The latter was recently retrenched by his company and had come to his uncle for help. Being the kind soul that he was, Mr Chai welcomed him with open arms. But the neighbors thought otherwise. The residents saw the young man's lazy ways and sly eyes and trusted him not a bit. He was always doing nothing but flaunting the fact that he was Mr Chai's nephew. By doing so, he thought to elevate his position in the neighborhood. Little did he know that they ranked him only above the stray animal.\n\nOne day, the people heard that Mr Chai had decided to invest all his money in a business venture with his nephew Everyone became worried. The young man was obviously not to be trusted, they thought. Many of them went to see Mr Chai to advise him against doing so but he merely smiled. In their hearts, they understood that if he could do what he had done for them, when they were not related in any way, he would definitely not begrudge his nephew They sighed and left his house sadly.\n\nBut the day they expected to come did not materialize. They had thought that the venture would be a bogus one, created to drain Mr Chai's money, but it was a solid investment that raked in the profits within a few months. Slowly, the residents began to feel better about the whole affair, convinced that Mr Chai was safe from any conniving nephew But one day, they came home from work to see Mr Chai's housekeeper sobbing piteously outside his house, which was in the process of being locked up by some strangers. They learned that Mr Chai's nephew had tricked him into signing over all his assets; Mr Chai was now penniless.\n\nEveryone was outraged. After all that the kind uncle had done for him, the young man was ungrateful and scheming. They rushed to see Mr Chai, who had just finished clearing out his things from the car. Instead of being despondent, he greeted them with a smile. Some of the women started crying when they realised that the selfless man had really lost everything. But Mr Chai consoled them, saying that he never really needed that much money. A simple life was enough for him. In the end, Mr Chai made his home among these poor neighbors, content to lose his fortune but gain so many true friends."

He had spent so much time studying the volcanic activity of Mount Kilisaro in Indonesia via the computer and other sources that to actually go there and see it for himself would be wonderful. Furthermore, it was a trip that he would never be able to make on his own. The money involved was too much for his working-class family. The state-of-the-art equipment that would be brought along by the university team was beyond his means. He was only a research student on a scholarship to one of the most prestigious universities in the country.\nHe knew that being selected for this trip would be a feather in his cap. His family would be so pleased at his progress in the university and he would also come closer to realising his dream of being a geophysicist upon his graduation. He wanted so much to work alongside experts in studying how the Earth came about and the physical processes that continued to affect it. Emir thought about his family still living in a one-room flat, eking out a miserable living each day on the streets. He resolved to be a success so that they would be able to afford more than just salted fish with their rice for each meal. Emir brushed away the tears on his cheeks and proceeded to write out his application.\n\nThe results of the application for the trip would be announced that morning. Emir strode quickly to the notice board outside the hall where the list would be put up. He knew that he had a very good chance of getting into the team. After all, he was consistently getting good grades in his studies and had been working hard with Professor Lambert on the project. He was also physically fit and would be able to handle the steep ascent of the mountain. In fact, he met all the criteria listed on the poster. Tom hastened his feet to move faster as the blustery weather swirled into the holes of the thin jacket he was wearing.\n\nThe shock that he felt as he searched frantically for his name on the list numbed him. He could not believe it. Even the usually frivolous and lazy Mary had made it to the team. Emir could not understand it. Why was he not selected? He ran down the corridors to Professor Lambert's office. Once there, he saw the wizened old man bent over some rock samples. Emir's heart constricted tightly in affection for the fatherly professor. Professor Lambert had been a wonderful mentor to him since he joined the university. He had made sure that Emir received the best of his knowledge regarding geophysics, treating him like the son that he never had.\n\nSuddenly, it struck him that the list of people selected for the trip had one thing in common - they were all wealthy! Emir realised why he was not selected. Resentment and anger at the unfairness of it all gripped him and he punched the wall with his clenched fist. Professor Lambert turned around and looked at him. Quietly, he told Emir, \"I'm not going either.\" With that, he smiled and went back to his work. But the feeling of great disappointment still tore at him, making him rail inwardly against the unfairness of the whole thing. Why did they not choose on merit?\n\nThe day of the trip came and went. Emir walked around the campus like an apparition, oblivious to everything around him. The disappointment still gnawed at him like an ulcerous sore refusing to heal. Suddenly, he realised the commotion around him. People were running hastily towards the student's lounge. He quickly followed. There, all eyes were focussed on the television news bulletin. The shock at what he saw rooted him to the ground. He could not think straight, except for the same sentence that repeated itself in his mind. \"Thank goodness I'm here! Thank goodness I'm here!\" He would never forget the sight of the research team sprawled all over the mountainside as rescuers worked to free their dead bodies from the landslide that left no survivors."

He vaguely remembered warm beds and hot food in days long past and cursed his mind for not being able to remember. If he could think about it, maybe his body would be fooled into thinking that it really was warm and well fed. But it was not going to work. Ben got up and decided to walk off the hunger pangs. Maybe he would find some food along the way.\nThe night was still young for those who had the means to enjoy themselves. The streets were lit in strange iridescence from the night spots. Ben trudged wearily down the streets, despairing of ever finding food. Suddenly, he found himself caught in a car's headlights and saw a well-dressed figure coming out of it and walking towards him. He blinked to see the person clearly. But the notes clipped between the man's fingers arrested his attention.\n\nThe man's voice was low and even, asking a question that Ben could hardly make out. When he showed that he could not hear, the man spoke louder. 'Are you interested in earning some money? We have a game that's still lacking some participants.\" Ben was intrigued. They were going to pay him RM1,000 just to play a game. He wondered what the game was, his skin prickling at the premonition of danger. Yet, the attraction of the money was too great for him to resist. He nodded quickly and was told to meet them down at the highway in thirty minutes.\n\nBen walked his way to the appointed rendezvous. All the way, he racked his brains for some answers to the questions that were whirling in his mind. But he could find none. At the highway, he saw three more cars beside the one he had encountered earlier. There was a group of men standing around, their lighted cigarettes looked like tiny lights in the dark. When he got closer, Ben saw that they were armed. He began to panic. But the man who had spoken to him came forward and explained the game to him. If Ben could escape unscathed to the riverside with the men hunting him down, he would be allowed to keep the RM1,000 that they were giving him now Ben felt a strange fear in his bones, but could not help thinking how the money would change his life. He had been dirty hungry and without hope. Now, there was a chance for a new life. Yet, he doubted if he could make it to the riverside in his weak condition. In the end, he decided to take on the challenge.\n\nBen was given a ten-minute headstart, and he made the most of it. He ran like his life depended on it, as it literally did. Falling over stones and stumbling as his joints gave way, Ben came close to the riverside. In fact, he could hear the gurgling of the river on its way downstream. A smile broke his face as he realised that he was going to make it. Suddenly, a sharp pain exploded in his chest and he fell. Touching his chest, he saw an arrow protruding from it. Blood was flowing rapidly and he could hear the footsteps of the hunters behind him. He tried to pull himself to the riverside but he could not. As the lifeblood slowly poured out from him, Ben realised that he was going to die a rich man. Smiling, he patted the money in his pocket and then closed his eyes. Forever."

He was tired of hearing her launch into a tirade against him, frustrated by her vitriolic outbursts about what a lousy husband he was. Wai Leng was never satisfied with anything that he did. If he brought home $4,000, she would taunt him with stories of how much her colleagues' husbands earned. If he had bought her flowers, she would still invariably grumble about how other people received diamonds instead. She was impossible to please.\nHe decided to take a walk along the tranquil banks of the reservoir. It was always a balm to his frazzled nerves after an encounter with his wife. As he walked towards the bus stop, he mulled over his life. Sometimes, he wondered at the insanity that must have possessed him when he married Wai Leng. Perhaps, they had been happy in the early days, but those days were definitely behind them now.\n\nAs he approached the shelter, he spotted a white bundle on the seat. Curiosity crept in, he walked closer to take a look. To his surprise, it was a baby all wrapped up in a rough white towel. As he reached out to touch the baby, it suddenly stretched out to try to grab his fingers. Dek Poh was tickled. As he laughed with happiness at the angelic face of the baby, waves of tenderness washed over him. What a beautiful baby it was! He wondered who could have the heart to abandon such a bundle of joy.\n\nSuddenly, in a rare show of decisiveness, Dek Poh picked up the bundle and strode quickly to the police post just some distance away. He reported finding the baby and, when it was revealed that no one had come to report a missing baby, he was asked to have temporary custody of it. Although initially sceptical, the policeman soon gave in to Dek Poh's obvious sincerity. Somehow, Dek Poh knew that Wai Leng would welcome this baby into their childless marriage.\n\nTrue enough, she got over her initial grumblings and chastisements and started cooing over the baby. The days with the baby in the house were the most glorious ones in their lives. The halcyon days of playing with and taking care of the baby somehow repaired the couple's rocky marriage. As he watched her fussing over the baby, Dek Poh finally remembered what he had loved so much about Wai Leng - her tenderness and capacity for love.\n\nEven though the baby was returned to its parents weeks later, Dek Poh and Wai Leng knew what was missing in their lives. It was not so much having a baby, but rather, allowing the love in them to come out and wash all the bad feelings away. Dek Poh never had to go to the reservoir again."

The locals were impressed by the way these youngsters worked - all four exhibited dedication to their task with such fervor that the locals had to tell them several times to rest or risk heatstroke. But it was a sip of water and then back to work for them. The locals were impressed by the selflessness of the young men.\nSuresh was really determined to distinguish himself as a good worker. The supervisor on this project would be coming round any time now, and Tom wanted him to see how diligent he was. After all, he had not wasted his holiday on some silly project for nothing. Whether the villagers were able to cross the river was of no concern to him except that it would give him a good report that would come in handy for his bid to win a place on the Students' Council in school. He wondered when the supervisor would appear.\n\nSoon Hock was oblivious to the heat beating down on his back. He relished the freedom that he finally felt after years of being in an oppressive family. He was tired of being told what to do and how to do it. He was not stupid and slow, as his family was always making him out to be. He would show them that he could do something good without their unbearably dictatorial instructions. He would go back a new person, a proven hero. He had to, if he hoped to escape from his family.\n\nMelvin glanced around the site. He could see the grateful looks of the locals who were overjoyed that the bridge across the river would finally be built. They would not have to go around the river anymore. He felt so happy that he was finally bringing a smile to someone's face. Melvin was extremely unpopular in school, the reason for which still remained unknown to him. He wanted to come on this volunteer mission to feel part of something, to bask in the significance of something else. He was glad he had come. He felt better about himself by the minute.\n\nAkmal hated supervising such missions. He always ended up dirty and hot, with inadequate food and drinks to make up for the backwardness of the village. Had it not been for the fact that he needed some community service to be shown on his application form for the 'Outstanding Teacher of the Year' award, he would never deign to come to such a godforsaken place. He would be spending his holiday in some picturesque country where there would be exotic cuisine to be savored. Here, he could only taste the salty sweat trickling down his face. It was disgusting.\n\nThe villagers decided to hold a cookout that night. They wanted to reward the young men for being so selfless with their time and effort. Only the truly kind-hearted would help them like they were doing, or so they thought."

It was way beyond her ability to ever earn such a large amount of money. No matter how many cardboard pieces she picked up to sell to the rag-and-bone man, she would never earn even a quarter of that amount. Her beloved father lay on the rough bedding of old newspapers and other 'castaways' salvaged from the rubbish dumps. His fever was raging as high as ever, with the infection slowly but surely spreading in his body.\nThe woman smiled at the little girl. What a Siewt little thing, she thought. It was really such a waste, sending her on such a dangerous mission. But she had no choice. Someone had to plant the bomb, and sacrifices in the course of the revolution were inevitable. The lady clasped Siew's hands in her well-manicured ones and solemnly agreed to get her father the best treatment possible if she succeeded in delivering the package safely. Siew was only too happy to agree.\n\nThe next morning, Siew was handed a large parcel. Her job was to place it by the first table in the popular restaurant downtown. After that, the lady promised that she would send her father to the best hospital where he would be treated for his infection. Siew skipped almost gaily to the destination. She thought about her kind father who had struggled to bring her up in a manner that was dignified and proper. He never let her beg or do so himself. All that they earned came from hard work. Tears collected in her eyes as she thought of how much she loved him. With renewed determination, she trudged quickly to the restaurant.\n\nHer presence in the restaurant was not noticed by anyone. After all, she was too small to catch the attention of the busy waiters. She left the parcel and then ran quickly back to the shelter where her father was. Siew was so excited that she had managed to earn the money to save her father. She would tell him proudly when he awoke that she did not beg for it. Sitting by her father as he groaned in his semi-conscious state, she waited patiently.\n\nNight came and then morning approached, but still the lady did not show up. Siew went outside to see if she was coming. She tried to tell herself that perhaps the lady could not remember where the shelter was. But it was of no use. She had to face what she had refused to acknowledge. It was obvious that the lady had never intended to keep her promise. Finally, Siew's forced optimism crumbled and she sat down on the gutter outside the shelter, her sobs mixing with her father's groans to form sad music in the still of the night."

He felt like he had been waiting for an eternity, when it had only been twenty minutes since the last skirmish erupted. He held the lives of his comrades literally in his hands, as his role was to detonate the bomb that would blow up the enemies' escape back into the dense jungle. But the signal had still not come.\nAll around him, the strangled cries of men forced themselves into his unwilling consciousness. He wondered how long it would be before it all finally died down. But it was unlikely that he would see that end; he knew that the war had only just started. As he thought about all that he had to leave behind to defend his country, hot tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\nHe remembered the warm and loving faces of his family and those halcyon days that were now so far away as he ploughed deeper into the smoke and death that was undeniably war. When he had gone home one day, full of resolution and enthusiasm to join the war, his parents were stunned. After all, he was only fourteen, an age when boys were still exploring the hills and caves behind the village. But he was adamant. He had gone to listen to the stirring speech by the war recruitment officer, who had won over the hearts of the young men and boys with his speech about the valor of men and the honor of being in a war. Nothing was going to stand between him and his maturity into a real man; he had decided there and then.\n\nThe day he left the village to board the rickety truck which would bring them to the barracks dawned bright and fine. What a good omen, he had thought then, trying hard to ignore the tear-stained faces of his family. He had felt a pang of fear and regret, suddenly realizing that he did not really know what he was getting himself into. But he was determined to keep up a brave front.\n\nEven now, he found himself having to maintain a stoical front. The war had none of the romance that he had thought it entailed. There was nothing even remotely resembling the beauty of camaraderie, the songs around the campfire, the triumph of the human spirit or even the glory of victory. It had only been an extended experience of brutality, fear, death and fatigue.\n\nNow, when the enemies pressed on to capture the town, many comrades were dropping like flies. He wondered why the signal had still not come. Taking the risk to peer out of his reinforced position, he looked for the captain who was to give the signal. A sharp intake of breath froze him. The sandbags that protected the captain's position had been blown to bits, with the torn body of the captain slumped all over. The fear that he had managed to dam now rushed forward unabated. What was he to do now? The signal was never going to come. He stared with irresolution at the detonator. Finally, he made a decision. Grinning for the first time since he stepped onto this battlefield, he put his hands on the lever. Suddenly, he felt the first heat of explosion from a grenade that had landed mere centimeters from him."

After all, Weng had actually had the audacity to report the gang's attempts to extort money from him to the teachers. Weng hugged his bag closer to him, trying to ride out the hours after school when the gang would congregate outside the school gates. He knew that escape would not be easy now.\nWeng had grown up with the gang's activities all around him. They were always extorting 'protection' money from the hawkers and terrorizing the neighborhood children into joining them. Gang clashes with other groups were also a common sight. Yet, his puny and unimpressive frame had always escaped the notice of the gang until this year when he became the only person holding out against the gang. Everyone else he knew had capitulated to the gang's bullying.\n\nWhen they had approached him for two dollars per week, Weng was determined not to give in. He did not believe that the school authorities were ineffective against the gang. With great courage, he told the teachers what was happening and they duly reported the matter to the police. But when the police came, none of the other students dared to come forward to corroborate Weng's story. Without their input, there was little the police could do. In the end, they stopped their investigations and the teachers merely told him that they would keep a lookout for his safety.\n\nWeng knew that this was their way of trying to gloss over their ineptitude. He was well aware that he had become the target of the gang now, and that each day they waited at the school gates for him to appear after school. Yet, each time he had been lucky for they got tired of waiting fruitlessly for him and left. But such luck would run out, Weng knew. He only hoped that when the time came, his legs would carry him to safety. Even then, he did not see himself as being that unfortunate.\n\nSuddenly, Weng felt a hand on him. He turned around to see the teacher looking at him suspiciously. She questioned him as to why he had not gone home, so Weng told her that he needed to avoid the gang. With a smile that carried doubts about his concerns, the teacher gently nudged him in the direction of the school gate. Left with no choice, Weng crept out of the school gate.\n\nHe did not manage to complete his tenth step when he felt a blow from a blunt object on his head. The vulgarities shouted out at him by the gang and their relentless raining of blows on him all merged to become one great experience of pain, as he slowly sank down onto the ground."

Years of counselling teenagers as a teacher had taught her to sense that Melissa had a problem.\n\n\"What's wrong, dear?\" she gently asked Melissa, who was slightly startled. With a furrowed face, Melissa answered, \"Nothing.\" However, her tone and body language betrayed her.\n\nSeeing that her granddaughter was unwilling to unburden herself to her, the grandmother left it as such but advised her that no burden was too hard to bear and to be borne alone.\n\nHowever, the girl's sad disposition did not escape the eyes of her friends, students and teachers. One day, the Tan family received a call from Mrs Devi, Melissa's form teacher. Mei Mei, Melissa's best friend, had informed Mrs Devi that she saw Melissa leaving a women's clinic.\n\nThe cat was out of the bag for Melissa. On close questioning from her father, Melissa was forced to reveal the truth. It seemed that she was two months pregnant. James was the father. Both teenagers had been in a quandary. They thought they could solve the problem by having a secret abortion without informing their parents.\n\nThe day when Melissa was spotted leaving the clinic was the day she went for a consultation. Upon receiving this shocking piece of news, the Tan family swung into action. James' parents were informed. The two families decided wisely that recriminations on the unfortunate pair over past sins would burden their already guilty conscience. The pressing need was what to do for the future.\n\nA meeting involving both families was held the next day. After the young lovers were strongly chided, they were forgiven by all family members. Attention was then on what was to be done in the best interests of the young couple's future.\n\nIn an atmosphere of goodwill and humanity, the Tan family, after the discussion, proposed the following:\n\n(1) There would be no abortion. Melissa was to leave school when her pregnancy became visible. She would return to school some time after she had delivered the baby if the school allowed her to do so. Otherwise, she would prepare for her `O' level examinations as a private candidate.\n\n(2) Melissa would marry James in a quiet ceremony after she left school.\n\n(3) The Tan family would bring up their daughter and her child until James reached adulthood and had completed his studies.\n\n(4) After she turned 21, Melissa and her husband would decide whether they wanted to stay in either family's household or live on their own. The Lee family readily agreed to the proposal. Everyone was relieved that the issues had been addressed and practical solutions had been found."

        "content": "Aminah was sad. This was not uncommon. She was sad every day. Her mother had run off with a man she met at her workplace last year. Her father was depressed. He seemed to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Many a night he would come back crying out, \"Why, why did she leave me?\" At times, when he spied her cowering in a corner, he would lay his hands on her. Soon, her body was covered with welts and bruises.\nAminah's school grades deteriorated. It was unfortunate that the teachers were only interested in her test results. They nagged at her about her work as her school was in the top 20 based on national school rankings. She felt that her teachers were not the ones whom she could confide in about her plans.\n\nOne day, her patience gave way and her will to see the miserable day through wavered. She decided there and then to leave home. \"Where?\" she wondered. She did not know. All she knew was that she had to get away from it all: a horrible father and school.\n\nPacking some necessary documents and a few precious personal belongings, she fled. She would leave her future to the gods.\n\nThe next few days passed in a blur. There was confusion, uncertainty and suffering. In her heart, she knew that running away would not solve her problems, but she had to do something. The first night saw her sleeping in the void deck of an unnamed block of flat near her home. Curiously enough, she did not feel hungry. Perhaps, she was keeping a wary eye on the strange surroundings. In addition, she was feeling too miserable herself. Fortunately, she passed the night undisturbed.\n\nThe second day, however, brought fully the realization of her decision to run away. After a skimpy breakfast as she had to stinge on her scant savings, she was still hungry. In the afternoon, she walked about aimlessly in shopping centers to pass the time. By nightfall, she had actually begun to long for the familiar surroundings of her home. However, passing the second night peacefully in the void deck she had spent the previous night was something to be thankful for.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Ahmad, Aminah's father, had realized her absence. After checking with teachers, friends and relatives, his initial anger subsided. It now turned to panic and then to remorse and worry. She was after all his own flesh and blood. She was merely an innocent victim of his hatred towards her mother. The police and media were alerted. The once depressed and inebriated man had become fully aware of his past and present actions.\n\nOn the fourth day of her running away and after a sleepless night, he awoke to a heavy knocking on his door and excited shouts from his neighbor,\n\nAli. \"Wake up! Wake up! Ahmad! Your daughter has been found.\" With trembling hands and a pounding heart, he reached out for the newspaper his friend had thrust out to him. The title of the article read:\n\"Missing girl found after narrowly escaping would-be rapists.\" The article related that Aminah had spent her third night washing up in a toilet near Ikan Bus Station. There, she had befriended some illegal workers who had invited her to their shack. However, just past midnight, they made an attempt to capture her. One man held her while the other attempted to rape her. Fortunately, her screams unsettled them. In a moment of inattention from them, she escaped their clutches and fled from the shack. A chase ensued around Ikan Bus Station.\n\nFortunately, her cries for help were heard by a group of passers-by. They gave chase. Her pursuers fled but were apprehended later by the passers-by and police. Aminah was then held in police custody.\n\nMr Ahmad rushed to the police station where his daughter was held. There and then, he understood why the police had not attempted to contact him. His daughter had told the police her sad story of his abuse. What followed was a very touching scene. Both father and daughter were allowed a meeting before the latter was taken away. In that meeting, Mr Ahmad knelt before his daughter and asked for her forgiveness. She shed tears uncontrollably and nodded."

        "content": "Ahmad was a weakling. He was all skin and bones. To add to his woes, he had a severe acne problem on his face. It was no surprise that he was not a hit with the girls in class. Added to his problems was  the fact that he stuttered when he was shy or nervous.\nThere was one advantage Ahmad had however. He had a beautiful voice. It was a clear, high and steady tenor. However, none of his friends knew about it as he practiced singing only in the bathroom. Once, he was caught unawares singing in the corridor by his classmates. The moment he saw them, he denied that the beautiful song they had heard was sung by him. They were convinced when his voice went to a characteristic stutter. \"I ...I...real-lly did-didn't s-sing.... \"\n\nOne day, the class of Secondary 4B, which Ahmad was in, heard about a singing competition that was to be held in the nearby community centre. A prize would be awarded for the best student singer. It was a well-known yearly competition and many students support All, their classmate. He had a nice baritone voice and good showmanship. So it was really a surprise for the students to see Ahmad's name besides Ali's on the notice board, which announced the auditions on 15 May.\n\n\"You can sing, Ahmad? Get real! Don't make me laugh !\" was the essence of the unkind remarks directed at him when they saw Ahmad before he entered the audition room. Ahmad felt awkward and sad. It was enough that they did not support him but ridiculing him was too much.\n\nWhen the results were announced, class 4B could not believe their ears. Ali had of course qualified but so did Ahmad for the finals. How on earth did the stutterer do it, they wondered.\n\nA few of All's friends accosted Ahmad in the toilet. They forced him to sing a favorite song. Of course, under such disbelieving eyes and prejudice from his classmates, poor Ahmad could not sing. He could only stutter!\"I will show them like I did at the audition,\" Ahmad vowed to himself. In the week before the finals, he was fortunate to have the services of his father's friend, a former singing instructor who polished up his delivery and improved on his showmanship.\n\nThe finals of the singing competition finally arrived. Ali's supporters were out in full force. Mr Mok, the principal, and some teachers caused quite a stir among the students when they turned up to support the two finalists from their school.\n\nAli sang to the crowd's delight. It looked like he was the clear favorite. His resonant and modulated voice, together with his good showmanship, endeared him to the audience.\n\nAhmad was next. There was a hushed silence before he began. The claps were few, coming from the principal, teachers and his only friend. Some subdued boos came from a few disbelieving schoolmates of his who felt that he was not fit to be a finalist. Quite a number of the audience had heard of his stuttering defect and came to see for themselves whether the judges had made a wrong decision to admit Ahmad in the finals.\n\nWhen Ahmad mounted the stairs to get on the stage, he was determined to prove them wrong. Mr Chan, his singing instructor, had told him to focus on himself and the song. To the encouraging smile of his instructor, he sang his heart out. His song was 'Climb Every Mountain'. He adapted his tone and expression to the lyrics, and his voice hit the right notes and pitch. His delivery was clear and his voice never wavered. \"Where was the stutter?\" his detractors wondered. But what amazed everyone, including the principal and teachers, was Ahmad's delivery and showmanship. He executed the song well and his movements were appropriate and well coordinated.\n\nWhen he finished singing, there were very few dry eyes. Then there was tense anticipation from the audience as the judges decided on the winner. In spite of Ahmad's outstanding performance, almost everyone felt that All would be the winner. They were wrong. When Mr Tan, the chief judge announced Ahmad as the winner by a narrow margin, the audience sat in stunned silence. Suddenly, everyone cheered and rose to give him a standing ovation. The winner had finally dared to 'climb his own mountain' and in the end tasted the sweet spoils of victory."

        "content": "Mr and Mrs Othello were elated. They just received news that they had inherited a house in the Delli Culta district, one of the prime locations in Lahore. Less welcome was the news that Mr Othello's father had died and they had to conduct the proper funeral rites for him. In addition, they had to handle all the details concerning his demise before they could inherit the house. This was revealed by the lawyer in charge of the late Mr Othello's will. An observer would not be wrong in surmising that the son was not close to his father.\nThe young Othello was the only son of the late Othello. He had a fierce row with his father when he wanted to marry his present wife, Dean, a pretty Australian and settle down with her in her homeland. The result was that his father had withdrawn all financial support and severed all ties with him. It was therefore a surprise for Alvin, the younger Othello, when he received news of the surprise windfall. \"The old man must have forgiven me,\" he thought to himself gleefully. Because he was not doing well in Australia, this was an opportune time to settle in Lahore.\n\nAlvin dealt with all the necessary work to do with his father's death. Filial-wise, he appeared the dutiful son, shedding crocodile tears. A week after the funeral, the title deeds and keys to his father's house were handed over to him. With two young children in tow, the Othellos moved their scanty belongings from their hotel room to No. 11, Genggi Heights on a Sunday morning. On entering the driveway of the house, however, they started having serious misgivings. It looked rather seedy, neglected and ghost-like. The elder Othello had lived in rented quarters since the row with his son.\n\nAlvin cautiously approached the entrance. The set of keys was in the envelope but to his horror, he saw a bunch of keys. \"Which one was the key to the front door?\" he thought annoyingly. The next half an hour saw an increasingly irritable and frustrating time for the couple. Key after key was tried but none could fit the front door. Meanwhile, the kids were running wild in the garden. An angry Alvin decided to call Mr Lawrence, the lawyer. Finally, he managed to locate him. Mr Lawrence did not believe that the keys could not fit. He asked Alvin to try again.\n\nAlvin did try again but in vain. When Mr Lawrence received a phone call from Alvin again, it was to listen to an angry tirade of shouts and curses. \"Calm down, Alvin,\" Mr Lawrence said. \"I'll come by with an expert locksmith.\"\n\nWhen Mr Lawrence arrived with John, the locksmith, the latter got down to work. After examining the lock mechanism and the keyhole on the door, John said that the keys given would not fit. After another few minutes of examination, John said that the lock required a special brand of keys. This key was out of stock. Even if he could locate the brand of keys, it would take half a day to file them exactly to fit into the lock mechanism. The impatient Othellos conferred briefly and decided to break down the door. Then, an embarrassed Alvin approached Mr Lawrence. \"Could you pay for the services of breaking down the door first, Mr Lawrence?\" he asked. Mr Lawrence saw that Alvin was down in his finances. Even if he refused this irresponsible couple, the whining, hungry children had to be pitied.\n\n\"Let's go back to town to summon some help and to have lunch,\" he kindly suggested. After lunch was over, the party returned to 11, Genggi Heights with some laborers who promptly hacked down the front door. However, when the doors were down, the Othellos were in for a big shock. Big, strong, sturdy metal bars barred the entrance. It looked like the elder Othello was out to play a nasty joke on his son.\n\nThe Othellos spent a miserable night at a budget hotel. In the morning, they returned with laborers to prise open and get rid of the bars. However, a more nasty sight greeted the couple. Alvin spied a musty note below the entrance. It read 'Welcome to your new home. May my spirit haunt this place. This is my revenge for your unfilial conduct. Your departed father.'\n\nWith sinking hearts, dismay and anger, the Othellos looked around. What they saw further dismayed them. The walls were blackened, as if from a fire. There were cobwebs, insects and vermin everywhere. Alvin realized with a sinking heart that it would take a fortune for him to restore the place. Even then, it would be difficult to sell it. \"The old man really had the last word,\" he thought grimly."

She had been busking in an underpass for a year. This passage led from Jackson's office building to the nearby rail transit station. Daily, Jackson would see her singing in her sweet, angelic voice when he wearily headed for home at 7 p.m.\n\nTheir characters could not be more contrasting. Jackson was sociable, talkative and blunt in his speech. Mariah, however, was the retiring type. One day, Jackson, unable to contain himself, uttered when he saw Mariah, \"Why are you cheapening your talents in public by busking?\"\n\nTimidly, Mariah replied, \"I have a handicapped mother and myself to support. This is all I can do to make a living. Besides, I'm grateful for this work as I have been unemployed for a long time.\" For once, Jackson was speechless. Then, he felt pity and compassion.\n\nFrom then on, Jackson tried to ease her burden. Other than donating some money to her daily, he would also wait for her in the morning to set up her 'stage' and equipment. He would then pack up for her in the evening.\n\nMariah appreciated Jackson's help. She had always been popular with the pedestrians as she had a sweet and patient nature. Moreover, she was a good singer. Her gentleness was like a balm to Jackson's disillusioned nature. She encouraged and calmed him as he poured out his woes and regrets over his past mistakes.\n\nTheir relationship blossomed. Jackson found himself spending all his spare time promoting Mariah in the subway. She was having an increasing following. Word had it that there was a very good blind singer in Timmin South subway.\n\nOne day, a talent scout heard Mariah singing. He spoke to Jackson about her potential.

        "content": "Mr Tai, the teacher in charge of athletics at SUKK Temarah, was getting on in years. He had just celebrated his 58th birthday -- an age which many would think seriously of retiring. However, it was not so with Mr Tai. He had an illustrious record of athletic achievements in the school sports scene. Some of the students he had coached had become national runners or even coaches themselves. The School Board concurred with his sentiments of not retiring as they did not want to lose the services of someone who had successfully led the school athletics team to reach the finals of the National Athletics Competition.\nIn the year before, however, the school team did not garner as many medals in the National Athletics Championship as expected. To make up for this disappointment, Mr Tai was determined to have his runners bring as much glory as they could in this year's National Athletics Championship. His hopes were fired with enthusiasm this year by two promising star athletics, Farid and Hassan, who happened to be twins.\n\nIn the Annual School Sports, Farid broke the school's twenty-year record for the 100 meters event. His brother, Hassan, was just a fraction of a second behind. Since Hassan had a recurring ankle injury, Mr Tai decided to submit only Farid's name to the finals of the National Athletics Championship. On the day he submitted the results of the best runner in the school, he mistakenly wrote Hassan' name instead.\n\nWhen Mr Tai received the list of the finalists in the 100-metre event in the National Athletics Championships, he realized his mistake. However, it was too late to inform the sports secretariat. Pride also did not allow him to admit his mistake to Farid. He decided to inform his brother, Hassan, and start grooming him in the final preparations for this prestigious event.\n\nWhen Farid learnt that he was not a finalist, he could not believe his ears. Even though he was glad that his brother had qualified, he was bitterly disappointed. To make matters worse, Mr Tai did not give him any reasons for his exclusion in the finals. It was a bitter pill to swallow for Farid as he realized that his hopes for athletic glory were dashed.\n\nHis moroseness was further compounded when he heard that his fellow athletes had believed a rumor that he had been dropped from the list because of discipline problems. Depressed, he lost interest in his athletic practices and withdrew from his friends. His studies also suffered as his listlessness affected his academic performance.\n\nOne day, his best friend, Wen Yi, pulled him aside to have a talk. Hassan poured out his grievances and sadness to Wen Yi who then encouraged him to arrange a meeting with Mr Tai. However, Mr Tai tried to avoid meeting Hassan. The teacher did not want to admit his mistake. When Hassan finally managed to confront Mr Tai, the latter consoled Hassan superficially and tried to make him accept that his brother was the better choice.\n\nFarid did not do well in the National Finals. His old ankle injury cropped up at the last minute and he came in last. The school's athletics performance was at its worst that year. Mr Tai was not appointed the athletics coach the following year.\n\nAs for Farid, he withdrew from pursuing a promising athletics career. He did well enough to qualify for college and joined the Cadets. However prestigious his heart remained with running and throughout his life, he was embittered for he knew that Mr Tai had made a mistake and did not stand up to him."

        "content": "John and Jack were identical twins. When they were born, they were so like each other that even their mother could not tell them apart.\nWhen they grew up, they were therefore the butt of everyone's jokes. People wondered whether they thought alike, or went to the bathroom at the same time. The brothers were sometimes perturbed and irritated by these jokes but overall, they took it in their stride.\n\nBeyond the physical side, however, the resemblance ended. As they grew older, both began to differ more in character. Jack was always the extrovert one. He liked sports and was known as a ladies' man.\n\nOn one fine day, Jack approached John for a favor. He had been in a relationship with a pretty college belle, Jessica, for some time. However, now, he wanted out of the relationship but despite the ample hints, Jessica did not seem to understand what he had been driving at. Jack asked John to stand in for him whenever Jessica wanted to go out with him. Jack and John were studying in different private colleges, so Jessica was not aware of a twin brother.\n\nThe first meeting between John and Jessica was a success. Jessica was pleasantly surprised with John's attentiveness. She felt that Jack behaved like a gentleman on that date. Of course, she was puzzled at some point; he had coffee instead of tea and he was not swearing like he usually did. John found Jessica interesting. He was attracted to her beauty, intelligence and honesty.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack was getting enamored with another popular college girl, Merry. Merry, however, hinted to Jack that she would welcome his attention only if he gave up his relationship with Jessica. Although John was the one going on dates with Jessica, Jack still had to hang out with Jessica on campus.\n\nJack asked John to end his relationship with Jessica. However, a shocked Jessica could not believe that Jack wanted to end the relationship. She also refused to believe that it was John who had been going out with her.\n\nJack now knew that things were going too far now. He scheduled a meeting with his twin brother to try to reason with Jessica. Jessica brought along her brother, Thomas. At the meeting, Jack apologized for misleading Jessica. Jessica, however, refused to believe that John had been posing as Jack, even though the twin brothers stood before her. She had fallen in love with Jack and she believed that he was the one who was courting her all the while. Even though John gave her certain details of their dates which would conclusively prove that he was with her, she refused to listen and practically shut her ears.\n\n\"I have been dating Jack and it is Jack I want to marry. If he is trying to get out now because he wants to go out with Merry, I will pursue him to his death,\" she asserted angrily.\n\nThomas then dropped the bombshell to the shocked twins. Jessica was pregnant. She believed she was carrying Jack's child as he had been intimate with her. If Jack persisted in denying his responsibility, the matter would be handled by their parents and the school authorities.\n\nJack pleaded and argued with Jessica and Thomas but to no avail. Jessica insisted that Jack bore the responsibility for her pregnancy. She wanted to be married as soon as possible.\n\nDesperate, Jack turned to his brother, John, for help. John tried to persuade Jessica to change her mind. He argued that even if they were to be married to each other, Jack was no longer in love with her. It would be meaningless. John also reminded Jessica how they got along so well together. Jessica, however, refused to listen. It was Jack all along, she insisted vehemently, who had been dating her.\n\nBy now, Thomas was feeling rather annoyed. He argued that Jack had to bear the responsibility as the baby was his - Jack was the one she had been intimate with. Moreover, everyone had thought that Jessica and Jack were a couple. He also stated that his parents were old and could not take the blow if Jack did not marry her. As for Jack getting John to pose as him, he was uncertain about the truth. All he was certain was that Jack must face up to the fact that he was responsible for. When Jack protested again, Thomas silenced him with these angry words, \"A man must be responsible for his actions. You do not have a choice.\"\n\nThe impact of these words sank into Jack. He was stricken with guilt. A week later, he finally apologized and asked for Jessica's forgiveness. Then he held his future wife's hands as they went to their respective parents to explain the situation to them. He was determined to make things right, for Jessica, for their child."

        "content": "It was the eve of National Day in Singapore. My family decided to break the usual routine of watching the national celebrations in Singapore but to visit Batam on National Day. Batam is an island a mere half hour ferry ride from Singapore. On that day, we woke up, all fresh and keyed up to enjoy ourselves.\nHowever, we got off to a disappointing start. No taxis could be hailed within sight and the few taxi drivers who pulled over were not too keen to bring us to Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal. They explained that the terminal was a distance accessible by a deserted side road. The authorities did not allow them to impose an extra charge, unlike the allowance at the airport. Moreover, it might be ages before they could pick up a passenger for the return journey. Unbelievably, we were rather sympathetic. After a long wait, a taxi driver finally agreed to take us.\n\nUpon reaching the terminal, we rushed in, all flustered and worried about missing the ferry. We were relieved to find out that the departure time had been delayed. However, our relief was short-lived. There was a long frustrating queue as the immigration staff could not cope with the unexpected crowd.\n\nThere was a mad scramble for seats when we finally boarded our vessel. The mild weather had changed and the day became unbearably hot. It was stuffy in the ferry. Many were seasick and vomited. The queue outside the toilets was a sad and disheartening sight.\n\nUpon arrival, we waited for our coach. However, once on board the coach, another disappointment awaited us. Groans from the passengers greeted the guide's announcement that the watersports centre we were scheduled to visit was burned down the day before. We would visit a Go-Kart centre instead. This place was in the middle of nowhere and we spent a mindless two hours watching the kids queuing and then squealing in delight at the limited turns they get.\n\nMy family and I were not Go-kart enthusiasts, so Dad offered to pay for any souvenirs we wanted. But these were outrageously priced at the shops we visited.\n\nLunch was the only bright spot in the journey. The seafood dishes were varied and delicious. We tried sucking edible snail meat from the famous 'kong kong' snails. It was a nice change. We finally relaxed amid the breezy and tranquil seaside surroundings.\n\nBatam city was dirty and rather squalid. It had just rained and there were mud puddles everywhere. We had to walk through the mud just to get to the few shopping centers. They invariably sold the same souvenirs. The unenthusiastic, bored salesgirls and beggars outside these tourist spots made us realize how comfortable an experience shopping in Singapore was!\n\nWe had not dared to try eating the many interesting roadside snacks or colorful syrupy drinks sold by vendors because of the constant presence of flies. Fear of dengue fever also reduced us to paranoid tourists slapping at mosquitoes.\n\nOur tour guide blithely ignored our requests to visit a popular shopping centre. We learnt later that the place would not pay him a commission for bringing us there. Instead, the brazen man kept pushing us to buy his homemade cookies.\n\nThankfully, there was no wait for ferries on the journey back. We arrived safely but realized to our dismay that we were at the Harbour Front Centre, a considerable distance from our home.\n\nThere were no taxis in sight. It seemed that the roads leading to Harbour Front Centre were closed due to the National Day Parade. We whiled away our time at a coffee shop and waited restlessly for the roads to be opened.\n\nHowever, it was a relief to be back in dear old Singapore! Never again, I vowed, would I celebrate a public holiday Day abroad!"

        "content": "It was one of those sunny mornings when merely breathing seemed to be an event worth celebrating. I was in a particularly good mood as my mother had just given me RM400 for my daily expenses during the week that she would be away with my father in China to visit her ailing grandaunt. I was in seventh heaven just contemplating the things I could do with the RM400. If I survived on bread and butter the whole week, I would have a little windfall of RM300 to buy the latest computer games! It was certainly a great way to begin the day.\nThe physical education lesson was, as usual, a gruelling session of endless running and weight training. I could hardly catch my breath as I trudged back wearily to the classroom. As I neared the classroom, I heard a loud commotion coming from it and quickly rushed in. My classmates were gathered around Tommy's table as the latter ransacked through books, stationery as well as some personal effects in obvious distress. Tommy had always been a popular boy in class. Not only was he bright and well-mannered, he also came from a wealthy family that provided him with all he could ask for. Yet, he chose to share everything he had with us, never minding the fact that he always provided while we received.\n\nAs such, I rushed immediately to his side when I saw his anxiety. My classmates quickly told me that Tommy had lost the money that he had brought as a donation to the welfare home that we were supposed to visit that afternoon. Understanding the situation, I proposed that we organise a search around the classroom and inform the class teacher as soon as possible. Taking my suggestions seriously, the class  immediately took action. In no time at all, Miss Soh rushed to the classroom to take control of the situation. She decided to run a search through everyone's bag. We quickly stood by our tables and emptied the contents of our bags onto the table. When it came to my turn, I diligently took out all my possessions for inspection. My wallet was the last item to be checked and as Miss Soh took out the RM400 from it, the class fell into a hushed shock.\n\nUp till then, I had no idea that the amount lost was exactly RM400. Had I not been aware of my own innocence, even I would have agreed that the evidence was incriminating enough to indict me. Everyone stared at me in horror. Miss Soh was triumphant - pleased that her efforts at flushing out the thief had borne fruit. In a loud and harsh voice, she demanded to know where the money had come from. I told her the truth, which obviously fell on deaf ears. She appeared not to have heard anything that I had said, choosing instead to dwell on the 'facts' of the matter. She proclaimed loudly that I had been caught red-handed, dismissing my story as ludicrous in view of the fact that my family was not well-off and could not possibly afford to give me RM400. She also went on to elaborate on the evils of envy, implying that I had stolen from Tommy because I was envious of him. All this while, I was struck dumb by her convincing words, amazed at the conjectures that she had come up with based on the RM400 found in my wallet. The situation was worsened by the unfortunate fact that my parents could not come forward to corroborate my story.\n\nBy this time, the whole class was shaking their heads mournfully at me, obviously in full accord with the teacher's allegations. I was appalled and terrified. I could feel the jaws of misguided justice closing around my neck and struggled against it. I kept protesting my innocence, trying to drown out their accusations with the sheer volume of my voice. But it was to no avail.\n\nThe principal was called in to handle the situation. He promptly decided that the evidence against me was damning enough to warrant an immediate suspension or expulsion once my parents returned from their trip. I was devastated. How could they decide on my guilt without even checking out my story? Even a phone call to my parents was considered too much trouble for the school. Instead, they chose to concentrate on consoling Tommy and placating his parents. I knew then that my average background was the reason why my words carried less weight than Tommy's distress. It was a sobering experience, educating me in the realities of life.\n\nThe entire week was spent in a state of confusion. I kept to myself a lot, choosing not to leave the house at all. I lost a great deal of weight, since I was subsisting only on bread and butter. The RM400 had been confiscated by the school as 'evidence', leaving me only the loose change around the house to buy things with. Humiliation and anger were my constant companions during that week. None of my classmates telephoned me, not even those who were my buddies. Obviously, the stink of being a thief was more potent than that of friendship.\n\nMy parents finally returned. They rushed down to clarify matters once they realised what had happened. The school authorities, instead of feeling apologetic, chose instead to place the blame squarely on what they called my \"inability to put across clearly the situation\". My parents were infuriated. They wrote a long complaint against the school and transferred me to a different school. The matter was finally resolved when the principal and Miss Soh were chastised for their mishandling of the situation and I was officially cleared of all charges. But to this day, it still hurts to know that to certain people, wealth spoke louder than truth."

        "content": "I had always prided myself on my sharp tongue and witty retorts whether in class debates or casual arguments. Thus, when I was selected to represent the school in the national debate series, I was naturally supremely confident of my readiness for the task. Little did I know that this would turn out to be one of the most important lessons in my life.\nThe run-up to the finals was a breeze for my team. We were all good speakers who had the benefit of an experienced teacher who trained us well. But in the team, I was undoubtedly the most outstanding speaker. In each of the rounds that I debated in, the judges had unanimously selected me as the best speaker. This meant that my confidence was at an all-time high by the time we found ourselves with one week to train before the finals. I had no reason to even think that I would not be voted the overall best speaker for the debate series.\n\nUnfortunately, this meant that I began to get arrogant about the whole business and started putting on airs with my team-mates. I would scoff at what I saw as their pathetic rebuttals and poor debating style. I saw myself as the natural debater who would be let down by their bad performance. As the finals drew near, I became more and more dissatisfied with my team. I began missing practices, much to the panic of my team-mates and the frustration of my teacher. They had no choice but to rely on me to pull through on the day of the finals. Much as they would love to remove me from the team, they could not as there was no replacement good enough.\n\nThe day of the finals dawned bright and fine. I practically skipped to the venue of the debate finals, feeling the exhilaration of being able to finally show off my debating prowess. But the reality was not something that I had ever imagined. My absence from the practices had created a rift between my teammates and I. We could not seem to work seamlessly like we did in the previous rounds. Instead, our coordination was so bad that even our school supporters were shamed into silence. When it was my turn to conclude as the last speaker of the team, an expectant hush fell over the hall. Everyone knew that I was touted the one most likely to win the coveted overall best speaker for the series.\n\nAs I launched into my speech, I knew that things were very wrong. I was hesitant in my elucidation of the issue, realising too late that what I was saying sounded incoherent as it did not follow logically from my other team speakers' points. The puzzled looks on the faces of the judges almost drove me to tears. I had to struggle on with my speech, trying to hold back the hot tears that threatened to overflow I saw immediately the stupidity and arrogant oaf that I had been. I realised too late that I could have been a really good speaker if only I had not been overconfident. As I sat down after speaking my piece, tears broke their banks and scalded my cheeks. I knew that we had lost the title. Never before had I ever felt so alone, or so rightly so.\n\nSuddenly, a reassuring hand clasped mine. I looked up into the kindly face of my team-mate, the one whom I had earlier condemned as a moron to her face. She gestured that it was all right and that I should not feel bad. That made me feel even worse. I felt like a scum that the tears now came unabashed. The other two team-mates of mine came over and hugged me. Together, they hoped to stem my feelings of regret and pain even though I had rightfully deserved everything and more. In fact, I had cost them the title. I kept sobbing the word \"sorry\" to them, feeling even worse now that they had repaid my irresponsibility and haughtiness with their kind words and comforting gestures. Even my teacher came over to give me a tight squeeze on the shoulder to say that all was forgiven. When we were called to receive the prize for the first runner-up position, we went up together as a team and bravely lifted the trophy to salute the cheers of our supporters. I finally realised what it was like to be a team.\n\nTill today, I will never forget the trauma of defeat fashioned by my own hands or the sheer joy of knowing that I had support in my lowest moment. I went on to the next debate series and eventually clinched the title with the same team in the following year. I had learnt that no man is an island by himself."

        "content": "When I was young, I lived in a small village in Melaka. Mine was a terrace\nhouse in a row of shophouses. The spirit of neighbourliness was very strong\nthen. There was no such thing as locking the doors of our houses by day or\nnight.\nThe village had a variety of trades to serve the needs of the villagers. There\nwas a barber, tailor, coffee shop owner, grocer, baker, electrician, plumber and\nso on. All of us were quite poor by today's standards but we got by. However,\none family which could be considered as living a marginal existence was the\nLim family living in the bicycle shop opposite our dwelling.\n\nMr Lim, the bicycle mechanic, had a large brood of children - twelve to\nbe exact. The joke amongst the neighbours was that he was aiming to form a football team among his children. However, seriously speaking, it was no joke\nfor him trying to feed his growing children daily.\n\nMy mother was a kind-hearted soul. Often, she would remark that his\nchildren were dressed in ragged clothes and looked malnourished. My family\nwas relatively better off in the village and my father was the headman. My\nmother would bring over whatever food we could spare to our neighbours. On\noccasions when there was leftover food from village weddings or festivals, my\nfather would direct me to bring these to Mr Lim. I did not mind visiting the\nLim's bicycle shop as I had an interest in bicycles.\n\nI remember one particular year when times were very hard. The economy\nwas doing very badly. Even my family had to make do with two meals a day.\nLunch was dispensed with. We stopped the practice of giving food to Mr\nLim. One day, I noticed my mother looking troubled. She had learned that\nthe Lim family had not been eating for the past two days. There and then, she\ndecided to sacrifice a portion of our meals to the family. Despite the protests\nfrom my brothers and sisters that we too were hungry, she kept on doing the\nkind act of giving them a portion of our food from then on. Fortunately, the\nlean spell did not last long, and the children in our family resumed our three\nmeals a day again.\n\nI shared a room with my brothers overlooking the bicycle shop. I was\ninterested in the repair of bicycles and would often stare out of the window\nto see Mr Lim hard at work. As time went on, I noticed Mr Lim looking more\ncheerful. The number of customers at his shop had increased steadily. Soon, he\nwas selling many shiny new bicycles.\n\nThe eldest son of Mr Lim was the head prefect of our primary school. He\noften helped his father in his work. This boy, Tian Beng, was very good with his\nhands. He proved very popular with his customers. It was he who expanded\nhis father's business after he dropped out of school when his father needed his\nhelp in their growing bicycle business. Tian Beng started a motorcycle repairing\nservice to add on to his father's trade. Business at his shop took off like a rocket\nas Japanese bikes were the rage then as they were very useful and popular for\ntransport.\n\nIt was at this time that my father's business took a turn for the worse. My\nfather was a provision shop owner and he trusted many people readily. One day,\nhis senior assistant ran off with a substantial amount of the shop's earnings.\nDuring that time, my father's health was also deteriorating. We were at our wits'\nend, perplexed by the mysterious illness he was suffering from. My father then\nsold our family car to pay off the mounting bills.\n\nThey say that one good deed deserves another. Mr Lim, our neighbour,\ncame to learn of our plight. In spite of my father's protests, he stepped in to\nhelp. He stated simply that it was his turn to repay the kindness that my father\nhad shown to him in the past.\n\nThrough his connections, Mr Lim arranged for my father to consult a\nfamous Chinese physician in Chinatown. Not only was this doctor's diagnosis\nof my father's medical condition accurate, he was able to cure my father. My\nfather's health steadily improved. However, because of my father's lack of\nattention to his provision shop, business floundered.\n \n\n \n\nAgain Mr Lim became our good Samaritan. He arranged for a loan for\nmy father's business. When he also learned that my brother and I had stopped\nschooling because we could not afford the fees, he would have none of this.\nHe told us that we should not give up our education as we were among the top\npupils in the school. He then arranged to finance our education as long as we\nneeded it.\n\nSuffice it to say that my father's business recovered the next year. My father\nis now the proud owner of the village mini-market. Mr Lim has expanded his\nbusiness too. He now has a car showroom in town. Whenever my parents\nmeet up with Mr Lim, they would thank him for his past help. He would just\nshrug off their thanks and say simply that he was merely repaying a kindness."

        "content": "My name is Theresa. I am a Eurasian girl. My mother has the blood of different races -- Scottish, Indian and Chinese -- in her veins. My father is a Japanese soldier. I am the offspring of a secret liaison between my mother and father during the Japanese Occupation of Malaysia. After the war, my mother remarried. My foster father accepts me and in all respects, loves me as his own child. My mother has no children from her second marriage.\nBesides my beloved parents, I have a childhood friend, Jeanette. We have known each other since our kampung days and been next-door neighbors for twenty years. Throughout the years spent in primary and secondary schools, we played, laughed, cried and studied together. Jeanette, however, moved away from my neighborhood when she was in her college. I had little contact with her. The one phone call she made to me last year surprised me. She was abrupt and cold. All she said was, \"Do not reveal anything about me to your friends.\" Then she hung up, leaving me hurt and wondering.\n\nOne day, on my way back from school, I found her on the doorstep of my house. She did not bother to greet me. Instead, she glared at me. \"Is it true that you are dating Jim?\" she asked accusingly. I was surprised and baffled at her tone. Who was she to appear out of the blue and confront me like that? Jim was a popular and likeable guy in my college. We were fond of each other. That was all. I was surprised when I replied to Jeanette in this manner, \"We are not dating. And anyway, if we are, it's none of your business.\" I was really riled up at her bad manners, especially so when we were close friends before. Jeanette then shot me a look of hate that I would never forget. \"Watch out for your secret, you little hotshot and lay off my guy.\" She then left abruptly. I was in a whirl of feelings and thoughts. I was angry at her outburst. However, I was afraid of her threat. I did not fear giving up Jim as a steady as I just regarded him a very good friend. She was welcome to make him her steady.\n\nI was more fearful and worried about her threat of revealing my secret. In a moment of trust in my confidant in my childhood days, I had told her that I was the illegal offspring of an affair between my parents.\n\nI was not ashamed of my father who was an officer in the Japanese Army. My mother had always been of the opinion that he was either suddenly sent out of Malaysia or that he had died in the war. However, she had always cautioned me not to reveal her secret affair as other children would mock at me. I went back to college the next day and met Jim in the passageway. He was furious at me. His outburst really hurt me. In a nutshell, Jeanette had told him that I had called him a gigolo. Jeanette also revealed to him that I was a \"bastard\". Jim then hurt me further by informing me that Jeanette and him were an item and that he was ending our friendship.\n\nI retreated to the toilet and cried my heart out. I really regretted telling Jeanette my secret. However, I knew I was being made a scapegoat for my mother's past indiscretions by the vindictive Jeanette, who was now a far cry from the sweet young friend of my childhood days.\n\nIn the next few days, I heard whispers behind my back and cold, hard glances at me from some college mates. I knew that Jim was popular but I did not know that he was that popular. He had influenced many of my friends against me. Jeanette had made use of him to spread my secret to my classmates.\n\nOne day, a few of my close friends who had noticed my downcast mood, approached me. It was there and then that I cried my heart out. They consoled me and left. The next thing I knew was that they had come back to me with Mr Hans, our beloved Vice-Principal, in tow. Mr Hans assured me that he would solve the matter.\n\nIn the afternoon, during his usual pep talk at the assembly, Mr Hans related a story of trust and friendship, betrayal and integrity. Everyone who knew me, knew who the real characters were and that his story was a rebuke to the students who had unjustly treated me. In the end, Mr Hans' moral was that good would triumph over evil and he told us to ignore malicious talk. There was a hushed atmosphere in the hall after his talk.\n\nI was feeling embarrassed and uneasy after this. \"Would Jim and his friends retaliate?\" I wondered. However, upon entering the classroom, I heard spontaneous clapping from my classmates. My eyes were drawn to the board. On it was written, \"She's a jolly good fellow and we respect her parents.\"\n\nThis time I cried again, but they were tears of relief. I regretted telling Jeanette my secret, but I am no longer affected by my parents' past. In fact, my mum and foster father hired an investigator when we went on a holiday to Japan later that year. We learned that Dad was a decorated war hero who had died in Japan."

        "content": "Joseph was my best friend. He was the only son of Adam Tan, a well-known former athlete and a member of the first Malaysia team to reach the South Pole in an expedition. Hence, many expected and assumed Joseph to be as sporting as his father. Nothing could be further from the truth.\nSince he was young, he has been a weakling. He suffered from asthma and preferred to stay indoors. He preferred to read books and was nicknamed \"Professor\" unkindly in class. He did not seem to mind these remarks until one day. That particular day marked the first death anniversary of his father who died tragically in an expedition in the Mautu wilderness in Africa. He had been gored by a wild bull on the last mile of his expedition.\n\nSo on this anniversary of his father's death, he was stung by the jibes of Bala and Azhar, his classmates. They had called him `weakling', remarking that he was a disgrace to his father. He lost his cool and fought with the bullies. Of course, he lost. From that day onwards, Joseph devoted himself to building up his body. He exercised religiously and turned his attention and efforts enthusiastically to sports. No one, he vowed, would bully or compare him unfavorably to his father.\n\nJoseph joined the scouts troop in my school and became its leader. We were all agog with excitement when we learned that the school had planned an expedition in Kalimantan, Indonesia. It was also meant to be in memory of Joseph's father, who was its former adviser.\n\nThe expedition really tested the mettle and skills of my fellow scouts and me. Though we had the help of our two teacher advisers, we were determined to succeed in the expedition which was to cross a mountain, river and forest. The last stage was the forest and we were within sight of our target. We had only four more kilometers to cover before we would emerge from the forest and successfully complete our expedition in the required time. If we succeeded, we would be the first school team to have done that in record time.\n\nHowever, on December 27th, Joseph experienced a recurrence of his asthma. We noticed at first that he was faltering behind us. When we asked him whether he had any problem, he gave us the thumbs up sign. Just before the last kilometer, his team-mate, Shafiq, noticed his labored breathing. His face was pale and Shafiq signaled us to stop walking. We gathered around Joseph anxiously and forced him to stop and rest. Then we noticed his trembling hands. This was serious trouble indeed. When we asked him about his medication, Joseph said that he had lost his pills somewhere during the expedition. Behind us was 20 kilometers of wilderness which we had covered. We had left our teachers two kilometers behind us as it was agreed that we would attempt the last stage ourselves. We could not go back; it was a  matter of pride. Furthermore, it was too difficult. Ahead, lay civilization in the form of the nearest village. We had to cover the last stage ourselves.\n\nWhile we were deliberating on our best course of action, Joseph had all the while, been pleading with us to carry on. \"Help me finish the expedition for the sake of my father. This expedition is in memory of him and he did not complete the final stage of his last expedition\" was in essence what he was blurting out faintly.\n\nJoseph was therefore carried piggyback by four of us alternating in turns, on this last lap. How we made it and burst through the jungle into the clearing we did not know. It seemed an eternity but according to our teachers who timed us, we had taken half an hour.\n\nHalf an hour! We went through hell at that time. Enduring pesky mosquitoes and squelchy mud were only minor difficulties. Carrying Joseph was a very heavy load but we did not mind the physical part of the burden. What worried us was not finishing the expedition in record time but that Joseph would die before he received medical help.\n\nWe struggled. By Herculean strength of spirit and body, we labored the last meters. We reached the village, but the welcome team did not get to complete their cheery support. They cut short their cheering when they saw us carrying Joseph. He was later rushed by helicopter to the capital, Kota Kinabalu, after receiving medical aid. We later learned to our relief that he was hospitalized but had not got out of the critical stage.\n\nFive days later, Joseph came home from Sabah. The school gave him a hero's welcome. After all, he had tried and completed the last stage of the expedition in his own way. He had not disgraced his father. After this, Joseph returned to the pursuit of his first love - his books."

        "content": "My name is Tenerife. Folks call me \"Ten\". I come from a poor family and we live in the poor workman's quarters on the outskirts of a Mexican city. Dad is an odd job worker and Mum is a domestic help. She works for a rich family in the city. When Dad is at home, he is often drunk and likes to beat both Mum and me.\nI hate school. It is boring and the teachers call me \"stupid\". The rich children will have nothing to do with me and after a theft in school, even the poor children ostracized me all because the pesky teacher fingered me unfairly as the prime suspect. I was cleared eventually, but the stigma remains. Hence, I often play truant.\n\nOne day, I was hanging outside Uncle Willie's store, gazing longingly at the chocolate candies inside. Then, my attention was drawn to two men. One was tall, lean and looked young except for a shock of white hair on his head. He looked mean. The other man was stocky and even more sinister-looking. The men were paying for their purchases at the cashier. They had bought a lot. A fortnight's supply of food, I reckoned. \"Come on!\" the small man grumbled to his partner. \"Let's get going.\" They went out of the store and towards the car park. What attracted me, however, were the stacks of colored liquorice they were carrying. I was hoping to have one of them if I pestered them.\n\nHowever, I had no such luck. The men glared at me. Something in their manner was strange and my sixth sense told me that something was amiss. I decided to follow them secretly. At the car park, one of the men, decided to go to the toilet after loading his bags. Dave, his friend, decided to accompany him. My attention, however, was drawn to his prolonged stare at the partly opened car boot. \"What could be inside it that made him look at it for so long?\" I wondered.\n\nAfter the men left the car, I approached the boot. To my surprise, I heard muffled cries of a small child in need. Putting my ears to the car metal, I heard, \"Help me! Help me out!\" Shocked and flabbergasted, I reassured the child as loudly as I could, all the while keeping a lookout for the two men. Then I acted quickly. After mentally noting the make of the car, color and the vital license plate number, I made a dash for the nearest police station.\n\nBut it was here that my troubles began. At the police post, they did not believe my story. In the first place, I was out of place in my school uniform. I was sternly asked why I was not in school. A phone call by the officer to my school confirmed his suspicions that I was a truant. My pesky teacher told him that I was untrustworthy. Then I was escorted back to the school in disgrace. It never occurred to the authorities to wonder why I would want to lie to them in the first case about the cries in the car.\n\nThat very night, I heard news from my village people that confirmed my fears and suspicions. A prominent politician's only son had been kidnapped. The kidnappers wanted a huge sum of money. After hearing this, I felt vindicated and prepared myself for a visit from the police.\n\nWhen they arrived at my home, I was treated with care and respect. In fact, I was treated very well. After ascertaining from me a detailed account of the morning's incident, Inspector Basheer left, leaving me to answer the excited queries from my neighbors.\n\nThe next day, Inspector Basheer was back. The police had traced vital particulars of the criminals. They also knew where the car was stolen. However, they still had no clue as to the whereabouts of the kidnapped boy. Could I, they had asked, remembered anything more? I scratched my hair and tried to recall that morning's event. Then I shouted out something to their delight, \"Chaco Mount Ain!\" I explained excitedly that I had heard the kidnappers mention this place twice that morning. Delighted, the officers left.\n\nThat night, I learned from my neighbor whose friend owned a television set, that the police had caught the kidnappers. I could not sleep that night, happy in the knowledge that I had played no small part in helping the boy and his parents.\n\nThe next day was one I will not forget in my life. In school, the Principal and Inspector Basheer invited me to the stage in the school hall. In front of the pupils, I was commended for my bravery, civic-mindedness and alertness in helping them nab the criminals. I also received a cash reward from the grateful father of the boy, now safe at home."

        "content": "My name is Nurisya. I am a student in one of the schools in Malaysia where Chinese Literature is offered. Being interested in all things Chinese, I was thrilled to pieces when I learnt that my school had nominated me for a one year immersion study course in Beijing to learn about China's history, culture and its language. The trip would be sponsored by the Ministry of Education. A week later, my school's nomination was accepted and I was confirmed to depart on 5th November, a week after my school examinations. The idea was to acclimatise me to the Beijing scene before I started my school term in January. I had no shortage of well-wishers and teachers. There was no trace of jealousy in them as I had brought honor to the school.\nThe morning of November 5th dawned bright and clear. This was the day I was looking for - to depart from Malaysia and to land in historic Beijing. Yet, I felt more than a tinge of regret on leaving my loved ones, especially my beloved Mum. She and I had spent the day before in a flurry of activity doing last-minute preparations. Her worries and nagging about my preparation for the trip were still fresh on my mind as I woke up at 8.30 a.m. The flight was on SQ 518 at 12.15 p.m. from KLIA to Beijing. I was to meet my teachers, friends and relatives at 10.00 a.m. before I checked in.\n\nSince there was plenty of time to spare and my bags were all packed, I took a leisurely breakfast. At 9.30 a.m., Mum asked me,\n\n\"Dear, are you ready?\" \"Yes, Mum\", I replied gaily. \"Don't forget your passport,\" she reminded.\n\nI was at the door, carrying two of my bags when a niggling thought manifested in my mind. \"Did I pack the passport myself last night?\" I had an uneasy feeling that I had not and turned to Mum.\n\n\"Mum, did you put my passport in my pouch?\" \"Yes, dear,\" she replied.\n\nI then unzipped my waist pouch to confirm this. To my consternation, it was empty except for some Chinese currency. I then asked Mum where it was. Flabbergasted, Mum checked and then scratched her head. She was quite certain that she had put my passport in the pouch the night before. The next thirty minutes saw Mum, my maid and me rifling through the luggage and combing my room. We practically emptied drawers, and even looked under the bed! But it was to no avail. Frantically, we then searched the rest of the house. By 10.30 a.m., we practically sank on the sofa, admitting defeat. Mum then made a decision. I was to go to the airport now as we could not keep our well-wishers waiting. She would remain behind and try to recall where she had placed my passport.\n\nFighting back my tears, I left for the airport. The mood was sombre as I met and told my well-wishers at the airport my situation. The minutes crawled by and yet there was no ringing from my mobile phone. At 11.30 a.m., there was a last call to check-in for my flight. Reluctantly, I faced the fact that my passport might not be found and went to the SQ counter to explain my situation. Then Sun Lin, my best friend, who was guarding my bags, gestured to me excitedly. \"Your mobile phone is ringing!\" she said. With a pounding heart, I rushed to the smart phone and heard one of the sweetest news in my life. \"I remember now. It is in the secret compartment in your red bag.\" Swiftly, I unlocked my bag and unzipped the compartment at the bottom. My red passport was unveiled in all its glory.\n\nThere were spontaneous cheers from everyone. I was then sent off hurriedly but warmly. At 12.20 p.m., I was on the plane, winging over Kuala Lumpur, on its way to Beijing.\n\nLater, I learnt from Mum what had happened. It seemed that she had a nightmare the night before my flight that my pouch containing my passport was stolen. Therefore, she had woken up and transferred my passport to the red bag. In the morning, she had forgotten about the transfer. It was only a mother's love that made Mum remember this fact in time.\n\nI therefore departed from Malaysia, feeling greatly relieved and looking forward to my stay in Beijing. However, I was sad that Mum could not bid farewell to me at the airport. However, on the first night in the school hostel in Beijing where I was staying, the telephone rang. Mum was flying over to spend a holiday in Beijing. My happiness was thus complete."
