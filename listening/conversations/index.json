And does your current employer know that you are in the market for a new position?\n- Not explicitly, but my manager understands that I've been there six years now, and I've basically reached the top of the ladder in terms of what I can do with them.

        "transcript": "- OK, Mr. Lancaster. Let me summarize your order. You want two cases of printer ink -- one black and one color; 50 reams of copy paper -- the bright white kind; six cartons of legal envelopes; and 50 boxes of manila folders. Is that correct?\n- Yes it is. And can I expect that to arrive within a week? We need it by next Monday.\n- With standard shipping, it will get there within 7 to 10 business days. If you need it sooner, we should use expedited shipping. That would cost $30 instead of $15 for standard, but it would guarantee arrival within 3 to 5 days.\n- Hmm... well, I guess we'll have to go with the expedited, then. Would it be possible to order additional items for the same shipping fee?\n- Sure. You could add up to 25 pounds on your order. But after that, the expedited fee would be $2 per five pounds.",

I started taking the subway two years ago, and it's wonderful! From the Scott Street station, it's only a block and a half to our building. And going home, the 52nd Street stop is only two blocks from my apartment. When I was driving, I wasn't getting nearly as much exercise.\n- Exactly! Plus, the subway's cheaper than gas in the long run. And the trains leave every 15 minutes, so if I miss one I don't have to wait long for another.

It's my understanding that garbage is collected on Wednesdays, and recyclables such as paper, plastic and glass are collected on Thursdays. Is that correct?\n- No sir, it's the other way around. Recyclables are Wednesday, and garbage is Thursday. You need to put your garbage can next to the curb in front of your house by 7 a.m. Thursdays. You should have two recycling containers, one for paper and cardboard, and one for glass. Those need to be set in front of your house by 7 a.m. Wednesday. On both those days, our pick-up trucks will be there sometime between 7 and 5.\n- Oh I see. Thank you very much for your assistance. Just one more thing. I heard that the city is going to start collecting yard waste soon. Can you please tell me about that?",

Laura, how are you coming on the new web browser?\n- Well, the project is a little behind schedule, because last month's storm delayed a shipment of computer chips from Taiwan. But we're testing a prototype browser, and hope to have it in beta stage within eight weeks, which will be an exciting step for the company. This browser will host an internet platform, meaning all customers will need is our browser to access the World Wide Web.\n- That's exciting news, indeed, Laura! Do you have all the components you need now to complete the testing before it goes to beta? Is there anything else we need to order?\n- We should have everything we need, barring unforeseen circumstances. Hashkeem and Martin are working on the prototype practically 24/7, and they'll let me know if anything unexpected comes up.",

Only about 10 I think, but it does seem longer. He's kind of an institution at this paper. Word is that he asked the publisher, Mr. Frankel, for a column last year, but he was turned down.\n- What a shame. If anyone deserves his own column, it's Nathan Richmond. He's paid his dues, covering city politics all these years. I wonder who'll cover that beat now. Have you heard, Carla?",

I used Mighty Maids yesterday, and the woman who cleaned my home -- Nora, is her name -- did not do a very good job. I asked her to scrub the bathroom floors, but when she finished, they looked no cleaner than before she started. I also asked her to clean the oven and do some laundry. She did neither. I'm very disappointed, and I'd like my money back.\n- I'm terribly sorry to hear that, Mr. Dodd. Believe me, this is not typical of Mighty Maids service. Unfortunately, I cannot refund your money. However, what I can do is send a different person out tomorrow, who will clean your house this time free of charge. We'd like another chance to prove that yesterday was an aberration. Would that be OK?\n- Yes, I suppose. But if the cleaner is not good tomorrow, I will not use your service again, and I'll tell everyone I know to avoid Mighty Maids.",

I think we ought to look in at least two stores before we get anything.\n- Yeah, we could, but when you figure in the cost of time and gas getting to another store, it might end up being cheaper just to buy it here right now. What if we go to Video Plus and it's not any cheaper, but they just match the price?\n- Yeah, I see your point, but I'd feel better if we could compare anyway. If the TV is only $300 at the other store, then it's worth the time and gas to go there. How about if I call Video Plus and ask them?\n- All right, that's a good idea.

That's a tight deadline. All right, let's get Gino and meet in the conference room in half an hour. Bring all the design sketches that you've worked up, and have Gino bring all the ad copy he's written. I'll grab the old power point slides and videos of Martin's current commercials.\n- Right. Look, I know it's not much time, but I think we'll be OK. I've been working hard on the artwork, and I know that Gino was writing at home even though he was ill.

You got high marks for promptness and dedication, and need to improve your business etiquette and time management. Do you have any questions?\n- Yes, just a couple. What do you do with my performance review after I review it and sign it? Will you use it next year in deciding on salary increases?\n- Those are good questions. Your review will go into your file, which is part of your permanent employment record. It will be considered in determining salary, but it's just one factor among many. We'll also consider your overall performance since you joined the company, and any improvement made following this evaluation. In general, you're doing very nice work. Keep up the good work, and you shouldn't have any worries.\n- Thank you, Ms. Donaldson. I appreciate your fairness, and I enjoy working for you.",

Take that to your manager, and get his or her signature on the bottom line. Then, take a copy of that form -- that's the yellow page underneath -- and turn it into accounting. Be sure to attach copies of all your receipts. You keep the third page, the pink form, along with all your original receipts. Reimbursement checks are cut once a month, and they are separate from your normal paycheck. They usually go out on the 15th.\n- OK, blue form to manager, yellow to accounting. I think I've got it. What type of expenses will the company reimburse?\n- Typically taxi, subway and bus fares; admission fees; meals and drinks up to $30 a day; and any necessary business supplies -- either for use on your trip or after you return. Of course, we'll also reimburse for unexpected costs, such as having to rent a hotel room if your flight is cancelled or delayed, or expenses associated with a lost wallet or natural disaster.",

You wanted 20 pounds of fresh caviar, but our supplier is hampered by a labor dispute, so they can deliver only 10 pounds of caviar. We could refund your money for the other 10 pounds, or substitute something else.\n- Oh dear. Hmmm... well, we have more than 200 guests, so it's probably best to substitute at this point. What would you recommend?\n- Well, you wanted five pounds of smoked sardines. How about 10 more pounds of those?\n- No, let's do this. Five more pounds of sardines, and double the amount of avocado dip, from three bowls to six. Hey, while you're on the phone, can we double-check the order?",

But fifteen of them don't have electricity right now.\n- I see. Well, we still have three days 'til the weekend. Do you think you could rig up some tables with stand-alone displays behind them?

Oh, he also asked if we'd be interested in a 1,500-square foot office in Pineville.\n- Hmm. Pineville's nice, but that's too small. The way we're growing, we need 2,000 square feet at the minimum.",

I’m going to have my wife drive me to the airport.\n- I have your itinerary right here.  Your flight leaves San Jose at 8:00 PM on Friday.  I reserved a car for you at Hertz and you will be staying at the Hilton Hotel.  I tried to get you a room at the W hotel but they were full.  I know it’s your favorite.\n- That’s okay, Hilton is still a nice hotel.  Can you make sure the rental car has the never lost navigation system?  You know how I hate to get lost.\n- I’ve already confirmed it with the rental agency.  I’m also printing out directions to the convention center from your hotel in case there is something wrong with the navigation system.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a student and a university advisor. The student is trying to decide where to go to school next year.\n- Advisor: Now, then, Mr., uh, Vickstad. How can I help you?\n- Student: Well, I'm thinking about transferring, but I'm, I'm not sure ... I was hoping you could help me make a decision.\n- A: I'll try. Where are you thinking of transferring to? And why do you want to leave Kryptos U?\n- S: Um...I'm thinking of going to Central University, because it's in my hometown. I've uh, been kind of homesick here this year, and I haven't made many friends...I just feel so lonely. So, I thought that uh, maybe, it'd be better to be closer to my parents and friends and all.\n- A: I see. And would you keep the same major if you transferred? What is it...business administration?\n- S: Yeah, I would. The credits I've earned here will transfer to Central. I've already checked.\n- A: May I ask why you chose to come to Kryptos University in the first place?\n- S: Sure. Um, well, the main reason is you have a great business school. And the second reason is that I...I wanted to get away from home.\n- A: You're right, Mr. Vickstad, we do have an excellent business school. But, so does Central. The thing is, you've got almost a year under your belt here now. At Central, you'll be starting from scratch.\n- S: Yeah, I know that. But I'm a little bit familiar with Central, 'cuz I had older friends who went there, and I visited it before I came here.\n- A: You know, freshman year is usually the hardest. I remember how homesick I was my first year. I'll tell you, I was ready to pack it in after the first two weeks. But the longer I stayed, the more comfortable I felt. By senior year, I was glad I chose to stay.\n- S: Really? Did it get a lot better your sophomore year?\n- A: Yes, it did. You might well find the same is true for you. Also, even though your credits here will transfer, you will have to take extra courses, because Central has different requirements. You'll probably have to go to school for an extra year.\n- S: Hmm...I hadn't thought about that. I'll have to check into it. Maybe I should give it one more year. I mean, it's probably good for me to learn to live away from my family and friends, right? It'll make me stronger in the future.\n- A: You can always move back there after you graduate. Of course, by that time you may not want to!\n- S: Thank you for all your help. I guess I'll find out the exact transfer requirements. You've given me a lot to think about.\n- A: Don't mention it. If you feel like you want to talk more, don't hesitate to come back and see me.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between two students in their first class of the term.\n\nArthur: Morning, Myra.\n\nMyra: Oh hi, Arthur! You're taking Ecology Three Eleven, too?\n\nA: Looks like it. It's my only elective this term.\n- Really? What happened?\n\nA: Oh, I just took too many my second year, and now I've got to pick up all the required courses I've been ignoring. University's just too much fun, I guess.\n- Too many parties?\n\nA: No. (laughs) Well, yeh, that too. But you know-- there're just so many interesting things to learn about, and we've only got four years here to explore them. I've been having too good a time at it, that's all. But it has helped me decide my major, finally.\n- And?\n\nA: Bus Ad. I've learned a lot here, and one thing I've learnt is that most fields don't hold out a lot of promise for gainful employment! So I'm playing it safe and going for my BA in business administration.\n- So, why Three Eleven? An ecology course isn't going to help you in your office job at some corporation.\n\nA: Prob'ly not, but... it still seems interesting-- and important. We all need to know about the environment, no matter what we do for a living.\n- Yeah, you're right. And maybe you will be able to use it. Maybe you'll end up working for a green company or something.\n\nA: Could be. There's more and more of those every day.\n- And thank goodness. Poor old Earth!\n\nA: Is that why you're taking this?\n- Well, it's not an elective for me. I need Three Eleven for my BS program. We need several cross-field courses to \"broaden our understanding\", and this is one of them. Actually, though, I'm looking forward to this course: \"Nature's Influence on Man-- Man's Influence on Nature\"! Sounds like a really useful topic, doesn't it? And Dr Forsythe is supposed to be a very engaging lecturer.\n\nA: Well, his website is a gas, at least! He's got an hilarious little eco-game on it: shoot the wolves and see how many deer reproduce and eat all the grass!\n- Hmm. I suppose that would teach, uh, fifth graders about the balance of nature.\n\nA: Hey, it was fun! Anyway, he's also got some good information there-- it'll probably come in handy when he gives us homework.\n- Wow, you're right! I better take a look at it myself. Can you give me his URL?\n\nA: It's listed right in the course guide where they describe the course, but if you can't find it, I'll give it to you next time. Or I could email it to you-- what's your address?\n- That would be great, thanks. Myrasweetie@umail.com. Here, I'll write it down for you. Did you pick up your textbook yet?\n\nA: No. I've been looking for a secondhand copy before I spring for a new one. It's expensive-- forty-five bucks!\n- (sighs) They all are, aren't they? Why do poor college students have to pay so much for their textbooks? It ain't fair.\n\nA: It's just economics. Nobody reads them except the students that take the courses. The publishers probably didn't print more than a few hundred copies of our text, you know.\n- Still, they could print them in paperback, couldn't they? That would save us some money.\n\nA: And on newsprint-- sure! (laughs) Some students do keep them, though, for reference after they graduate, if they're working in that field. In that case, they need to be durable. My dad's still got his college accounting textbooks-- and he uses them all the time.\n- I suppose you're right. Where you gonna find a used copy? At the bookstore?\n\nA: They don't have any there now-- I checked. I put up some notes on the Science Building bulletin boards yesterday. Maybe someone there's got one they don't want to keep anymore.\n- Well, uh, if you hear about two of them, will you let me know? I'd like to save a little money, too.\n\nA: Sure. If I do, I'll buy it for you and you can pay me back. How much are you willing to pay?\n- Oh, anything under thirty-five dollars'll be fine. A penny saved is a penny earned. But if you haven't found one by next Monday, I'll have to buy a new one then, so email me Sunday night either way, will you?\n\nA: You bet. Oops! Here's Dr Forsythe now.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a professor and his assistant.\n- Dr Abercrombie: Good morning, Hanna. Thanks for coming in. How was your holiday?\n- Mr Fitch: It was very good, Professor, thanks. A week in the Appalachians is really therapeutic. Nothing to do but eat, sleep, and listen to nature. It's beautiful up there in the spring-- the countryside is so green-- and the people are so friendly and laid back. A good place to unwind.\n- Dr: I envy you. I've just got too much to get done to get away at all now. I must get this book finished, for one thing-- my publisher's getting impatient. I've outlined the last two chapters, though, finally, so it won't take me too much longer, I hope. Maybe I'll be able to go somewhere at Christmas. But, um, what I wanted to talk to you about is our syllabus for this term, Hanna. I know this is short notice, but I'd like to make a couple of little changes to it.\n- Mr: Uh oh! I know your idea of \"little\" changes!\n- Dr: (laughs) No, no, I don't think it'll be that bad this time. What I'd like to do is, uh, cut Lectures Two and Three-- the ones on Old English and Middle English-- down to half their length and then meld them together into a single lecture. Then, with that extra ninety minutes, I want to add a lecture at the end on World Englishes. I think it's time we dealt with that more thoroughly, don't you?\n- Mr: Yessir, I certainly do. That's a good idea. So I guess I just need to cut down the quizzes to match and add a new one for World Englishes. Do you know when I'll be able to see your revised OE and ME notes?\n- Dr: I've already done a good bit of that revision, Hanna, and I think I'll have them ready for you before Lecture One. That's April eighth, I think?\n- Mr. Yes, Tuesday the eighth.\n- Dr: I've taken the segments on pronunciation out-- I think we can lose those easily enough. Nobody really needs to recite \"Beowulf\" or the \"Canterbury Tales\" any more-- no matter how much fun it is.\n- Mr: And that means you probably won't be discussing orthography much either?\n- Dr: I suppose not. I just want to be sure to point out clearly the main ways in which Modern English has developed from its predecessors. You know, the Great Vowel Shift, and so forth. Saving ninety minutes is not going to commit Old and Middle English to total oblivion, after all.\n- Mr: (laughs) Not if you can help it, certainly! So I can eliminate the phonetics quiz completely, then?\n- Dr: Yes, I think so. I'll still give them a reading just so they can get a flavour of their ancestral tongue, but they can get as much of the phonetics as they want out of the textbook-- and it's rote learning anyway, really.\n- Mr: Now, what about your new lecture, then? Can I get started on any of that?\n- Dr: Yes, that's where I could really use your help in the next couple of weeks. I need you to research 'pidgins and creoles' for me. I've never paid enough attention to them, and I'd like an idea of the number there are, uh, their distribution, and uh, what linguists are saying about them these days-- are they English dialects? Derivative languages? What? See if you can find me some interesting examples and some specific quotes, will you?\n- Mr: Yes, of course. I think I know the kind of thing you're looking for. I'll take a look for internet sources this afternoon and then see what the library has later.\n- Dr: Thank you, Hanna, I'd appreciate that. And while you're there, would you see if they've got a copy of Burnley's source book on the history of English? I can't seem to find mine.\n- Mr: Oh. Uh... that's because you lent it to me last term... and erm, I haven't returned it yet.\n- Dr: Ah. Well. Get it back to me sometime soon, then, will you? I need to refer to it for my revisions.\n- Mr: Yessir, of course. Anything else on the syllabus?\n- Dr: Just that we'll need the student handout revised to reflect the changes. Who was in charge of that last time?\n- Mr: The department secretary has the file. I'll draft a revision, let you check it, and then give it to her, shall I? Shouldn't take long, and we just need to get photocopies before the first class.\n- Dr: All right, I'll leave that in your hands too then, Hanna. Just let me know if you need anything. And I'll see you at the faculty meeting tomorrow afternoon.\n- Mr: Oh, yes. Yes. The faculty meeting. Oh, and if you need any anecdotes on Appalachian English dialect, I'm your man-- I've just picked up a wealth of contemporary examples!\n- Dr: (laughs) I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, Hanna.",

It only takes about ten minutes and it's pretty simple-- if you've taken good notes and studied them a bit beforehand, that is. There are fifteen lectures, so that's fifteen quizzes.\n- MJ: And they're part of our final grade, right?\n- MF: Right. One percent each or fifteen percent for all fifteen of them.\n- MJ: Each one's only one percent of my grade? That doesn't seem like much. Missing one or two of them wouldn't make much difference, would it?\n- MF: Not really, no-- but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. They're not worth much individually because they're very short and sweet-- just to check that you've been coming to class, really. But students who pass all fifteen quizzes earn a five percent, um, bonus for effort.\n- MJ: Don't our individual quiz scores count?\n- MF: No, sorry. They're just pass-fail quizzes.\n- MJ: So, pass them all and it's twenty percent of my final grade?\n- MF: That's right.\n- MJ: That sounds good.\n- MF: And sixty percent are your mid-term and final exams.\n- MJ: Are they short and sweet, too?\n- MF: (laughs) No, I'm afraid not. They're not like the quizzes. They're ninety-minute tests and require a good bit of writing in addition to the objective questions. The mid-term covers the first eight lectures, the Founding Fathers to Mark Twain. The final mainly covers World War One to the present, from Lecture Nine on.\n- MJ: So first-half authors won't be on the final?\n- MF: That's not what I said. I said it's MAINLY on the second half of the course. Professor Addlestone will be keeping you, uh, honest with a few questions about American literature before the first World War, too.\n- MJ: I see. And they're thirty-thirty?\n- MF: Yes, thirty percent for the mid-term, thirty percent for the final, and up to twenty percent for the weekly quizzes. And then up to ten percent each for your essays. You'll need at least ninety percent for an A, eighty percent for a B, and seventy percent for a C.\n- MJ: Erm....could you tell me something about what is expected with our essays? There're two of them, right?\n- MF: Yes. You're required to write two short critical essays on American authors of your choice, from anywhere in American literary history, and we'll be looking carefully at your writing style and ability as much as at the content of your essays. The Professor's a real stickler for overall literacy.\n- MJ: So I can choose any author in the syllabus?\n- MF: Yes, but I can tell you that we often like it when a student picks an author out of the mainstream-- perhaps a lesser writer that we haven't been able to include in the lectures, or a contemporary author who hasn't, uh, hasn't found a place in literary history yet.\n- MJ: Someone really obscure?\n- MF: Not a good idea. The author you choose should have some relevance to the course of American literature. And if you can demonstrate that relevance clearly in four to five typewritten pages, then you'll have a good essay.\n- MJ: For each essay? Ooh.\n- MF: This is a university, uh, Mary Jane, not a high school. Now, you've got almost four months to write eight to ten pages. You should be able to manage that.\n- MJ: Yes, OK. You're right. When are they due?\n- MF: Your first essay's due in late October. It must be handed in by Lecture Eight, but we'd be happy to see it anytime before that. And the second is due at the last lecture in December. It must be turned in before the winter break.\n- MJ: Oh-- should the first essay be about somebody in the the first half's material then? And the same for the second?\n- MF: No, not at all. Any author you like. It would be smart to choose ones that interest you, though. Papers that reflect some, um, enthusiasm always turn out better.\n- MJ: Oh, I've got that! I'm really looking forward to this course-- I love reading!\n- MF: That's good, because you'll be doing a lot of that.\n- MJ: Thanks for your help, Mr Fitch-- I really appreciate it.\n- MF: And don't be shy if you have any more concerns, Mary Jane. My door's always open. Good-bye.",

And you're Terry, uh, Lawrence?\n- T: Yep. So we're roomies this year, eh? Nice to meet you.\n- R: Good to meet you, too.\n- T: Well, uh, I guess the first thing is-- which bunk do you want?\n- R: Ha! Oh, I don't mind, really. The top's fine. You can have the lower one.\n- T: OK, thanks, I'll take it! I am a bit afraid of falling off. I did that more than once when I was a kid. It doesn't hurt, really, but it sure knocks the wind out of you!\n- R: (laughs) Well, I'll try not to roll over in my sleep. Actually, it looks like fun sleeping up there. I've never slept in a bunk bed before, though. What's your major?\n- T: Oh, I'm supposed to be in pre-med, but I've been taking a lot of electives. I might change it. What's yours?\n- R: I'm just an aggie. We've got a ranch out west of Houston, and I'm thinking I might become a vet. You're pre-med? Then you've taken Chemistry One Twenty-one? It's a required course for me, and I'm not good in chemistry at all. Maybe I could borrow your notes?\n- T: Hah! \"Bonehead Chemistry\"-- no, sorry. I still have to take that, too. Hey, maybe we could sign up for the same sections.\n- R: Yeah, that's a good idea!\n- T: When do you register?\n- R: Oh. Let me see. Wait a sec. Uh...ah, here it is: ten a.m. Monday.\n- T: Great! I register at nine. The Bonehead lectures are Tuesdays and Thursdays, and the labs are Monday-Wednesday-Friday afternoons. I can register first and then let you know which sections I've got before you register at ten. What times are good for you?\n- R: Oh gosh. Maybe, early lectures and a Friday lab? I think better in the morning, and that's going to be a tough course.\n- T: I know. That's why I'm thinking about switching majors-- the science prerequisites are really awful. But I'll give it one more semester before I pack it in. You sure you want a Friday lab? It'll cut your weekend short.\n- R: Yeah, but I'm gonna have a full load this semester, so I gotta take something Friday anyway. Might as well be something I can cut.\n- T: OK then. So, should I meet you back here Monday about nine-thirty? I can give you my schedule then.\n- R: Uh, how about in the cafeteria? I'd like to get some coffee before I start-- I'll need the energy. And it's handier anyway.\n- T: Sure, that's fine-- let's do that, then. But maybe we'd better get a little organized around here. I've already put my clothes in the left-hand dresser. Do you mind if I set one of my stereo speakers on the corner of the right-hand one?\n- R: No, that's OK. I didn't bring much stuff-- just the basics till I know what I need. If I need that space later, we can hang the speaker on the wall.\n- T: And I took over half the closet.\n- R: That bookcase looks pretty small. Most of my stuff is books.\n- T: Yeah, I've got a lot of those, too-- and we haven't even got this term's texts yet. (Sighs in thought) D'you think we could get one the same size from Campus Stores and put it on top of that one? They've got a free furniture place there.\n- R: Well, we could at least run over and take a look. I'll bet the bookcases are all gone, though-- they're going to be a popular item. Tell you what: I'll go over there after I see you Monday morning. Maybe they'll have an early-bird special.\n- T: OK, good. And if they don't, we'll just have to make do for now. (Pause) Shoes.\n- R: Huh?\n- T: Where can we put our shoes? Where'd you stash yours?\n- R: Oh. There, under the bed. One advantage of sleeping on the bottom bunk.\n- T: Wait a minute!\n- R: Just kidding. Stuff whatever you like under there, too. Half is yours. Just got those two bags?\n- T: No, I've also got two cartons of books and junk coming later. I'll worry about them then. All your stuff here?\n- R: Yep. But I need to go to a drugstore and pick up some toilet paper and kleenex sometime soon. Wanna come?\n- T: Yes, that's just what I have to do, too-- get some toothpaste and stuff. Gimme a minute and we can go together now.\n- R: Great!",

My Physics lectures are eight to nine in the morning Tuesday and Thursday. Those're gonna be killers. I'm gonna need two alarm clocks. And I got a Friday lab from two to four. I couldn't get an earlier one because they conflict with my Biology course. It's only has one section, so I have no choice there.\nR: Those Friday classes sure spoil a four-day week, don't they? (Laughs) Want some coffee?\nT: Uh, sure. You still got time before you register?\nR: There's still a few minutes till ten, and they don't let you start early. They're pretty strict-- they won't let you in there till your time comes.\nT: That's because it's so crowded, I guess. Registering eighteen thousand students in four days makes it pretty busy over there.\nR: I'll be right back. (He gets them coffees.) There you are. (Pause) Coffee. I'm gonna be drinking a lot of that this semester.\nT: Me too, I guess.\nR: Did you pick up a cafeteria cash card yet?\nT: No, not yet. I've gotta go to the bank first. The biggest card they've got is a hundred dollars, isn't it?\nR: I think they've got a two-hundred dollar one this year. Prices have gone up so much they've added a new denomination-- like Zimbabwe does! But I've still got some money on my last year's card, so I haven't checked for sure yet.\nT: Well, I'll take out two hundred bucks just in case. Might as well get the biggest one-- I'll be using it all, that's for sure. I practically live over here. It's a good place to study.\nR: Can I sublet your half of the room then? (Laughs)\nT: (Laughs) Gee, maybe we should. Pick up some extra money. They say there's a real shortage of dorm space this year.\nR: How come? The student body's about the same as last year, I think. Or smaller-- tuition's gone up again and I'll bet some students just couldn't afford it this year, with this slow economy.\nT: No, it's because they tore down Dormitory A to put up a new one-- but all they've got is the shell so far. That plumbers and electricians strike this summer sure threw a monkey wrench into the construction schedule. It won't be finished now till the end of December at least.\nR: Wow! There must've been five hundred rooms in Dorm A! That's a big dent in campus housing, all right. Are they doing anything about it?\nT: Well, I hear the Housing Office is trying to lease as many off-campus units as they can find, but most of them are rented to students already.\nR: Too bad. I wouldn't want to live off-campus anyway, though.\nT: Why not?\nR: Well, it's so cheap and easy to live right here. The rent's less than half of what we'd have to pay out there, and we're right on campus within a few minutes of everyplace. The only problem is the roommates they give you.\nT: (Laughs) Yeah? Well, you're stuck with this one for the rest of the year at least, pal! But y'know, of we stayed roomies, we could share the rent on an apartment somewhere not too far off. So it wouldn't cost that much-- and think of the parties we could throw! You can't have a real party in a dorm room.\nR: Huh! Yeah. That's something to think about. Let's keep our eyes open for a place for next year, then.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a student and a university adviser.\n- Adviser: So, what can I do for you today?\n- Student: Well, um, next month is the deadline for declaring a major, and uh...I still don't know what I want to major in.\n- A: Don't worry. That's common with sophomores. Um, have you narrowed down your possibilities? Do you have a list?\n- S: Uh, no, I don't. I've...I've always had a hard time making decisions, especially hard ones.\n- A: All right. Well, why don't we start with subjects that you're sure you don't want to major in.\n- S: OK. Well, I hate science, and I'm not very good at math, so those are out. Um, I don't think business would be good for me. I don't want to wear a suit and work in an office from 9 to 5. Uh...I like to move around, you know, maybe get outside, and kind of be my own boss. I don't want someone looking over my shoulder all the time.\n- A: Mmm...we're off to a good start. No business, math, or science. So, let's switch gears and consider topics you might want to choose for a major. Um...of all the subjects you've taken last year and so far this term, which ones have you liked? What kinds of classes have you found interest you the most?\n- S: There's a lot them. I love literature, and my psychology class was also pretty interesting. Philosophy was kind of cool; so was world history with Professor Briggs. I learned a lot in my visual arts class, and...oh yeah, my roommate talked me into taking sociology, which I thought would be boring, but it turned out to be great! So, um, that's the problem. I like so many different things, I can't pick just one of them!\n- A: Oh, I see. Hey, do you like to write by any chance?\n- S: Yeah! English was one of my favorite classes in high school, and one of my best too! I got all A's, except for one B+ from Ms. Horowitz junior year.\n- A: I've got an idea. How about trying journalism?\n- S: Journalism?! You mean, like being a newspaper reporter or magazine writer?\n- A: Yes. Journalists have to cover many different stories, so they learn a little about a lot of things. You wouldn't be chained to a desk all day, and you'd work largely on your own, gathering material and writing stories. There's something different to learn about almost every day. Also, many of the classes you've already taken satisfy the first-year requirements of the journalism department. You see, they want you to take a broad spectrum of classes. You don't even start taking classes in the journalism department until next year.\n- S: Hmm...I've never thought of journalism before. Yeah, maybe I should check into it. But, um, what if I try it and it turns out that I don't really like it?\n- A: Well, while you're trying it, you'll be learning about, uh, all sorts of topics. If you find one of those that you like better, you could change your major. You'd just need to go to the registrar's office and fill out some paperwork.\n- S: Um, OK! I'll check out journalism, then. Thank you, Mr. Grouton.\n- A: You're welcome. Remember, the adviser's office is open every weekday from 8 to 4, if there's anything else I can do for you.",

In need to see your student ID card, please. OK, thank you. Now, which type of IMA pass would you like to buy?\n- S: Um, I don't know. How many different kinds of passes are there?\n- R: Well, there's a basic pass. That allows you to use the basketball courts, the fitness center, the racquetball courts, the rock-climbing center, and the indoor track. An IMA super pass lets you use all those things, and also the swimming pools, tennis courts, and golf driving range. Then we have, um, specialized passes for just the swimming pools and the fitness center.\n- S: Man, I didn't know this was going to be so complicated. Um, so the basic pass includes basketball, the fitness center, racquetball, and, uh, what else?\n- R: The rock-climbing center and the indoor track. It costs $50 for the quarter.\n- S: And the Super Pass has all those things, plus swimming, tennis, and the golf driving range, right?\n- R: Yes, that's correct. The super pass is $75 for the quarter. It also permits you use the IMA Center during the two-week Christmas vacation, if you're going to be here.\n- S: So, the basic pass is $50 for the quarter, and the super pass is, uh, 75, but the super pass it gives you two extra weeks. And um, you mentioned there were also special passes?\n- R: Yes, we have a swim-only pass for $35. This lets you use either one of our two swimming pools, plus the sauna and whirlpools in the locker room. There's also a pass for the fitness center only. It costs $40, and gives you access to all the weight machines and fitness machines, as well as the locker- room sauna and whirlpools.\n- S: All right, let's see if I've got this straight. The swim pass is $35, and the fitness center pass is $40. And both of these include access to the whirlpools and saunas in the locker room?\n- R: Correct. Oh, and one other thing I forgot to mention is that the fitness pass includes a 15-percent discount on all of our IMA sports and fitness classes.\n- S: What kinds of sports and fitness classes do you have?\n- R: Oh, my! We have several different kinds of dance classes, yoga, aerobics, swim conditioning, Tae Kwon Do....here's a brochure with all the details.\n- S: Thanks. So, these classes, there's an extra fee for them, even if I have a super pass?\n- R: I'm afraid so, because we have to pay the teachers' salaries and the cost of equipment.\n- S: OK. Uh, mmm...oh yeah, what about someone who isn't a university student? Is there some kind of pass that they could buy?\n- R: No, I'm afraid not. IMA passes are only offered to registered students and faculty. Guests have to be accompanied by a student or faculty member. They pay $10 each time they come.\n- S: Can students pay the same way, I mean, each time they come?\n- R: Yes, but if you're going to come very often it's better to buy a pass. The student price is $5 per visit. If you use the IMA even once a week, you'll save money buying a pass.\n- S: Well, thanks for all the information. There are so many choices, I can't make a decision right now. I'll think about it, then come back later in the week.\n- R: No problem. We're open Monday through Thursday from 8 to 12, then 1 to 4:30, and from 1 to 5:30 on Friday. If you have any more questions, you can call the phone number on the brochure.",

You are in my, um, American History 201 class, right? How can I help you today?\n- S: It's about my term paper. I, uh, I know it's due next Monday, but, um, I was hoping...I don't think I can get it done by then. Could I please turn it in by the end of next week instead? I have a really good excuse.\n- P: Oh I'm sure you do! [chuckles]. I've been teaching 33 years. Do you know how many excuses I've heard? \"My dog ate my paper.\" \"My roommate had a party so I couldn't concentrate.\" \"I have seven papers due on the same day!\" \"I went home to see my parents and my car broke down.\" My favorite was a student who told me she \"forgot\" all about her term paper until the day before it was due. It's amazing she remembered to come to class.\n- S: [Laughs nervously] I didn't forget, sir. I've been working on the paper, really! Here, I brought my outline and a rough draft. It's, um, just that...well, a lot of things have been going on in my life, and I'm having trouble managing things.\n- P: I see. You know, I assigned that paper four weeks ago, and I've been reminding students about it in each class. So, tell me your story. What's happening in your life?\n- S: First, about two weeks ago, my roommate found out his mother is real sick. She has breast cancer. So he's been really upset, and, uh, I went home with him for a couple of days to see his mom. That caused me to miss biology lab, and I have a huge biology final coming up on Tuesday that I really need to study for this weekend. Then I got the flu last week, and missed a day of class. I tried to work on your paper that day, but I really felt horrible...\n- P: OK, I can understand that. I'm glad that you're, er, helping your roommate through a tough time. That's more important than school work. But all this seems to have happened recently. What about the two weeks after I first assigned the term paper?\n- S: I, uh [sheepishly]...I guess I didn't use that time very well. I kind of put off getting started on it.\n- P: [Sighs]. Yes, you did. You know, if I had a dollar for every time I've heard a student say that...\n- S: I'm sorry, Professor Dalton. I've learned my lesson. If I had spent just a little bit of time each week on the paper, I could have had it done on time. I know now that I need to plan for unexpected things.\n- P: You seem like a bright, conscientious young man, Mr...your first name's Jack, isn't it? When I was a young student, an upperclassman gave me some advice that I've never forgotten. He said, \"You're going to find yourself with a lot of small gaps during school days -- 15 minutes, or half and hour. What you do during those gaps will make a big difference in how successful you are.\"\n- S: Wow! That's great advice.\n- P: Yeah, I thought so. And I still do. So I'll tell you what. You can turn your paper in no later than 9 a.m. Friday, right here on my office desk. In exchange for this favor, I want you to pass that advice on to all your friends and dorm mates.\n- S: Thank you, professor Dalton! You bet I will.\n- P: Um, as long as you're here, let me take a peek at your outline and rough draft. Do you have any questions about the paper that I can help you with?",

Did you want a limited or unlimited? And just for fall quarter, or for the entire school year?\n- S: I was thinking of one for the whole year, but I'm not sure. Does the year include summer quarter? 'Cause I won't be here then.\n- E: No, summer term is extra. The year includes fall, winter and spring quarters. A yearly pass is valid only from the start of fall term to the end of spring term. This year, that's, uh, let's see...[rustling paper] Sept. 22nd to June 7th.\n- S: Oh, OK. And you said there were two different kinds? Uh, limited and unlimited?\n- E: Yes. A limited pass lets you park in any campus lot only on days school is in session. During holidays and on weekends, you would have to pay the normal parking rate. With an unlimited pass, you can park in any lot on any day during the school year, including weekends and holidays. Like I said, between Sept. 22nd and June 7th.\n- S: Hmm...how much do they cost?\n- E: A limited pass is $100, and an unlimited is $150.\n- S: All right, I'll buy an unlimited, I guess. What do I have to do?\n- E: First, I'm going to give you a registration form. This gives us information about your car. Fill it out, and bring it back to me when you're ready. You can pay by cash, check, or credit card. Then, I'll give you a sticker to put on the corner of your windshield. Make sure that sticker is in place when you park. Otherwise, you will get a ticket.\n- S: No problem. So, um, does this pass guarantee that I'll get a parking space? I mean, are there, like, special places set aside in each lot for people with parking passes?\n- E: That's a good question. Uh, unfortunately, the answer is no. Parking is on a first-come, first-serve basis. If a lot is full, you'll have to park somewhere else, or wait until another car leaves.\n- S: I see. How much does, um, regular parking cost? Without a pass?\n- E: It's two dollars an hour, or $10 a day. You're getting an excellent deal.\n- S: Thank you. Oh, just one more question. Do you need all the money up front, or can I make payments?\n- E: I'm afraid I need it all at once. Sorry.",

Are you looking for something in particular?\n- Student: Yes, well... first I'm looking for the foreign language section.\n- C: Oh, it's right down here. Here we are. \"Foreign Languages\". What course are you taking?\n- S: Spanish Four Thirty-one.\n- C: You need the Intermediate Spanish textbook?\n- S: No, I still have that from Four Thirty. What I'm looking for is the novel we're supposed to read: Garcia Marquez's 'Cien años de soledad'-- 'One Hundred Years of Solitude'.\n- C: 'Garcia Marquez', 'Garcia Marquez'. Hmm. No... Oh, here it is, under 'Marquez'. Here you are.\n- S: Eighteen dollars? The price is right, but, erm, it's just the text. There don't seem to be any footnotes or any glossary.\n- C: Ah.\n- S: This is the only edition you have?\n- C: Yes, it is. Sorry.\n- S: Hmm. How many copies do you have left? Just those on the shelf?\n- C: Yes, uh, four-- no, five copies.\n- S: Jeez, those'll be gone by Friday for sure. Our class is really full. What's your return policy? Would it be OK if I bought this now, and then returned it if I can find an annotated edition on the internet?\n- C: Yes, certainly. But you'll need to keep your receipt, of course, and be sure that the book is not marked up or damaged in any way.\n- S: Sure, that's fair enough.\n- C: Did you want me to check whether we can find you another edition?\n- S: I don't think I have time. It usually takes so long to get a book through a bookstore.\n- C: (laughs) Unfortunately, that's often true.\n- S: Thanks anyway. I'll take this then, and say-- you have, uh, sweatshirts, don't you?\n- C: Sweatshirts? Yes, in the 'School Spirit' section. Over this way. And down here. Um. Here you are.\n- S: Ah. Yes. Hmm....that's not much of a school crest.\n- C: Oh. (laughs) There's a bigger one on the back, see?\n- S: Oh, yeah, of course. I see. Uh, this is a medium. I need a large, and uh...I think...in green.\n- C: Medium, medium...here, is this a large? Yes, large. Here you go.\n- S: Yeah, that's good. Say, do you know what our motto means, anyway? \"Ex Pertinacia Veritas\". \"Out of something....something-or-other.\"\n- C: \"From Determination comes Truth\". It's been SU's motto since it was founded in 1894. And this crest is \"an American bison couchant upon a tome vert\".\n- S: What in heck does that mean?\n- C: A buffalo lying on a green book. I think the idea was that this new pioneer state was getting its first institution of higher education-- the buffalo represents the prairies-- the green of the book-- and the book represents learning.\n- S: Huh. That's really interesting. I'll wear it with pride-- and hope for some of that determination! How much is this?\n- C: $39.95 plus tax.\n- S: Fine. Uh, what else do I need now? Mmm.... I guess that's it, then: the sweatshirt and the book.\n- C: And there's no tax on the book.\n- S: Where's your register?\n- C: Just take them up to the cashier at the front, please. Over there.\n- S: Oh, OK. Thanks a lot for your help.\n- C: Thank you. Have a nice day.",

Yes, I'm afraid the smoker's lounge is about the only place I can relax in around here. Can I do something for you, or are you just slumming?\n- H: Well, I was just wondering... You teach the afternoon section of Modern Social Systems, don't you?\n- R: Yes, that's me. Why?\n- H: Have you got a student in there by the name of Steiger, Sara Steiger?\n- R: Sara? Yes-- you know her?\n- H: I sure do. She's in my undergrad psychology seminar. She's beginning to be a real problem for the class, and I was just wondering how you were handling her. Or is she OK in your class?\n- R: OK? Uh. Yes. Well, not really-- but she's just eager to learn, I think, don't you?\n- H: You think so? That's why she never stops asking questions? I'll tell you what I think-- I think she already knows the answers before she asks. Or she's just asking for the sake of asking.\n- R: Huh? Why's that?\n- H: Well, half the time she wants to know about something we've already discussed in some detail, and half the time she has questions that are off-topic or, well, just, uh, mindless.\n- R: (sighs) I suppose you could be right about that. Sara can certainly be irritating sometimes. Sometimes I feel I'm cheating the rest of the students by spending so much time explaining things to her.\n- H: Exactly. And I can see them all rolling their eyes. (laughs) The rest of my class is a little irritated with her, too.\n- R: Maybe we should give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she's just trying too hard, I dunno, to learn maybe, or maybe just to make an impression on us. I don't know what her motives could be.\n- H: Yeah, well. She's making an impression, all right, but it isn't a good one. Any ideas? Pro-active ones, I mean.\n- R: Well, I guess we should have a talk with her.\n- H: A talk? A private one, you mean?\n- R: Yeah. It's either that, or just give her the cold shoulder.\n- H: I'm afraid I've already been giving her a bit of that. I thought maybe she'd take the hint and sit back, listen and take notes for a change.\n- R: She doesn't-- Doesn't she take any notes? She does in my class-- voluminous ones!\n- H: Are you sure, Roger?\n- R: Sure, I'm sure-- she's always scribbling away.\n- H: But have you seen Sara's notes?\n- R: Well, no, but--\n- H: I have. I took a peek over her shoulder a couple of times. She's a doodler.\n- R: A what?! She doodles?\n- H: All over her notebook. I don't think she's keeping any kind of notes or paying any attention at all to what I'm saying or what anyone else says in class. She's just daydreaming-- or dreaming up something irrelevant to inquire into. This morning we'd been talking about Jung's theory of archetypes, and she suddenly blurted out 'What's an archtype?' Well, we'd been discussing archtypes for half an hour by then, and it was like she'd just realized that she'd heard a strange word, when the conversation was almost over.\n- R: Heh! That's Sara, all right. OK then, who's going to talk to her, you or me?\n- H: Umm..\n- R: OK, OK, I'll see if I can get her to come in and talk to me later this week. I'll be seeing her in class tomorrow afternoon, I guess. Maybe I can get her to settle down a little. ...She doodles?!\n- H: Yes! (laughs) Pretty good, really. Complex, architectural, rococo things. Maybe she should go to art school instead of majoring in sociology.\n- R: That's Sara's major, is it?\n- H: I think so-- I think she mentioned that once. Anyway, yes: if you could have a little talk with her, that would be great. And let me know what happens, what you find out, will you?\n- R: Of course. I'll let you know how it goes.\n- H: Thanks, Roger, very much. I owe you one. Now, I've got to run before all this secondhand smoke does me in.\n- R: (laughs) Now don't start that!\n- H: (laughs) All right-- but you know you should really try to---\n- R: Henry!\n- H: OK.

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a student and her coach.\n- Coach: Good workout, Cindy. You're going to be in good shape for the intermurals next month.\n- Cindy: (gasping) Yeh. Whoo! If you don't kill me first. Wah! Whoosh....ohh.\n- Coach: OK, I get the hint. You can call it a day. Just be back here tomorrow at the same time, eh?\n- Cindy: I'll be here, but... can I talk to you a minute about something, Coach?\n- Coach: Sure. What is it?\n- Cindy: Coach, I'm not, uh, I'm not doing so good in my courses this term.\n- Coach: Huh? What? I thought you were an 'A' student. How bad could your grades be?\n- Cindy: Pretty bad, coach. The courses are getting harder. My grades are pretty awful in Cost Accounting, and I'm failing outright in Economics. I'm just not getting the work done that I need to do. I just don't have enough time.\n- Coach: How'd you do on your midterms?\n- Cindy: Not so good either. 62 percent on the Economics test, 73 percent in Cost Accounting. And 79 percent in Marketing- and that's supposed to be an easy course! I'm not going to graduate, with those kinds of scores. I've got to get a lot more studying in before the finals, that's all there is to it.\n- Coach: Oh. Um. So?\n- Cindy: So... I'm not sure how much time I can give to football anymore. I was wondering, wondering, uh.... how would it be if maybe I moved back to the B Squad- kind of 'in reserve', so to speak?\n- Coach: 'In reserve'?! Cindy, you're the best forward we've got!\n- Cindy: I dunno, Coach- Marly's good too. She just needs a chance to show her stuff.\n- Coach: Yeah, but- she's not you, Cindy, and I- the team- we're counting on you. We've got to take on SFU first off next month, and Marly's hardly played with the A Squad at all so far. I just don't know whether there's time to break her in now.\n- Cindy: Oh, I can work with her during practice, Coach. She can do it, I know she can, and--\n- Coach: Wait a minute, wait a minute- don't we have any other option?\n- Cindy: What option is that?\n- Coach: Well... how about a tutor? Yeah, how about us finding you a tutor for those courses? Somebody that, you know, could kind of give you what you need to pass your finals.\n- Cindy: Aw, Coach, I've gotta learn all this stuff myself. There's life after football, you know! There's a lot of competition for jobs out there when I graduate- IF I graduate!\n- Coach: (laughs) I know, Cindy. You're absolutely right- I just don't want to lose you right before the tournament. You've worked so hard to get this far- and so have all your teammates.\n- Cindy: Yeah. That's why I feel so bad about this. But I need this time to study, I really do.\n- Coach: I know I'm just clutching at straws now, but how about this, then?- I let you work Marly into your position in A Squad this week, and then you take the next two weeks completely off from practice, study hard, and- when's your first exam?\n- Cindy: Uh... Economics is first. March 30th.\n- Coach: OK, you take all the time off you need until then, and if you pass that exam, come back for the first round of the tournament at least, OK? That's the big one. If we can get past SFU, then confidence will carry us along from there. And we'll also have time then to reassess your situation. Deal?\n- Cindy: Can't make a deal yet, Coach, I just can't. Let me sleep on it, will you? Let me look at my schedule and try to figure this all out, and then I'll get back to you. I promise.\n- Coach: And think about that tutor, too. We'll get you one of those too, if you think it will help. I don't want to jeopardize your career any more than you do, and grades come first in my books, too.\n- Cindy: Thanks, really- I feel like you're taking real good care of me.\n- Coach: Yeah, well, just take your time- you gotta do what you gotta do. But think it over. You're going to leave a big hole in the offense if you take off.\n- Cindy: Thanks. Anyway, I'll be in tomorrow afternoon for more of your torture. Right now I gotta take a shower and get out of here.\n- Coach: Good. No partying tonight, you hear?\n- Cindy: Got you, Coach. G'night.",

I think I left a book in this carrel last night. Could you just take a look in the shelf for me?\n- L: Sure. What's the title?\n- J: Uh...\"Fundamentals of Bioengineering\" or something like that- I forget the exact title. (laughs) That's why I need it! It's a sort of green paperback.\n- L: Huh. Looks like a couple of other folks've left their books in here, too. Why don't they put them back where they got them when they're through, anyway?\n- J: Probably just forgot, like me. It's easy to forget a book in there after you've been sitting here going through books for three or four hours at night.\n- L: Yeah, I guess. I've done that, too. (laughs) How about, um, \"Engineering Basics\"? Is this it? It's not green, though. It's kind of, uh, turquoise?\n- J: Huh! That's kind of eerie, isn't it? That's really pretty close. No, not mine. Nothing else there?\n- L: Nope. Just a couple of works on Anglo-Saxon grammar. Want those?\n- J: (laughs) I don't think so! I probably need one on English grammar, though. My paper on GM is not organized very well.\n- L: GM? General Motors?\n- J: (laughs) No. Gene modification. It's due next Tuesday and I'm barely half-finished. And I need that book to check the pagination- I'm including some quotes out of it.\n- L: Well, sorry I can't help- it's just not here. Did you check the stacks?\n- J: Yeah, 'cause I thought at first I'd put it back. But it's not where it's supposed to be, at least.\n- L: Maybe somebody else's got it then. Somebody from your class maybe?\n- J: Yeah, maybe. We've all got papers due.\n- L: Did you check at the desk? They can tell you if it's been checked out.\n- J: No- it can't be checked out. Our prof put it on reserve until the end of the term. Too many people might need to use it.\n- L: And there's only one copy? That's pretty rough.\n- J: Yup, I think so. Or... no- actually, I have no idea. I just presumed there was. I'll go check the catalogue!\n- L: Yeah- there might be another one in the Science Reading Room or the Medical Library. You know the author?\n- J: Uh.... Jamison, or um, Jamiston. Why?\n- L: Because I can search it for you right now- Google Scholar.\n- J: Huh?\n- L: Yeah, haven't your heard? University Libraries has linked up with Google's search of library holdings all over the world\n- J: Wow!\n- L: Just a sec. Jamison?....And the title's something about bioengineering, so keyword 'bioengineering'... and- voila! \"Jamison, H.J., Fundamental Concepts of Bioengineering\"- is that it?\n- J: Oh, yes! Great!\n- L: And...lessee... Tennyson University....yes, here we are: Main Library- and Medical Research Library! They've got a copy there, too, it says.\n- J: That is really great! Thanks so much for your help. I'm sorry I took up so much of your time. I really appreciate this.\n- L: My pleasure. It's my major.\n- J: Huh?\n- L: Library Science. You just gave me a little practicum\n- J: (laughs) Well, glad to help, then. I've got to go! The Medical Library closes for the weekend Saturday afternoon.\n- L: Better run, then!\n- J: Thanks again!

Doesn't your mother complain?\nE: Every time. She says I double the water bill.\n- I can believe it.\nE: But a shower doesn't use nearly as much water as taking a bath does. 'Course, you wouldn't know- you don't use either one.\n- Haw! You'd know if I didn't. You wouldn't be able to breathe in here right now. What's the occasion?\nE: It's Rush Week, my man. I've got a fraternity to check out tonight. Omega Theta.\n- Omega Theta? Really? They rushed you? That's a feather in your cap- Everybodys says they're really cool.\nE: Yeah, they are. But they've also got a good reputation for academics, too. They've got the highest GPA on Fraternity Row..\n- Hmm- that means you're gonna have to keep up your average, too.\nE: Yeah, but I figure that'll be easier to do with a little help from some Omega Theta friends.\n- You've got friends there?\nE: I will if I join. They've got a pretty strict study regimen: everyone gets assigned a tutor- an upper-class brother- kind of an academic buddy system. They say it works good.\n- Sounds good if you need that.\nE: And I do. I'm not a self-starter at all. Left to myself, I tend to fiddle around and get nothing done.\n- Me too, I guess- if I go to the library or the coffee shop to study, I do better, but if I sit around here, I just dawdle. I listen to music or pick at the guitar or, uh, anything to avoid getting down to my assignments.\nE: That's why I think Omega Theta is a good idea.\n- But what about the really important stuff?\nE: Huh? What's that?\n- Their parties! They don't have much of a rep as a party house.\nE: No, they don't.\n- Well? Isn't that the main reason for joining a fraternity- to party and meet girls?\nE: (laughs) For some guys, I guess so, yes. I like to party too, but not every weekend like the Delta Taus do. Now, that's a real animal house- talk about reputation!\n- Yeah, probably a little much for me, too, when I think about it. We gotta stay a bit serious, after all- we've gotta find jobs when we leave here!\nE: Anyway, Omega Theta does throw a good party or two along the way, just before Christmas and Easter break- and at Halloween, of course.\n- Oh boy! I hope you'll invite me to that one! I love Halloween parties!\nE: Sure, if I can- but I haven't even been invited to join yet.\n- Oh yeah, I forgot. Well, I want to hear how it goes tonight.\nE: You bet. Reception's at six-thirty, dinner's at seven. There'll be some talking and a tour of the house and some one-on-one. No alcohol, I think. So I should be back here by nine-thirty or ten at the latest. Then I'll spill all.\n- Hey! I just thought of something! If you join Omega Theta and move into their house, what am I gonna do for a roommate?\nE: No, no, you're stuck with me for a while yet in any case. They don't have freshman residents, just upper classmen., and not a lot of those. It's not a big house.\n- How many are staying there anyway?\nE: I dunno- about a dozen or so, I think. I think they've got five or six bedrooms. Everybody else is in the dorms or off campus. But they've got a big hall that'll hold thirty or forty brothers for meetings and cram sessions and things.\n- Huh! Well, I don't want to hold you up. It's almost six o'clock now.\nE: What? Yipes! I gotta go get dressed and get outta here!\n- I'll leave you to it. I'm going over to the Campus Club and see if there's a good movie on.\nE: Don't you have anything better to do?\n- Naw. No one's rushing me tonight. Maybe it's the garlic I ate at lunch.\nE: (laughs) Couldn't be your personality, could it?\n- Thanks. You're my pal, too. Lock the door when you leave, will you?\nE: Yep. See you about ten?\n- If the movie's over. If there is one. Otherwise, I'll just be hanging out back here.\nE: OK. See you later.\n- See you. Have fun!",

        "transcript": "- Listen to two seminar classmates discussing their classwork.\n- Colleen: Ah, there you are. Hi, Jared.\n- Jared: Hi, Colleen. You still got time?\n- C: Yes, I've got almost an hour. My next class isn't until three-thirty. That should be enough time, shouldn't it? We haven't got that much to decide now.\n- J: Depends how it goes. We've got our topic, but we haven't divided up the workload yet. And we haven't even discussed how to approach it, really.\n- C: I thought one of us was going to take the coelenterates and the other was going to do the sponges. Seems pretty simple.\n- J: Yeah, well, that's fine for the basic research, but don't forget that we've got to make the presentation together. We can't just be 'stings' and 'squirts', like Laurel and Hardy. We're going to have to field questions from the rest of the seminar- and from Doctor Mankiewicz, too!\n- C: Yeah, and they can be brutal! So?\n- J: So- we both have to have a pretty good grasp of the whole thing, the overall picture. Don't forget that the key word is 'comparative'- 'A Comparison of the Adaptive Evolution of the Coelenterata and Porifera'. It's not just how jellyfish've evolved and how sponges've evolved, but a, an analysis of their comparative success.\n- C: So I guess we need to get together and really look at that together, don't we?\n- J: Yes, we sure do. And it's going to take some thinking, because I don't think we're going to find all that much material on this idea.\n- C: There're whole books on invertebrate evolution....\n- J: Yeah, but each phylum is kind of looked at independently, you know- at least they are in the texts I've been looking through.\n- C: Which are?\n- J: Hyman's 'Invertebrates'. McEdward's 'Ecology of Marine Invertebrates'. McEdward's really good- he's got a lot of fascinating examples- but he doesn't really look at one phylum versus another in term of relative, uh, relative success. He just marvels at their individual, uh, creativity.\n- C: Well, that's good stuff....\n- J: But we're gonna have to take it a step further than that.\n- C: Well, look- we're still beginning with each of us researching a phylum, aren't we?\n- J: Yes, yes, that's still a good starting point for sure, but-\n- C: I know, so let's get going on that then, learn something about these critters, and then try to put it together after we've got an idea what we're talking about. We've got six weeks to do this thing, so why don't we, well, bulldoze our way through this first part in, say, two weeks? And then plan to get together a lot after that to intercalate what we've found out. And get some original ideas.\n- J: Yeah, OK. We can, like, mini-present to each other and see what angles we can come up with. Put four weeks into that, and we might have something.\n- C: So, what do you like?\n- J: Huh? What do I what?\n- C: Which ones you want- sponges or jellyfish?\n- J: Oh. Yeah. Huh! Y'know, they're actually both very intriguing. Amazing beasts. Frankly, though, the coelenterates look pretty daunting- there's such a, you know, range of forms and behaviour. The sponges seem much more manageable. But what about you?- I'm easy, really.\n- C: Ha! That's funny- to me, the Porifera seem kind of boring. They're so, so...sessile. They just sit there and filter. They remind me of my grandfather. (Laughs)\n- J: (Laughs) I like that. Stick it in the presentation!\n- C: Maybe. Anyway, I'll be happy to take the jellyfish- they interest me much more.\n- J: OK. Say, this is working out well so far.\n- C: Yeah, but the hard part comes later. So, shall we look at our schedules and see if we can arrange a regular time to meet?\n- J: Uh, sure. Once a week?\n- C: For now, yeah, that's enough, I guess.\n- J: Well, how about this time?\n- C: Um....yeah, that'll be good for me. So... Tuesdays at one p.m.?\n- J: Fine. Uh...here?\n- C: This'll be OK, I think. Not too noisy after lunch hour.\n- J: All right, then I'll see you next week, on the seventh. No! I'll see you in the seminar on Thursday, won't I? (Laughs)\n- C: (Laughs) Yep. Gotta go.\n- J: Right. Thanks. Later.",

I haven't seen you in quite a while, have I? How can I help you?\n- L: Well...if you have a few minutes... I need you to help me sort out my credit hours. It's kind of an, uh, an emergency.\n- C: OK, sit down. I've got a few minutes right now.\n- L: Thanks very much.\n- C: So, what's the problem with your credit hours?\n- L: Well...um...I think I may not have the right ones. The ones I need to graduate, I mean.\n- C: What's your major again? Business Management?\n- L: Yeah, it's supposed to be. For Bus Ad, I still need to take Global Economics- EC 303- and, well, I've got room for it in my schedule but, erm...303's got a prerequisite, which I, uh, I haven't taken. EC 203, Econometrics.\n- C: Oh, that's just great. How did you manage that, Lisle?\n- L: Not paying attention. I didn't notice until now that I needed 303 to graduate, and didn't notice before that I needed 203 before. Is there anything I can do now to fix this?\n- C: Well, I'm not sure. It's possible that the dean would let you take them concurrently. It's been done before, in extremis.\n- L: Well, that's what I'm in- extremis. The last term before graduation and I'm stuck. Do you think he would, really?\n- C: It's possible, if your grades are good enough and everything else is in order. Are they? Is it?\n- L: Oh, yeah! My GPA's three point seven. And I've got all the other required credits, and then some- I've actually taken more electives than I need to.\n- C: Hmm. Too many electives and missed a prerequisite. Good work, Lisle.\n- L: Yeah, pretty dumb, eh?\n- C: OK, well- they're both offered this term, I hope?\n- L: Oh yes. Global Economics is Tuesday-Thursdays at three pm and Econometrics is the same days at eleven in the morning. Those would work fine, except, uh....\n- C: Except what?\n- L: Except I've already signed up for the second half of my statistics course- Stats 202- at eleven.\n- C: Is that a required course?\n- L: No, but it's highly recommended for business majors. And I really need that math. Math is my weak point, I'm afraid, and I'm going to use a lot of it if I go into finance like I want to.\n- C: Lisle, do you know what, um, Econometrics is?\n- L: Sure! Uh... I guess- what? It's, uh, \"measuring economies\"- \"econo-\" plus \"-metrics\"- isn't it?\n- C: It's math, Lisle. Statistics. It's a course in the kinds of statistics used in business, finance, and economics.\n- L: Oh!... Oh... so maybe I don't need Stats 202 then?\n- C: That's right. Bus Ad makes sure you get the necessary math by requiring Econometrics. But- you've taken Statistics 201 already?\n- L: Yes.\n- C: Hmm. Listen- there may be another solution to this. The dean might accept Stats 201-202 in place of Econometrics.\n- L: Really? That'd be great!\n- C: He might. Anyway, I'm going to have to call his office about this- about both possibilities- right away. Let me just see what they say. If you had a choice, which option would it be?\n- L: Uh... well, unless they really want me to take Econometrics, I think it would be easier if I completed the second half of my statistics course. I mean, then I'd have the whole course under my belt. But whatever the dean wants- I'm happy to do whatever it takes to graduate on time.\n- C: OK, good. Well, with two options, he may be more amenable to exempting you from the prerequisite. Can you bring me a copy of your transcript later today?\n- L: I've got one right here, Mrs Morgan. Here you go.\n- C: Ah. Mmm. Yes. it does look good, Lisle- three point seven and a good scattering of 'A's, too! OK. I'll arrange to see the dean as soon as I can- if not today, then tomorrow morning, I hope. And we'll try to get this straightened out for you. Stop by tomorrow afternoon about three, will you?\n- L: Sure! And thanks. Thank you very much.\n- C: OK. And don't worry too much. The dean can be quite flexible in a good cause. See you tomorrow, then.\n- L: Thanks so much, Mrs Morgan. See you tomorrow afternoon at three.",

I'm supposed to get hydrogen gas, but I don't seem to be getting anything except air.\nP: How are you supposed to tell?\n- Well, hydrogen gas should explode when I hold this burning splint up to the test tube- but... nothing happens, see?\nP: Hmm. Very unimpressive. How do you do this experiment, again?\n- Well, I put some hydrochloric acid into this test tube here. And then I add a piece of zinc metal to it. A reaction takes place and hydrogen gas is produced- it says- which should come out of the glass tubing, over here, and go into this other test tube. But it doesn't.\nP: Nothing happens?\n- Well, something happens. The zinc bubbles and bounces around- the acid does something to it. Some gas must be coming off, I guess, but it isn't flammable. It doesn't burn at all.\nP: Is there any way else to identify hydrogen?\n- Not that I 've learned. It's completely colorless and tasteless, I know- it just burns very dramatically.\nP: Huh. Well, I dunno. Shall we run through your experiment again together and see how it goes?\n- Sure, if you don't mind- that would be great! I'm sure I'm doing everything right, I've gone through it twice now, but I still get nothing, nada.\nP: OK. Lessee.... We need what? Clean test tubes? Two of 'em? Here we are. And... a rubber stopper with ten centimeters or so of glass tubing through it... right...uh...here. That's it?\n- Yep. And a graduated cylinder and the Bunsen burner. And the zinc and the acid.\nP: All right: let's do this first- let's take the zinc and the HCl from different sources- from, uh, those reagent bottles on that lab table over there. Maybe your bottles are contaminated or mislabeled or something.\n- Oh, good idea. Trust me to use the wrong reagents.\nP: Just a sec.... here we are... OK, now you run the experiment like you think you should, and I'll watch what you do.\n- Well, first I clamp this test tube onto its stand...like this... and put in about five milliliters of the hydrochloric acid....\nP: \"About\" five milliliters?! Isn't this a scientific laboratory?\n- All right, all right. Exactly five milliliters of HCl...like this....\nP: OK. Mmm... and....\n- Then I take a little piece of zinc metal with these tweezers, like this, and-\nP: Are they all the same size?\n- Yeah, they seem to be. It looks like they're pressed out of some kind of machine in standard bits.\nP: And add \"one\"?\n- Yeah, one. Like this. And see?- it starts to bubble!\nP: Sure does!\n- So I slap the stopper into the top of the test tube real quick, like- unh!- this....\nP: Mmm....\n- And then, I hold the other test tube under the other end of the glass tubing, here...like this, and...uh, wait until I think I've collected enough hydrogen gas to ignite, I guess. Is the Bunsen burner going?\nP: Yes, it's burning- and you also need a splint, right? Here's one. Hey! Just a minute- how in heck are you going to collect any gas like that?!\n- Like what?\nP: Like that- holding the test tube under the mouth of the tubing\n- What? Am I spilling it or something?\nP: No, no- you're losing it entirely! Hydrogen is lighter than air, Marie. It's floating UP.\n- Huh?\nP: It's floating up. It's rising from the tube mouth. It's not falling into your container. Hold it above the tube!\n- Ack! How stupid! I am so stupid. I'm never gonna pass this course. OK, OK- now...light that for me, will you?\nP: Right...here you go.\n- And.... POW! Wow, did you see that?\nP: And we've got lift off! And you've got hydrogen. Congratulations.\n- Yeah. (sighs) Thanks, Peter. Now all I gotta do is write this experiment up.\nP: No problem. So, what's your next experiment?\n- Uh, something about sodium and water.\nP: Oh no!",

Oh, I was just looking for a quiet place to study where there's no distractions.\n- P: (laughs) Well, you found the perfect spot- my empty classroom. But I guess I'm a distraction now. I left my folder of notes in here last period. Do you mind if I...?\n- J: Oh! No, no- please go ahead, Professor.\n- P: Um. Hmm.... Ah- here it is. OK. I leave you to it.\n- J: Oh, Professor....\n- P: Yes?\n- J: Would you have a minute? Could I just ask you about the comment you wrote on my last essay?\n- P: Yes, I have a few minutes now. What did I write on it?\n- J: Well, here's the essay- \"The Heights of Romanticism\"- and you wrote just the word \"vague!\" at the top beside my grade....\n- P: Oh yes. It's an interesting topic choice, Jason, but I think that maybe you, uh, bit off more than you could chew. That title covers a lot of very major English poets!\n- J: Yeah, I guess it does, doesn't it? Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Byron. You know, I felt that way too, actually, after I got started with it. But by then I was kind of trapped.\n- P: Trapped? What do you mean?\n- J: Well, I had already started research. I'd picked out some key passages from the Prelude, from Keats's odes, et cetera. I'd already learned a good bit about their personal lives- I was, you know, committed.\n- P: Well now, listen, Jason: one of the key steps in writing an essay is choosing and defining your topic at the very beginning. If you get a feeling that the theme's too broad or too narrow, or uh, too convoluted or too, um, whatever- then cut your losses right away. Abandon it and find a fresh theme. That's rule number one.\n- J: Hmm. Yeah, I guess you're right. (sighs)\n- P: And what happened here is that you were never able to get down to brass tacks. That's why I wrote \"vague\"- that was my main reaction when I got done reading your paper. You're assigned three-page essays in my class, and you chose a subject fit for a book!\n- J: (laughs) Well, could I ask you, could you give me an example, of how I could've narrowed this down to a manageable size? Should I have just chosen one poet, do you think?- say, Lord Byron?\n- P: Yes, that's a simple solution to the problem here. But with only three pages to work with, you could afford to narrow it even more- just look at \"Don Juan\" as a work, uh, symbolic of the Romantic ideal, you know.\n- J: And that would be enough?\n- P: Sure, more than enough! The narrower your topic, the more incisive you can be. You might even come up with an original idea about Byron and the Romantic Movement!\n- J: Not likely.\n- P: But see, that's wrong thinking. These essays are not just rote assignments, Jason, something you have to crank out in order to pass my course. The point is to train you to research- \"re-search\"- \"search again\"- through our literary history... and add new light on it. This is something you should be eager to do!\n- J: Yes, of course, Professor- and I am, really! But I guess sometimes they do just, well...turn into assignments. Sometimes I do forget why I' m here.\n- P: (laughs) Well, you're not the only one, I can tell you that. Actually, this was one of the better essays. At least you didn't wander off topic, or just fill the three pages with polysyllabic gobbledegook. Those are the students I really come down hard on. Look, a \"B minus\" isn't so bad, is it?\n- J: No, I guess not. I like \"A\"s better, though. (laughs) And that's what I'm trying for next time. Our next paper's on the 19th century up to World War One, right?\n- P: Yes, that's right.\n- J: I'm interested in the Symbolists, and I've been reading about Rimbaud- he's kind of seminal, isn't he?\n- P: He certainly is- and in a way Rimbaud is a topic already narrowed down for you. He has a very small opus- he stopped writing when he was 21 and ran off to become a trader in Africa.\n- J: Yes-- and I can identify! (laughs)\n- P: (laughs) Oh, no you don't! I expect good things from you- starting with your next essay. Just remember: control your topic, don't let your topic control you. You've only got three pages, so be concise, be pithy.\n- J: OK, I'll try. Thanks very much for your time, Dr Wescott. I really appreciate it.\n- P: My pleasure, Jason. See you in class.\n- J: 'Bye.",

No- actually, I'm glad you haven't run them off yet. I need to fix a typo in the original. I got the year wrong. This is 2009 now, isn't it? (laughs)\n- E: (laughs) Yes, and it has been for the last two months. Can I change it for you?\n- J: Oh, you'd better just give me back the original, Estelle. It's wrong in a couple of places, and it would be easier if I just went over it myself, I think.\n- E: All right, then... um.... Ah! Here it is.\n- J: Good. Uh...can I borrow your white-out?\n- E: Sure. Here.\n- J: Thanks. (correcting the master copy) Is the chairman coming in this morning?\n- E: He should be in about eleven. He has a meeting with the Dean first thing before that.\n- J: About budget cuts, I'll bet.\n- E: Probably. I hope I'm not one of them.\n- J: Ah, don't you worry- you're irreplaceable. You're the heart of the department.\n- E: (laughs) Well, they do successful heart transplants now.\n- J: (laughs) I suppose so, but anyway, I'm sure your job is more secure than mine. Assistant professors are a dime a dozen, and one more or less is not critical to operations- but- no secretary? We'd be in chaos in a day!\n- E: (laughs) Maybe.\n- J: Here you are. It'll be OK with the penned-in correction, I think. It doesn't need to be fancy. I only need ten copies for this class, and then I'll revise it again for next term anyway.\n- E: Whatever you say. I can do these in a minute. Shall I bring them down to your office?\n- J: Yes, that would be- oh. No. I have to run down to the reading room first, so I'll swing back and pick them up from you here.\n- E: OK then.\n- J: Oh, and while I'm thinking about it- have we still got some of those little A4 binders, the looseleaf ones?\n- E: Yes, some. How many do you need?\n- J: Oh, um... six, I think. I want to break my introductory course into modules.\n- E: Oh, just for you, then, not for all your students. Yes, we've got that many. What color would you like?\n- J: Color?\n- E: Yes. Blue? Navy? Pink?\n- J: Ack! Pink?!\n- E: Well, some people like it.\n- J: I suppose. Not me. I'll take navy if you've got six of them.\n- E: Just a minute...uh...four, five...yes, I do. Here you are.\n- J: Great! And, uh, the labels?\n- E: Oh, labels. Uh...here. And a couple of extras so you can make a mistake.\n- J: Me? A mistake? Not a chance.\n- E: Not a chance, eh? Got the year down pat now, have you?\n- J: (laughs) OK, OK. You got me. There goes your birthday rose, though.\n- E: What?! Oh, no! You really hold a grudge, don't you?\n- J: Yeah, so watch out. And could you do just one more little thing for me?\n- E: Maay-be.\n- J: Please? Could you just let me know when the chairman comes in? I need to talk to him for a minute. Just ring me- I'll be in my office from about ten-thirty till lunch time.\n- E: Yes, of course. And I'll have your copies when you come back from the reading room.\n- J: Great, thanks.

Building Q22.\n- U: Q...?\n- F: It's supposed to be behind the Flagler Arts Hall here, but there's nothing there but trees that I can see.\n- U: Can't see the forest for the trees, huh? Where'd you get that map?\n- F: Oh, it's from our orientation guide. I didn't want to carry the whole thing around with me, so I just tore out the map. (chuckles)\n- U: Huh. Good idea. Can I see?\n- F: Sure. Here. See- we're here, Circle Road, right? And here's the Arts Hall, right here, number eighteen....\n- U: Yeah...mmm....\n- F: And then Q22 is right- here. Behind it.\n- U: Yes, but...which way are we facing? Look- Circle Road curves around the Arts Hall, and we're...uh...we're here, on the left side of the building, see?\n- F: Huh? Oh...then...Q22 must be...around to the...right of the Hall from here.\n- U: C'mon, let's check. I'll go with you.\n- F: Thanks, but you don't have to....\n- U: Naw, that's OK. I'm curious.\n- F: Thanks, then.\n- U: (supposing) You're a freshman, aren't you?\n- F: How'd you guess? (laughs)\n- U: (laughs) 'Cause I was one myself a couple of years ago. I couldn't find my physics laboratory till the second week.\n- F: Really? (laughs)\n- U: Yeah, and it was in a Quonset, too.\n- F: A what?\n- U: A Quonset- a Quonset hut- that's what the 'Q' stands for. It's an old US Army hut.\n- F: An Army hut? Was this a military base before?\n- U: No. (laughs) After the Second World War, all the GIs came home, and a lot of them went back to college on the GI Bill.\n- F: What's that?\n- U: The GI Bill? Oh, the government offered returning soldiers almost a...an almost free education. And the state universities were flooded with students. They were...they suddenly needed a lot of extra classrooms and dormitory space. And the federal government responded by giving them a lot of, well, temporary structures that were no longer needed by the military. Perfect recycling, eh? And there's one now! Q22!\n- F: Wow! That's a funny-looking thing. It looks like the top half of a big sewer pipe or something.\n- U: Yep, not very elegant, I'm afraid- but very practical. And cold in the winter; the thing's poorly insulated. But they were a good quick fix to the problem of growing enrollment.\n- F: Jeez- they set these up in the fifties, and we're still using them in 2009? These things are more than fifty years old. And they're temporary?\n- U: Yeah. (laughs) But as long as they keep saving money for the university.... Oh, there's not near as many Quonsets as there used to be. SFU expanded a lot in the 1970s with the baby boomers, so they built a lot of new buildings then and got rid of a lot of the Quonsets. But there's still a few around, stuck in the bushes.\n- F: Like my music class here. Look at this thing: it's made of corrugated iron! The acoustics actually might be pretty good, though, with this arched roof.\n- U: What kind of music class?\n- F: Oh, it's part of my practicum. They put us right into the SFU student orchestra, and that practices here once a week.\n- U: A good thing they stuck you out in the woods here, then. You won't be bothering anyone with the noise.\n- F: Noise? We make byoo-ti-ful music!\n- U: What do you play?\n- F: French horn.\n- U: One of those, uh, curled things?\n- F: Yeah.\n- U: Well.... Anyplace else you've gotta find?\n- F: Nope. I'm ready for my first class now, I think. Sure is a big campus, though.\n- U: Yeah. We're a land grant college. The federal government gave it all this land in the beginning. And there's still a lot left that they haven't developed yet. The agriculture school uses it for pasture.\n- F: Pasture?\n- U: Sure- they've got livestock- cattle, horses, you know. SFU operates a farm right on campus. That's where the student cafeteria gets its fresh eggs every day. And some of its hamburger.\n- F: You're kidding.\n- U: Not at all. You'll see. Take a walk out to the south end of campus some Sunday. It's like a stroll in the country. It's great!- very relaxing after a tough exam.\n- F: Huh. OK, I will. Thanks. And thanks for your help finding the, the...what?\n- U: Quonset hut.\n- F: Oh yeah, 'quonset hut'.\n- U: No problem. See you around.\n- F: Deal.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a student and a campus patrolman\n- Patrolman: Sorry- you can't park your bike here, son.\n- Student: Huh? Why not? There's a lot of bikes already here.\n- P: Yeah, but they all got Lot H stickers.\n- S: They've got what?\n- P: Lot H stickers. Permits to park here in Lot H- see?\n- S: Oh. Well, where can I park instead?\n- P: Nowhere. You ain't got no sticker. You gotta have a permit for some parking zone before you can park that thing anywhere on campus.\n- S: Ok, then...well...can I get one today, do you think? Where do we get them?\n- P: If you got your student ID card for this term, yes, you can get one today....\n- S: Yeah, I've got that, yes....\n- P: And you can apply for it at the Campus Affairs Office.\n- S: Where's that?\n- P: Just next to the Student Union, on the west side of it.\n- S: That little brown building?\n- P: Yessir, that's it.\n- S: And- are they free?\n- P: Nope, 'fraid not.\n- S: Do you know how much they cost, then?\n- P: It depends. The main building zones are ten dollars, I think, and the outer zones are five- but you'll have to check with them.\n- S: OK. Thanks.\n- P: Sure. Say, what is that thing, anyway?\n- S: It's a Thorn Raven.\n- P: Don't look cheap.\n- S: No, it's not. I'm into touring bikes.\n- P: Well, that sure looks like a good one. Ride a lot?\n- S: Yes, you could say so. I took this one across the country.\n- P: Across America?!\n- S: Yep, Atlantic to Pacific, all the way.\n- P: Whew! How long did that take you, anyway?\n- S: Three months.\n- P: You must've been awful tired by the end.\n- S: More mentally than physically, actually. You can get used to riding the bike eight hours a day, I mean, with a comfortable seat and comfortable clothes and all- but you never stop worrying about the traffic and potholes and flat tires and your schedule and... you know. And stuck out in the desert as the sun goes down, with no motel or gas station in sight- you feel pretty lonely and, uh, vulnerable.\n- P: Huh?\n- S: Vulnerable? You know, kind of unprotected.\n- P: Ah. Yeah, I guess so, eh? But that's an exciting thing you done, son. During summer break?\n- S: Yes, last year. I'd gotten my scholarship, so I didn't need to get a job last summer, and I planned that trip instead. New York to San Francisco- crossing the continent is something I've always wanted to do. Once.\n- P: Once?\n- S: Yeah. I won't do it again.\n- P: Just too hard, huh?\n- S: Not just that. It took a lot of time and a lot of money, and I'm not going to have that kind of free time again now until I retire from work maybe. (laughs)\n- P: (laughs) Well, just stay healthy, son, and maybe you can do it again when you're 65.\n- S: Yeah, maybe. Say, do you know this town very well?\n- P: Sure do. Born here. What're you lookin' for?\n- S: Is there a good bike shop? Maybe even a Thorn dealer?\n- P: Nope, no dealer, but there's a durn good bike shop. 'S called 'Wheels Within Wheels'- downtown off Elm Street.\n- S: Elm Street? Hmm. Didn't see the shop. I was down there looking around Sunday.\n- P: Well, it's not exactly on Elm Street- it's just off it, down the alley between Oak and Maple. Y'know where the Pizza Plaza is?\n- S: Yeah.\n- P: All right, it's around that corner. It ain't big, but it's a good shop, got everything you want, I expect, or leastwise what you need. And old Buster's been fixin' bikes for almost thirty years now.\n- S: You used him?\n- P: No. No bicycle. But he's my wife's cousin. And I ain't heard a complaint against him in the last twenty years.\n- S: (laughs) Well, that's a good enough recommendation for me. I'll check him out next Sunday.\n- P: What'cha need?\n- S: Oh, now I just want to pick up a spare tube in case I get a flat tire. I don't have a spare.\n- P: Well, he's got those, sure- any size you like. Fix your own flats, do you? You must be a serious biker.\n- S: Well, I don't really like the job, but, you know, it's hard to find a repair shop sometimes, out in the middle of nowhere- and that's where I always seem to catch my flats.\n- P: (laughs) Ain't that the way!\n- S: Sure is. Well, thanks. I gotta go get that permit before the office closes, I guess.\n- P: All right. Take care, son.\n- S: You too. See you. 'Bye.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between two students.\n- Robert: Oh- hi, Cecille. What are you doing here so early?\n- Cecille: Hi, Robert. Oh, I got tired of sitting in the cafeteria, that's all. I have an hour break before this class, and I usually, uh, spend it there... but it's so noisy today! Why are you here early?\n- R: Oh, I always come in about now- it's a quiet place to go over my notes before class.\n- C: Gee, aren't you the eager beaver!\n- R: I just find it's a, a good way to review and at the same time try to keep up with, uh, with where this course is going. Cost Accounting is pretty difficult for me. Why's the cafeteria so noisy? There shouldn't be many people there at three in the afternoon. Lunch is done.\n- C: There's a sort of rally going on- for the demonstration.\n- R: Demonstration?\n- C: Yeah, Friday.\n- R: Really? Against what? What's it about?\n- C: Tuition. It's about the tuition increase.\n- R: Oh, yeah, the tuition increase. They're holding a demonstration?\n- C: You don't get around campus much, do you? They've got posters plastered up all over the place.\n- R: No, I guess I don't. I just come in for this class and for, um, Financial Management Thursday nights. I didn't think this fee rise was such a big thing, though. It seems to happen couple of years or so, regular as clockwork.\n- C: Well, I guess this one was just the last straw.\n- R: Why's that?\n- C: Because the economy's so bad. Students don't have any money. Their parents don't have any money. They just can't afford to pay any more for school right now.\n- R: I suppose that's so. I manage, but I haven't had a raise in more than four years myself.\n- C: You're working?\n- R: Yeah. That's why I'm taking only two classes. I'm a bookkeeper.\n- C: A bookkeeper? Where at?\n- R: Lightsey Furniture, downtown. I've been working there part-time since before I started Accounting School, three days a week. That's- It's enough to pay my expenses, even the tuition boost- if I'm careful with my money.\n- C: You don't have such big fees to pay, though, if you're just taking those two classes. With a full load, most of us are having to fork out close to five hundred dollars more a term!\n- R: Ouch! I'd protest at that too, I guess. Are you going?\n- C: To the demonstration? I dunno. I've been thinking about it, but, well, I'm not really one to, uh, climb on the bandwagon.\n- R: It's turning into that, is it?\n- C: Seems to be- there's a lot of people over at the cafeteria, anyway, and they seem pretty enthusiastic about this thing.\n- R: Don't you think this might be just a \"college thing\", though? Students getting riled up just for the sake of getting riled up? We're so righteous, so sensitive to injustices. UBC must have a good reason for raising its tuition, I'm sure- it's a non-profit institution, for heaven's sake!\n- C: Oh, no doubt, no doubt. Student idealism? Some of that too, I guess, but-\n- R: But- it's hard times. I get it. And how's your economy?\n- C: Oh, I'm OK. My money comes from Daddy's education trust.\n- R: Trust? You must be rich!\n- C: (laughs) I wish. No, this isn't a trust like a Rockefeller trust! This is a fancy savings account Daddy started when I was born. He put a little money into it every month, and over- what?- eighteen years, that grew to enough to get me through university. And God bless Daddy!\n- R: Amen! Good for you!\n- C: Yeah, I'm lucky- and I've got enough to finish out my last year now, no problem. But a lot of others, they're not so lucky. Some of 'em aren't going to be able to finish school- they just don't have another five hundred or a thousand dollars in their budget.\n- R: What time is that protest Friday?\n- C: I think it starts at four, why? Thinking of going?\n- R: (sighs) Yeah, I am, actually. I'd like to get a few more details first, though. Do you know where-\n- C: There's some flyers in the cafeteria and over at the Student Union, and at some other places on campus, I guess. You could pick one of those up.\n- R: Yes, I think I will. After class.\n- C: Tell you what- I'll go with you. And if you decide to participate Friday, I'll meet you there.\n- R: Or we could meet somewhere else first.\n- C: And make placards and headbands? (laughs)\n- R: (Laughs) Maybe. Anyway, it would be easier than trying to find you in the crowd. And we could plan our escape if it gets too rough.\n- C: Gee, do you think it could?\n- R: Oh, probably not. But it's better to be safe than sorry.\n- C: Yeah, I suppose so. Oh- here comes Dr Smithers.\n- R: Rats! And I never reviewed my notes. Talk to you after class.",

Caesar's for me.... Oh, hand me some, uh, oil-and-vinegar, will you?\n- A: Here. Hmm... And the lettuce looks wilted. Fruit for me, I guess.\n- B: Grapes? I thought you didn't like them.\n- A: I don't like the green ones, that's all.\n- B: Oh.\n- A: And lessee.... Today's entrees are- Salisbury steak...buffalo wings...filet of sole...and uh, veal cutlets. Hmm. I guess I'll have fish again.\n- B: Why? Low cholesterol?\n- A: No, it just looks better than the rest. Like it might be edible.\n- B: (Laughs) I see.

But I've still got to make copies of one of his paintings for the class. I thought I'd do that right after lunch- it won't take a minute.\n- A: Who've you got again?\n- B: Turner. I found a really great print of his- \"Landscape with Walton Bridges\" it's called. (To the server) Oh, thank you.\n- A: (To the server) And I'll have the sole. And fries, and, uh, succotash. (To Betty) Are you going to make color copies? They're not cheap.\n- B: Yeah, but they're worth it. \"Walton Bridges\" is really fantastic. I'll show you when we sit down.\n- A: OK.

OK, let's find a table!\n- B: Um. Oh- how about over there, by the window?\n- A: Yes, that's good. I need some table room.\n- B: What for?\n- A: Uh, well... I've still got some organizing to do. Same class.\n- B: Ah. (They sit down to eat) Who are you talking on?\n- A: Dali. Chow down!\n- B: Eh?\n- A: Salvador Dali. You know, the surrealist. The guy with the moustache.\n- B: (laughs) Oh, yeah! The guy with the moustache. Do you think he was crazy?\n- A: Crazy like a fox, maybe. He made a lot of money later on his career, cranking out trash for the most part. He put on a real, um, show, though, didn't he?\n- B: (laughs) Sure did.\n- A: But I really admire his imagination- some really wild stuff, those melted clocks and hollow beasts. Very evocative images. And actually, he did a lot of research. Do you know the story about his Corpus Hypercubus?\n- B: His what?\n- A: It's a cubist painting of the Crucifixion- you know, of Christ on the Cross.\n- B: No, what's the story?\n- A: Well, you'll have to wait for class- I'm still working on it.\n- B: Aw, c'mon!\n- A: No, I can't, really. It's about the mathematics he used, but I've gotta tell it right. And I gotta get that together right after lunch! Can I see your Turner print, though?\n- B: Oh. Yes, sure. I've got it right, um...here.\n- A: Wow.\n- B: Isn't that great? Look at that light!\n- A: It's so Italianate- the pastoral atmosphere is so thick you could cut it with a knife! Turner's so modern, isn't he? All colour and mood, and almost no form, except for these wispy trees here. Truly amazing! There's every imaginable shade of gold in there, isn't there?\n- B: Can you believe this was painted before the middle of the 19th century?\n- A: Really, eh? Are you going to eat the rest of that salad?\n- B: No, you can have it. Here. Are you going to stay here and finish your presentation?\n- A: Yeah. We've still got over an hour before class.\n- B: OK, then. I'm going to just run over to the Campus Shop and get this xeroxed and then come back. How many do I need? Ten?\n- A: Plus one for Dr Auburn- that's eleven. But if they're too expensive, I don't need one. I've seen it already.\n- B: (laughs) It's not going to break me. You get one too.

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between two university students.\nWalter: Are you going to the job fair, Zelda?\nZelda: You bet! I've gotta find work by July or August at the latest. I'm going to have no money left at all after this term. You going?\n- Yep. I don't really need to find a job right away- I can always part-time in my dad's shop- but I do have to get going on my career, eh? Or I'll end up in his workshop maybe forever.\nZ: What kind of business is it, anyway?\n- Woodworking. He makes mostly commercial stuff- store counters, shelving, barber stations, things like that, you know.\nZ: He does a good business?\n- Yes, actually. It's been growing recently, too. He's got three journeyman carpenters with him now. Business has been good.\nZ: You're not interested, though?\n- Geez...not really, no. The work's pretty boring. It's really repetitive, the same models from his catalogue over and over. I want to find something more, uh...creative, y'know.\nZ: Like what?\n- Oh, like something in, uh, interior design- or maybe in an architect's office or somewhere... I dunno.\nZ: Well, there oughtta be some companies like that at the fair. I know there're a couple of big construction firms coming.\n- Hmm. Yeah, they might have something interesting....\nZ: Still- it seems a shame, though, not to take over your father's business. Maybe you could, you know, think about expanding it, for instance. In the direction you want to go- maybe offer, um, design services? Uh, custom services?\n- Hmm. I probably could do that. Yeah. That might be an idea at that....\nZ: You could at least, you know, try it out, maybe this summer. If you don't find another job.\n- Lemme think about that. Actually, uh...erm....\nZ: What?\n- Actually, I'll tell you a, another reason I don't really want to work in my dad's place. It's a carpentry shop, right? With a lot of table saws and radial arm saws and band saws, you know? And, well, every carpenter there- Dad included- has a missing finger or two. Or three.\nZ: Huh?!\n- Yeah. The work's repetitive, like I said, eh? And if it's your job eight hours a day to run boards through a saw, and inevitably, sometimes, you lose your, uh, concentration- someone tells a joke or something, y'know- and, well...ZIP! goes your thumb through the saw with the board. Dad's missing the last two fingers of his left hand- just whacked 'em off in an instant when the phone rang once. They all try to be careful, of course, but, well, it's just, just an...occupational hazard. I work there long enough and I'm gonna lose an appendage too.\nZ: Oh wow! That's awful! I guess I wouldn't want to work there either. Ack! I can't blame you for wanting out. What's your dad think of that decision, though?\n- Oh, I dunno what he really thinks, but he's very supportive. He says I should follow by own path, wherever it leads. But I don't think he's really, y'know, attached to the business- it's just what he got into and what he knows how to do, and what he makes money at.\nZ: Is he going to retire?\n- Oh, yeah! He's looking forward to it, too. Then he can get down to this first love....\nZ: Which is...?\n- Toy soldiers. He makes them. He's got a whole army in our basement- Bengal Lancers, Soaves, Beefeaters, hussars, you name it!- he casts 'em in lead, paints 'em, puts 'em in little, uh, dioramas, you know what I mean? He's good at it, too.\nZ: Wow, what a gas!\n- Yeah. So there's no love lost between him and the workshop. He'll be glad to be done with it, I think.\nZ: OK- so you're coming to the job expo then, to find a career? When are you going?\n- Early, I guess. When does it open?\nZ: Nine-thirty.\n- That's Saturday, right?\nZ: Right. I don't suppose you've made an appointment?\n- Huh? No. Do we have to?\nZ: No, but it's a good idea if you know who you want to see. It's gonna be crowded at some of the booths- the ones for the prestige companies- and it makes a good impression if you've got one. Shows you're professional. Shows you're serious.\n- So you've got one?\nZ: Yeah, I've got appointments at ten and eleven with two engineering firms, ATC and Industrial Services.\n- Well. Hmm. I have no idea who to get an appointment with. I'll just have to look around when I get there, I guess.\nZ: Good planning, Walter. It's easy to see who's hungry for work here. Why don't you check the list of participants in the Counselling Office? You've still got time to make an appointment with one of them.\n- Ah! Yeah, OK- I'll do that. I'll go over there right now. Your enthusiasm's contagious, Zelda. Thanks.\nZ: OK- and I'll see you at the fair somewhere, I guess.\n- No, you'll see me before that- we've got Drafting class together tomorrow afternoon, remember? See you.\nZ: Oh, yeah. See you. Good luck.",

Yes, Mr Sampson, please sit down. Thank you for coming. No\n- could I just get some basic information from you first, please? Your name is, uh, Garth Sampson?\nS: Yes, that's right.\nI: S-A-M-S....\nS: No, that's S-A-M-P-S...O-N.\nI: Sorry. And you're graduating this year?\nS: Yes.\nI: And your major is...?\nS: Computer Science. I'll be getting my BSc in Computer Science.\nI: Good. This May, right?\nS: Yes, right.\nI: And your mailing address?\nS: That's Box 648 University Station, Vancouver V8G 2R9\nI: ...V8G 2R9... and your email and cellphone?\nS: GSampson@coolmail.ca....\nI: ....@coolmail.ca....\nS: ...and 090-555-6269\nI: ...6269. Great! And you're a Canadian citizen?\nS: Yes, I am.\nI: Good. OK, that's all I really need right now. Now, you said you'll be getting your bachelor's in computer science. Why did you choose that field?\nS: Oh, wow- I've never thought of any other career for myself. I've always been into computers, ever since I was in elementary school. My father bought me my first one, a used, uh, Apple MacIntosh, when I was eleven years old, and I've been sitting in front of a computer ever since. I, uh, got interested in how they work, you know, and, well, I kind of tore that old Mac SE apart circuit by circuit when it died.\nI: Oh, you have good mechanical skills, then?\nS: (laughs) No, I'm afraid not! I made a real mess of the Mac. I'm, I'm all thumbs, actually- but it satisfied my curiosity. I'm more interested in software programming now.\nI: Well, we certainly always have a need for good programmers. What programming courses have you taken here?\nS: Actually, I didn't, uh, start here at UBC. I transferred in from Corolla College. It's a community college. I took their two-year diploma in Computing. I had Visual Basic and Cobol there.\nI: How were your grades?\nS: Oh, good! Those courses were really exciting for me. I got As in both of them. And, um, then here at UBC, I've taken Oracle and C-and-C++ programming. So I think I've got a solid background in computer languages now.\nI: Have you done much programming?\nS: You mean outside the classes? Uh, well, no, I wouldn't say so, really. Just my class projects. My father was interested in building an oddsmaking program for horse racing, and I helped him put that together, but I've never down any real, um, commercial work of any kind.\nI: Horse racing? (laughs) Does it work?\nS: Well...yeah, the program runs OK. But he hasn't had much luck at the track yet. I think the problem is his input data. (laughs)\nI: (laughs) I see. Well now, at IT Solutions, we have two divisions I think you might be interested in. Our Industrial Systems Division is doing a lot of work right now in nano-programming, with a lot of potential in, uh, medicine, and also in, um, aeronautics. They're into some real cutting-edge stuff there...\nS: Gee, that sounds intriguing- capsule computers and all that, eh?\nI: Yes, that's right. And our Consumer Software Division is busy now, um, trying to get the last bugs out of our new wristband cellphone. We're about ready to hit the market with it, so there's a lot of activity going on there these days.\nS: Almost out? That's great! I've been waiting to get my hands on one of those. After all the hype, I hope we're not going to be disappointed.\nI: (laughs) No, I guarantee you won't! It's going to be a real eye-opener. And maybe we can get you involved with the next generation.\nS: Really? That would be something!\nI: But what we'd like you to do first is get your transcripts sent in to us. Here- here's my card. Just have them snailed to this address and to my attention. Oh- sorry, my name's Ed Freeberg...here.\nS: OK, sure! I'll run over to the Registrar's and have that done right away.\nI: And then we'd like you to come in to our offices sometime in the next couple of weeks to, uh, you know, just have a look around and have a chance to talk to some of the division staff and HR people. How does that sound?\nS: That sounds great, Mr Freeberg. Thank you.\nI: Good! Well, uh, what would be a good day for you, do you think?\nS: Uh...lessee... um, next Tuesday or Thursday would be real good. I've got no classes those days right now.\nI: Ah. OK then.... how about the... fifteenth, Thursday, at, say... ten o'clock?\nS: Thursday. Ten a.m. Yes, that's fine.\nI: And if you will just come to the Main Reception- here, at this address- and ask for me, that's Ed Freeberg- they'll let me know you're there, and I'll come down and get you.\nS: OK, great! I'll be there. Thank you very much.\nI: And thanks for coming in to see us. You may have a great future with IT Solutions.\nS: I hope so! (laughs) Thank you.\nI: See you next Thursday, then. Goodbye.\nS: Goodbye.",

Couldn't be that hard for you. You're an Economics major, aren't you, Rachel?\n- R: Yeah. It shouldn't be, I know, but somehow- I'm just not getting a handle on it. Too much math, I guess. I'm more of a theoretician. (laughs)\n- D: (laughs) Yeah, you and John Maynard Keynes. Rachelian Economics- where supply and demand are not inversely related.\n- R: (laughs) Anyway, I've just barely squeaked by all of her quizzes- and I only got sixty-nine percent on the midterm.\n- D: Oy! You'd better burn some midnight oil tonight, then.\n- R: Don't worry- I'm planning to. Want coffee?\n- D: No thanks. I gotta run in a minute.\n- R: How come? I thought you were all done.\n- D: I am. I want to pick up the tickets for the Homecoming game.\n- R: Haven't you done that yet? I thought you were all gung-ho for Homecoming. I hope there're still some left.\n- D: No problem.

You're on your own for this one, David.\n- D: Aw, c'mon, Rachel. It'll be fun! I'll buy you a big chrysanthemum!\n- R: Tempting, but...no. I've gotta get packed, anyway.\n- D: Packed?\n- R: I'm going home for the break- and I leave real early the next morning.\n- D: Oh. OK. Well, I guess I'll just batch it, then. That means I can drink more and make a bigger idiot of myself without you there.\n- R: Yeah, look at it that way. How'd you do on your finals, anyway?\n- D: Oh, pretty good overall, I think. I'm not too sanguine about my chances of passing Biometrics, but the others have been fine. I should get an A in Genetics, and either As or Bs in Cell Biology and Animal Behavior. Biometrics- that's been awful. It's all statistics and probabilities and variances and things. All, um, higher math!\n- R: Ha! Well, I empathize. That's my Achilles' heel, too. Numbers just don't like me.\n- D: Or you just don't like numbers. Y'know, I actually liked arithmetic when I was little. It was so logical. And algebra, geometry- I enjoyed those. No grey areas, I guess.\n- R: You probably liked playing with your compass and protractor, didn't you?\n- D: Ha! Funny you should say that. I actually impaled myself on my compass one time- horsing around at school, and I ran it right through my finger! The school nurse had to pull it out for me. Gross!\n- R: Ack! That gives me the shivers! I didn't know mathematics could be so dangerous.\n- D: Yeah. Anyway, when I got to calculus in high school, the wheels suddenly came off. I hit a brick wall, just suddenly could not understand what in heck was going on. That's the point where math and me came to a parting of the ways.\n- R: Sounds like my story- except for the puncture wound! I guess we should just keep sharp objects out of your hands, eh?\n- D: Yeah, that would be safest. How about your finals?\n- R: Oh. Yeah, they'll be all right. Micro tomorrow is my only real worry. World Economies is good- I should ace that. And maybe ace Political Systems, too- I think Dr West likes me.\n- D: Huh?! What do you mean, \"likes\" you?\n- R: No, no- I just mean that he thinks I'm an eager student, so he'll give me the, the benefit of the doubt, maybe, on my final grade. If there is any. I wrote him a real nice mid-term essay.\n- D: That thing on \"the joys of capitalism\"?\n- R: Right.\n- D: Didn't you just copy that out of Wikipedia?\n- R: Hey, hey!- I did research, yes!- and I cited every single source, thank you!\n- D: Sure you did. Oh! Gotta go. I told them I'd be stopping by at three.\n- R: OK.\n- D: Sure you don't want to come?\n- R: I'll pass.\n- D: OK then. ...I wonder... that nice blonde in my Behavior class....\n- R: Watch your mouth, buster!\n- D: (laughs) OK, OK. Next time, then.\n- R: Maybe. Bye.\n- D: Bye.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a research professor and a student.\n- Jack: I enjoyed your lecture today, Dr Beech. See you.\n- Dr Beech: Goodbye. Oh- Jack?\n- J: Yes, Professor?\n- DB: Have you got a minute?\n- J: Uh...sure. Have I done something?\n- DB: (laughs) No, Jack. Not at all. You're doing very well indeed in my class, and, uh, I've noticed that you seem particularly interested in my research....\n- J: Thanks! Yes. It seems like fun to be working with primates. They're very likeable animals, aren't they? Very gentle, very smart.\n- DB: Yes, they are, and it's nice to be able to mix business and pleasure. But they do take a lot of, well, looking after to keep them healthy and happy. I've got an assistant, Larry- you know him, I think, the student who brought Maisy and Daisy into the classroom last month?\n- J: Oh, yes, I know Larry, Larry Easton. He's getting his master's in Zoology, isn't he?\n- DB: Yes, that's right. And he's graduating in June. So I was wondering if you might be, be interested in, uh, taking over for him, taking his assistantship. Um, I don't know if you want to work, or need work, of course....\n- J: Oh! Uh- yes. Yes! That's something I would really like to do, yes. Oh. But, uh....\n- DB: But?\n- J: But...well, I guess I should find out a little bit more about it. I mean, the hours, the, um, time involved, and, and... can I do the work? I don't really know what all's involved.\n- DB: Well- have you got a little time right now?\n- J: Uh, yes- my next class's not till one. Sure.\n- DB: Good. Let's just sit down here then, shall we?\n- J: OK.\n- DB: Now, it's not a very romantic job, I'm afraid, Jack. My research assistant is mostly in charge of maintaining the laboratory animals- preparing their food, cleaning their quarters, uh, feeding and watering them, of course, and, uh, just keeping an eye on things, you know- making sure they're healthy and comfortable.\n- J: How many primates do you have in the lab?\n- DB: Twelve right now. There are ten bushbabies and two aye-ayes. The aye-aye pair are in one of the big cages, and the bushbabies are in the other two. One has a family in it- the mother and father and two babies- and the other group are unpaired juveniles, including Maisy and Daisy.\n- J: Ah.\n- DB: Oh, and there's a smaller cage with Max, the old male I started with. He's the only one you have to be careful of.\n- J: Careful of? Why?\n- DB: He bites sometimes. You can go right into the other cages, though. They're all quite friendly- sometimes too friendly. (laughs) Until you get the food set out, they'll be all over you looking for it.\n- J: Well gosh, it sounds easy enough, I suppose. I've had enough mice, hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbits over the years to know how to take care of mammals pretty well, I think. At least basically. I wanted a capuchin monkey when I was in high school, but Mother drew the line at that.\n- DB: (laughs) Well, mothers can be that way. Mine still doesn't understand how her daughter can handle \"wild varmints\". (laughs)\n- J: (laughs) What do they eat, anyway? Fruit?\n- DB: Yes, fruits, mostly- apples, grapes, pears- and also some vegetables. Lettuce, uh, carrots... we try different things sometimes. And they get mealworms for snacks. Part of your job will be to pick up the fruit and vegetables from Campus Stores- I have a standing order there- twice a week. And then you chop some of them up every morning for their rations. Larry'll show you how to do it.\n- J: And...mealworms?\n- DB: Yes, we have a couple of trays of them in the lab. You'll need to tend them, too, and sift out a few dozen every day for the bushbabies. It's easy. It only takes a few minutes.\n- J: What kind of hours are we talking about, Professor? And when during the day?\n- DB: Well, student assistantships are limited to fifteen hours a week- university regulations. The animals have to be tended every day, of course, but I'll be responsible for Sundays and holidays. The main thing is that you'll have to come in before classes, in the early morning, say about seven or seven-thirty, and, uh, spend an hour or an hour-and-a-half cleaning the cages- throwing out the old straw and laying down fresh straw, uh, washing the food bowls and giving them fresh water. And then preparing their food and giving it to them. It's a simple routine, really, when you get used to it.\n- J: OK.\n- DB: And then, I'd like you to be sure to stop by again in the late afternoons or early evenings- sometime between, oh, four and seven?- to check them, check their water, and give them a bit more fruit and their mealworms. Would you be able to do all that?\n- J: Sure, that sounds fine. My class load's not so heavy now that I'm in third year. I'm sure I can arrange my class schedule around that. Oh. Uh...can I ask how much it, um, pays?\n- DB: Oh! Sorry, Jack- of course! Fifteen dollars an hour- $225 a week. The university will withhold some for taxes and issue you a check at the end of each month. It should be for about $850, I think. But you can ask Larry.\n- J: Gee, that's fine, Dr Beech. That'll help me out a lot with my expenses. And I'm going to love getting to know your bushbabies- and aye-ayes, wow!- better. Will I have a chance, do you think, to, uh, help with your research?\n- DB: Yes, there's certainly a good chance of that, yes, if you want to. I'd be happy to have you get involved. We have a lot to learn from these \"varmints\".\n- J: (laughs) Great!\n- DB: OK then- I'll talk to Larry, and we'll see when we can get together, the three of us, and set up some time for you to start learning the routine. And I'll get the paperwork rolling tomorrow.\n- J: Thanks very much, Professor. Thank you for thinking of me.\n- DB: And thank you, Jack. I know I'll be able to rely on you. Taking care of animals requires a strong sense of responsibility, and I think you've got that. Next class, we'll set up a meeting time, OK?\n- J: OK. Thanks again! See you.\n- DB: See you, Jack.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between two university students.\n- Lil: Hey- welcome back!\n- Forrest: Hi, Lil.\n- L: How was your holiday? Did you go home?\n- F: Yeah. How about you?\n- L: No! It was Spring Break- I went to Fort Lauderdale. I love it there during Spring Break.\n- F: Oh, yeah- I see you got a tan. How was it? Isn't it awful crowded there?\n- L: Yep- that's what's so great about it- it's one big crowded party. It's a blast!\n- F: Who'd you go with?\n- L: My roommate, and two other girls in the dorm. We drove down. One of them has a car. It's a real old clunker, but it got us there and back OK.\n- F: Where'd you stay? In the car? I hear rooms are impossible to get down there during Break.\n- L: No- we just found a Motel Six up the coast about twenty miles and stayed there. Then we drove down to Lauderdale in the morning and back at night. You can park anywhere along the beach. The only problem was choosing our, um, designated driver each time. Nobody wanted the job.\n- F: I guess not! What'd you do, rotate?\n- L: We tried to, but my roommate met a guy she liked, and she kind of dropped out of the schedule, you know. And then one afternoon we all got separated. When we finally met up back at the car, it was 'way past midnight, and nobody was in any condition to drive. So we just stayed there all night and danced on the beach.\n- F: Sounds like you had fun. Nobody got in trouble?\n- L: Well, we didn't. The police had their hands full, though- like they do every year, I guess. There's always somebody who ends up drunk and disorderly.\n- F: Yeah. And what about your assignment for this class? Did you get it done?\n- L: I did. I wrote it in the car on the way back yesterday.\n- F: In the car?! With three tired, sunburnt, giddy girls?\n- L: Yup. They did all the driving, and I sat in the back and wrote. That was the deal I made with my roomie- I told her I'd go if she'd promise me at least, at least two or three hours to myself to get my work done.\n- F: That was \"time to yourself\"?\n- L: Yeah, I had the whole back seat. (laughs)\n- F: (laughs) But what about your research, your, uh, references? I don't suppose you had a library in the back seat, did you?\n- L: (laughs) Yeah- it was a bookmobile. (laughs) No, I got an early start. I did my research before I left and then took a bunch of notes with me. And I carried along a couple of the, uh, most important reference books.\n- F: How'd your paper come out? OK?\n- L: Pretty good, if I do say so myself. I'm pretty happy with it. I had to go to the library last night to pick up a couple of missing, you know, citations, but that didn't take long. And I got it typed up and printed out this morning.\n- F: Hot off the presses, eh?\n- L: Yep. Just in time. How's yours?\n- F: Yeah, I'm happy with mine, too. I tried to get it done at home- I wasn't gallivanting around like you were- but my folks always had something they wanted me to do. Dad wanted me to come down to the shop and look at the new equipment he installed. Or, uh, Mom'd ask me to go into the garden and pick spinach or something for dinner or come with her to say \"hello\" to the neighbors or something.\n- L: Family can keep your hopping. Sounds about like my folks, too. I probably got more rest in Lauderdale than I would've at home.\n- F: (laughs) I don't think so!\n- L: I got my paper written, didn't I?\n- F: Yeah, OK. Point taken. And then, and then, my brother and his family showed up, and it turned into a grand reunion. So I didn't get as much done as I thought I could.\n- L: Too bad.\n- F: So then I came back here a day early and spent it in the library stacks wrapping things up. That was nice. It was real quiet around here. The stacks were empty, so I could really concentrate. Nobody to bother me.\n- L: Who'd bother you, anyway?\n- F: Well, no one to chat with, I mean. I tend to, uh, get into conversations a lot when I should be studying.\n- L: Probably an avoidance reaction.\n- F: What's that, your psychology again?\n- L: Almost. Animal behavior. We're just animals, you know, and we usually behave like them.\n- F: Yeah, social animals\n- L: Well, we'd better stop socializing. Here comes the Prof.",

Now, I've tried to explain what I want you all to do several times now, but nobody seems to get it. I guess I'm a failure as a teacher.\n- S: (laughs) I don't think so. But, I'm sorry- would you mind trying one more time with me? I understand that you want to see a clear, efficient development of the thesis and all that, and I thought I'd done that this time, I really did.\n- P: Have you got your paper with you?\n- S: Yes...here it is...right here.\n- P: Let me have a look.\n- S: Sure! Here.\n- P: Mmm...yes...I remember now. Actually, Michelle, you have a very good thesis here. I like it. I just wish you could've presented it more effectively.\n- S: In what, in what way?\n- P: Well...just look at your opening sentence. This is the first sentence that the reader meets. \"Most authorities consider the zygote the initiation of a new existence.\" Now tell me, Michelle, if the average person picked this up and started reading it, would they understand that?\n- S: Well, um...I hope so. I mean, I presume so- that's what I presumed when I wrote it, of course.\n- P: Of course. It seems short and direct. But you must remember that when you wrote this, you had been reading and researching your topic beforehand- I hope- but the reader is coming to this cold. How many people know what a zygote is? How self-evident is the meaning of \"a new existence\"? That's a very abstract phrase.\n- S: Yeah, I guess so.\n- P: Michelle, the writer's first duty is to his readership and his second duty is to his thesis. Think of all the articles you've read that've been built on flimsy arguments, misconceptions or untruths, and yet have become widely popular, have enjoyed wide acceptance because of the writer's talent at communicating.\n- S: Yeah, there're a lot of those. You want us to write like that?\n- P: (laughs) Well, I certainly don't want you to be promulgating untruths- that's what I hope I'm helping my students avoid- but it would be worth your while to notice how some of those writers do it. The key to effective writing is \"Know thy readership\"- assess your reader accurately.\n- S: What they know, right?\n- P: Exactly! What they know... and what they don't know. If you talk down to them, they feel insulted. They say to themselves, \"Does he think I'm stupid or something?\" And they walk away.\n- S: Well, I don't think that, that's for sure.\n- P: Maybe not, but your opening sentence borders on the other extreme- if you expect too much of your readers, you'll also put them off. They'll say to themselves, \"Who does he think I am, Einstein?\" And again, they'll walk away.\n- S: Well, um...so, what should I do, for instance, with this first sentence here? I can't make the grammar any simpler, can I?\n- P: No, but you can certainly tone down the vocabulary. Either that or define difficult or arcane words when you use them. But that usually slows things down. Anyway, you have to bring yourself and the reader to the same level somehow- that's what you should always be shooting for.\n- S: So... I should define 'zygote' right off the bat- \"...a zygote, or fertilized egg,....\"\n- P: That's the idea...but keep it short, or you'll lose the effectiveness of your opening. Why not just go ahead and use 'egg'? Then you can introduce the more, uh, precise scientific term later in the paragraph.\n- S: Just \"An egg is...\"?\n- P: Sure. It's strong and clear, which is just what you want in order to interest your reader. You have a whole essay to be more precise in, to get down to the details.\n- S: Then what about the rest? You said that \"initiation of a new existence\" is too, um, too....\n- P: Too abstract. OK, just tell me this: what do you mean by that phrase?\n- S: Well, uh... it means, um, the start of a new life, a new living thing....\n- P: Good! Well, why didn't you say that in the first place? That's much more direct and attention-getting. It's expressed in a way that anyone can understand. \"An egg is the start- or the beginning- of a new life\".\n- S: But...does that sound, well...formal enough, Professor?\n- P: Don't confuse formality with obfuscation, Michelle. You don't have to write densely to be formal- and lord knows you don't have to use big words! You just need to avoid slang and, uh, casual language. And be sure that the grammar is standard. Write clearly, simply, directly- that's what makes a good essay.\n- S: OK. Maybe I've just gotten a better idea of what you're looking for now. \"Clear, simple, direct.\" I'll remember that next time.\n- P: Good. And I'll be looking forward to how well you succeed. I'm not averse to giving A grades if they're deserved, you know.\n- S: Thanks for your time, Professor. I really appreciate your help.\n- P: Not at all, Michelle. That's what I'm hear for. See you in class.\n- S: See you.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between two university students who met on campus.\n- Surveyor: Excuse me....\n- Junior: Yes?\n- S: Hello. I'm, uh, I'm taking a student survey as a part of my Sociology course, and, um, I wonder if I could ask you a few questions?\n- J: Uh... well- how long will it take?\n- S: Oh, only about three minutes. Do you have time?\n- J: Hmm. Yes, I guess so. Only three minutes, eh?\n- S: Yes, and it's anonymous. I only need to ask your age, sex, and, um, university year.\n- J: OK. Sure. Go ahead.\n- S: Thanks. (recites) This is a student survey in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Sociology 117. No identifying information will be collected. This survey constitutes research data for the topic \"The Relation of Student Alcohol Consumption to Student Attendance and Grade Point Average\". It will take approximately three minutes to complete. My name is Nancy Puzzio. Question one: What is your age?\n- J: I'm, uh, nineteen.\n- S: And you're male.\n- J: Last time I looked, yes.\n- S: And your year at BSU?\n- J: Third year. I graduate at the end of next academic year.\n- S: Thank you. Now, the legal drinking age in this state is eighteen. Do you drink alcohol at all?\n- J: Uh, yes, I do. Sometimes.\n- S: And have you been drinking alcohol since you turned eighteen, the legal drinking age?\n- J: Yes- I started on my eighteenth birthday, as a matter of fact.\n- S: How often do you consume alcoholic beverages?\n- J: Oh, um...it's hard to say....\n- S: Do you consume some quantity every day?\n- J: Huh? Oh, no. No- maybe once or twice a week, average.\n- S: And what is your beverage of choice?\n- J: Oh, I drink beer usually. Occasionally wine. I don't like, uh, um, hard liquor.\n- S: How many pints of beer do you consume in one drinking session?\n- J: \"Drinking session\"? I don't get sloshed every time I drink!\n- S: No, \"session\" just means \"occasion\" or \"instance\"- it's a research term.\n- J: Oh, I see. Uh... two, three pints maybe.\n- S: Once or twice a week?\n- J: Yes, that's right.\n- S: And would that be on regular days- weekends, for example?\n- J: Yes, that's right. Friday night, or Saturday night. Sometimes both.\n- S: And for which of the following reasons would you say you primarily drink alcohol? A - stress. B - pleasure. C - socialization. D - habit?\n- J: Can I choose more than one?\n- S: Yes.\n- J: Then, I guess I'd say for pleasure, mostly, and to relieve, um, stress? Stress. For relaxation, really- after a week of classes and studying, it's relaxing.\n- S: Do you usually drink alone, or with others?\n- J: Oh. Sometimes alone. Usually with others- my roommate or classmates or somebody.\n- S: And- do you ever consume sufficient alcohol to feel its aftereffects the following day?\n- J: You mean, do I ever have a hangover? No... Well, very rarely. Sometimes after a party.\n- S: How often would you say you attend parties where alcoholic beverages are served?\n- J: Hmm. Maybe once in two or three months. Not often. Sometimes I get invited to a, a fraternity party or something, but not very often.\n- S: Has the consumption of alcohol ever affected your class attendance or your ability to study?\n- J: No.\n- S: Has the consumption of alcohol ever restricted your study or preparation time?\n- J: No, not really. Of course, I suppose I could be studying all Friday and Saturday nights, too. So in that, uh, sense, yes, I guess it does limit my studies in that way. But, uh, I think it's more important for good study habits to have that, er, relaxation time available, you know?\n- S: OK. Have your drinking habits or quantities changed significantly since you began drinking?\n- J: No, I don't think so. No.\n- S: And have your study habits or class attendance changed significantly during your time at BSU?\n- J: No, not really. I may be preparing a little more now. My courses are harder, and I'm more, well, concerned about grades now.\n- S: What is your current GPA?\n- J: Three point eight.\n- S: Oh! That's great! Well, thank you for your time. This is the end of the survey. If you're interested in the outcome of my research, I'll be, um, making it available to survey participants at the end of the semester. Here. This is my email address. Please email me if you'd like to get a copy of my survey results.\n- J: Yeah, I would, actually. This is kind of an interesting topic.\n- S: Thank you for participating. Have a nice day.\n- J: You, too. And good luck on your paper.\n- S: Thanks! 'Bye.",

I made an appointment to see you at two? I'm sorry- I'm a few minutes early....\n- P: Ah, yes. Newman. That's fine. Come in. Sit down.\n- S: Thank you, sir.\n- P: Now- what can I do for you, Newman?\n- S: Well, uh...I was wondering if it would be possible for me to audit your Advanced Communications course, um, COM 410, next term?\n- P: Hmm. I don't generally like students auditing my classes. Why can't you enroll in it?\n- S: Because I don't have the prerequisites, Doctor.\n- P: Neither 310 nor 312?\n- S: I'm afraid not. You see, I'm not in a liberal arts program at all. I'm getting my master's in Zoology.\n- P: Zoology? Huh! Why are you interested in my course, then? It's a sociology course. We deal with the, um, phenomena of international communications.\n- S: Yes, I understand that, sir. But you see, my thesis is concerned with inter-species interactions. I'm working with Doctor Schmidt and his orangutan project. He's been working on, uh, orangutan - human communications, but my own project is orang interactions with, with other primate species.\n- P: Sounds interesting. What species?\n- S: Well, right now, I'm just looking at the, uh, potential for interactions between several different primates. Besides Dr Schmidt's orangs, the Primate Lab is keeping some chimpanzees and gibbons, and several New World monkey species. At the moment, I'm trying to find out which might offer the, you know, richest activities for examination.\n- P: And how do you suppose my Advanced Communications would be of value to you?\n- S: To be honest, Doctor Isaacs, I'm not sure. I'm hoping it will come to me during the term. At the moment, I just have a, a feeling that there's going to be some parallels between human intercultural interactions and primate interspecific interactions- and that looking at cultural, um, frictions may supply clues to what I see in my research. And, uh, vice versa, of course!\n- P: I see. Well then, why can't you enroll in 310 or 312 this next term? And then take 410 after that?\n- S: Unfortunately, I don't have any classes after this term, Professor. My final six to eight months needs to be spent on active research and my thesis preparation, and then on my orals.\n- P: Hmm. You're not making it very easy for me, you know, Newman.\n- S: I'm sorry, Professor. But I am really eager to sit in on your classes. I've heard a good deal about them.\n- P: Good things, I hope.\n- S: Oh yes sir!\n- P: (laughs) Well, have you taken any sociology-related courses at all?\n- S: Hmm. Well, uh, I've had the usual ethology classes- animal behavior classes- in the Department of Zoology, of course. And when I was a sophomore, I took World Social Systems- you know, capitalism versus communism?- which is a required undergrad course. Oh, and I took a cultural awareness course as an elective- Views of Existence, I think it's called. I found that very interesting.\n- P: Yes, that's Sociology 242. Who taught that, do you remember?\n- S: Um... Oh, yes- Doctor Wright. He was good.\n- P: Ah! Josh White- yes, he's a good man. What was your grade in 242?\n- S: Oh, I got an A. I really enjoyed that subject, and Doctor Wright's a very engaging speaker.\n- P: (laughs) Yes, he is, isn't he? Let me ask you a question. Can you define \"habitus\"?\n- S: \"Habitus\"? Uh...yes, I think so. Isn't it a word referring to the common, daily, habitual practices and assumptions that we have within a given, uh, social environment? People are at the same time the, um, creators of and the, uh, product of their habitus, I think.\n- P: Yes- that's very accurate! Well, Newman, you seem to have some familiarity with this field, and I'm certainly intrigued with how you hope to, um, apply what you may learn. I like \"thinking outside of the box\" very much, and you seem to be doing that. You'll be able to attend all of the classes, I presume?\n- S: Yes, I'm sure I can. Uh- they're Thursday mornings, right? At nine thirty?\n- P: Yes, that's right. And you're welcome to join in any of the questions or discussions. You won't be taking the final exam and you won't be getting any credit hours- I hope that's clear.\n- S: Yes, of course, Professor.\n- P: And you can try your hand at my little pop quizzes if you like- I'll grade them for you. One of my small pleasures in life is seeing how poorly my students understand my quiz questions. (laughs)\n- S: Oh. (laughs) Forewarned is forearmed, I guess. So I can really audit 410?\n- P: Yes, that will be fine. If you have any further questions, please feel free to come back and see me.\n- S: Thank you very much, Professor Isaacs. I really appreciate this. It is very important to me.\n- P: My pleasure, Newman. And I would like to hear how your research is going. Have a good day.\n- S: Yes sir, of course. Thank you.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a university student and an employee in the university registrar's office.\n- S: Hi, I've got a question about registering for the special geology field seminar in spring quarter.\n- E: OK. You know that registration for that class is limited to 15 students, don't you? And that you have to have passed Geology 302 as a prerequisite?\n- S: Yes, I know. Uh, the thing is, I'm taking Geology 302 this quarter. I expect, er, I think I'll pass it no problem. I mean, I'm getting an A-minus in it so far. I really want to take the seminar next quarter. Can I register now, and still be eligible to take it when, er, if I pass 302?\n- E: Hmm...interesting question. Well, registration for spring classes does not begin for another two weeks. Technically, you're supposed to have passed 302 before you register. But what you could do is sign up for the seminar, and, um, wait and see if the class fills before your 302 grade is recorded. If the seminar doesn't fill, you'll be eligible as soon as your Geology 302 grade becomes official, and then you'd be assured of a place in the field seminar. Or, you could wait until your 302 grade is in, and then see if there are openings left for the seminar.\n- S: I see. Um, and then if I [false start] if the class is full and I can't get in, when can I, uh, when is the next chance to take it? Will it be offered in the summer? Or next fall?\n- E: That depends on the professor. Let's see...right now it's not on the summer schedule, but that could change. We don't finalize summer classes until the middle of spring term. If there are enough students who want to take it then, it might be offered. The geology seminar is not held in fall and winter terms -- at least not usually -- because it takes place in the mountains.\n- S: OK. So, uh...shoot! What can I do? You're saying that I can't register for two more weeks, right? And then if I [false start] -- when I do register, I have to wait until my 302 grade comes in? But even then I might, er, not be able to take the seminar?\n- E: Yep, you've got it! Sorry, but that's the best I can do for you.\n- S: If I don't get into the spring seminar, does my name automatically go to the top of the waiting list for the next time the class is offered?\n- E: No, I'm afraid not. You can register only during approved registration periods -- these begin, uh, one week after the end of the current term. If we let you register too far in advance, it wouldn't be fair to other students. Some classes would be full years ahead.\n- S: Yeah, I know. Thanks for your help. I really want to take that seminar this spring. Is there, uh, any other way you can think of that I could be sure of getting in?\n- E: [sighs]. Not offhand. I suppose that maybe you could talk to your Geology 302 professor, or to the professor who's going to teach the field seminar, and see if they'll pre-approve you. But the field seminar is very popular, so uh, I'm not sure if they will.\n- S: Hey, it's worth a try. Who's going to teach the field seminar?\n- E: That would be Professor Bronson. Do you know who he is? His office is in Johnson Hall, um, number 302.\n- S: I don't know him, but I have a friend who's taken his class. I'll talk to my 302 professor, and then maybe have him write a note or something that I can take to Professor Bronson. Um, thanks again for your time.\n- E: You're welcome. Good luck!",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a university student and a professor in the professor's office.\n- P: Good morning, Ms. Rosencrantz. You're here to discuss your essay? What's the problem, is your grade too high? (chuckles)\n- S: Uh (nervous laugh) yes sir. I mean no, my grade's not too high. It's, um, I was just, um, wondering...I got a B minus, and I was, I just wanted to ask why. I worked really hard on it, and I thought I'd get a, a higher grade.\n- P: I understand. And I know you worked hard on it. I could tell when I read it that you put a lot of effort into it. Sloth is a problem for some students, but not for you. Unfortunately, hard work doesn't always translate into a high mark. But, remember, a B is a pretty good grade, no?\n- S: I know, it is. But I get mostly B-plusses and A's. So, um...could you please tell me what's wrong with it, and how I can [false start] how I can improve for next time.\n- P: Absolutely. Do you have the essay with you? Let me see it (rustling paper). Well, first of all, it's creative and well written; er, I mean grammatically, there aren't many mistakes. Your thesis sentence is clearly stated, and it's in the first paragraph. Good, good. I think your greatest weakness is structure. You need to make sure that your supporting paragraphs reinforce your thesis.\n- S: Yes, I know. I tried to outline it before I wrote, and then, uh, you know, follow the outline as I wrote it. But it got kind of hard to stick to the outline.\n- P: An outline is an excellent tool. Um, the trouble with outlines sometimes is that as you write, your ideas change. Something comes to you that you didn't think of when you made your outline, or you get busy writing and find you've strayed from the outline structure. So you need to be careful not to follow your outline too rigidly. It's only a guide.\n- S: Yeah, I found that out in the third paragraph, 'cause I wanted to add some of the stuff we learned about the Renaissance. So then I went back and changed the outline, and uh, it, kind of uh...it was hard to figure out how to include all that.\n- P: That confusion shows in your paper. Remember that each sentence -- I mean paragraph -- needs to have a topic sentence, then other sentences that support it. In your third and fourth paragraphs, this doesn't seem to be the case. Here, take a look.\n- S: Oh, I see. The topic sentence mentioned changes in art, and then I started writing about changes in religion and science.\n- P: Yes, it would have been stronger to treat each of these topics with a separate paragraph. Because you strayed off track in the middle paragraphs, it took some of the punch away from your conclusion. You want to end with a bang, not a whimper. Um, another thing that lowered your mark was your bibliography section. It doesn't follow the format on the handout I gave you. Your references should be in the order they are cited in the essay. Here you list a reference that appears on page three before you list one that you cited on page two.\n- S: Oh yeah, shoot. Sorry about that.\n- P: You don't need to apologize. Just learn from your mistakes and do it correctly next time.\n- S: Yes, sir. Thank you for your help.\n- P: I'll tell you what, Ms. Rosencrantz. I wish more students were like you. You're the only one, in a class of 30, that cared enough to meet with me and challenge your grade. Congratulations! Just because you had the fortitude to do that, I'm going to change your mark from a B-minus to a B-plus.\n- S: Really! Oh thank you professor Ammons. Really, you uh, wow! That's great!",

I have a 10 o'clock appointment.\nP: Yes, Susan. Come in, sit down. What can I do for you this morning?\nS: I had a, uh, question about Tuesday's lecture on pla [false start] on plate tectonics. My notes aren't too clear. I was wondering if I could, um, ask you a little more about it.\nP: You sure can! In fact, I'm glad you're here. Remember what I said at the beginning of the term, the only bad question is the one that stays in your brain. Right?\nS: Yeah. Thank you. Uh, anyway [clears throat]. Well, I didn't quite get the differences between divergent and convergent boundaries of tectonic plates, and what happens when they crash, or uh, bump into each other.\nP: OK. You, uh, know that there are four major types of boundaries on tectonic plates, right? And when tectonic plates move and bump into, or uh, rub against each other, it creates effects on the land above, such as creating mountains, causing earthquakes, forming new continents and stuff like that. Good so far?\nS: Yeah, I understand that. That's why the Earth's topography keeps changing over time, and why North, er, South America pulled apart from Africa. Now, you said that the plates, with con, no, divergent boundaries, when they collide, one of the plates goes under the other one?\nP: No, you're mixing them up. That happens with convergent boundaries. One of the plates tends to submerge under the other one, which destroys the Earth's crust. When divergent boundaries collide, the two plates pull away from each other, which creates new crust.\nS: Oh, I see. So convergent boundaries submerge and destroy crust, and divergent boundaries pull apart and form new crust. I think I've got it.\nP: All right. So, um, let's test your knowledge. In the past few million years, the country of Saudi Arabia has separated from Africa, which has helped form the, uh, Red Sea. Is this the result of a collision between divergent or convergent boundaries?\nS: Um...that would be, uh, divergent, wouldn't it? Because Saudi Arabia is pulling away from Africa and creating something ne\n- the Red Sea.\nP: Yes, very good Susan. Now, at the border of India and Asia, there are the highest mountains on the face on the Earth, including Mt. Everest. What caused those?\nS: A convergent boundary! The plates of India and Asia collided, and one plate dove under the other one, pushing up the crust into mountains.\nP: Excellent, young lady! I think you are getting the hang of this.",

How much time do you have each week to work?\n- S: Um, I'm not sure. Maybe 10 to 20 hours...\n- A: Twenty hours? That's a lot, young lady. What class are you? And how many credits are you taking this term?\n- S: I'm a freshman, and I've got 15 credits.\n- A: In that case, I'd advise you to take baby steps while you get used to university life. Fifteen credits is a pretty full load. You've got to learn how to balance your study, work and leisure time. It's not easy.\n- S: Well, I, uh, I need money pretty badly. My parents are retired, so it was tough to find a bank that would loan us money. I don't mind working hard.\n- A: [chuckles] I'm sure you don't. But it's just as important to work smart. If you don't allow enough time to study, your grades are going to suffer. And if you don't allow enough time for social life, you're going to be pretty unhappy. Plus, you've gotta leave some time just for you -- to relax, have a date, work out, or, uh, whatever. As they say, \"All work and no play makes Jill a dull girl!\"\n- S: Yeah, that makes sense. OK. So...what do you recommend? Is there a job I can do?\n- A: Oh, we've got plenty of jobs that need doing. The trick is to find just the right one for you. Now, I would suggest something that's about six hours a week to start with. That's, say, two hours a night, three nights a week. The other thing I recommend is to get something that gives you time to study while you're working. That way you can kill two birds with one stone. Sound OK?\n- S: Yeah, that sounds great. Like, what kind of job lets me study while I work?\n- A: How about something in the library? Usually it's just assisting students with finding something. That only takes a couple of minutes. In between students, you can study. And it's a quiet environment.\n- S: OK. How much does it pay?\n- A: It pays $20 an hour, but half of that goes toward your loan. That's what this program is all about -- helping you start to pay off your debt. So if you work six hours a week, you'll pocket $60, minus taxes. It won't make you rich, but it does give you some weekend cash.\n- S: All right. Um, the library sounds fine, but could check out some other jobs before I decide?",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a university professor and a student in the professor's office.\n- P: Hi, Ms. Quinn. Come in, please. Sit down. How are you today?\n- S: I'm OK. How are you?\n- P: I'm well, thanks. And thank you for coming in. I'll try not to take too much of your time.\n- S: Oh, that's OK. Uh, thanks. Why, uh, why did you, um...\n- P: It's OK. I won't bite. I need to talk with you for a few minutes about the paper you submitted last week on bull sharks.\n- S: Uh, all right. Is there, um, something wrong with it?\n- P: Well, yes and no. First, it was well-researched, and I can tell you put a lot of time in on it. This part, for example, is informative and well-written: \"They are found cruising the shallow, warm waters of all the world's oceans. Fast, agile predators, they will eat almost anything they see, including fish, dolphins, and even other sharks. Humans are not, per se, on their menus. However, they frequent the turbid waters of estuaries and bays, and often attack people inadvertently or out of curiosity.\"\n- S: Uh, thank you. I have a feeling there's a BUT coming...\n- P: There is. The \"but\" is....this wording comes straight from an Internet web site. So does the wording of several other paragraphs in your paper. Oh, don't be surprised. We professors have ways of checking papers against the Web. There's a computer program that alerts us if something in a student's paper matches something on a web site. In this case, the alarm bells were blaring.\n- S: I know. Um, sorry...I thought you said we could use the Internet to do research for the paper. That website helped me a lot, gave me lots of information.\n- P: And it was good information, Ms. Quinn. You are allowed to use that information. The problem is, you can't simply copy it word-for-word and submit it as your own work. That's called plagiarism. It's a serious crime. In fact, it sometimes causes students to get expelled from universities.\n- S: I, uh, didn't mean...I guess, I mean, I was pressed for time, and uh...\n- P: It's OK, settle down. You're not going to get expelled. When we're in a hurry, we're all tempted to take shortcuts. The good news is, your whole paper doesn't seem to be copied, so I can tell you didn't simply lift it verbatim off the Internet. In fact, much of it is your own work. Do you know what paraphrasing is?\n- S: Yeah, it's when you say, or um write, what somebody else has said, but you say it in your own words.\n- P: Correct. It's perfectly fine to paraphrase information that you find online, or in books or magazines. It's [false start] but it's not OK to quote others' work directly in your paper, unless you, uh, credit the original source. Do you understand?\n- S: Yes. I'm sorry. Will this affect my grade?\n- P: I'll tell you what. I've highlighted the suspicious paragraphs in your paper. Let's do this. Take your paper home now, re-write all the highlighted paragraphs as paraphrases, and re-submit it a week from today. Then I'll grade it based on your revisions. Is that fair?\n- S: Yes sir. Thank you. I'll have it back to you next week, no problem!\n- P: I appreciate your coming in, Ms. Quinn. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

A lecture and a lab. So I thought I deserved a cappuccino. Or- what's that?\n- P: This? It's a macchiato.\n- Q: A what?\n- P: A macchiato. It's stronger than a cappuccino, not as strong as an espresso. The Golden Mean.\n- Q: Oh. Perhaps I'll try one of those, then. Which buttons do I push?\n- P: Haven't you got the hang of this machine yet? Let me do it for you. Here- just push the one that says 'macchiato', and the machine'll do the rest.\n- Q: Oh.... Ah, you're a mechanical genius, Frank.\n- P: (laughs) No, you're just mechanically challenged.\n- Q: Maybe. I tell my wife that, anyway. Every time she asks me to fix something around the house. It doesn't work very well, though. There we are. (He takes his coffee.)\n- P: What do you think?\n- Q: Mmm. Pretty good. Needs sugar, though. How are you plans for your sabbatical coming? When is it you leave, again?\n- P: July first. I've got to get set up on the coast as soon as possible. Migration will be underway. Some juveniles will've already left the Arctic breeding grounds by late June.\n- Q: Got everything you need?\n- P: I've made all the arrangements, yes. That's no problem. I've got my flight booked, and I found an inexpensive summer cottage right on the flats.\n- Q: And 'inexpensive' means...?\n- P: It's only two hundred bucks a week.\n- Q: On the beach? At Cape Cod? That's fantastic- how'd you manage that?\n- P: Easy- I booked it through October, and they gave me a deal. October's way past the tourist season.\n- Q: Great!\n- P: And I've got my own gear ready to go, of course- boots and rain gear and waterproof camera and waterproof pens. (laughs)\n- Q: (laughs) Expecting some wet weather?\n- P: Bound to be some. But I'm still waiting for the stuff I ordered from Scientific Supply, the stuff that's critical.\n- Q: What's that, leg rings?\n- P: Yes, leg bands, crimpers- I broke my old ones- and my new mist nets. Without them, there's no point in going- I can't catch anything...except a cold.\n- Q: Got your permit?\n- P: Oh, mine's good for five more years yet there in Massachusetts.\n- Q: Did you contact Scientific?\n- P: Yes. They shipped last week, but still no sign. I'm getting worried. I really can't delay my departure. I've got to ring for the whole season if I want to get a, a large enough sample size to be statistically, uh, significant.\n- Q: The whole migration season?\n- P: That's right. Shorebird numbers have been very low over the past ten or so years- and they're getting lower . I'll be lucky if I can net as many as a thousand or so birds altogether- and that's for all species. As it is, the only ones that should show up in significant numbers are dunlin and sanderlings.\n- Q: Why are the, the numbers down?\n- P: Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.\n- Q: Global warming?\n- P: Some ornithologists think so. The warming Arctic is affecting breeding success. Others say it's loss of feeding habitat along the migration routes. Land fills continue to devour the reed beds and mudflats all along the coast, Maine to Florida. It's awful, Frank.\n- Q: They both sound like reasonable causes. Maybe a combination of both?\n- P: Probably. To say nothing of the hungry South Americans who eat these guys.\n- Q: What? Seriously?\n- P: Well, yes- shorebirds are a delicacy where they winter. Ironic, isn't it?- they fly south to avoid freezing to death, and they get cooked instead. Out of the frying pan and into the fire. But I don't think that's a major cause, really. Environmental awarenesss is seeping southward. So I think that's a lessening problem.\n- Q: Well, I hope you get some answers this fall.\n- P: We'll get started at it, anyway. I'm recording body weight, and we should start getting some returns on the leg bands in, oh, December or January, I think.\n- Q: If your nets arrive.\n- P: Yes, if my equipment arrives. As a matter of fact, I've got to run. I want to stop by the campus post office once more before my next class, just to see if it's come in.\n- Q: Won't they ring you when it arrives?\n- P: Not the US Postal Service! I should've asked them to send it UPS. Save a nickel, spend a dollar. I should've learned that by now.\n- Q: Well, with the budgets they give us on these grants, we kind of get stuck in that mindset, don't we?\n- P: I have, anyway, I guess. Talk to you later, Charlie.\n- Q: OK. Good luck, Frank.\n- P: Thanks.",

She's still having trouble accepting his death, and what's more, she's worried about whether she can stay in school now, or whether she should forget about school now and, uh, help support her family.\nR: Oh...gosh.\nD\n- Yes. She's worried about money, and she's worried about her, uh, responsibility to her mother. She doesn't know if she can afford to continue here.\nR: Gee- none of us knew that. She doesn't talk much, you know.\nD\n- That's why I wanted to let you know. It's really private information, and maybe I shouldn't've told you, but I thought, well, maybe a word to the wise, you know, would be sufficient. You're kind of a, a social leader here, Sarah, so I thought you might- you know- spread the word. Discreetly, of course.\nR: Yes, yes- of course, Mrs Miller. I'll mention it to the others as soon as I get a chance to.\nD\n- Thank you. I know they mean no real harm, but-\nR: No, they don't. But sometimes we can be a little thoughtless, I guess. Is there anything we can do, do you think, to help Martha?\nD\n- You mean about her schooling? Well, um, I hadn't thought about that, really. There might be.\nR: I mean, maybe we could raise some money for her somehow. Oh, uh, have a sale or a benefit, or, um, find her a scholarship or something.\nD\n- Well now, that's a nice idea, Sarah! She has only one year left to graduate, doesn't she?\nR: Yes, that's right- so we only have to come up with about five thousand dollars or so, maybe.\nD\n- Ye...es- but we really ought to talk to her about this first. I don't know what she might think about that. Martha has to make her own decisions about what she wants to do with her life. She may have decided that she wants to quit school and go to work anyway.\nR: But that would be such a shame, after she's, she's come so far! And she's so bright! It would be a real waste for her to quit now.\nD\n- Well, you'd better talk to her about that.\nR: OK, I will- and straight away. Do you know if she's in now?\nD\n- I don't think so, dear. I saw her earlier and she was on her way out. She said she had some business to take care of- at the post office, I think she said.\nR: Well, that shouldn't take too long. Maybe she's back by now. I'll go and check, anyway. After I stop by a couple of other rooms, that is.\nD\n- Thanks for your help with this, Sarah. You know, I'm really going to miss you when you graduate. You've been a fine role model while you've been here- the girls all really respect you- and you've certainly been a lot of help to me.\nR: Oh, Mrs Miller, it's nothing, really. My mom just raised me right, I guess!\nD\n- She sure did, honey. Listen- after you talk to Martha and the other girls, could you stop back by and kind of, um, fill me in? Just so I know where everything stands.\nR: Sure thing, Mrs Miller. I've just got to put my groceries away. Then I'll get going on this.\nD\n- And I'll think some more about how we might be able to give Martha a hand- or at least some moral support.\nR: That'd be great. And so will I. Yes, the least we can do is be kinder and more attentive to her. See you in, um...a couple of hours, maybe?\nD\n- OK, dear- and good luck!\nR: Bye.",

        "name": "A conversation about toys",
        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation about toys.\n- Professor: Good morning, everyone. Let's settle down quickly, please. Today I would like to discuss toys.\n- S1: Toys, professor? What do toys have to do with social science; am I in the wrong class? (Laughter)\n- P: An excellent question, Mr. Herley. Let's explore this further. (Clears throat) Have any of you ever bought a toy for a child? Ms. Johnson?\n- S2: I bought a doll for my six year old niece for her birthday.\n- S1: I bought a football for my cousin, Jim.\n- P: All right. What would have happened if you gave a doll to Jim? And Ms. Johnson gave a football to her niece?\n- S1: My cousin would have been embarrassed.\n- S2: My little niece would have cried.\n- P: Why? Because society has decided what are appropriate toys for boys and girls.\n- S1: What's wrong with that?\n- P: Good question. Perhaps, fifty years ago, no one would have questioned those gifts. Those toys would have reflected the stereotypic roles of little girls growing up to become mothers. Boys were expected to play the role of a sports lover and player. If he was injured playing sports, boys were expected to \"suck it up\" and never cry.\n- Girls were expected to be \"ladies\" and certainly never sweat. (laughter)\n- P: However, in the years since then, the typical male and female roles have changed.\n- P: Let me give you an example: Three years ago, my neighbor lost his job. His wife had a high enough salary to support the family, so they decided he would stay home and be a \"house-husband\" taking care of their three small children and the housework.\n- S1: So what does that have to do with appropriate toys?\n- P: Well, he had grown-up with three older sisters and had the opportunity to play with both gender related toys. He could change diapers on a doll, or play with cars and trucks. In short, his parents did not set limitations on using gender related toys. As a result, the children were all confident in playing with dolls, trucks, cooking, cleaning, sewing or going out for sports. This confidence prepared them for adult roles.\n- S2: But that's just one example...\n- P: True. Let's discuss some others. Today single men are allowed to adopt children; Women have won medals in track and field, tennis, and swimming; Men can become nurses, women can be doctors. Roles that at one time would have been impossible. I'm sure you can think of others.\n- S1: Yeah, my sister always watched me play football and this year she decided to go out for the team. At first, she took a lot of razing, but the guys got over that when they saw how good she is.\n- P: Great!\n- S2: So, professor, you're saying that the toys kids play with have an affect on their future roles in society?\n- P: Yes. Let's discuss another example: When my grandmother was a child, the only toys for girls were baby dolls and baby buggies. Any little girl who stepped outside the perceived role of a genteel child was considered a \"Tom-boy.\" This was supposed the worst insult a girl could receive.\n- P: Then when my mother was a child, her toys were pretty much (false start) girls toys still focused on the role of a future homemaker and mother. However, boy's toys dealt with construction and exploration like playing with Lincoln logs, speed boats, cars, farm toys, tops, kites, buses, steam engines, circus toys and character toys. At the time, there were six toy companies that manufactured these toys, and only two companies that made dolls.\n- P: Now let's look at what toys were available when I was a child: Lionel trains, Candy Land, Checkers, Electric football, Erector sets, marbles, slingshots, Tonka trucks, View Master, and BB guns for the boys. For the girls there were dolls, doll houses, and stuffed animals.\n- S1: A gun was considered a toy?\n- P: Yes, it was a gun that shot small round pellets, mostly used to fire at a target.\n- P: By the time my children were born, the Barbie doll had made its appearance, almost replacing the baby type doll. Now young girls were introduced to various roles that \"Barbie\" played. She got out of the house to become a stewardess, a doctor, a NASCAR racer, a scientist and even an astronaut. Girls were beginning to realize there many career possibilities available to them.\n- P: In conclusion, throughout the years, toys had a profound effect on not only changing gender roles, but also in creating occupational roles for women.",

Oh hi, Wendy. How are you today?\n- Good, thanks. Uh...what, what're you doing in class so early? Can I...?\nA: I'm...I need to use Power Point this morning, but-- for my presentation, y'know?-- but I can't...I can't...it won't boot, and...\n- Can I help you somehow?\nA: Uh, no, I don't think so, thanks. Or...darn! Well, I've checked all the cabling here twice. See? -- it's plugged into the USB port all right...here and-- at the projector, here...\n- Yeah. Yeah, they seem OK to me too. And the AC?\nA: Oh. Yes, it's fine.\n- Yes, it's in there OK. And...you turned on the computer, didn't you?\nA: Huh? Yes. No... well, sure, but-- I just leave the power switch on all the time. Actually, I don't even remember...\n- ...where it is? Heh! It should be here, on the side...about here... Uh, no. What is this, anyway? A Sony, eh? Hmm. Maybe...yeah, here it is, over here. They always hide them, don't they?\nA: I didn't know where it was. I never use it.\n- There, it's on... No, I think I've turned it off now. There-- it's on now. It should be.\nA: All right, good...um... No, nothing.\n- It takes a minute to boot up, Anouk. At least mine does. Windows Seven?\nA: No, XP. I hear Seven is not so good.\n- Really? I think you're thinking of Vista. I've got Seven and I like it a lot. So far, anyway. I got it for Christmas.\nA: Yeah? Well, anyway, I'm sticking with Windows XP for now. I'm comfortable with it, and I've got no complaints... But I don't see it yet.\n- Nothing, eh?\nA: Nope, nothing.\n- Uh. OK, then...what else? It was working OK in your room, wasn't it?\nA: Oh yes, sure. I practiced my presentation last night, and it was running just fine. Where's that power switch again? Here?... Um. Yeah, it's on, all right. Now what?\n- And the power goes to...um...where? Oh, the outlet here on the lectern. And...\nA: Yeah, this's just how the professor sets his up. I don't get it.\n- But-- is this outlet on? I mean-- where does it plug in, anyway?\nA: Huh? I never-- ah! Down here. And-- that's it! The lectern's not plugged in! Into this floor socket, see? Damn...There, now how's that?\n- Let's see. Hang on now...There! There she is!\nA: Hey! There she is indeed! Great! Thanks, Wendy, thanks a lot. Electricity-- phooey! When are they going to make electricity wireless, anyway?\n- Can they do that?\nA: Do what?\n- Make it wireless. Give us electricity with no wires, no plugs, no extension cords.\nA: Well, I think so, yes. We can transfer electrical power by induction, can't we?\n- I dunno. What's that? What's 'induction'?\nA: Didn't you take any physics? How'd you get into this course, anyway? You remember-- magnetic fields. You remember the experiment where you use the magnet and a bunch of iron filings? The filings show the nice symmetric magnetic field around the magnet's poles?\n- Oh. Yeah. All the electrons are pointing in one direction or something, right? Just like electricity.\nA: It IS electricity, actually. That's what electricity is-- a line of flowing electrons.\n- But they don't really flow anywhere, do they?\nA: Well, no. They don't. Each electron just kind of bumps the next electron, sort of. Anyway...\n- Anyway, so...if they could make that happen efficiently, I mean, without much energy loss and, and... across long distances, then-- they could make electricity wireless, I guess.\nA: Right!...Theoretically.\n- So-- we wouldn't need batteries anymore, for one thing. No more dead batteries. No more pollution from discarded batteries-- that'd be good.\nA: Yeah-- except when you're out in the woods or somewhere. Your camping equipment, your flashlight and-- you know-- you'd be too far from an electricity source, even a wireless source. You'd need batteries.\n- Yeah, I guess. But not if we were in the city, say.\nA: No.\n- And we wouldn't need a cord that we might forget to plug in.\nA: Oh, very funny.\n- So are you all set up now? Your presentation is first, isn't it? What's it about again?\nA: Um...I call it \"Research Planning: Catching all the Details before you Start\". Guess I should pay better attention to my own presentation, shouldn't I?\n- (laughs) Maybe. Good luck with it, Anouk. I'll be rooting for you.\nA: Thanks!",

I don't have my student card with me. I can't remember my student number... seven...seven three...um.\nH\n- Oh. Well...uh, have you been here before?\nS: Um, yes. Yes, I have, actually. Last summer. I had poison ivy. (laughs) In June.\nH\n- Poison ivy? Oh dear! In June...You should have a file here already. Your name is...?\nS: Stephens. Shirley Stephens.\nH\n- OK, just a minute, Shirley. I'll see if I can find your file. That's 'Stevens' with a 'V'?\nS: No, with a 'PH'. S-T-E-P-H-E-N-S.\nH\n- OK. Um...'R'...'S'...'Stafford'...'Stephens'. Here it is. Let's see...Poison ivy rash...You were here on June 17th, and you saw Dr. Hemmings. And your student number is...7364-UC 12.\nS: ...Mmm...U - C - 12. And um...this is May 20th?\nH\n- Yes, the 20th.\nS (writing): OK. Um... OK. There you are. I guess I've...\nH\n- Yes, OK. That's good. Now, uh...in the last six months have you-- been hospitalized for any illness?\nS: No.\nH\n- Have you visited any foreign countries or received any immunizations?\nS: No. Oh, yes. I drove to Vancouver for a couple of days last Easter. Does that count? No immunizations, though.\nH\n- No, that's OK. Are you currently taking any medications?\nS: No. Are vitamins medications? And glucosamine? I take those every day.\nH\n- Glucosamine? Why are you taking that?\nS: Oh, the trainer suggested it to me.\nH\n- Trainer?\nS: Uh-huh. At the gym. I go to the campus sports centre three times a week\nH\n- Oh. Good for you. But-- ?\nS: But-- so, maybe I've been training too hard. My ankles and wrists kind of...ached. So the trainer suggested I try glucosamine. She said it was mild, that it was harmless, but it might help a bit.\nH\n- Ah.\nS: Was she wrong?\nH\n- Oh, probably not. Many athletes and older people take it. But I think we'd better write it down. We'll let the doctor decide.\nS: It's not prescription.\nH\n- I know, but we'll let the doctor decide. Better to be safe than sorry, don't you think?\nS: Yes. I suppose so.\nH\n- And, uh...Have you ever had or been treated for rheumatic fever?\nS: No.\nH\n- Heart trouble?\nS: No.\nH\n- Hepatitis A or B?\nS: No.\nH\n- HIV / AIDS?\nS: No.\nH\n- And do you smoke?\nS: No.\nH\n- Do you drink alcohol?\nS: Yes, a little.\nH\n- More than six ounces a day?\nS: No, not that much.\nH\n- OK. And uh...What are your symptoms today?\nS: Well. My stomach feels awful. Like I'm going to throw up, you know. And I, I think I've got a fever. Anyway, I feel hot. I was really sweating when I woke up this morning. And, umm... I guess that's it, really.\nH\n- Any diarrhea or constipation?\nS: No, no. I had a...\nH\n- ... a bowel movement?\nS: Yes. This morning.\nH\n- And your menstrual cycle?\nS: Oh, my period won't start for about two weeks yet.\nH\n- All right. I guess that's it for right now. If you'll wait over there, the doctor will see you in just a moment or two.\nS: Uh...um... Could I drink anything? Is it OK if I get myself an orange juice or something?\nH\n- Sure, if you feel like it.\nS: Uh, I don't really, no. But I thought I'd just try it to settle my stomach. I dunno.\nHW (chuckles): Well, if the juice doesn't work, the restrooms are right over there.\nS: Oh dear... now I don't...\nH\n- And the vending machines are in the corridor.\nS (feeling like she is going to vomit): Uh...ugh!... no. Oh! I shouldn't've thought about it... Now I think-- I have to-- Oh! Oh!--\nH\n- Be careful! DON'T RUN!",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a meeting between a lecturer and a laboratory assistant in the Department of Biology.\n- Lecturer: Oh-- hi, Bill. Thanks for coming in today. I know it's supposed to be your day off.\n- Assistant: Good morning. No, no, that's fine, Jason. I had to come in today anyway, and start the inventory of the equipment room. It's that time of year again.\n- L: Ah yes. Fiscal year end. Time to use up our budget quick before they take it away from us. How are we, generally, for supplies?\n- A: Not bad, not bad. We'll make it to the end of term all right. But we need to look at next term's projected enrollment again-- it takes time to get some of that stuff. We had trouble last time with the frogs.\n- L: The frogs? Why? We've had frogs for the last thirty years. Hell, I had frogs when I was in high school, back in the Middle Ages!\n- A: Oh, it's the amphibian fungus, Jason. You've read about it, I'm sure. The chytrid fungus. Frogs and salamanders all over the world are disappearing-- populations just decimated. And the frog farms have been hit, too.\n- L: Ah, that's right-- the chytrid fungus. Yes, it's awful. I can't help thinking that somehow the fungus is our fault, too-- along with everything else we've done to screw up the environment.\n- A: Maybe. You may be right. They say that global warming helps it spread, anyway. But the researchers don't have a handle on it yet-- they don't know where it comes from, how it spreads. It just suddenly appears in a region and wipes out most or all of the frogs and toads and salamanders there.\n- L: Wish it'd come to Australia. Do in all those damn Cane Toads. Knowing them though-- they're probably immune!\n- A (laughs): Yeah. Anyway, I'm not sure how many frogs we can get, or how much they're going to cost.\n- L: It's been one per student up till now, hasn't it?\n- A: Yes.\n- L: Well, we'll just have to get them to work in pairs from now on, that's all. That's what we did when we were in school, remember?\n- A: Uh...yes, that'll be OK, I guess. Oh! How about their illustrations, though?\n- L: Their illustrations?\n- A: Yes, their drawings. One of your assignments is a detailed illustration of one of the frog's organ systems. 'Drawn from life', remember? They spend a lot of time on that. I mean, the good students do, at least. I don't think both members of a pair can work on that at the same time.\n- L: Why not?\n- A: It's a physical impossibility. They have to evert the system-- spread the animal's organs out-- while they're drawing. If they choose different systems, then...\n- L: Huh? Oh, I see. Well then, we'll just have each pair illustrate the same system. They'll have to decide together which one. A little extra exercise in human relationships-- just what some of those budding biologists need. (laughs)\n- A (laughs): Yes, you're right there. OK then, that'll be a help. I'll get back to you with the inventory list and any other problems we've got as soon as I can. Maybe early next week?\n- L: That'll be fine. The departmental budgetary committee doesn't meet till the end of the month... But I'm still thinking about frogs. Did you see where some university or institute is trying to build up a collection of amphibians to keep and breed in total isolation? Somewhere where the fungus can be totally excluded. A kind of Noah's Ark of amphibians. Have you heard about that? You think that could work?\n- A: Oh. Uh, yes-- in Costa Rica, I think. Yes. Maybe an independent biological research center. I don't know if that will work or not. Worked for Noah, though. We'll just have to wait and see. And hope.\n- L: And hope. Yes, indeed.\n- A: But what is it you wanted us to talk about this morning?\n- L: Oh, yes--sorry. What I wanted to do this morning was go over the syllabus for Zoology 210 with you. I want to make some changes to it, but I don't want to catch you by surprise, and I need your input.\n- A: It doesn't require more frogs, does it?\n- L (laughs): No. But I don't think we've got enough time now to get into it. I've got a student consultation coming up. Could you possibly come back by after you finish in the equipment room?\n- A: Uh, sure. About four?\n- L: Sure, that'll be good. I'll be here. Thanks much, Bill\n- A: OK, see you later.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a librarian and a student in the university library.\n- Librarian: Excuse me...\n- Student: Yes?\n- L: I'm sorry, but you can't drink coffee in here.\n- S: Huh? Wha...why?\n- L: I'm sorry, but food and beverages can't be consumed in the university libraries at any time.\n- S: Why? It's not hurting anybody...\n- L: No, but it might hurt the books. There's always the danger that you might spill it on library materials.\n- S: But-- I'm not using any library materials. I'm just uh, studying my class notes and uh, writing this paper. How could I spill coffee on any library stuff?\n- L: Another student could easily sit down here and start working next to you. Or someone passing could just knock your cup over onto themselves. Accidents do happen.\n- S: But I'm being careful. I'll set it over here, see? And keep to myself-- and not use any \"library materials\", OK?\n- L: Look, many people here are using our books and other materials. We cannot monitor each person's activity all the time they're here. That's why we just don't permit drinks in the library. I'm afraid that you'll just have to take it outside.\n- S: But look-- it's got a screw cap on it. With just this little drinking slot-- and the slot has a cover, too, see? I couldn't possibly spill this if I tried. Watch this!-- (The student knocks over the coffee container.)\n- L: OH! Oh, for heaven's-- Don't do that again! Look. I don't have time to discuss this with you any further. You'll have to take your coffee outside, or you'll have to dispose of it immediately-- or you'll have to leave the library. Is that clear?\n- S (raising his voice): OK, OK. So, I guess we live in a police state on this campus, eh? Geez! And I thought universities were supposed to be bastions of liberalism! Guess not!!...\n- L: Please keep your voice down. Others are trying to study. Young man, you're confusing liberalism with licentiousness. This is a simple rule. It is not onerous or inhumane. It's just a practical regulation to make sure that the library collections-- and many of our volumes are unique and irreplaceable-- to make sure that they are kept safely and remain accessible to students now and into the future-- that they will still be a resource for your own children, when they attend USC, maybe.\n- S: But if I'm not doing anything--\n- L: The possibility remains. Accidents happen. It's practically impossible to keep an eye on each person individually in here-- and if we could, then you'd really have a police state, wouldn't you? Ours are simple, minimal preventive regulations that all libraries institute, not just ours. Keeping our voices lowered and refraining from eating and drinking and smoking-- these are common courtesies that we should extend to each other, as well as safety measures. They're no great burden on your freedom. They're just social tools to grease the system, and help it run smoothly for everyone-- not just those who are more attentive to their own personal comforts.\n- S: OK. You win. So. Where can I go and finish my coffee in peace?\n- L: Mmm. You can take it to the student lounge in the Student Union, of course. Or you could go drink it next door in the Architecture Building lobby-- they've got some benches in there. Or-- it's a nice day. Why don't you finish it out in the quad?\n- S: We can't smoke in the student lounge anymore. Can we smoke in the Architecture lobby?\n- L: Mmm. I don't know. No, I don't think so. There are almost no smoking places on campus anymore.\n- S: Boy, don't I know it! I've really gotta quit soon. OK, I guess it's the grass, then. I'll take this out on the quad. Can I leave my notes and stuff here?\n- L: I don't think that's a very good idea. Somebody might take them.\n- S: Naw. There's nothing anybody'd want.\n- L: Well, it's up to you then.\n- S: OK, thanks. See you.\n- L: Wait a minute-- what about your bag?\n- S: Huh? Oh. Yeah. I'd better take that. It's got my lunch in it.\n- L: Your lunch?\n- S: Yes. Oh-- OK, I'll eat that outside in the quad now, too, don't worry. 'Bye.\n- L: Thank you. Enjoy your break.",

What's up? You OK?\n- P (out of breath): Yeah...whoosh!...yeah...I've just been trying to catch up to you for the last block. Boy, you walk fast!\n- E: Sorry. I'm running late, that's all. Can you walk and talk at the same time? What's on your mind?\n- P: (still breathing heavily): Woosh... Ah...mmm...Have you got any money? Have you got any extra money?\n- E (laughs): Huh? Sure. How much do you need? Ten, twenty bucks? What'd you do, go over budget again this month?\n- P: No, no! I'm not out of pocket, no. Have you got any real money? I've been working on my practicum for Financial Management, you know, and--\n- E: Oh, that! Yeah. Mm-- you picked what?-- cash management, didn't you? How's that going?\n- P: Oh, it's going great, Eric, real great. That's what I want to tell you about. I'm supposed to work with the 200-dollar limit that Dr Geitner set us, and I think I can do pretty good for CBA Company.\n- E: CBA Company?\n- P: Yeah, I thought that was more interesting than \"ABC Company\".\n- E: Oh. Real catchy, yep. Very imaginative, Pamela.\n- P: Thanks! Anyway, the 200 dollars I'm using as CBA's minimum cash-on-hand, and I want to start investing it in overnights.\n- E: Overnights? Those are short-term deposits, right?\n- P: Right. You make the deposit at 6 pm and then it matures at 6 am the next morning-- it's a half-day term deposit. It doesn't earn much interest, of course, but the security and liquidity are 100 percent, and the principal and interest are fully guaranteed. And you make a little money on your money that's not doing anything at night anyway.\n- E: \"Little\" is the operative word there, isn't it? What do you make on 200 dollars then, Pam?\n- P: About zero point one oh percent. Twenty cents.\n- E: Wow! You'll be rich as Croesus!\n- P: No-- now wait a minute, Eric-- listen now. This is just a practicum. Real businesses do this-- big corporations do this-- and they've got maybe three or four million dollars in cash lying around at the end of every workday. Try four million dollars at zero point one percent...\n- E: ...Which gives us, uh...how much then?\n- P: Four thousand dollars.\n- E: Four grand?! That's more like it. Overnights are beginning to sound all right. I wish I had a million to invest.\n- P: Me too. And y'see, that's where my problem comes. This is a practicum, not theoretical research, so I've got to actually invest that 200 dollars. The catch is that overnights, they need a minimum principle of two thousand dollars. They won't accept my two hundred.\n- E: Oh. So?\n- P: So...I was thinking. I've got a little over fifteen hundred in the bank-- that's what the two hundred is coming out of. So, if I could come up with another 500 dollars somewhere...so that I'd have the minimum... And that's when I thought of you!\n- E: Huh?! Oh-- I get it. You want me to lend you the 500 dollars. I see.\n- P: Yes. Could you, Eric?\n- E: Overnight? For one day?\n- P: Well...um..no. I'd need it for about ten days. I'm going to have to roll it over through several overnights, so I can collect enough data on the earnings and everything, but--\n- E: It's really risk-free, Pam?\n- P: Absolutely, Eric, absolutely! Is City Bank going to go bankrupt overnight? Or in ten days? I doubt it.\n- E: Well then...what about the interest?\n- P: Huh? What do you mean?\n- E: The interest we earn. On 2000 dollars, that should be about...two bucks, right? We split that, right?\n- P: Well actually, since I'll be rolling over the principal about ten times, we should make about 20 dollars, and...and-- we'll share the profits, sure. Your 500 dollars and my fifteen hundred...that would give you, lessee...um, 25 percent of 20 dollars is five dollars interest on your 500-dollar loan. Not bad, huh?\n- E (laughs): I guess I won't get rich, but-- OK. It's a deal. When do you need the money?\n- P: Well, as soon as you can, I guess.\n- E: Let's see now...Can I write you a check?\n- P: Sure.\n- E: Then I'll write you a check in class. Now let's go or we'll be late.\n- P: Great! Thanks, Eric, thanks a lot. You're a real friend.",

It's about your essay...um...just a moment. Where did I put it now? Ah, here it is. It's about your essay here...\n- S: Oh?\n- DD: I'm interested in this part...uh...here: (reading) \"Exiles is a play worthy of examination but not of performance. Joyce's sense of the dramatic is not so much turgid as it is unspeakable.\" That's an acute assessment, I think, Jacob, and very well phrased. I like it. How did you come up with that idea?\n- S: Ah. Well...uh...I dunno...I was reading a lot. I mean, I was researching my topic, and...um...I guess it just came to me, you know, after studying so much about Joyce and his about play.\n- DD: And you've read Exiles, have you?\n- S: Well...erm...not all of it, actually. I, I didn't have time, really, to read the whole thing, but I, uh, I got through Act One, and then I, um, sort of skimmed through the rest, I guess...and the ending...\n- DD: But you feel that you got a good sense of the play's merits and demerits?--\n- S: Umm...\n- DD: -- Enough to form this considered opinion, did you?\n- S: Uh, yes, I think so, I mean...\n- DD: Because what I'm wondering about here is your word choices, really. I think the opinion itself is quite good, quite perceptive. But, well, the phrasing seems a bit, a little...familiar to me. \"Not so much turgid as it is unspeakable.\" It seems familiar. It rings a bell, you know?\n- S: Oh.\n- DD: Is it possible, do you think, that you've written that before? In one of your other papers for me, I mean?\n- S: Uh...well, maybe I--\n- DD: But I don't think we've discussed any other turgid authors, have we? Nice, but not a very generally useful phrase, is it?\n- S: No. I guess--\n- DD: But catchy, certainly! I don't suppose you, um, caught it from someone else, did you?\n- S: No-o! Oh...well, maybe I...\n- DD: Perhaps you could've read it somewhere in the course of your research? And then, well... forgotten, huh?\n- S: Um...yes. I guess I could have. But--\n- DD: That sometimes happens, Jacob.\n- S: It does? Really?\n- DD: Yes, it happens to the best of us, to the most conscientious of us. Reading over and over, searching through lots of references, taking notes. Phrases, ideas get picked up and we don't really realize it. They sometimes seem like new ideas we have ourselves.\n- S: I see.\n- DD: Or sometimes we note down an extended quote that we like, and then we work relevant parts of it into our paper. And then we revise and we re-organize, and it just sort of, well, gets lost in the shuffle-- we just forget to, or we fail to, follow through with the footnotes, you know.\n- S: Mm...yeah. Uh--\n- DD: Anyway, whatever might have happened here-- as I said, \"not so much turgid as it is unspeakable\"-- this sounds very familiar, like someone's said it before. And if that's actually the case, then it should be presented in your essay as a quotation, with a proper citation, don't you think? Even if the source itself is listed in your bibliography, you know.\n- S: Yes, of course! I'm sorry. Maybe I should--?\n- DD: Well, you should go back to the library, go back to your reference books, and see if you can't locate the source for this remark. So-- here. Here's your essay back--\n- S: Oh!\n- DD: -- and you can add the citation if you find the quote. And then, bring it back to me and I'll grade it.\n- S: Oh, OK! Thank you, Dr Dietz. I'll do that right away-- and I'll be more careful next time, I assure you.\n- DD: I know you will, Jacob, I'm sure you will. And you might try looking first in Reverend Stanton's Life of James Joyce. I think that's a likely location. Isn't that one of the books in your bibliography?\n- S: I think, uh...yes, here it is. Gee, I looked at so many biographies of Joyce, I can't remember which one's which anymore.\n- DD: Well, Stanton's is probably the least sympathetic of Joyce's biographers. I doubt he even tried to read Finnegans Wake. Probably thought it was nonsense.\n- S: Well, I can see why! (Laughs nervously then suddenly stops.) But I guess I'd better get over to the library now.\n- DD: Yes. Yes, you should. And get back to me with your revisions as soon as you can, Jacob.\n- S: Yessir, I will.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a TEFL professor and a student after class.\nProfessor Dickens: Hello, Linda. Can I help you?\nLinda Wright: Yes, professor. I was wondering about what you said at the, at the end of your lecture, about the dangers of prescriptive grammar?\nPD: Yes?\nL\n- And well, you said that, uh, prescriptive grammar-- I mean, teaching the rules of how grammarians think people should use English-- actually impedes learning, right?\nPD: Yes, that's what I said, Linda. It does impede learning, it impedes language acquisition. Studies have actually shown that.\nL\n- But what bothers me, I guess, is that, well-- all I've ever studied is prescriptive grammar, then. That's what I've learned, and that's what I use, and that's what I know, I think. When I was in school, when I was growing up in Denver-- we learned \"I before E\", we learned to avoid \"ain't\", and double negatives, and \"they\" as a singular pronoun, and \"between you and I\", and so on, and well, just a whole slew of rules that you'd call prescriptive, I'm sure.\nPD: Yes. Yes, I would-- many of them.\nL\n- So you're saying that we shouldn't teach any of that?\nPD: \"Teach\"? No, you really shouldn't try to \"teach\" those kinds of grammar rules.\nL\n- Because they're not good rules?\nPD: Well, no, that's not it at all. Now, you've just listed a few \"rules\" that actually range very widely between good and bad. It's true that some of your students are going to need to know, to be aware of, many of those rules eventually. When they're writing business reports or college essays, for instance. But if you fill their lessons with rules, if your students are always worrying about being \"right\" or \"wrong\" instead of relaxing and just focussing on communicating, then those rules really get in the way of the learning process, of the process of language acquisition.\nL\n- But then...when-- or how-- do we...?\nPD: Discourage double negatives? Get them to say \"between you and me\"? By example, mostly. You need to have confidence in your own English as a model-- you're a native speaker, after all-- a college-educated English speaker...almost.\nLW (laughs): Soon college-educated, I hope!\nPD (laughs): Yes, I'm sure you will be. So have confidence in your own English, the English you use. Your students will hear you. They'll pay attention to how you speak, to what you say.\nL\n- But how does that help them exactly?\nPD: It lets them realize for themselves those many small elements of the language that preoccupy some grammarians so much. Tell me, Linda, why do TEFL students take classes?\nL\n- Well...to learn to speak English, don't they?\nPD: Precisely! So that's what you want them to be able to do, to be doing, in class-- speaking English. Now, if I'm a student and I say to you, \"I don't brought my homework today\"-- do you understand what I mean?\nL\n- Well, uh, sure-- you mean you didn't bring your homework.\nPD: So-- I communicated successfully, didn't I?\nL\n- Well, yes...but--\nPD: And it's important that that success should be rewarded. But if the teacher responds instead with \"No, you should say 'didn't bring'\", then the student all too often feels embarrassed or chastened, or he loses self-confidence. Not all of them, of course. But many do. The student withdraws psychologically from participation in the communication process-- and this is deadly. This is dangerous. What you want to do is complete the communicative act. Say something like, \"Oh, that's OK if you didn't bring it today. Just bring it tomorrow.\"\nL\n- Oh! So...\nPD: So, that way you haven't \"taught\" negative past formation, you have just presented it in the process of communicating. The student is happy that you understood his English, and he's happy that you're not angry about his forgetting his homework-- and he may have noticed how you formed that verb phrase. Or if he didn't, he may notice it next time. Research shows that, over time, this kind of positive reinforcement produces a much steeper learning curve.\nL\n- Yeah?\nPD: And the students, on average, attain fluency much more quickly.\nL\n- Well, I guess that makes sense, then...\nPD: What I'm arguing against, actually, is not prescriptive grammar per se-- English does have rules that speakers are judged by-- what I'm protesting is prescriptive teaching, with the teacher as lawgiver. That's what can be counter-productive.\nL\n- I think I'm beginning to get it, Doctor Dickens. Thank you very much. Will you be talking more about this later?\nPD: Oh, yes. We'll be discussing this in detail in our next class. So don't be late!\nLW (laughs): OK, I won't. Thank you for your time. See you Tuesday.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between two students over lunch.\n- Bill: Hi, Hillary. Can I join you?\n- Hillary: Oh-- hi, Bill. Sure. Sit down. What's for lunch? Oh...you're having the beef curry, eh? I'd better warn the rest of the class.\n- B: I can't come today. I've got to skip it.\n- H: Why?\n- B: Oh, I've got to finish this motivation letter here.\n- H: Which one's that?\n- B: It's my letter for USC grad school. I've got to get it in the mail this afternoon. I've been putting it off and putting it off, but now I've really got to get it done, or I'll miss the submission deadline. So I'm going to have to miss 360 class, that's all.\n- H: Too bad. Why'n't you write it before, anyway? You're one of the most organized guys I know.\n- B: Oh, I dunno. I never do know what to say in these things exactly. And this one's really got me stumped. I really want to get into their graduate International Affairs program-- so this one's got to be just right, you know?\n- H: So...what's wrong with it? Can I see what you've got so far?\n- B: Huh? Oh. Sure. Here you go. It's just that, uh, I can't find that, you know, balance between eagerness and uh, effusiveness. I mean, how to show them I'm sincere. I want to tell them that I really want to get into that program, and that I think I've got the background to do well in it-- but I can't sound like some, well, wet-behind-the-ears, stars-in-my-eyes wannabe, either.\n- H: Yeah. I know what you mean. It's hard, isn't it? It's a fine line to walk. Lemmee see...mmm...this is nice-- \"The political turmoil that has brought in the 21st century\"...catchy! Hmm... Oh, but this-- \"I really feel my qualifications...\" Naw, that's no good, Bill. That sounds really canned. And you shouldn't have to say you \"feel\"-- that feeling should come out in the context-- and \"really\" certainly doesn't belong anywhere near a formal letter!\n- B: Oh.\n- H: Just cut that clause out and get right into it: \"My qualifications match the prerequisites you indicate and...\". Hmm. But then you don't mention them at all.\n- B: Mention what? The prerequisites?\n- H: Neither one. You haven't given any details either about your qualifications or about the prerequisites that USC wants.\n- B: Well, they know their own prerequisites, don't they?\n- H: Yes, of course-- but a smart applicant would remind them.\n- B: And my CV is going to be attached to this-- and it lists all my education and experience-- in gory detail.\n- H: Yeah, but even so-- you ought to give them, maybe, some examples at least, some key examples, here in the letter. If you say they match, then you should match them up right here. You know, like...uh, what?-- you've taken a heckuva lot of languages, haven't you? What are you taking this year?\n- B: Uh...second year German and first year Japanese.\n- H: Well, put those in here. Be specific. \"My language credits in French, German and Japanese, in addition to the fact that I am bilingual in Spanish and English, abundantly satisfy your language prerequisite.\" You've got to impress them with the truth, Bill, really. And nothing sounds more truthful than specific details-- details that can be checked and verified. And then, help them, help them think it out-- \"My language experience has already provided me a good grounding in many cross-cultural basics.\"-- something like that.\n- B: But isn't all that going to make this thing 'way too long? I've always read you're not supposed to go over one, a single, page with a cover letter.\n- H: But this isn't a cover letter. Well, yes, it's a kind of a cover letter-- but it's more than that. It's supposed to show what makes you tick-- who you are, and what you want out of life. What you want out of that USC program.\n- B: So...\n- H: So don't worry about length. As long as you're not just creating padding, not creating filler, as long as you're giving them good solid useful information about your abilities and goals, they'll keep reading. And they'll get a good clear picture of who you are as a candidate.\n- B: So, what do you think then? Two pages?\n- H: Sure, that'll be fine. As long as you have something relevant to say.\n- B: But I'm running out of time on this.\n- H: Look-- isn't this important? You can do this.\n- B: Well, OK then. Whatever you say. Uh-- would you have a chance to take one more look at this thing before I send it off?\n- H: Yeah, I guess so. When? I thought you were in a rush to get this off.\n- B: Yeah, I am. But I think I can get this revised and ready by the end of our 360 lecture...\n- H: -- the one you're skipping?\n- B: Yes. So I could bring it over to you at the end of class.\n- H: Or-- where are you going to work on it? Here?\n- B: Yep. I'm going to be sitting right here till it's done.\n- H: Well then, why don't I just come back here after class and find you?\n- B: That'd be great, Hillary. I'd really appreciate it.\n- H: No problem. Anything to get you out of here and into another university. (laughs)\n- B (laughs): Aw, c'mon! Anyway, thanks. Really.\n- H: See you in a couple of hours, then.\n- B: OK, great!",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between two graduate students in Biology.\n- Charles: Morning, Renee. Sleep good?\n- Renee: You bet! Like a log. That was some outing, wasn't it?\n- C: Sure was. My legs are killing me. I haven't hiked that far in ages.\n- R: No? You're not turning into an armchair biologist already, are you? At the ripe old age of twenty-four?\n- C (laughs): Not yet. But that was a long day. How far do you think we walked, anyway?\n- R: I dunno. Maybe...well...down from the parking area was about a mile, wasn't it? And then around the lake took us a couple of hours, so that must have been what? Two or three miles? And then all over through those woods! I've got no idea how far we walked around in there.\n- C: Maybe about the same again? And then along the creek and back to the vans-- heck, it must've been nine, ten miles at least, all told. Anyway, I'm bushed.\n- R: That's the life of a field researcher: 'bushed' (laughs).\n- C (laughs): In the bushes. So-- what did we get for it? Have you sorted through any of that stuff we brought back yet?\n- R: Just started. Gonna help?\n- C: That's what I'm here for. Otherwise, I'd still be asleep in bed, I guarantee.\n- R: OK, then-- the plant press is right over there on the work counter, and I got out a new pack of specimen folders. I think we must've collected fifty, sixty species, at least. I started trying to sort them out by family, but I'm no botanist. They all look like Compositae to me. Can you handle them?\n- C: Uh. Well, OK. I can classify the easier ones, I guess. We'll have to wait for Sylvia to get here, though, for a lot of them. Where's Gray's Manual?\n- R: It's over there on the counter, too. I thought it'd help me, but I just can't work those keys. I don't have the vocabulary. Lobate? Falcate? Sagittate? It's beyond me! So, if you can get on with those, then I'll, uh...I guess I'll start on the killing jars.\n- C: Everything dead?\n- R: Well, looks like. But you know bugs. They'll wake up again after they've been pinned for an hour. Anyway, I'll start sorting those into families, too.\n- C: I thought we did that in the field? I was supposed to collect true bugs and beetles.\n- R: Yeah-- supposed to. And I was supposed to be responsible for butterflies and moths. But we didn't. We pretty much collected whatever we found. At least, I did. My jar's full of everything under the sun. Even a scorpion.\n- C: Really?\n- R: Well, a whip-scorpion.\n- C: Really?! Can I see it? I've never seen one of those before.\n- R: Yeah, sure. Uh...let me just...empty this out on the blotting pad here... There. There he is.\n- C: Neat! Look at those antennae!\n- R: Those aren't antennae. Those are his front legs.\n- C: Oh. Of course, spiders and such don't have antennae, do they? He's going to be hard to spread, though.\n- R: Oh, I can't spread him. He's too delicate. I'll have to put him in alcohol.\n- C: Oh. Yeah. And when we finally get all these specimens sorted out according to kingdom, class, and family-- what do we do then?\n- R: Well, this is just a lab project, y'know-- so I guess we just make a list and report the, uh, \"Flora and Fauna of Catfish Creek\", I suppose.\n- C: Aw, there must be more to it than that. Doctor Douglas is going to want something more than that, surely. I mean, that's pretty simple-minded, don't you think?\n- R: Yeah, well...but... look, here's the assignment sheet. \"Survey the species diversity of the Catfish Creek watershed.\" That's all it says.\n- C: No, no-- don't you see? The \"species diversity\"-- that means we need to do some analysis here. Is it very diverse? Lots of species, relatively? Lots of different kinds of species or just lots of related species? I'll bet he wants us to try and find out why there are a lot of species-- or not so many species-- at Catfish Creek compared to some other areas.\n- R: Well, then...how are we gonna do that? We haven't got time enough to do this all over again someplace else!\n- C: We probably don't have to. First thing is-- I'm going to the Science Library and see if there are any other comparable studies around here. Or-- hey! Maybe an old study of Catfish Creek even-- and we could compare then and now! Can I leave all this with you for a while?\n- R: Yeah, sure. I've got nothing better to do. And Syvia will be along before long.\n- C: OK. I'll be back in a couple of hours or so, then. And get that whip scorpion into its alcohol before it shrivels up, eh?\n- R (laughs): Yeah, right! Good luck.\n- C: Thanks. See you.",

Next month is really important for our company so we need to prepare a bit earlier than usual.\n- Sure. But we will need to do some overtime.  Q1 We are really busy at the moment so it’s going to be a lot of extra hours after work, and I have to take care of my children.M2: Yeah, that’s a lot of extra work.  Q2 I think after next month we should get a few days added to our vacation.\n- That sounds reasonable.  Q3 I will need to hire a babysitter while I’m doing the overtime, so the extra vacation time seems fair. M1: I agree. Okay, we will discuss the details later, but I definitely agree with you.",

On the other hand, a piano is fine for children as they can learn musical principles easily.\n- I see. However, do you think my son is too young to begin learning an instrument?\n- Not at all.

It’s a little small but we only have five employees so it would be fine.\n- Is there any public transport close by? Some of our employees take the subway to work.\n- Yes. Actually, the Brighton street stop is about a five minute walk so it’s pretty close.\n- Q2 The only problem is the carpet. It’s quite dirty. Does the owner plan on changing it anytime soon?\n- Q3 Actually, we are having new carpets put in next week. So don’t worry about that. If you sign the contract you won’t move your stuff in for a month.\n- That’s great. I think we will take it.

That’s more expensive than I thought it would be. Our budget was three thousand dollars. Why is the price so high? M2:  Q2 I can explain why the price is over your budget. It is because the old paint is peeling badly in some areas. We have to remove it all before repainting, which takes a long time. If you had repainted it earlier it would be less expensive. M1:  In the future I would recommend painting it every 7 years.\n- OK. I thought I was being over charged, but that makes sense.

Q1 Last year you helped find some office space for my company and I was hoping you could help me find something in the same area.\n- Hi, Elizabeth. It’s good to hear from you.

I only have four staff members so we don’t need a big space. As long as it is in good condition and the location fine.\n- No problem. I have a few in the area I think you would like.

Q1 I’m interested in enrolling in your school’s vocational training program to become a dental assistant, but I couldn’t find any information about tuition on your website.\n- Thank you for your interest. We offer a two- semester training program to become a dental assistant at our community college. Tuition for a single semester is $6,500.\n- Oh, I see. Honestly, that is a little more than I expected.  Q2 I will have to ask my bank about the possibility of getting a student loan. Is there anything else you can tell me?\n- Q3 Well, one thing to keep in mind is that our community college offers night classes for all our programs. This is very good for students who work during the day. And please remember that we are one of the top-ranked schools in the state, and so far more than 5,000 of our graduates have become dental assistants.",

W2:  Yes, I did it at about 4:00 P.M.  Q2 The bank said it might take an extra business day to go through because they are having some problems with their computer system. Sorry, I should’ve told you.\n- I see. In the future, please let me know. This client is quite strict about time so we need to be careful not to upset them. They bring US a lot of business.

Our maintenance checks aren’t up to date so if we get inspected, the building manager might be in trouble.\n- Oh, OK. But did you see the time schedule?  Q2 The busiest wing in the hospital will be closed from 8-9 A.M. So many people will be arriving to work at that time. I don’t understand why they would schedule the North Wing repair at that time.\n- Hmm... Yes, you’re right.  Q3 I think we should talk to Dr. Franklin about this. I’m sure he can get the schedule changed.\n- I better do it now so the technicians have time to reschedule.",

Q1 How was your meeting this morning?\n- It went better than I expected. The interior design specialist just gave us some recommendations for our office layout. We don't need to purchase anything new, just rearrange a few things.\n- Oh really? What did he say?\n- Q2 He suggested that we move the help desk and the sales desk so that they are on opposite sides of the entrance. That way, if we have people waiting in line they won’t be crowded. Q3 We will just slide the sales desk to where the waiting area is now.\n- That is a good idea, and this way, when people come into the office they can see all of our products displayed against the back wall.\n- Exactly, and then after they purchase their items they can just step out the door. Glad we are already on the same page.\n- Well, I think we should start moving the sales desk right away, don’t you?",

I don’t think it is very fair. They should have had all the drills in the afternoon. The other departments actually get extra time off work, and we lose our lunch break.\n- Q3 I think we should go and speak to our supervisor. What do you think?\n- I agree. Should we go now?\n- Yes.

What exactly is missing?\n- Q2 Well, it seems like all the parts are here but I have nothing to put them together with.\n- Q2 Ah... It must be the snap fit tool. With our older model kits, that’s a pretty common problem. We have a lot in the store.  Q3 I’ll express-post one to you today if that’s OK?\n- Oh, that’s great. Thanks for your help!",

Q1 As the head chef, you must be proud.\n- Yes, I saw that article, and I’m glad I decided to revise the menu last spring shows that customers appreciate healthy food choicesW-A\n- True, but I’m disappointed that some of our ratings weren’t better. I’m not surprised that we scored low in the pricing category.  Q2 But I am surprised by this one – where we only received three stars. We’ll have to work on improving that area next year.\n- Yes,  Q3 it may be a good idea to meet with the staff about this. They may have some ideas for some changes we can make.",

So,  Q1 you’re writing an article for Forge Ahead Magazine?\n- Yes,  Q2 the piece is about how your car manufacturing plant dramatically changed the way it produces cars.  Could you tell me about what you did?\n- Certainly. Many factory employees are told to never stop production line – no matter what.  Q3 Recently I took the opposite approach. Whenever we found a defect, anyone could stop the assembly line and address the problem immediately.\n- Q3 And this transition improved your quality control?\n- Exactly. In fact, look at this production chart. You’ll see that, 67 compared to the other factories, cars from this one have far fewer defects.",

However, since we currently produce only mobile phones and computers,  Q2 I think we should partner with an automobile manufacturer.\n- Since we don’t have any soft of background in building cars, working with an automobile manufacturer is a good suggestion. We could combine our technical knowledge with their mechanical expertise.  Q3 I worry, though that this project will cost more money than we have available.\n- Q3 I agree with Samuel’s concern – It’s too ambitious for our firm right now.  Even if we split the finances with the company we partner with, it’ll take us over our budget.",

Why don't we put the second rack by the side entrance?\n- The side door's actually closer to the bike path that a lot of us use to get here, so that would be very convenient.\n- Then Q3 let me call Jason in the maintenance department.
