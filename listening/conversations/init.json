And does your current employer know that you are in the market for a new position?\n- Not explicitly, but my manager understands that I've been there six years now, and I've basically reached the top of the ladder in terms of what I can do with them.

        "transcript": "- OK, Mr. Lancaster. Let me summarize your order. You want two cases of printer ink -- one black and one color; 50 reams of copy paper -- the bright white kind; six cartons of legal envelopes; and 50 boxes of manila folders. Is that correct?\n- Yes it is. And can I expect that to arrive within a week? We need it by next Monday.\n- With standard shipping, it will get there within 7 to 10 business days. If you need it sooner, we should use expedited shipping. That would cost $30 instead of $15 for standard, but it would guarantee arrival within 3 to 5 days.\n- Hmm... well, I guess we'll have to go with the expedited, then. Would it be possible to order additional items for the same shipping fee?\n- Sure. You could add up to 25 pounds on your order. But after that, the expedited fee would be $2 per five pounds.",

I started taking the subway two years ago, and it's wonderful! From the Scott Street station, it's only a block and a half to our building. And going home, the 52nd Street stop is only two blocks from my apartment. When I was driving, I wasn't getting nearly as much exercise.\n- Exactly! Plus, the subway's cheaper than gas in the long run. And the trains leave every 15 minutes, so if I miss one I don't have to wait long for another.

        "transcript": "- City utility department, Mary Chambers speaking. How may I help you?\n- Yes, I'm new to the city and I'm trying to figure out how garbage and recycle collection work. It's my understanding that garbage is collected on Wednesdays, and recyclables such as paper, plastic and glass are collected on Thursdays. Is that correct?\n- No sir, it's the other way around. Recyclables are Wednesday, and garbage is Thursday. You need to put your garbage can next to the curb in front of your house by 7 a.m. Thursdays. You should have two recycling containers, one for paper and cardboard, and one for glass. Those need to be set in front of your house by 7 a.m. Wednesday. On both those days, our pick-up trucks will be there sometime between 7 and 5.\n- Oh I see. Thank you very much for your assistance. Just one more thing. I heard that the city is going to start collecting yard waste soon. Can you please tell me about that?",

Laura, how are you coming on the new web browser?\n- Well, the project is a little behind schedule, because last month's storm delayed a shipment of computer chips from Taiwan. But we're testing a prototype browser, and hope to have it in beta stage within eight weeks, which will be an exciting step for the company. This browser will host an internet platform, meaning all customers will need is our browser to access the World Wide Web.\n- That's exciting news, indeed, Laura! Do you have all the components you need now to complete the testing before it goes to beta? Is there anything else we need to order?\n- We should have everything we need, barring unforeseen circumstances. Hashkeem and Martin are working on the prototype practically 24/7, and they'll let me know if anything unexpected comes up.",

Only about 10 I think, but it does seem longer. He's kind of an institution at this paper. Word is that he asked the publisher, Mr. Frankel, for a column last year, but he was turned down.\n- What a shame. If anyone deserves his own column, it's Nathan Richmond. He's paid his dues, covering city politics all these years. I wonder who'll cover that beat now. Have you heard, Carla?",

I used Mighty Maids yesterday, and the woman who cleaned my home -- Nora, is her name -- did not do a very good job. I asked her to scrub the bathroom floors, but when she finished, they looked no cleaner than before she started. I also asked her to clean the oven and do some laundry. She did neither. I'm very disappointed, and I'd like my money back.\n- I'm terribly sorry to hear that, Mr. Dodd. Believe me, this is not typical of Mighty Maids service. Unfortunately, I cannot refund your money. However, what I can do is send a different person out tomorrow, who will clean your house this time free of charge. We'd like another chance to prove that yesterday was an aberration. Would that be OK?\n- Yes, I suppose. But if the cleaner is not good tomorrow, I will not use your service again, and I'll tell everyone I know to avoid Mighty Maids.",

I think we ought to look in at least two stores before we get anything.\n- Yeah, we could, but when you figure in the cost of time and gas getting to another store, it might end up being cheaper just to buy it here right now. What if we go to Video Plus and it's not any cheaper, but they just match the price?\n- Yeah, I see your point, but I'd feel better if we could compare anyway. If the TV is only $300 at the other store, then it's worth the time and gas to go there. How about if I call Video Plus and ask them?\n- All right, that's a good idea.

That's a tight deadline. All right, let's get Gino and meet in the conference room in half an hour. Bring all the design sketches that you've worked up, and have Gino bring all the ad copy he's written. I'll grab the old power point slides and videos of Martin's current commercials.\n- Right. Look, I know it's not much time, but I think we'll be OK. I've been working hard on the artwork, and I know that Gino was writing at home even though he was ill.

You got high marks for promptness and dedication, and need to improve your business etiquette and time management. Do you have any questions?\n- Yes, just a couple. What do you do with my performance review after I review it and sign it? Will you use it next year in deciding on salary increases?\n- Those are good questions. Your review will go into your file, which is part of your permanent employment record. It will be considered in determining salary, but it's just one factor among many. We'll also consider your overall performance since you joined the company, and any improvement made following this evaluation. In general, you're doing very nice work. Keep up the good work, and you shouldn't have any worries.\n- Thank you, Ms. Donaldson. I appreciate your fairness, and I enjoy working for you.",

Take that to your manager, and get his or her signature on the bottom line. Then, take a copy of that form -- that's the yellow page underneath -- and turn it into accounting. Be sure to attach copies of all your receipts. You keep the third page, the pink form, along with all your original receipts. Reimbursement checks are cut once a month, and they are separate from your normal paycheck. They usually go out on the 15th.\n- OK, blue form to manager, yellow to accounting. I think I've got it. What type of expenses will the company reimburse?\n- Typically taxi, subway and bus fares; admission fees; meals and drinks up to $30 a day; and any necessary business supplies -- either for use on your trip or after you return. Of course, we'll also reimburse for unexpected costs, such as having to rent a hotel room if your flight is cancelled or delayed, or expenses associated with a lost wallet or natural disaster.",

You wanted 20 pounds of fresh caviar, but our supplier is hampered by a labor dispute, so they can deliver only 10 pounds of caviar. We could refund your money for the other 10 pounds, or substitute something else.\n- Oh dear. Hmmm... well, we have more than 200 guests, so it's probably best to substitute at this point. What would you recommend?\n- Well, you wanted five pounds of smoked sardines. How about 10 more pounds of those?\n- No, let's do this. Five more pounds of sardines, and double the amount of avocado dip, from three bowls to six. Hey, while you're on the phone, can we double-check the order?",
