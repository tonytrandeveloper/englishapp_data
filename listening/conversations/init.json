I have a 10 o'clock appointment.\nP: Yes, Susan. Come in, sit down. What can I do for you this morning?\nS: I had a, uh, question about Tuesday's lecture on pla [false start] on plate tectonics. My notes aren't too clear. I was wondering if I could, um, ask you a little more about it.\nP: You sure can! In fact, I'm glad you're here. Remember what I said at the beginning of the term, the only bad question is the one that stays in your brain. Right?\nS: Yeah. Thank you. Uh, anyway [clears throat]. Well, I didn't quite get the differences between divergent and convergent boundaries of tectonic plates, and what happens when they crash, or uh, bump into each other.\nP: OK. You, uh, know that there are four major types of boundaries on tectonic plates, right? And when tectonic plates move and bump into, or uh, rub against each other, it creates effects on the land above, such as creating mountains, causing earthquakes, forming new continents and stuff like that. Good so far?\nS: Yeah, I understand that. That's why the Earth's topography keeps changing over time, and why North, er, South America pulled apart from Africa. Now, you said that the plates, with con, no, divergent boundaries, when they collide, one of the plates goes under the other one?\nP: No, you're mixing them up. That happens with convergent boundaries. One of the plates tends to submerge under the other one, which destroys the Earth's crust. When divergent boundaries collide, the two plates pull away from each other, which creates new crust.\nS: Oh, I see. So convergent boundaries submerge and destroy crust, and divergent boundaries pull apart and form new crust. I think I've got it.\nP: All right. So, um, let's test your knowledge. In the past few million years, the country of Saudi Arabia has separated from Africa, which has helped form the, uh, Red Sea. Is this the result of a collision between divergent or convergent boundaries?\nS: Um...that would be, uh, divergent, wouldn't it? Because Saudi Arabia is pulling away from Africa and creating something ne\n- the Red Sea.\nP: Yes, very good Susan. Now, at the border of India and Asia, there are the highest mountains on the face on the Earth, including Mt. Everest. What caused those?\nS: A convergent boundary! The plates of India and Asia collided, and one plate dove under the other one, pushing up the crust into mountains.\nP: Excellent, young lady! I think you are getting the hang of this.",

It's my understanding that garbage is collected on Wednesdays, and recyclables such as paper, plastic and glass are collected on Thursdays. Is that correct?\n- No sir, it's the other way around. Recyclables are Wednesday, and garbage is Thursday. You need to put your garbage can next to the curb in front of your house by 7 a.m. Thursdays. You should have two recycling containers, one for paper and cardboard, and one for glass. Those need to be set in front of your house by 7 a.m. Wednesday. On both those days, our pick-up trucks will be there sometime between 7 and 5.\n- Oh I see. Thank you very much for your assistance. Just one more thing. I heard that the city is going to start collecting yard waste soon. Can you please tell me about that?",

I don't want you to do anything you're not comfortable with, but any gift would help. Remember, it is tax-deductable.\n- Yes, I know that. Um, OK, why don't you put me down for $10?

Did you get those syllabus pages run off for me?\n- Estelle: Omigosh! I forgot them completely! Can you hang on for just about five minutes?\n- J: Yes. No- actually, I'm glad you haven't run them off yet. I need to fix a typo in the original. I got the year wrong. This is 2009 now, isn't it? (laughs)\n- E: (laughs) Yes, and it has been for the last two months. Can I change it for you?\n- J: Oh, you'd better just give me back the original, Estelle. It's wrong in a couple of places, and it would be easier if I just went over it myself, I think.\n- E: All right, then... um.... Ah! Here it is.\n- J: Good. Uh...can I borrow your white-out?\n- E: Sure. Here.\n- J: Thanks. (correcting the master copy) Is the chairman coming in this morning?\n- E: He should be in about eleven. He has a meeting with the Dean first thing before that.\n- J: About budget cuts, I'll bet.\n- E: Probably. I hope I'm not one of them.\n- J: Ah, don't you worry- you're irreplaceable. You're the heart of the department.\n- E: (laughs) Well, they do successful heart transplants now.\n- J: (laughs) I suppose so, but anyway, I'm sure your job is more secure than mine. Assistant professors are a dime a dozen, and one more or less is not critical to operations- but- no secretary? We'd be in chaos in a day!\n- E: (laughs) Maybe.\n- J: Here you are. It'll be OK with the penned-in correction, I think. It doesn't need to be fancy. I only need ten copies for this class, and then I'll revise it again for next term anyway.\n- E: Whatever you say. I can do these in a minute. Shall I bring them down to your office?\n- J: Yes, that would be- oh. No. I have to run down to the reading room first, so I'll swing back and pick them up from you here.\n- E: OK then.\n- J: Oh, and while I'm thinking about it- have we still got some of those little A4 binders, the looseleaf ones?\n- E: Yes, some. How many do you need?\n- J: Oh, um... six, I think. I want to break my introductory course into modules.\n- E: Oh, just for you, then, not for all your students. Yes, we've got that many. What color would you like?\n- J: Color?\n- E: Yes. Blue? Navy? Pink?\n- J: Ack! Pink?!\n- E: Well, some people like it.\n- J: I suppose. Not me. I'll take navy if you've got six of them.\n- E: Just a minute...uh...four, five...yes, I do. Here you are.\n- J: Great! And, uh, the labels?\n- E: Oh, labels. Uh...here. And a couple of extras so you can make a mistake.\n- J: Me? A mistake? Not a chance.\n- E: Not a chance, eh? Got the year down pat now, have you?\n- J: (laughs) OK, OK. You got me. There goes your birthday rose, though.\n- E: What?! Oh, no! You really hold a grudge, don't you?\n- J: Yeah, so watch out. And could you do just one more little thing for me?\n- E: Maay-be.\n- J: Please? Could you just let me know when the chairman comes in? I need to talk to him for a minute. Just ring me- I'll be in my office from about ten-thirty till lunch time.\n- E: Yes, of course. And I'll have your copies when you come back from the reading room.\n- J: Great, thanks. Actually, just keep them here, and I'll pick them up when I see Dr. Jewett.\n- E: OK then.\n- J: Thanks, Estelle.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a university student and an employee in the university registrar's office.\n- S: Hi, I've got a question about registering for the special geology field seminar in spring quarter.\n- E: OK. You know that registration for that class is limited to 15 students, don't you? And that you have to have passed Geology 302 as a prerequisite?\n- S: Yes, I know. Uh, the thing is, I'm taking Geology 302 this quarter. I expect, er, I think I'll pass it no problem. I mean, I'm getting an A-minus in it so far. I really want to take the seminar next quarter. Can I register now, and still be eligible to take it when, er, if I pass 302?\n- E: Hmm...interesting question. Well, registration for spring classes does not begin for another two weeks. Technically, you're supposed to have passed 302 before you register. But what you could do is sign up for the seminar, and, um, wait and see if the class fills before your 302 grade is recorded. If the seminar doesn't fill, you'll be eligible as soon as your Geology 302 grade becomes official, and then you'd be assured of a place in the field seminar. Or, you could wait until your 302 grade is in, and then see if there are openings left for the seminar.\n- S: I see. Um, and then if I [false start] if the class is full and I can't get in, when can I, uh, when is the next chance to take it? Will it be offered in the summer? Or next fall?\n- E: That depends on the professor. Let's see...right now it's not on the summer schedule, but that could change. We don't finalize summer classes until the middle of spring term. If there are enough students who want to take it then, it might be offered. The geology seminar is not held in fall and winter terms -- at least not usually -- because it takes place in the mountains.\n- S: OK. So, uh...shoot! What can I do? You're saying that I can't register for two more weeks, right? And then if I [false start] -- when I do register, I have to wait until my 302 grade comes in? But even then I might, er, not be able to take the seminar?\n- E: Yep, you've got it! Sorry, but that's the best I can do for you.\n- S: If I don't get into the spring seminar, does my name automatically go to the top of the waiting list for the next time the class is offered?\n- E: No, I'm afraid not. You can register only during approved registration periods -- these begin, uh, one week after the end of the current term. If we let you register too far in advance, it wouldn't be fair to other students. Some classes would be full years ahead.\n- S: Yeah, I know. Thanks for your help. I really want to take that seminar this spring. Is there, uh, any other way you can think of that I could be sure of getting in?\n- E: [sighs]. Not offhand. I suppose that maybe you could talk to your Geology 302 professor, or to the professor who's going to teach the field seminar, and see if they'll pre-approve you. But the field seminar is very popular, so uh, I'm not sure if they will.\n- S: Hey, it's worth a try. Who's going to teach the field seminar?\n- E: That would be Professor Bronson. Do you know who he is? His office is in Johnson Hall, um, number 302.\n- S: I don't know him, but I have a friend who's taken his class. I'll talk to my 302 professor, and then maybe have him write a note or something that I can take to Professor Bronson. Um, thanks again for your time.\n- E: You're welcome. Good luck!",

Oh, I was just looking for a quiet place to study where there's no distractions.\n- P: (laughs) Well, you found the perfect spot- my empty classroom. But I guess I'm a distraction now. I left my folder of notes in here last period. Do you mind if I...?\n- J: Oh! No, no- please go ahead, Professor.\n- P: Um. Hmm.... Ah- here it is. OK. I leave you to it.\n- J: Oh, Professor....\n- P: Yes?\n- J: Would you have a minute? Could I just ask you about the comment you wrote on my last essay?\n- P: Yes, I have a few minutes now. What did I write on it?\n- J: Well, here's the essay- \"The Heights of Romanticism\"- and you wrote just the word \"vague!\" at the top beside my grade....\n- P: Oh yes. It's an interesting topic choice, Jason, but I think that maybe you, uh, bit off more than you could chew. That title covers a lot of very major English poets!\n- J: Yeah, I guess it does, doesn't it? Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Byron. You know, I felt that way too, actually, after I got started with it. But by then I was kind of trapped.\n- P: Trapped? What do you mean?\n- J: Well, I had already started research. I'd picked out some key passages from the Prelude, from Keats's odes, et cetera. I'd already learned a good bit about their personal lives- I was, you know, committed.\n- P: Well now, listen, Jason: one of the key steps in writing an essay is choosing and defining your topic at the very beginning. If you get a feeling that the theme's too broad or too narrow, or uh, too convoluted or too, um, whatever- then cut your losses right away. Abandon it and find a fresh theme. That's rule number one.\n- J: Hmm. Yeah, I guess you're right. (sighs)\n- P: And what happened here is that you were never able to get down to brass tacks. That's why I wrote \"vague\"- that was my main reaction when I got done reading your paper. You're assigned three-page essays in my class, and you chose a subject fit for a book!\n- J: (laughs) Well, could I ask you, could you give me an example, of how I could've narrowed this down to a manageable size? Should I have just chosen one poet, do you think?- say, Lord Byron?\n- P: Yes, that's a simple solution to the problem here. But with only three pages to work with, you could afford to narrow it even more- just look at \"Don Juan\" as a work, uh, symbolic of the Romantic ideal, you know.\n- J: And that would be enough?\n- P: Sure, more than enough! The narrower your topic, the more incisive you can be. You might even come up with an original idea about Byron and the Romantic Movement!\n- J: Not likely.\n- P: But see, that's wrong thinking. These essays are not just rote assignments, Jason, something you have to crank out in order to pass my course. The point is to train you to research- \"re-search\"- \"search again\"- through our literary history... and add new light on it. This is something you should be eager to do!\n- J: Yes, of course, Professor- and I am, really! But I guess sometimes they do just, well...turn into assignments. Sometimes I do forget why I' m here.\n- P: (laughs) Well, you're not the only one, I can tell you that. Actually, this was one of the better essays. At least you didn't wander off topic, or just fill the three pages with polysyllabic gobbledegook. Those are the students I really come down hard on. Look, a \"B minus\" isn't so bad, is it?\n- J: No, I guess not. I like \"A\"s better, though. (laughs) And that's what I'm trying for next time. Our next paper's on the 19th century up to World War One, right?\n- P: Yes, that's right.\n- J: I'm interested in the Symbolists, and I've been reading about Rimbaud- he's kind of seminal, isn't he?\n- P: He certainly is- and in a way Rimbaud is a topic already narrowed down for you. He has a very small opus- he stopped writing when he was 21 and ran off to become a trader in Africa.\n- J: Yes-- and I can identify! (laughs)\n- P: (laughs) Oh, no you don't! I expect good things from you- starting with your next essay. Just remember: control your topic, don't let your topic control you. You've only got three pages, so be concise, be pithy.\n- J: OK, I'll try. Thanks very much for your time, Dr Wescott. I really appreciate it.\n- P: My pleasure, Jason. See you in class.\n- J: 'Bye.",

You're doing very well indeed in my class, and, uh, I've noticed that you seem particularly interested in my research....\n- J: Thanks! Yes. It seems like fun to be working with primates. They're very likeable animals, aren't they? Very gentle, very smart.\n- DB: Yes, they are, and it's nice to be able to mix business and pleasure. But they do take a lot of, well, looking after to keep them healthy and happy. I've got an assistant, Larry- you know him, I think, the student who brought Maisy and Daisy into the classroom last month?\n- J: Oh, yes, I know Larry, Larry Easton. He's getting his master's in Zoology, isn't he?\n- DB: Yes, that's right. And he's graduating in June. So I was wondering if you might be, be interested in, uh, taking over for him, taking his assistantship. Um, I don't know if you want to work, or need work, of course....\n- J: Oh! Uh- yes. Yes! That's something I would really like to do, yes. Oh. But, uh....\n- DB: But?\n- J: But...well, I guess I should find out a little bit more about it. I mean, the hours, the, um, time involved, and, and... can I do the work? I don't really know what all's involved.\n- DB: Well- have you got a little time right now?\n- J: Uh, yes- my next class's not till one. Sure.\n- DB: Good. Let's just sit down here then, shall we?\n- J: OK.\n- DB: Now, it's not a very romantic job, I'm afraid, Jack. My research assistant is mostly in charge of maintaining the laboratory animals- preparing their food, cleaning their quarters, uh, feeding and watering them, of course, and, uh, just keeping an eye on things, you know- making sure they're healthy and comfortable.\n- J: How many primates do you have in the lab?\n- DB: Twelve right now. There are ten bushbabies and two aye-ayes. The aye-aye pair are in one of the big cages, and the bushbabies are in the other two. One has a family in it- the mother and father and two babies- and the other group are unpaired juveniles, including Maisy and Daisy.\n- J: Ah.\n- DB: Oh, and there's a smaller cage with Max, the old male I started with. He's the only one you have to be careful of.\n- J: Careful of? Why?\n- DB: He bites sometimes. You can go right into the other cages, though. They're all quite friendly- sometimes too friendly. (laughs) Until you get the food set out, they'll be all over you looking for it.\n- J: Well gosh, it sounds easy enough, I suppose. I've had enough mice, hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbits over the years to know how to take care of mammals pretty well, I think. At least basically. I wanted a capuchin monkey when I was in high school, but Mother drew the line at that.\n- DB: (laughs) Well, mothers can be that way. Mine still doesn't understand how her daughter can handle \"wild varmints\". (laughs)\n- J: (laughs) What do they eat, anyway? Fruit?\n- DB: Yes, fruits, mostly- apples, grapes, pears- and also some vegetables. Lettuce, uh, carrots... we try different things sometimes. And they get mealworms for snacks. Part of your job will be to pick up the fruit and vegetables from Campus Stores- I have a standing order there- twice a week. And then you chop some of them up every morning for their rations. Larry'll show you how to do it.\n- J: And...mealworms?\n- DB: Yes, we have a couple of trays of them in the lab. You'll need to tend them, too, and sift out a few dozen every day for the bushbabies. It's easy. It only takes a few minutes.\n- J: What kind of hours are we talking about, Professor? And when during the day?\n- DB: Well, student assistantships are limited to fifteen hours a week- university regulations. The animals have to be tended every day, of course, but I'll be responsible for Sundays and holidays. The main thing is that you'll have to come in before classes, in the early morning, say about seven or seven-thirty, and, uh, spend an hour or an hour-and-a-half cleaning the cages- throwing out the old straw and laying down fresh straw, uh, washing the food bowls and giving them fresh water. And then preparing their food and giving it to them. It's a simple routine, really, when you get used to it.\n- J: OK.\n- DB: And then, I'd like you to be sure to stop by again in the late afternoons or early evenings- sometime between, oh, four and seven?- to check them, check their water, and give them a bit more fruit and their mealworms. Would you be able to do all that?\n- J: Sure, that sounds fine. My class load's not so heavy now that I'm in third year. I'm sure I can arrange my class schedule around that. Oh. Uh...can I ask how much it, um, pays?\n- DB: Oh! Sorry, Jack- of course! Fifteen dollars an hour- $225 a week. The university will withhold some for taxes and issue you a check at the end of each month. It should be for about $850, I think. But you can ask Larry.\n- J: Gee, that's fine, Dr Beech. That'll help me out a lot with my expenses. And I'm going to love getting to know your bushbabies- and aye-ayes, wow!- better. Will I have a chance, do you think, to, uh, help with your research?\n- DB: Yes, there's certainly a good chance of that, yes, if you want to. I'd be happy to have you get involved. We have a lot to learn from these \"varmints\".\n- J: (laughs) Great!\n- DB: OK then- I'll talk to Larry, and we'll see when we can get together, the three of us, and set up some time for you to start learning the routine. And I'll get the paperwork rolling tomorrow.\n- J: Thanks very much, Professor. Thank you for thinking of me.\n- DB: And thank you, Jack. I know I'll be able to rely on you. Taking care of animals requires a strong sense of responsibility, and I think you've got that. Next class, we'll set up a meeting time, OK?\n- J: OK. Thanks again! See you.\n- DB: See you, Jack.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between two students over lunch.\n- Bill: Hi, Hillary. Can I join you?\n- Hillary: Oh-- hi, Bill. Sure. Sit down. What's for lunch? Oh...you're having the beef curry, eh? I'd better warn the rest of the class.\n- B: I can't come today. I've got to skip it.\n- H: Why?\n- B: Oh, I've got to finish this motivation letter here.\n- H: Which one's that?\n- B: It's my letter for USC grad school. I've got to get it in the mail this afternoon. I've been putting it off and putting it off, but now I've really got to get it done, or I'll miss the submission deadline. So I'm going to have to miss 360 class, that's all.\n- H: Too bad. Why'n't you write it before, anyway? You're one of the most organized guys I know.\n- B: Oh, I dunno. I never do know what to say in these things exactly. And this one's really got me stumped. I really want to get into their graduate International Affairs program-- so this one's got to be just right, you know?\n- H: So...what's wrong with it? Can I see what you've got so far?\n- B: Huh? Oh. Sure. Here you go. It's just that, uh, I can't find that, you know, balance between eagerness and uh, effusiveness. I mean, how to show them I'm sincere. I want to tell them that I really want to get into that program, and that I think I've got the background to do well in it-- but I can't sound like some, well, wet-behind-the-ears, stars-in-my-eyes wannabe, either.\n- H: Yeah. I know what you mean. It's hard, isn't it? It's a fine line to walk. Lemmee see...mmm...this is nice-- \"The political turmoil that has brought in the 21st century\"...catchy! Hmm... Oh, but this-- \"I really feel my qualifications...\" Naw, that's no good, Bill. That sounds really canned. And you shouldn't have to say you \"feel\"-- that feeling should come out in the context-- and \"really\" certainly doesn't belong anywhere near a formal letter!\n- B: Oh.\n- H: Just cut that clause out and get right into it: \"My qualifications match the prerequisites you indicate and...\". Hmm. But then you don't mention them at all.\n- B: Mention what? The prerequisites?\n- H: Neither one. You haven't given any details either about your qualifications or about the prerequisites that USC wants.\n- B: Well, they know their own prerequisites, don't they?\n- H: Yes, of course-- but a smart applicant would remind them.\n- B: And my CV is going to be attached to this-- and it lists all my education and experience-- in gory detail.\n- H: Yeah, but even so-- you ought to give them, maybe, some examples at least, some key examples, here in the letter. If you say they match, then you should match them up right here. You know, like...uh, what?-- you've taken a heckuva lot of languages, haven't you? What are you taking this year?\n- B: Uh...second year German and first year Japanese.\n- H: Well, put those in here. Be specific. \"My language credits in French, German and Japanese, in addition to the fact that I am bilingual in Spanish and English, abundantly satisfy your language prerequisite.\" You've got to impress them with the truth, Bill, really. And nothing sounds more truthful than specific details-- details that can be checked and verified. And then, help them, help them think it out-- \"My language experience has already provided me a good grounding in many cross-cultural basics.\"-- something like that.\n- B: But isn't all that going to make this thing 'way too long? I've always read you're not supposed to go over one, a single, page with a cover letter.\n- H: But this isn't a cover letter. Well, yes, it's a kind of a cover letter-- but it's more than that. It's supposed to show what makes you tick-- who you are, and what you want out of life. What you want out of that USC program.\n- B: So...\n- H: So don't worry about length. As long as you're not just creating padding, not creating filler, as long as you're giving them good solid useful information about your abilities and goals, they'll keep reading. And they'll get a good clear picture of who you are as a candidate.\n- B: So, what do you think then? Two pages?\n- H: Sure, that'll be fine. As long as you have something relevant to say.\n- B: But I'm running out of time on this.\n- H: Look-- isn't this important? You can do this.\n- B: Well, OK then. Whatever you say. Uh-- would you have a chance to take one more look at this thing before I send it off?\n- H: Yeah, I guess so. When? I thought you were in a rush to get this off.\n- B: Yeah, I am. But I think I can get this revised and ready by the end of our 360 lecture...\n- H: -- the one you're skipping?\n- B: Yes. So I could bring it over to you at the end of class.\n- H: Or-- where are you going to work on it? Here?\n- B: Yep. I'm going to be sitting right here till it's done.\n- H: Well then, why don't I just come back here after class and find you?\n- B: That'd be great, Hillary. I'd really appreciate it.\n- H: No problem. Anything to get you out of here and into another university. (laughs)\n- B (laughs): Aw, c'mon! Anyway, thanks. Really.\n- H: See you in a couple of hours, then.\n- B: OK, great!",

We expect it to slow to light drizzle by tomorrow morning, followed by a partly cloudy afternoon. And Wednesday and Thursday are shaping up to be partly sunny.\n- That's great! Will the sun stick around for the weekend?\n- It probably will. As we look at the weather map, we can see this low-pressure front moving our way is pushing out the clouds, bringing sunshine and warmer temperatures.",

But we've been approached by other cities offering more attractive options, in terms of tax rates and special incentives, and asking us if we'd consider a change.\n- How have the mayor and city council responded to these concerns?\n- Well, they're aware of the offers, and we're continuing negotiations. Our position is that we provide a lot of jobs and a lot of income to this community over the past quarter century, but we will have difficulty continuing to do so with the current tax structure.\n- Have you set a deadline for making a decision?",

I started taking the subway two years ago, and it's wonderful! From the Scott Street station, it's only a block and a half to our building. And going home, the 52nd Street stop is only two blocks from my apartment. When I was driving, I wasn't getting nearly as much exercise.\n- Exactly! Plus, the subway's cheaper than gas in the long run. And the trains leave every 15 minutes, so if I miss one I don't have to wait long for another. So, did you say we should get off at Scott Street?",

And I've got all the other required credits, and then some- I've actually taken more electives than I need to.\n- C: Hmm. Too many electives and missed a prerequisite. Good work, Lisle.\n- L: Yeah, pretty dumb, eh?\n- C: OK, well- they're both offered this term, I hope?\n- L: Oh yes. Global Economics is Tuesday-Thursdays at three pm and Econometrics is the same days at eleven in the morning. Those would work fine, except, uh....\n- C: Except what?\n- L: Except I've already signed up for the second half of my statistics course- Stats 202- at eleven.\n- C: Is that a required course?\n- L: No, but it's highly recommended for business majors. And I really need that math. Math is my weak point, I'm afraid, and I'm going to use a lot of it if I go into finance like I want to.\n- C: Lisle, do you know what, um, Econometrics is?\n- L: Sure! Uh... I guess- what? It's, uh, \"measuring economies\"- \"econo-\" plus \"-metrics\"- isn't it?\n- C: It's math, Lisle. Statistics. It's a course in the kinds of statistics used in business, finance, and economics.\n- L: Oh!... Oh... so maybe I don't need Stats 202 then?\n- C: That's right. Bus Ad makes sure you get the necessary math by requiring Econometrics. But- you've taken Statistics 201 already?\n- L: Yes.\n- C: Hmm. Listen- there may be another solution to this. The dean might accept Stats 201-202 in place of Econometrics.\n- L: Really? That'd be great!\n- C: He might. Anyway, I'm going to have to call his office about this- about both possibilities- right away. Let me just see what they say. If you had a choice, which option would it be?\n- L: Uh... well, unless they really want me to take Econometrics, I think it would be easier if I completed the second half of my statistics course. I mean, then I'd have the whole course under my belt. But whatever the dean wants- I'm happy to do whatever it takes to graduate on time.\n- C: OK, good. Well, with two options, he may be more amenable to exempting you from the prerequisite. Can you bring me a copy of your transcript later today?\n- L: I've got one right here, Mrs Morgan. Here you go.\n- C: Ah. Mmm. Yes. it does look good, Lisle- three point seven and a good scattering of 'A's, too! OK. I'll arrange to see the dean as soon as I can- if not today, then tomorrow morning, I hope. And we'll try to get this straightened out for you. Stop by tomorrow afternoon about three, will you?\n- L: Sure! And thanks. Thank you very much.\n- C: OK. And don't worry too much. The dean can be quite flexible in a good cause. See you tomorrow, then.\n- L: Thanks so much, Mrs Morgan. See you tomorrow afternoon at three.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a professor and his student.\n- Professor: Hello, Michelle. Can I help you?\n- Student: Hello, Professor. I was wondering if you had a few minutes to, uh, talk to me about my essays.\n- P: Sure. Sit down.\n- S: Thanks. Professor, you, uh, you gave me a C plus on my last essay. That's the third C you've given me now. I guess I just don't understand what it is you're looking for.\n- P: Well, you're not alone, Michelle. I'm afraid most of the class is doing poorly this term. Now, I've tried to explain what I want you all to do several times now, but nobody seems to get it. I guess I'm a failure as a teacher.\n- S: (laughs) I don't think so. But, I'm sorry- would you mind trying one more time with me? I understand that you want to see a clear, efficient development of the thesis and all that, and I thought I'd done that this time, I really did.\n- P: Have you got your paper with you?\n- S: Yes...here it is...right here.\n- P: Let me have a look.\n- S: Sure! Here.\n- P: Mmm...yes...I remember now. Actually, Michelle, you have a very good thesis here. I like it. I just wish you could've presented it more effectively.\n- S: In what, in what way?\n- P: Well...just look at your opening sentence. This is the first sentence that the reader meets. \"Most authorities consider the zygote the initiation of a new existence.\" Now tell me, Michelle, if the average person picked this up and started reading it, would they understand that?\n- S: Well, um...I hope so. I mean, I presume so- that's what I presumed when I wrote it, of course.\n- P: Of course. It seems short and direct. But you must remember that when you wrote this, you had been reading and researching your topic beforehand- I hope- but the reader is coming to this cold. How many people know what a zygote is? How self-evident is the meaning of \"a new existence\"? That's a very abstract phrase.\n- S: Yeah, I guess so.\n- P: Michelle, the writer's first duty is to his readership and his second duty is to his thesis. Think of all the articles you've read that've been built on flimsy arguments, misconceptions or untruths, and yet have become widely popular, have enjoyed wide acceptance because of the writer's talent at communicating.\n- S: Yeah, there're a lot of those. You want us to write like that?\n- P: (laughs) Well, I certainly don't want you to be promulgating untruths- that's what I hope I'm helping my students avoid- but it would be worth your while to notice how some of those writers do it. The key to effective writing is \"Know thy readership\"- assess your reader accurately.\n- S: What they know, right?\n- P: Exactly! What they know... and what they don't know. If you talk down to them, they feel insulted. They say to themselves, \"Does he think I'm stupid or something?\" And they walk away.\n- S: Well, I don't think that, that's for sure.\n- P: Maybe not, but your opening sentence borders on the other extreme- if you expect too much of your readers, you'll also put them off. They'll say to themselves, \"Who does he think I am, Einstein?\" And again, they'll walk away.\n- S: Well, um...so, what should I do, for instance, with this first sentence here? I can't make the grammar any simpler, can I?\n- P: No, but you can certainly tone down the vocabulary. Either that or define difficult or arcane words when you use them. But that usually slows things down. Anyway, you have to bring yourself and the reader to the same level somehow- that's what you should always be shooting for.\n- S: So... I should define 'zygote' right off the bat- \"...a zygote, or fertilized egg,....\"\n- P: That's the idea...but keep it short, or you'll lose the effectiveness of your opening. Why not just go ahead and use 'egg'? Then you can introduce the more, uh, precise scientific term later in the paragraph.\n- S: Just \"An egg is...\"?\n- P: Sure. It's strong and clear, which is just what you want in order to interest your reader. You have a whole essay to be more precise in, to get down to the details.\n- S: Then what about the rest? You said that \"initiation of a new existence\" is too, um, too....\n- P: Too abstract. OK, just tell me this: what do you mean by that phrase?\n- S: Well, uh... it means, um, the start of a new life, a new living thing....\n- P: Good! Well, why didn't you say that in the first place? That's much more direct and attention-getting. It's expressed in a way that anyone can understand. \"An egg is the start- or the beginning- of a new life\".\n- S: But...does that sound, well...formal enough, Professor?\n- P: Don't confuse formality with obfuscation, Michelle. You don't have to write densely to be formal- and lord knows you don't have to use big words! You just need to avoid slang and, uh, casual language. And be sure that the grammar is standard. Write clearly, simply, directly- that's what makes a good essay.\n- S: OK. Maybe I've just gotten a better idea of what you're looking for now. \"Clear, simple, direct.\" I'll remember that next time.\n- P: Good. And I'll be looking forward to how well you succeed. I'm not averse to giving A grades if they're deserved, you know.\n- S: Thanks for your time, Professor. I really appreciate your help.\n- P: Not at all, Michelle. That's what I'm hear for. See you in class.\n- S: See you.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a student and a university service representative.\n- Student: Hi, I want to get a pass for the Intramural Activities Center this quarter, please.\n- Rep: Sure. In need to see your student ID card, please. OK, thank you. Now, which type of IMA pass would you like to buy?\n- S: Um, I don't know. How many different kinds of passes are there?\n- R: Well, there's a basic pass. That allows you to use the basketball courts, the fitness center, the racquetball courts, the rock-climbing center, and the indoor track. An IMA super pass lets you use all those things, and also the swimming pools, tennis courts, and golf driving range. Then we have, um, specialized passes for just the swimming pools and the fitness center.\n- S: Man, I didn't know this was going to be so complicated. Um, so the basic pass includes basketball, the fitness center, racquetball, and, uh, what else?\n- R: The rock-climbing center and the indoor track. It costs $50 for the quarter.\n- S: And the Super Pass has all those things, plus swimming, tennis, and the golf driving range, right?\n- R: Yes, that's correct. The super pass is $75 for the quarter. It also permits you use the IMA Center during the two-week Christmas vacation, if you're going to be here.\n- S: So, the basic pass is $50 for the quarter, and the super pass is, uh, 75, but the super pass it gives you two extra weeks. And um, you mentioned there were also special passes?\n- R: Yes, we have a swim-only pass for $35. This lets you use either one of our two swimming pools, plus the sauna and whirlpools in the locker room. There's also a pass for the fitness center only. It costs $40, and gives you access to all the weight machines and fitness machines, as well as the locker- room sauna and whirlpools.\n- S: All right, let's see if I've got this straight. The swim pass is $35, and the fitness center pass is $40. And both of these include access to the whirlpools and saunas in the locker room?\n- R: Correct. Oh, and one other thing I forgot to mention is that the fitness pass includes a 15-percent discount on all of our IMA sports and fitness classes.\n- S: What kinds of sports and fitness classes do you have?\n- R: Oh, my! We have several different kinds of dance classes, yoga, aerobics, swim conditioning, Tae Kwon Do....here's a brochure with all the details.\n- S: Thanks. So, these classes, there's an extra fee for them, even if I have a super pass?\n- R: I'm afraid so, because we have to pay the teachers' salaries and the cost of equipment.\n- S: OK. Uh, mmm...oh yeah, what about someone who isn't a university student? Is there some kind of pass that they could buy?\n- R: No, I'm afraid not. IMA passes are only offered to registered students and faculty. Guests have to be accompanied by a student or faculty member. They pay $10 each time they come.\n- S: Can students pay the same way, I mean, each time they come?\n- R: Yes, but if you're going to come very often it's better to buy a pass. The student price is $5 per visit. If you use the IMA even once a week, you'll save money buying a pass.\n- S: Well, thanks for all the information. There are so many choices, I can't make a decision right now. I'll think about it, then come back later in the week.\n- R: No problem. We're open Monday through Thursday from 8 to 12, then 1 to 4:30, and from 1 to 5:30 on Friday. If you have any more questions, you can call the phone number on the brochure.",

Did you want a limited or unlimited? And just for fall quarter, or for the entire school year?\n- S: I was thinking of one for the whole year, but I'm not sure. Does the year include summer quarter? 'Cause I won't be here then.\n- E: No, summer term is extra. The year includes fall, winter and spring quarters. A yearly pass is valid only from the start of fall term to the end of spring term. This year, that's, uh, let's see...[rustling paper] Sept. 22nd to June 7th.\n- S: Oh, OK. And you said there were two different kinds? Uh, limited and unlimited?\n- E: Yes. A limited pass lets you park in any campus lot only on days school is in session. During holidays and on weekends, you would have to pay the normal parking rate. With an unlimited pass, you can park in any lot on any day during the school year, including weekends and holidays. Like I said, between Sept. 22nd and June 7th.\n- S: Hmm...how much do they cost?\n- E: A limited pass is $100, and an unlimited is $150.\n- S: All right, I'll buy an unlimited, I guess. What do I have to do?\n- E: First, I'm going to give you a registration form. This gives us information about your car. Fill it out, and bring it back to me when you're ready. You can pay by cash, check, or credit card. Then, I'll give you a sticker to put on the corner of your windshield. Make sure that sticker is in place when you park. Otherwise, you will get a ticket.\n- S: No problem. So, um, does this pass guarantee that I'll get a parking space? I mean, are there, like, special places set aside in each lot for people with parking passes?\n- E: That's a good question. Uh, unfortunately, the answer is no. Parking is on a first-come, first-serve basis. If a lot is full, you'll have to park somewhere else, or wait until another car leaves.\n- S: I see. How much does, um, regular parking cost? Without a pass?\n- E: It's two dollars an hour, or $10 a day. You're getting an excellent deal.\n- S: Thank you. Oh, just one more question. Do you need all the money up front, or can I make payments?\n- E: I'm afraid I need it all at once. Sorry.",

Caesar's for me.... Oh, hand me some, uh, oil-and-vinegar, will you?\n- A: Here. Hmm... And the lettuce looks wilted. Fruit for me, I guess.\n- B: Grapes? I thought you didn't like them.\n- A: I don't like the green ones, that's all.\n- B: Oh.\n- A: And lessee.... Today's entrees are- Salisbury steak...buffalo wings...filet of sole...and uh, veal cutlets. Hmm. I guess I'll have fish again.\n- B: Why? Low cholesterol?\n- A: No, it just looks better than the rest. Like it might be edible.\n- B: (Laughs) I see. (To the server) Give me the veal please, with, uh, mashed potatoes and, um, string beans, I guess.\n- A: Did you finish your homework?\n- B: For Art History? Sort of. I've got my talk down, I think. But I've still got to make copies of one of his paintings for the class. I thought I'd do that right after lunch- it won't take a minute.\n- A: Who've you got again?\n- B: Turner. I found a really great print of his- \"Landscape with Walton Bridges\" it's called. (To the server) Oh, thank you.\n- A: (To the server) And I'll have the sole. And fries, and, uh, succotash. (To Betty) Are you going to make color copies? They're not cheap.\n- B: Yeah, but they're worth it. \"Walton Bridges\" is really fantastic. I'll show you when we sit down.\n- A: OK.

The guy with the moustache.\n- B: (laughs) Oh, yeah! The guy with the moustache. Do you think he was crazy?\n- A: Crazy like a fox, maybe. He made a lot of money later on his career, cranking out trash for the most part. He put on a real, um, show, though, didn't he?\n- B: (laughs) Sure did.\n- A: But I really admire his imagination- some really wild stuff, those melted clocks and hollow beasts. Very evocative images. And actually, he did a lot of research. Do you know the story about his Corpus Hypercubus?\n- B: His what?\n- A: It's a cubist painting of the Crucifixion- you know, of Christ on the Cross.\n- B: No, what's the story?\n- A: Well, you'll have to wait for class- I'm still working on it.\n- B: Aw, c'mon!\n- A: No, I can't, really. It's about the mathematics he used, but I've gotta tell it right. And I gotta get that together right after lunch! Can I see your Turner print, though?\n- B: Oh. Yes, sure. I've got it right, um...here.\n- A: Wow.\n- B: Isn't that great? Look at that light!\n- A: It's so Italianate- the pastoral atmosphere is so thick you could cut it with a knife! Turner's so modern, isn't he? All colour and mood, and almost no form, except for these wispy trees here. Truly amazing! There's every imaginable shade of gold in there, isn't there?\n- B: Can you believe this was painted before the middle of the 19th century?\n- A: Really, eh? Are you going to eat the rest of that salad?\n- B: No, you can have it. Here. Are you going to stay here and finish your presentation?\n- A: Yeah. We've still got over an hour before class.\n- B: OK, then. I'm going to just run over to the Campus Shop and get this xeroxed and then come back. How many do I need? Ten?\n- A: Plus one for Dr Auburn- that's eleven. But if they're too expensive, I don't need one. I've seen it already.\n- B: (laughs) It's not going to break me. You get one too. See you.\n- A: Yeah, OK. See you here in a few minutes then.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to two roommates talking about fraternities.\nEddie: Oh hi, Marlon. I didn't hear you come in.\nMarlon: Shower's too loud. Boy, you sure take long ones. Doesn't your mother complain?\nE: Every time. She says I double the water bill.\n- I can believe it.\nE: But a shower doesn't use nearly as much water as taking a bath does. 'Course, you wouldn't know- you don't use either one.\n- Haw! You'd know if I didn't. You wouldn't be able to breathe in here right now. What's the occasion?\nE: It's Rush Week, my man. I've got a fraternity to check out tonight. Omega Theta.\n- Omega Theta? Really? They rushed you? That's a feather in your cap- Everybodys says they're really cool.\nE: Yeah, they are. But they've also got a good reputation for academics, too. They've got the highest GPA on Fraternity Row..\n- Hmm- that means you're gonna have to keep up your average, too.\nE: Yeah, but I figure that'll be easier to do with a little help from some Omega Theta friends.\n- You've got friends there?\nE: I will if I join. They've got a pretty strict study regimen: everyone gets assigned a tutor- an upper-class brother- kind of an academic buddy system. They say it works good.\n- Sounds good if you need that.\nE: And I do. I'm not a self-starter at all. Left to myself, I tend to fiddle around and get nothing done.\n- Me too, I guess- if I go to the library or the coffee shop to study, I do better, but if I sit around here, I just dawdle. I listen to music or pick at the guitar or, uh, anything to avoid getting down to my assignments.\nE: That's why I think Omega Theta is a good idea.\n- But what about the really important stuff?\nE: Huh? What's that?\n- Their parties! They don't have much of a rep as a party house.\nE: No, they don't.\n- Well? Isn't that the main reason for joining a fraternity- to party and meet girls?\nE: (laughs) For some guys, I guess so, yes. I like to party too, but not every weekend like the Delta Taus do. Now, that's a real animal house- talk about reputation!\n- Yeah, probably a little much for me, too, when I think about it. We gotta stay a bit serious, after all- we've gotta find jobs when we leave here!\nE: Anyway, Omega Theta does throw a good party or two along the way, just before Christmas and Easter break- and at Halloween, of course.\n- Oh boy! I hope you'll invite me to that one! I love Halloween parties!\nE: Sure, if I can- but I haven't even been invited to join yet.\n- Oh yeah, I forgot. Well, I want to hear how it goes tonight.\nE: You bet. Reception's at six-thirty, dinner's at seven. There'll be some talking and a tour of the house and some one-on-one. No alcohol, I think. So I should be back here by nine-thirty or ten at the latest. Then I'll spill all.\n- Hey! I just thought of something! If you join Omega Theta and move into their house, what am I gonna do for a roommate?\nE: No, no, you're stuck with me for a while yet in any case. They don't have freshman residents, just upper classmen., and not a lot of those. It's not a big house.\n- How many are staying there anyway?\nE: I dunno- about a dozen or so, I think. I think they've got five or six bedrooms. Everybody else is in the dorms or off campus. But they've got a big hall that'll hold thirty or forty brothers for meetings and cram sessions and things.\n- Huh! Well, I don't want to hold you up. It's almost six o'clock now.\nE: What? Yipes! I gotta go get dressed and get outta here!\n- I'll leave you to it. I'm going over to the Campus Club and see if there's a good movie on.\nE: Don't you have anything better to do?\n- Naw. No one's rushing me tonight. Maybe it's the garlic I ate at lunch.\nE: (laughs) Couldn't be your personality, could it?\n- Thanks. You're my pal, too. Lock the door when you leave, will you?\nE: Yep. See you about ten?\n- If the movie's over. If there is one. Otherwise, I'll just be hanging out back here.\nE: OK. See you later.\n- See you. Have fun!",

Great! And you're a Canadian citizen?\nS: Yes, I am.\nI: Good. OK, that's all I really need right now. Now, you said you'll be getting your bachelor's in computer science. Why did you choose that field?\nS: Oh, wow- I've never thought of any other career for myself. I've always been into computers, ever since I was in elementary school. My father bought me my first one, a used, uh, Apple MacIntosh, when I was eleven years old, and I've been sitting in front of a computer ever since. I, uh, got interested in how they work, you know, and, well, I kind of tore that old Mac SE apart circuit by circuit when it died.\nI: Oh, you have good mechanical skills, then?\nS: (laughs) No, I'm afraid not! I made a real mess of the Mac. I'm, I'm all thumbs, actually- but it satisfied my curiosity. I'm more interested in software programming now.\nI: Well, we certainly always have a need for good programmers. What programming courses have you taken here?\nS: Actually, I didn't, uh, start here at UBC. I transferred in from Corolla College. It's a community college. I took their two-year diploma in Computing. I had Visual Basic and Cobol there.\nI: How were your grades?\nS: Oh, good! Those courses were really exciting for me. I got As in both of them. And, um, then here at UBC, I've taken Oracle and C-and-C++ programming. So I think I've got a solid background in computer languages now.\nI: Have you done much programming?\nS: You mean outside the classes? Uh, well, no, I wouldn't say so, really. Just my class projects. My father was interested in building an oddsmaking program for horse racing, and I helped him put that together, but I've never down any real, um, commercial work of any kind.\nI: Horse racing? (laughs) Does it work?\nS: Well...yeah, the program runs OK. But he hasn't had much luck at the track yet. I think the problem is his input data. (laughs)\nI: (laughs) I see. Well now, at IT Solutions, we have two divisions I think you might be interested in. Our Industrial Systems Division is doing a lot of work right now in nano-programming, with a lot of potential in, uh, medicine, and also in, um, aeronautics. They're into some real cutting-edge stuff there...\nS: Gee, that sounds intriguing- capsule computers and all that, eh?\nI: Yes, that's right. And our Consumer Software Division is busy now, um, trying to get the last bugs out of our new wristband cellphone. We're about ready to hit the market with it, so there's a lot of activity going on there these days.\nS: Almost out? That's great! I've been waiting to get my hands on one of those. After all the hype, I hope we're not going to be disappointed.\nI: (laughs) No, I guarantee you won't! It's going to be a real eye-opener. And maybe we can get you involved with the next generation.\nS: Really? That would be something!\nI: But what we'd like you to do first is get your transcripts sent in to us. Here- here's my card. Just have them snailed to this address and to my attention. Oh- sorry, my name's Ed Freeberg...here.\nS: OK, sure! I'll run over to the Registrar's and have that done right away.\nI: And then we'd like you to come in to our offices sometime in the next couple of weeks to, uh, you know, just have a look around and have a chance to talk to some of the division staff and HR people. How does that sound?\nS: That sounds great, Mr Freeberg. Thank you.\nI: Good! Well, uh, what would be a good day for you, do you think?\nS: Uh...lessee... um, next Tuesday or Thursday would be real good. I've got no classes those days right now.\nI: Ah. OK then.... how about the... fifteenth, Thursday, at, say... ten o'clock?\nS: Thursday. Ten a.m. Yes, that's fine.\nI: And if you will just come to the Main Reception- here, at this address- and ask for me, that's Ed Freeberg- they'll let me know you're there, and I'll come down and get you.\nS: OK, great! I'll be there. Thank you very much.\nI: And thanks for coming in to see us. You may have a great future with IT Solutions.\nS: I hope so! (laughs) Thank you.\nI: See you next Thursday, then. Goodbye.\nS: Goodbye.",

Could I speak to you for a moment, please?\nResident: Uh, sure, Mrs Miller. Just let me stick these groceries inside my door, will you?\nD\n- Of course, dear.\nR: Mmm...ah...there. Now- what can I do for you?\nD\n- Come on in. Sit down.\nR: Thanks.\nD\n- Just over here is fine. Yes. Just shopping?\nR: Ah. Yes. The supermarket was crowded this morning. It always is Sunday. I should have learned that by now. Is there a problem?\nD\n- Hum. Well, sort of, I think. I understand there's been some hazing going on.\nR: Oh. (sigh) Yes, there has. Everybody's restless before the end of the term, and...you know....\nD\n- Yes, I'm afraid I do. Listen- a little fooling around is all right. It's just natural for you girls to let off a little steam now and then. But we don't want it to get out of hand.\nR: No, of course not.\nD\n- I heard that there's been some tears over this.\nR: Yeah. Martha was a little upset last night. She thinks everyone is bullying her.\nD\n- Are they?\nR: No, not really. It's just that Martha's so easy to tease, I guess.\nD\n- Yes, I imagine she is. She doesn't have much self-confidence. Did you know that she's having a hard time keeping up her grades this term?\nR: What? Really? I thought she was very smart. Everybody thinks she's kind of an egghead.\nD\n- Well, that's not a very nice word, but you're right- Martha is a very intelligent young lady. But she's had some personal problems recently, and they've been getting her down.\nR: What problems?\nD\n- Well, her father passed away a couple of months ago. She's still having trouble accepting his death, and what's more, she's worried about whether she can stay in school now, or whether she should forget about school now and, uh, help support her family.\nR: Oh...gosh.\nD\n- Yes. She's worried about money, and she's worried about her, uh, responsibility to her mother. She doesn't know if she can afford to continue here.\nR: Gee- none of us knew that. She doesn't talk much, you know.\nD\n- That's why I wanted to let you know. It's really private information, and maybe I shouldn't've told you, but I thought, well, maybe a word to the wise, you know, would be sufficient. You're kind of a, a social leader here, Sarah, so I thought you might- you know- spread the word. Discreetly, of course.\nR: Yes, yes- of course, Mrs Miller. I'll mention it to the others as soon as I get a chance to.\nD\n- Thank you. I know they mean no real harm, but-\nR: No, they don't. But sometimes we can be a little thoughtless, I guess. Is there anything we can do, do you think, to help Martha?\nD\n- You mean about her schooling? Well, um, I hadn't thought about that, really. There might be.\nR: I mean, maybe we could raise some money for her somehow. Oh, uh, have a sale or a benefit, or, um, find her a scholarship or something.\nD\n- Well now, that's a nice idea, Sarah! She has only one year left to graduate, doesn't she?\nR: Yes, that's right- so we only have to come up with about five thousand dollars or so, maybe.\nD\n- Ye...es- but we really ought to talk to her about this first. I don't know what she might think about that. Martha has to make her own decisions about what she wants to do with her life. She may have decided that she wants to quit school and go to work anyway.\nR: But that would be such a shame, after she's, she's come so far! And she's so bright! It would be a real waste for her to quit now.\nD\n- Well, you'd better talk to her about that.\nR: OK, I will- and straight away. Do you know if she's in now?\nD\n- I don't think so, dear. I saw her earlier and she was on her way out. She said she had some business to take care of- at the post office, I think she said.\nR: Well, that shouldn't take too long. Maybe she's back by now. I'll go and check, anyway. After I stop by a couple of other rooms, that is.\nD\n- Thanks for your help with this, Sarah. You know, I'm really going to miss you when you graduate. You've been a fine role model while you've been here- the girls all really respect you- and you've certainly been a lot of help to me.\nR: Oh, Mrs Miller, it's nothing, really. My mom just raised me right, I guess!\nD\n- She sure did, honey. Listen- after you talk to Martha and the other girls, could you stop back by and kind of, um, fill me in? Just so I know where everything stands.\nR: Sure thing, Mrs Miller. I've just got to put my groceries away. Then I'll get going on this.\nD\n- And I'll think some more about how we might be able to give Martha a hand- or at least some moral support.\nR: That'd be great. And so will I. Yes, the least we can do is be kinder and more attentive to her. See you in, um...a couple of hours, maybe?\nD\n- OK, dear- and good luck!\nR: Bye.",

Yes, I'm afraid the smoker's lounge is about the only place I can relax in around here. Can I do something for you, or are you just slumming?\n- H: Well, I was just wondering... You teach the afternoon section of Modern Social Systems, don't you?\n- R: Yes, that's me. Why?\n- H: Have you got a student in there by the name of Steiger, Sara Steiger?\n- R: Sara? Yes-- you know her?\n- H: I sure do. She's in my undergrad psychology seminar. She's beginning to be a real problem for the class, and I was just wondering how you were handling her. Or is she OK in your class?\n- R: OK? Uh. Yes. Well, not really-- but she's just eager to learn, I think, don't you?\n- H: You think so? That's why she never stops asking questions? I'll tell you what I think-- I think she already knows the answers before she asks. Or she's just asking for the sake of asking.\n- R: Huh? Why's that?\n- H: Well, half the time she wants to know about something we've already discussed in some detail, and half the time she has questions that are off-topic or, well, just, uh, mindless.\n- R: (sighs) I suppose you could be right about that. Sara can certainly be irritating sometimes. Sometimes I feel I'm cheating the rest of the students by spending so much time explaining things to her.\n- H: Exactly. And I can see them all rolling their eyes. (laughs) The rest of my class is a little irritated with her, too.\n- R: Maybe we should give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she's just trying too hard, I dunno, to learn maybe, or maybe just to make an impression on us. I don't know what her motives could be.\n- H: Yeah, well. She's making an impression, all right, but it isn't a good one. Any ideas? Pro-active ones, I mean.\n- R: Well, I guess we should have a talk with her.\n- H: A talk? A private one, you mean?\n- R: Yeah. It's either that, or just give her the cold shoulder.\n- H: I'm afraid I've already been giving her a bit of that. I thought maybe she'd take the hint and sit back, listen and take notes for a change.\n- R: She doesn't-- Doesn't she take any notes? She does in my class-- voluminous ones!\n- H: Are you sure, Roger?\n- R: Sure, I'm sure-- she's always scribbling away.\n- H: But have you seen Sara's notes?\n- R: Well, no, but--\n- H: I have. I took a peek over her shoulder a couple of times. She's a doodler.\n- R: A what?! She doodles?\n- H: All over her notebook. I don't think she's keeping any kind of notes or paying any attention at all to what I'm saying or what anyone else says in class. She's just daydreaming-- or dreaming up something irrelevant to inquire into. This morning we'd been talking about Jung's theory of archetypes, and she suddenly blurted out 'What's an archtype?' Well, we'd been discussing archtypes for half an hour by then, and it was like she'd just realized that she'd heard a strange word, when the conversation was almost over.\n- R: Heh! That's Sara, all right. OK then, who's going to talk to her, you or me?\n- H: Umm..\n- R: OK, OK, I'll see if I can get her to come in and talk to me later this week. I'll be seeing her in class tomorrow afternoon, I guess. Maybe I can get her to settle down a little. ...She doodles?!\n- H: Yes! (laughs) Pretty good, really. Complex, architectural, rococo things. Maybe she should go to art school instead of majoring in sociology.\n- R: That's Sara's major, is it?\n- H: I think so-- I think she mentioned that once. Anyway, yes: if you could have a little talk with her, that would be great. And let me know what happens, what you find out, will you?\n- R: Of course. I'll let you know how it goes.\n- H: Thanks, Roger, very much. I owe you one. Now, I've got to run before all this secondhand smoke does me in.\n- R: (laughs) Now don't start that!\n- H: (laughs) All right-- but you know you should really try to---\n- R: Henry!\n- H: OK. Thanks. See you.\n- R: Talk to you soon.",

You're going to be in good shape for the intermurals next month.\n- Cindy: (gasping) Yeh. Whoo! If you don't kill me first. Wah! Whoosh....ohh.\n- Coach: OK, I get the hint. You can call it a day. Just be back here tomorrow at the same time, eh?\n- Cindy: I'll be here, but... can I talk to you a minute about something, Coach?\n- Coach: Sure. What is it?\n- Cindy: Coach, I'm not, uh, I'm not doing so good in my courses this term.\n- Coach: Huh? What? I thought you were an 'A' student. How bad could your grades be?\n- Cindy: Pretty bad, coach. The courses are getting harder. My grades are pretty awful in Cost Accounting, and I'm failing outright in Economics. I'm just not getting the work done that I need to do. I just don't have enough time.\n- Coach: How'd you do on your midterms?\n- Cindy: Not so good either. 62 percent on the Economics test, 73 percent in Cost Accounting. And 79 percent in Marketing- and that's supposed to be an easy course! I'm not going to graduate, with those kinds of scores. I've got to get a lot more studying in before the finals, that's all there is to it.\n- Coach: Oh. Um. So?\n- Cindy: So... I'm not sure how much time I can give to football anymore. I was wondering, wondering, uh.... how would it be if maybe I moved back to the B Squad- kind of 'in reserve', so to speak?\n- Coach: 'In reserve'?! Cindy, you're the best forward we've got!\n- Cindy: I dunno, Coach- Marly's good too. She just needs a chance to show her stuff.\n- Coach: Yeah, but- she's not you, Cindy, and I- the team- we're counting on you. We've got to take on SFU first off next month, and Marly's hardly played with the A Squad at all so far. I just don't know whether there's time to break her in now.\n- Cindy: Oh, I can work with her during practice, Coach. She can do it, I know she can, and--\n- Coach: Wait a minute, wait a minute- don't we have any other option?\n- Cindy: What option is that?\n- Coach: Well... how about a tutor? Yeah, how about us finding you a tutor for those courses? Somebody that, you know, could kind of give you what you need to pass your finals.\n- Cindy: Aw, Coach, I've gotta learn all this stuff myself. There's life after football, you know! There's a lot of competition for jobs out there when I graduate- IF I graduate!\n- Coach: (laughs) I know, Cindy. You're absolutely right- I just don't want to lose you right before the tournament. You've worked so hard to get this far- and so have all your teammates.\n- Cindy: Yeah. That's why I feel so bad about this. But I need this time to study, I really do.\n- Coach: I know I'm just clutching at straws now, but how about this, then?- I let you work Marly into your position in A Squad this week, and then you take the next two weeks completely off from practice, study hard, and- when's your first exam?\n- Cindy: Uh... Economics is first. March 30th.\n- Coach: OK, you take all the time off you need until then, and if you pass that exam, come back for the first round of the tournament at least, OK? That's the big one. If we can get past SFU, then confidence will carry us along from there. And we'll also have time then to reassess your situation. Deal?\n- Cindy: Can't make a deal yet, Coach, I just can't. Let me sleep on it, will you? Let me look at my schedule and try to figure this all out, and then I'll get back to you. I promise.\n- Coach: And think about that tutor, too. We'll get you one of those too, if you think it will help. I don't want to jeopardize your career any more than you do, and grades come first in my books, too.\n- Cindy: Thanks, really- I feel like you're taking real good care of me.\n- Coach: Yeah, well, just take your time- you gotta do what you gotta do. But think it over. You're going to leave a big hole in the offense if you take off.\n- Cindy: Thanks. Anyway, I'll be in tomorrow afternoon for more of your torture. Right now I gotta take a shower and get out of here.\n- Coach: Good. No partying tonight, you hear?\n- Cindy: Got you, Coach. G'night.",

        "name": "A conversation about toys",
        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation about toys.\n- Professor: Good morning, everyone. Let's settle down quickly, please. Today I would like to discuss toys.\n- S1: Toys, professor? What do toys have to do with social science; am I in the wrong class? (Laughter)\n- P: An excellent question, Mr. Herley. Let's explore this further. (Clears throat) Have any of you ever bought a toy for a child? Ms. Johnson?\n- S2: I bought a doll for my six year old niece for her birthday.\n- S1: I bought a football for my cousin, Jim.\n- P: All right. What would have happened if you gave a doll to Jim? And Ms. Johnson gave a football to her niece?\n- S1: My cousin would have been embarrassed.\n- S2: My little niece would have cried.\n- P: Why? Because society has decided what are appropriate toys for boys and girls.\n- S1: What's wrong with that?\n- P: Good question. Perhaps, fifty years ago, no one would have questioned those gifts. Those toys would have reflected the stereotypic roles of little girls growing up to become mothers. Boys were expected to play the role of a sports lover and player. If he was injured playing sports, boys were expected to \"suck it up\" and never cry.\n- Girls were expected to be \"ladies\" and certainly never sweat. (laughter)\n- P: However, in the years since then, the typical male and female roles have changed.\n- P: Let me give you an example: Three years ago, my neighbor lost his job. His wife had a high enough salary to support the family, so they decided he would stay home and be a \"house-husband\" taking care of their three small children and the housework.\n- S1: So what does that have to do with appropriate toys?\n- P: Well, he had grown-up with three older sisters and had the opportunity to play with both gender related toys. He could change diapers on a doll, or play with cars and trucks. In short, his parents did not set limitations on using gender related toys. As a result, the children were all confident in playing with dolls, trucks, cooking, cleaning, sewing or going out for sports. This confidence prepared them for adult roles.\n- S2: But that's just one example...\n- P: True. Let's discuss some others. Today single men are allowed to adopt children; Women have won medals in track and field, tennis, and swimming; Men can become nurses, women can be doctors. Roles that at one time would have been impossible. I'm sure you can think of others.\n- S1: Yeah, my sister always watched me play football and this year she decided to go out for the team. At first, she took a lot of razing, but the guys got over that when they saw how good she is.\n- P: Great!\n- S2: So, professor, you're saying that the toys kids play with have an affect on their future roles in society?\n- P: Yes. Let's discuss another example: When my grandmother was a child, the only toys for girls were baby dolls and baby buggies. Any little girl who stepped outside the perceived role of a genteel child was considered a \"Tom-boy.\" This was supposed the worst insult a girl could receive.\n- P: Then when my mother was a child, her toys were pretty much (false start) girls toys still focused on the role of a future homemaker and mother. However, boy's toys dealt with construction and exploration like playing with Lincoln logs, speed boats, cars, farm toys, tops, kites, buses, steam engines, circus toys and character toys. At the time, there were six toy companies that manufactured these toys, and only two companies that made dolls.\n- P: Now let's look at what toys were available when I was a child: Lionel trains, Candy Land, Checkers, Electric football, Erector sets, marbles, slingshots, Tonka trucks, View Master, and BB guns for the boys. For the girls there were dolls, doll houses, and stuffed animals.\n- S1: A gun was considered a toy?\n- P: Yes, it was a gun that shot small round pellets, mostly used to fire at a target.\n- P: By the time my children were born, the Barbie doll had made its appearance, almost replacing the baby type doll. Now young girls were introduced to various roles that \"Barbie\" played. She got out of the house to become a stewardess, a doctor, a NASCAR racer, a scientist and even an astronaut. Girls were beginning to realize there many career possibilities available to them.\n- P: In conclusion, throughout the years, toys had a profound effect on not only changing gender roles, but also in creating occupational roles for women.",

        "transcript": "- Listen to a conversation between a TEFL professor and a student after class.\nProfessor Dickens: Hello, Linda. Can I help you?\nLinda Wright: Yes, professor. I was wondering about what you said at the, at the end of your lecture, about the dangers of prescriptive grammar?\nPD: Yes?\nL\n- And well, you said that, uh, prescriptive grammar-- I mean, teaching the rules of how grammarians think people should use English-- actually impedes learning, right?\nPD: Yes, that's what I said, Linda. It does impede learning, it impedes language acquisition. Studies have actually shown that.\nL\n- But what bothers me, I guess, is that, well-- all I've ever studied is prescriptive grammar, then. That's what I've learned, and that's what I use, and that's what I know, I think. When I was in school, when I was growing up in Denver-- we learned \"I before E\", we learned to avoid \"ain't\", and double negatives, and \"they\" as a singular pronoun, and \"between you and I\", and so on, and well, just a whole slew of rules that you'd call prescriptive, I'm sure.\nPD: Yes. Yes, I would-- many of them.\nL\n- So you're saying that we shouldn't teach any of that?\nPD: \"Teach\"? No, you really shouldn't try to \"teach\" those kinds of grammar rules.\nL\n- Because they're not good rules?\nPD: Well, no, that's not it at all. Now, you've just listed a few \"rules\" that actually range very widely between good and bad. It's true that some of your students are going to need to know, to be aware of, many of those rules eventually. When they're writing business reports or college essays, for instance. But if you fill their lessons with rules, if your students are always worrying about being \"right\" or \"wrong\" instead of relaxing and just focussing on communicating, then those rules really get in the way of the learning process, of the process of language acquisition.\nL\n- But then...when-- or how-- do we...?\nPD: Discourage double negatives? Get them to say \"between you and me\"? By example, mostly. You need to have confidence in your own English as a model-- you're a native speaker, after all-- a college-educated English speaker...almost.\nLW (laughs): Soon college-educated, I hope!\nPD (laughs): Yes, I'm sure you will be. So have confidence in your own English, the English you use. Your students will hear you. They'll pay attention to how you speak, to what you say.\nL\n- But how does that help them exactly?\nPD: It lets them realize for themselves those many small elements of the language that preoccupy some grammarians so much. Tell me, Linda, why do TEFL students take classes?\nL\n- Well...to learn to speak English, don't they?\nPD: Precisely! So that's what you want them to be able to do, to be doing, in class-- speaking English. Now, if I'm a student and I say to you, \"I don't brought my homework today\"-- do you understand what I mean?\nL\n- Well, uh, sure-- you mean you didn't bring your homework.\nPD: So-- I communicated successfully, didn't I?\nL\n- Well, yes...but--\nPD: And it's important that that success should be rewarded. But if the teacher responds instead with \"No, you should say 'didn't bring'\", then the student all too often feels embarrassed or chastened, or he loses self-confidence. Not all of them, of course. But many do. The student withdraws psychologically from participation in the communication process-- and this is deadly. This is dangerous. What you want to do is complete the communicative act. Say something like, \"Oh, that's OK if you didn't bring it today. Just bring it tomorrow.\"\nL\n- Oh! So...\nPD: So, that way you haven't \"taught\" negative past formation, you have just presented it in the process of communicating. The student is happy that you understood his English, and he's happy that you're not angry about his forgetting his homework-- and he may have noticed how you formed that verb phrase. Or if he didn't, he may notice it next time. Research shows that, over time, this kind of positive reinforcement produces a much steeper learning curve.\nL\n- Yeah?\nPD: And the students, on average, attain fluency much more quickly.\nL\n- Well, I guess that makes sense, then...\nPD: What I'm arguing against, actually, is not prescriptive grammar per se-- English does have rules that speakers are judged by-- what I'm protesting is prescriptive teaching, with the teacher as lawgiver. That's what can be counter-productive.\nL\n- I think I'm beginning to get it, Doctor Dickens. Thank you very much. Will you be talking more about this later?\nPD: Oh, yes. We'll be discussing this in detail in our next class. So don't be late!\nLW (laughs): OK, I won't. Thank you for your time. See you Tuesday.",
