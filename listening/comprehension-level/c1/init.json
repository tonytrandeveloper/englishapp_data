        "transcript": "Interviewer: Today I’m going to talk to two young people who are both doing voluntary work in the sports sector. First there’s Liam Parker, who is a keen BMX biker and does a lot of work at a sports centre. And then there’s Debbie Sanford, who has volunteered to help with many different sports, and who now has a paid job with a sports organisation. So, Liam, tell us a bit about the place you work – it sounds really interesting.\nLiam: Yes, it’s really cool. Basically it’s a huge space where lots of sports and cultural events take place. It used to be a shipbuilding hangar, but the company went bust years ago. The building was taken over and completely renovated and repurposed about five years ago. Now we have facilities for all kinds of urban sports like skateboarding, breakdancing, Parkour, kick scooter …\nInterviewer: Hang on a moment, can you explain the last two?\nLiam: A kick scooter is just a normal scooter with a handlebar, deck and wheels. But now we have stunt scooters and special ones for racing. And Parkour has been around for a while now. It’s a way of moving around an urban environment – it developed from military training. It involves climbing, running, vaulting, jumping, swinging and stuff like that. Everyone’s seen it on TV and videos, people jumping off incredibly high buildings, between roofs and things.\nInterviewer: So what are you involved with?\nLiam: My passion is for BMX, and I want to get other people involved in the sport. But I do all kinds of things at the centre. I make sure the bikes and scooters meet safety standards. I check the tracks and ramps so that they are clean and no one can slip and hurt themselves. I teach kids the basics of BMX and do demonstrations. I sometimes cook in the burger van too. \nInterviewer: Right, so you’ve learned a lot of skills?\nLiam: Yeah. At first I was a bit nervous about speaking to groups, but now I have no problem giving safety inductions to people. I had to learn sports-specific first aid in case anyone hurts themselves, cooking hygiene for the burger van, maths for taking money at the till. I’ve had a lot of training in different areas and gained useful certificates.\nInterviewer: So all that training will be valuable when you come to look for paid work?\nLiam: Absolutely. I’m still only 18 and I’ve been volunteering for two years. I’d like to stay in this sector and find full-time paid work, so obviously all my experience and skills will help a lot.\nInterviewer: Thank you, Liam. And now, our other guest has made that jump from voluntary work to paid work. Debbie, you’ve been involved in many different sports in your 22 years, haven’t you?\nDebbie: Yes, quite a few! I started off playing football at county level and then got into coaching. I reckoned that I wouldn’t have been able to play football without the help of volunteers, so when I had the chance to help other people, I did. Then I started a degree in Sport Development and I realised that lots of people like me would soon have a degree and be looking for a job and I’d need more experience to compete with them all!\nInterviewer: So you volunteered again?\nDebbie: Yes, I spent a year helping with an online sports volunteering bureau and volunteered at various events including a cricket tournament, a table tennis championship and a half marathon.\nInterviewer: Wow, that’s a lot of experience!\nDebbie: Yes. I must add that I don’t actually play cricket or table tennis myself, though I do run. You don’t have to be an expert in a sport to volunteer – there are lots of jobs that need doing.\nInterviewer: And now you’ve finished your degree and you’re working.\nDebbie: That’s right. I wrote my dissertation on the retention and recruitment of volunteers, and now I manage volunteers for an organisation promoting swimming. I also organise events at a national level. I would never have got the job without all my volunteering experience. It helped me loads.\nInterviewer: And finally, a question for you both. Do you think we sometimes exploit volunteers in this country? Are they doing things for free when they ought to be getting paid? Liam, I believe that you volunteer for about ten or twenty hours a week. Do you ever feel that you should be paid for what you do?\nLiam: Well, of course, it would be nice. But the organisation I help is non-profit-making and it couldn’t really afford to pay all the volunteers. At the moment, I’m happy to do what I love and gain experience of dealing with the public. I’m living with my parents and they are paying my keep. In the future I’ll have to look for paid work.\nDebbie: I think many volunteers feel they want to give something back to their sport. It was like that for me with football. Ideally it would be good to have more paid positions, but we also need volunteers. Sport just couldn’t function without them. It is really important to give people recognition for what they do, though.\nInterviewer: Thanks very much for sharing your experiences. And now, we’re going to move on …",

        "transcript": "Presenter: Hi, everyone. On today’s Tech-times podcast we’re lucky to have Sam Wogan, a well-known digital journalist, with us. So, Sam – what interesting techie-topic would you like to talk about today?\nJournalist: Hi Brad. Today I’d like to talk about some of the reasons why we shouldn’t automatically believe everything we read online, and how false information spreads so easily with the help of technology. One of the reasons for this is a phenomenon known as circular reporting.\nPresenter: Circular reporting? What’s that?\nJournalist: Well, it’s basically reports which are based on other reports, rather than on the primary evidence or source. To the reader, it looks like the information is coming from several different independent sources, which normally means it can be trusted. But, in actual fact, all the reports are based on each other. Imagine a piece of false information is published, for example on Wikipedia, and then is referenced in a newspaper article or other publication. Then, in turn, the original Wikipedia entry references or quotes the article as validation that the information is true. In a nutshell, it’s the confirmation of false information by more than one publication.\nPresenter: OK, let me see if I’ve understood this correctly. So, someone writes an article on Wikipedia which contains some false information ...\nJournalist: That’s right, false information which is not referenced or checked and in no way is obvious as being false.\nPresenter: OK, and then this false information is copied from Wikipedia by a journalist and included in a newspaper article.\nJournalist: Yes, or other type of article, as if it were true information.\nPresenter: And then Wikipedia references the newspaper article, which verifies the information in the original Wikipedia article as being true.\nJournalist: That’s right! And sometimes it’s not just one newspaper article that cites the false information. Several publications may include it and so it becomes very difficult to prove that the original information is false. Let me give you an example. A few years ago a 17-year-old American student was on holiday with his family in Brazil. He spotted what he believed to be an aardvark, but which was in fact a type of Brazilian raccoon called a coati. When the boy got home after his holiday, he went online and changed the Wikipedia entry by adding the name ‘Brazilian aardvark’ to the information on the article, as a sort of joke, and then he forgot about it and thought nothing more of it. However, what started to happen was that articles and blogs began to quote the information from Wikipedia and then those articles were re-reported as evidence in Wikipedia. Before long, everyone was talking about the ‘Brazilian aardvark’ as if it were factual information.\nPresenter: So when information makes its way from a Wikipedia page into a published article, the article could be spreading false information without even realising it?\nJournalist: Exactly! It makes you wonder how many hoaxes initiated by people in this way have ended up as truths in many people’s minds just because people copy and paste vandalised Wikipedia pages. That’s not to say that all information on Wikipedia is false by any means. There’s a ton of really valid information there and it is constantly being updated – many people consider it to be the most up-to-date and unbiased encyclopaedia in the world. However, it is the open structure of Wikipedia, compared to a traditional encyclopaedia, which makes it a target to be tampered with.\nPresenter: So we just have to be aware that there may be a certain amount of inaccuracies on Wikipedia?\nJournalist: Yes, and it’s also worth mentioning that circular reporting is not just restricted to harmless information like the ‘Brazilian aardvark’.\nPresenter: Isn’t it?\nJournalist: No. For example, some time ago, claims that certain vaccines could cause autism in children were published in a prestigious medical publication by a British surgeon. The problem was that the unsupported claims were picked up by the media and the news spread like wildfire. Soon enough the general public were understandably concerned about the risks and huge numbers of parents refused to vaccinate their children. Consequently, in recent years we have seen an increase in the number of children suffering childhood diseases such as measles. By the time the claims were proven unfounded, the damage was done and even to this day some people still believe that there is a link between vaccines and autism.\nPresenter: It just goes to show how difficult it is sometimes for the truth to be heard.\nJournalist: Absolutely.\nPresenter: So, in practical terms, how can we be sure that what we’re reading is true?\nJournalist: Well, we can take certain steps such as checking the original source of the information and, if at all possible, checking that the original source is reliable and not just taken from either Wikipedia, Facebook or the media.\nPresenter: Right, so we need to be a little more critical and not just believe everything we read online.\nJournalist: That’s right, although it’s difficult because we want information quickly and immediately, so it’s not always viable to spend time checking the sources of information, even though we should. And we should certainly try and reflect on the information and decide ourselves if we think it’s true or not. If you feel unsure about the validity of certain information, then there’s no harm in looking into it further to check how true it actually is.\nPresenter: That’s very true. We often take things at face value and don’t really take the time to think critically about them.",

        "transcript": "Speaker 1\nI think that even up until just a few years ago we could never have imagined how our behaviour would change with regards to using mobiles and tablets. I know that I would find it incredibly difficult to live without my mobile. I’m constantly looking at my phone to see if I’ve got any new messages or updates, and checking my apps to see what’s new. I wouldn’t say that I post my life online, not like some people I know, but I do like to keep up with what people are up to — friends, family and even other people I know but maybe haven’t seen for years, like old school friends, and check out photos of what they look like now, ha ha ha (laughing) …\n\nSpeaker 2\nIn a way, I think it’s quite funny that we’re always worrying about teenagers and young people becoming obsessed with online communication, but if you ask me we need to worry just as much about adults! At the office where I work, even when we have a break, nobody talks to each other unless they absolutely have to, which is a sorry state of affairs to say the least. Everyone’s too busy checking their social networks and sending messages to have time to communicate face-to-face! People spend their lunchtime glued to their screens or barely glance up from their phones. Even during meetings people can’t resist subtly checking their phone, and what really irritates me is when you are trying to talk to someone and they’re more interested in looking at their phone than paying attention to what you’re saying, even though you're right in front of them! Phubbing, I think it’s called! \n\nSpeaker 3 \nI was listening to this discussion on the radio the other day talking about online communication and they were talking about FOMO or, what was it, Fear of Missing Out, which apparently is a kind of modern-day psychological syndrome which we’re affected by because of our obsession with online communication. Basically, they were saying that the reason why people feel that they have to be connected 24/7 and communicate everything they’re doing and keep up with everything that other people we know are doing is down to this fear of missing out. We’re worried that everyone is having more fun than us or doing something more exciting than us. They also said that because we’re spending more time communicating in the online world, we’re losing the ability to enjoy the present.\n\nSpeaker 4 \nMy generation is so different to my parents’. I mean, they’re always telling me that they grew up in a world without mobiles and social networking and they managed fine. Hard to imagine how they arranged to meet their friends without a phone … but they say they did! Uh ... I had so many arguments with them while I was growing up, until they let me have my first smartphone. But they didn’t let me have Snapchat or Instagram or anything like that! ‘It’s not the end of the world,’ they’d say! They just didn’t understand that that’s the way people my age communicate with each other. Nobody actually talks on the phone any more. They have no idea how much I missed out on at school being the only one who didn’t have Snapchat. Also, at school we had loads of talks and stuff on how to stay safe online and most of us knew that anything you post online was going to be there forever.\n\nSpeaker 5\nFor me, one of the best things about online communication is that you can stay in touch with everyone at the same time, all the time. You know exactly what’s going on, when and where, so you never miss out on anything. I love the fact that you can update all your friends on what’s going on in your life and they can respond immediately with a like or a comment, so you feel like you’re together with people even though you might be completely alone sitting on a bus or at home. I share loads of photos, but I only post up my best edited shots. I hate it when people I know post photos of me not looking my best.",

        "transcript": "Presenter: Good afternoon and welcome to 'Book Corner'. Our first review today is of an unusual book by Charles Foster which is a combination of nature writing, biology, philosophy, personal memoir … it’s not very definable, but it’s already being described as a modern classic. Jon, tell us about the book you’ve been reading.\nJon: You’re quite right, it’s not very easy to define. The title is Being a Beast and the book is about the author’s attempts to be a beast, that is, to live as an animal, or rather as several animals: a badger, an otter, a fox, a red deer and a bird. He says he wanted to really know what life was like for these animals and so he did the conventional research, the reading and so on. Then he actually tried to live in the same way as them, as far as possible. For example, when he’s being a badger, he goes to live in a hole in the ground and crawls around a wood, learning to identify different trees by their smell. He even experiments with eating earthworms. Eighty-five per cent of a badger’s diet is made up of earthworms – did you know that?\nPresenter: Ugh! I didn’t know that. He took one of his children with him, didn’t he?\nJon: Yes, his eight-year-old son, Tom. Foster says that children make better animals than adults in many ways – they use their senses to understand the world more, and they think in a much less abstract way than adults. Another reason why he took his son is that badgers are social creatures and would never live alone. He says that Tom adapted quickly to being a badger, learning to smell mice, hear tiny forest sounds and get around on four feet.\nPresenter: How did Foster tackle being the other animals?\nJon: In the same kind of way. As an otter, he spent a lot of time in the rivers and lakes and the sea, as an otter would – alone this time, since otters are solitary. The otter’s big problem is that it has to spend all its time hunting for food in order to survive, and that feeling of desperation was hard to recreate, but he did catch live fish in his mouth. To try to live as a red deer, Foster went to the north of Scotland. He nearly died from exposure to the cold out on the mountains, and he asked a local to set his dogs on him so that he could experience being hunted.\nPresenter: What happened?\nJon: The dogs realised that he wasn’t a red deer! That episode left Foster feeling that he had failed to get close to understanding the animal, but he had much more success as a fox. In London, he tried to forage for waste food, as an urban fox would. There’s one very funny part where he’s trying to sleep on the ground like a fox, and a police officer tries to move him on. He tries to explain that he’s trying to be a fox ...\nPresenter: … and gets arrested, I suppose!\nJon: Almost! In London he had the kind of animal encounter that he’d been hoping for: a fox looked him in the eye and he felt some kind of relationship was being established, animal to animal. He felt he had got close to understanding foxes – he had great respect for their ability to survive and thrive in the city. The end of the book is about swifts, those amazing birds which travel thousands of miles between continents every year.\nPresenter: It must be hard for a human to live like a swift.\nJon: Absolutely! Foster can’t fly! The nearest he can get to the birds is by standing in a tree and trying to catch insects. But this section has a lot of fascinating facts about swifts, and about other animals. In fact the whole book is very witty and engaging. It asks lots of important questions about what it means to be human and animal, and provides quite a few possible answers. I really recommend this to anyone with any interest in animals, or in humans, in fact. Although it contains some scientific detail, it’s a very good read, by the way. Very entertaining.\nPresenter: Well, I’ll certainly look out for that book, Jon. Thanks. Now, our next book is about something completely different …",

        "transcript": "Speaker 1 \nI switched to vegetarianism two years ago because I read an article about all the health benefits – best decision I’ve ever made. I feel so much healthier now. My skin is really good and my hair is much shinier. You have to be super-careful though that you still get all the nutrients you need in your diet. The main problem for me is that I’m the only vegetarian in the family, and the others want to eat meat and fish. So sometimes it’s a bit of a pain for my mum, because she’s the one who does most of the cooking. She usually cooks for the rest of the family, then throws something together quickly just for me. She says I should learn to cook for myself, but I’ve got so much homework at the moment ... OK, I am a bit lazy about cooking. I’m going to have to get my act together or I’ll be condemned to a diet of salads and omelettes, which I like, but if that’s all you’re eating, it’s pretty boring.\n\nSpeaker 2\nDid you know that there are about half a million vegans in the UK? That’s people who don’t eat any animal products at all. They reckon the number is growing because of teenagers on social media – like me! That’s where I got links to videos which convinced me that it’s the best option for animals, our planet and my health. I did a lot of research into what kinds of things to eat before I changed my diet. It’s really easy to find vegans online who’ll answer questions and give you advice. I’ve been given lots of useful tips, like you can eat chickpeas and spinach for iron — you know, to make up for the iron you’d get from meat in a conventional diet. I still really miss fried eggs and normal chocolate — oops, I mean non-vegan chocolate. My family have been supportive about the change, but I get teased a bit at school. Some people think that being a vegan is weird. Luckily I’ve got a lot of friends who tell them it’s cool.\n\nSpeaker 3 \nI gave up eating meat a couple of years ago because at the time I was following a celebrity who was a veggie. Stupid reason, I know, but you see beautiful, glamorous people on Instagram and you want their lifestyle, so I became a vegetarian. I don’t miss meat but I still eat fish sometimes, which sort of isn’t really allowed. My main problem is that I’m not too keen on vegetables. My dad finds that hilarious. He’s always going, 'How can you be a vegetarian if you don’t like vegetables?' I do like chips, though, and tomato ketchup – they’re made from vegetables, aren’t they? I don’t eat that much fruit either, apart from bananas. Anyway, but because my diet is a little on the unhealthy side, I take multivitamins every day. I also try and avoid rubbish like fizzy drinks and sweets. I don’t think my diet’s so bad. I feel pretty healthy.\n\nSpeaker 4\nMy whole family is vegetarian, so if you’re brought up that way it seems perfectly normal. My parents are both good cooks and we had a very varied diet. We ate lots of international dishes: Italian, Indian, Middle Eastern and so on. I never really missed meat or fish, except when I went out with friends. When I was young I remember lots of birthday parties in hamburger places – that was a bit tricky! When you’re young you never like being different. But later, quite a few people in my class at school became vegetarian, so I was no longer the odd one out. Anyway, now I’ve left home, I keep having lapses. I wouldn’t admit it at first, but I have tried meat a couple of times and I’m getting to really like fish. I feel awful sometimes, but I love food and I want to experiment with everything. I haven’t told my mum and dad – they’d be shocked!\n\nSpeaker 5\nMy main reason for becoming vegan was that I can’t stand the way we treat animals – most farms are run in such an inhumane way. I refuse to support factory farming. The treatment of hens is horrific, not to mention what they do to cows. So now I don’t eat any animal products – no meat, obviously, but no eggs, milk or cheese either. And I don’t eat fish, of course. When I first started to be a vegan, I found I was getting tired all the time, so I went to see a nutritionist and she said I wasn’t getting enough protein. Now I’m a lot more careful and I eat lots of different nuts and seeds, and pulses – you know, dried beans, chickpeas and lentils. It’s a bit time-consuming, buying and cooking special things, but now I feel really good. My family think I’m a bit weird, but they’re gradually coming round to my lentil and rice specials!",

        "transcript": "Teacher: Good morning, class.\nStudents’ voices: Morning, miss / Morning.\nTeacher: So, today we’re going to carry on with what we were talking about last class which are the advantages of doing sport on a regular basis. Let’s start by seeing how much you remember about the benefits of sport. I’m going to ask you some questions and in your groups I’d like you to answer them. OK, so the first question is, can you remember three of the specific physical benefits sport offers to the human body that we discussed last class? OK, Group B. What do you think?\nGroup B spokesperson: Um, well we’ve got two.\nTeacher: OK, let’s hear them.\nGroup B spokesperson: We think that doing sport reduces high blood pressure and the chance of getting diabetes.\nTeacher: Absolutely. OK does anyone have any other advantages? Yes, Group D?\nGroup D spokesperson: Yeah, sport is good for your bones.\nTeacher: That’s right. It strengthens our bones, particularly while we are still growing. OK, we also discussed that sport can be good for our minds too because of the chemicals that our brains release when we exercise. Can anyone remember the name of these chemicals and how they make us feel? Mmm, Group A?\nGroup A spokesperson: Are they called euphoria?\nTeacher: Not exactly. Anyone else? OK, Group B again.\nGroup B spokesperson: Endorphins and they make you feel euphoric or really happy.\nTeacher: That’s right. So sport can help us feel happy and put us in a good mood because of these chemicals that are present in our bodies when we exercise. It also improves our capacity to concentrate, which is why doing PE at school can actually help you do better in exams. OK, so that was basically what we covered last week and what we’re going to move on to today is thinking about whether it’s better for us to take part in individual or team sports. So let’s have a quick show of hands to see what you think. Those who think it’s better for us to do individual sports put up your hands. OK, thank you. And now those who think it’s better to do a team sport? OK. Well, there are certain advantages to both individual and team sports, but, in my opinion, the benefits of team sport do seem to outweigh those of individual sport. Can you shout out a couple of examples of individual sports?\nGroup C spokesperson: Yeah, like, karate or swimming?\nGroup D spokesperson: And tennis.\nTeacher: Good. Well, you won’t be surprised to hear that in order to succeed in individual sport we need to have a fair amount of self-discipline to motivate ourselves, which is easier said than done for some people. However, with regular practice, it may be easier to see progress. Also, it’s worth pointing out that our individual successes and failures are completely down to the individual, no one else. OK, I’d like you to have a think in your groups about the possible advantages of doing sport as part of a team as opposed to by yourself.\nTeacher: OK, Group C. What have you come up with?\nGroup C spokesperson: Well, we were saying that it might be, like, easier to be more motivated to actually do a sport if you’re in a team because you, like, you don’t want to let anyone down, so you, like, always turn up for sports practice, you know, so you are sort of more committed to doing the sport.\nTeacher: That’s a very good point. Yes, being a team member certainly helps people feel motivated and make an effort to turn up and play on a regular basis. Well done, Group C. Any other ideas? Group D?\nGroup D spokesperson: Err, because it’s boring doing sport by yourself and it’s more fun if you’re with your mates.\nTeacher: Absolutely! And the sense of being involved and belonging to a group is very positive for most people. Some experts actually believe that belonging to a group or a team makes us less likely to suffer from depression, as members develop positive bonds between them. And there are other benefits too. When you work as part of a team you are learning to work together and rely on each other. Everyone is responsible for the success of the team, so there’s less pressure on an individual and consequently it’s less stressful. And finally, can you think of any skills you develop when you work as part of a team?\nTeacher: Group A?\nGroup A spokesperson: Well, you need communication skills to talk to everyone on the team.\nTeacher: Yes, very good, Group A. Any more? Group C?\nGroup C spokesperson: Err … could it be, like, negotiation skills?\nTeacher: Yes, you need to communicate and negotiate with your fellow teammates. You also develop trust as you work together with others to achieve a common aim or goal, and all these skills are ones that come in handy in other areas of your life as well as in sport. So you can see that there are many all-round benefits to being in a team. However, perhaps, at the end of the day, the most important point is that you choose a sport you actually like, regardless of whether it’s an individual or team sport.",

        "transcript": "Extract one\nYou will hear part of an interview with an expert on phobias.\n\nInterviewer: So what exactly is a phobia?\nExpert: Well, nearly everyone fears something, but when the fear becomes exaggerated and irrational, it’s a phobia, which is the most common form of anxiety disorder. There are many types of what are known as specific or simple phobias. Common phobias include a fear of animals, particularly spiders, a fear of darkness or nyctophobia, or perhaps a fear of clowns, flying or a fear of public speaking. Now, you may not be keen on some of these things I’ve just mentioned, but most of us find a way to cope with the situation and don’t let it interfere with our daily lives. However, if you have a phobia of one of these things, you may suffer from symptoms such as an increased heart rate, dizziness, excessive sweating or even a panic attack. You might end up going to extreme lengths to change your daily life so as not to come into contact with the thing or situation that causes your phobia. For example, imagine a friend of yours has a pet tarantula. If you’re not a huge fan of spiders you may not enjoy spending time in his house, but most of us would put up with it. However, if you are an arachnophobia sufferer, you would probably refuse to visit him at home altogether. So you can see how phobias can have a real impact on our social relationships.\nInterviewer: And why do people suffer from phobias?\nExpert: Well, there are a couple of causes. If a child grows up with a parent who suffers from a phobia, the child is far more likely to develop the same irrational fear. Also, many phobias are actually triggered by a traumatic past event, often during childhood. So, perhaps an encounter with a vicious dog or falling into a swimming pool and nearly drowning as a child could feasibly develop into cynophobia, a fear of dogs, or aquaphobia, a fear of water.\n\nExtract two\nListen to part of a radio programme in which someone is talking about why people like to feel scared.\n\nInterviewer: There are many of us out there who actually enjoy the sensation of feeling scared to death on a roller coaster or delight in sitting on the edge of your seat during a horror movie and, Jan, you can explain to us why this is the case.\nJan: Yes, that’s right. As you say, millions of us choose to put ourselves in situations where we consciously know we are going to feel scared, like going on rides at a theme park. The reaction we have when we put ourselves into these situations – you know, the rapid heartbeat or sweaty palms – is in part similar to that when we’re faced with a real threat. What happens in those cases is that the body reacts to the danger with what we call a ‘fight or flight’ response. So, when the body detects real danger, it closes off any non-essential systems such as critical thought and reacts with automatic responses which enable us to either put up a fight or run away. We get a sudden huge rush of energy and at the same time the body is flooded with chemicals which protect us from feeling pain. The difference between a situation of real danger and being on a theme park ride is the context. So although we feel a certain sense of fear, we know deep down that the situation does not really pose a true threat and so this energy and lack of pain without any real danger allow us to experience a sense of euphoria or an adrenaline rush, which explains why we are able to scream and giggle in quick succession.\n\nExtract three\nYou will hear some people talking about their fears and phobias.\n\nBen: So, have you got any phobias, Liz?\nLiz: I’m not sure if I’d call it a phobia as such, but I absolutely hate needles and injections. Even the thought of them makes me feel queasy. When I have to have a blood test, I can’t bring myself to watch and I feel faint and dizzy, and if I’m watching TV and there’s a scene with someone injecting themselves, I can’t watch. I think it started when I was little and I went to the doctor with my mum and my big sister. The doctor gave my sister an injection and I was watching ... I started to feel faint and I passed out on the floor of the doctor’s office.\nAbi: Oh no! Well, my greatest fear is clowns. There’s actually an official name for it, coulrophobia, I think. I don’t know what it is about them exactly, but they just freak me out, they’re so weird. I’ve always hated them since I was a kid from birthday parties and the circus and things. They don’t look at all happy to me even with a big painted smile. They look sad and scary, even a bit sinister.\nLiz: What about you, Ben? Are you scared of anything?\nBen: No, course not!\nAbi: Well, apart from heights.\nBen: That’s true, I can’t look out of the window past the fourth floor.\nAbi: And lifts …\nBen: OK, yeah, and lifts. I hate getting inside lifts. I’ll always take the stairs if I can. I don’t know, they just make me feel uneasy. And, well, I get really nervous if I ever have to speak in public. I start sweating and my mind just goes blank. It’s so embarrassing ... that’s pretty normal, isn’t it?\nLiz: Of course!\nAbi: Sure.",

        "transcript": "Interviewer: Hello, Maria. Thanks for coming in for the interview.\n\nMaria: It's my pleasure. Thanks for inviting me.\n\nInterviewer: Well, as you know, the company has been expanding and we have an opening in our HR department. We're creating a new role for someone to lead our training and development within the company.\n\nMaria: Yes, I very much think that my skills and experience are a good fit for what you're looking for.\n\nInterviewer: That sounds great. So, your CV looks strong, though it would be good if you could give us an overview, in your own words, of what you've been doing over the past four years or so.\n\nMaria: Well, in my first job, four years ago, I was working for a small HR services provider which offered HR services, including L&D, to corporate clients.\n\nInterviewer: OK, so it was only B2B?\n\nMaria: Yes, we only offered services to other companies, not B2C.\n\nInterviewer: Right, and it says here you then left that company about three years ago.\n\nMaria: Yes, that's right. I was looking for a little more stability and also to be part of a larger organisation. So I joined a company with around one hundred staff and a small HR team. As there are only a few of us, we each deal with a range of HR topics. In addition to payroll, one of the areas I was responsible for was learning and development.\n\nInterviewer: I see. And, so why do you want to change jobs now?\n\nMaria: Well, I very much like the L&D side of my role and I've always had particularly good feedback for my work in this area. I believe I excel in that field. So, I'm looking to specialise, and as your company has around 2,000 people, right …? \n\nInterviewer: Yes, that's right.\n\nMaria: Well, an organisation of this size would give me the scope to specialise in L&D. I'm also a big follower of your brand and feel fully aligned with your image and values.\n\nInterviewer: Well, that all sounds good. And I can see you have an L&D qualification.\n\nMaria: Yes, I got a diploma two years ago. I am also currently working on a further diploma in psychology, with a specific focus on learning and performance management.\n\nInterviewer: Very good. Well, it looks like you have the qualifications and experience we're looking for. What do you think will be the main challenges of coming to a much larger company?\n\nMaria: I can see that it might be perceived as a weakness to not have experience in an organisation of this size, though I see that it could also be a benefit. I won't be bringing too many preconceived and possibly inflexible ideas with me to the role. \n\nInterviewer: Yes, that would be a good thing.\n\nMaria: Also, I'm used to taking a very personal approach to employee development. I realise that such an approach with 2,000 staff members will have to happen in a different way, but I bring many ideas with me that can be replicated on a larger scale.\n\nInterviewer: I see what you mean. Right, so, do you have any questions for me?\n\nMaria: Um, I think we've covered many of the areas I had wanted to address. I have two quick questions though.\n\nInterviewer: Go on.\n\nMaria: Who would I mostly work with on a daily basis?\n\nInterviewer: Well, there's the HR manager who you would report to. And then the HR team, which currently has six people in it. There's usually an intern or two who you can get some support from also.\n\nMaria: OK. Thanks. That's all really clear. And my other question is how performance in this role will be measured. What does success look like?\n\nInterviewer: That's a good question. As you know, we have a performance management system in place, and from that we have identified some learning and development needs within the organisation. But we haven't devised a strategy. Your role would be to devise and then successfully implement this strategy.\n\nMaria: Thank you. That sounds interesting. \n\nInterviewer: Great. So, thanks again for coming in today. We'll be discussing all candidates next week and then I'll get back to you by the end of next week to let you know the outcome.\n\nMaria: Thank you for your time. I'd welcome the opportunity to continue discussing this role with you.",

I know we're all working cross-functionally on this project, but so far the key stakeholders are really pleased with how it's going. This project will really benefit our overall value proposition and the company as a whole.\n\nAkiko: Thanks, John. It's an important project. It's good to be collaborating on this together.\n\nMatteo: Yes, it's important, but we're all so busy with our regular jobs. It'll be difficult to fit things in.\n\nJohn: It's OK, Matteo. We'll work it out. I know that you all have a lot on at the moment, combining this project with your regular jobs.\n\nBarbara: So, what do we need to do, and by when?\n\nJohn: Good questions, Barbara. We have a number of key deliverables to discuss so it's essential we're all in agreement about roles and responsibilities and also the timelines we're working to.\n\nAkiko: Great.\n\nMatteo: Yes, it's good to get this clear.\n\nJohn: So, the first thing we need to do is design the customer survey questionnaire. In my experience, this is best done through an online survey tool.\n\nAkiko: That sounds like a great idea. I'm glad you have experience with this.\n\nJohn: Yeah, we've done something similar on previous projects.\n\nMatteo: So will you do that, John?\n\nJohn: I'd love to but I'm already tied up managing this project, and my line manager, Kate, has agreed that I should focus on the timelines, reporting and financial management. I'd like Akiko to lead on the questionnaire. You learned about this on your marketing and PR course, didn't you?\n\nAkiko: Yeah, happy to take it on.\n\nJohn: Thanks, Akiko. Next thing is we need the new designs finalised. Matteo, you said you could do this in a couple of weeks, right?\n\nMatteo: Yeah, I know, but that was last month, and then nothing happened. I'm overloaded at the moment and my line manager won't be happy if I don't hit my targets. Sorry, but this project has to take lower priority.\n\nJohn: Hmm. I see. I can understand the challenge you're facing. I've been in that situation before. So, what can we do to help you hit those targets and free up some time?\n\nMatteo: That's a good question. If I could get a slight reduction in my targets, I could use the extra time that would create to finish the designs for this project.\n\nJohn: OK. We might not be able to get your targets reduced, but I'll see what we can do.\n\nBarbara: How about if I support Matteo there? I know his job well and I have some capacity at the moment. I can help him meet his targets so he can free up some time to finish the designs for this project.\n\nMatteo: Could you, Barbara?\n\nJohn: Hmm. I'm not sure if it's fair to ask Barbara to be supporting Matteo in his regular job so he can work on this project.\n\nBarbara: It's up to you, but I'm happy to support Matteo with his regular work, just for a couple of weeks so he can create the designs. He's the only one with the expertise.\n\nJohn: Yeah, you're right. OK, thanks a lot, Barbara. I appreciate it. Matteo, would that work for you? \n\nMatteo: Yes, that would work. Thanks. OK, you've made it easy for me to say yes.\n\nJohn: OK, then that's settled. Thanks, both. I really appreciate your help in this. So, can you get them done by the end of the month?\n\nMatteo: Yes, that should be no problem.",

        "name": "An interview about two books",
        "transcript": "Presenter: Today we're looking at the darker side of literature with two books about not-so-happy families. And we've got writer Helen Slade and book critic Anna Kimura to talk us through them. First up, we're looking at Her Mother's Daughter by Alice Fitzgerald, a novel written from two points of view, one of a child and the other of her very troubled mother. Helen, I have to be honest. I found this one hard to read. It's very well written but, well, how did you find it?\n\nHelen: I know what you mean, but I literally couldn't put it down and stayed up till three in the morning to finish it. There's something about immersing yourself in a family this flawed, this damaged, that's compelling. You'd never want to be in that family yourself, but that's what reading is about, isn't it? Wearing someone else's shoes for a while without ever having to live their reality.\n\nPresenter: You surprise me! The families in your own books are a million miles away from this one.\n\nHelen: Yeah, my readers can always be sure they're going to get a happy ending. Which you definitely ... I don't want to give too much away here, but you definitely don't feel like a happy ending is coming for these characters.\n\nPresenter: OK, so don't mention the ending, but can you just describe for listeners what the book is about?\n\nHelen: So, it's about a family with secrets. The mother has hidden her troubled childhood from her husband and her two children but, of course, it's shaped her entire personality and how she behaves as a mother and as a wife. Which is especially obvious when we're reading the sections told in the child's voice, even though the little girl herself doesn't understand the meaning of everything she's seeing.\n\nPresenter: For me, what was really so shocking was less what happened to the mother when she was a child but how the mother treated her own children. Why is that, do you think?\n\nHelen: I think we're all programmed to see mothers as something sacred and pure. As a child she was mistreated by her father, and in some ways we're not that shocked by that, which is a sad thing in itself, and her own mother didn't help her. As a reader we're less affected by that, I think, because that part of the story is revealed to us in the mother's voice, the adult voice. But the reason the way she treats her own child is so much more shocking is that the child is telling us about it and we sympathise with her. It's very clever how the author plays on our natural instincts to protect a child.\n\nPresenter: Though we do feel sorry for the mother too. Or, at least, I did.\n\nHelen: It's hard not to. She's trapped in her own unhappiness.\n\nPresenter: And we're trapped right there with her as the reader. It made me wonder, Anna, why is it that miserable books like this one sell so well?\n\nAnna: Because all of us have families. I suppose the books play out things we all see in much smaller ways in our own family lives.\n\nPresenter: The other hard-hitting book this week is We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver. Now there's a family who have a problem!\n\nAnna: They definitely do. Very few people will ever have a killer as a teenage son like the narrator in the book, but we can all identify with the challenges and often terrifying reality of raising teenagers!\n\nPresenter: So can you give us the lowdown on Kevin, then, Anna?\n\nAnna: This book is written from the point of view of the mother in letters she's writing to her husband, Kevin's father. Again, we shouldn't say too much about the ending, but the way the author uses the letters is very clever.\n\nPresenter: I have to admit, I really enjoyed this book. It's a difficult topic, but it was much easier to read than Her Mother's Daughter.\n\nAnna: As Helen said before, it's about the voice of the narrator. There's no child's voice and, in this story, the victims in many ways are the adults, though, of course, Kevin's sister is a victim of her brother's evil.\n\nHelen: Yes, and the idea of where 'evil' comes from is a theme that comes out in both books. If you choose to call it 'evil' that is. I prefer to describe it as a complete lack of empathy. The mother in Her Mother's Daughter had a terrible childhood, but Kevin's from a happy home and good parents.\n\nPresenter: Is he though? The mother often admits she found motherhood hard. Aren't we supposed to think she might have caused Kevin to turn out the way he does? Just like in Her Mother's Daughter.\n\nAnna: Both books certainly look at how the mistakes of the parents affect children. And this is another reason we relate to these books. Parents are always worrying if they're doing a good job.",

I don't see why this one should be any different.\n\nDora: Why not?\n\nCharles: First, you know me, I can't be bothered with the hassle. It's my birthday but I'm supposed to do all the hard work – contacting people, finding a venue, organising food, worrying who will show up. No, thanks.\n\nMarco: Ah, someone's angling for a surprise party, eh, Dora? \n\nCharles: Marco, stop! Even worse. Having to pretend to be delighted 50 people just sprang up in your living room when you thought you were coming home to put your feet up. Probably having a heart attack at the shock.\n\nDora: Note to self: never to organise you a surprise party. OK then!\n\nMarco: You've got to do something, though, Charles. It's your 40th.\n\nCharles: Why? What's so great about getting old?\n\nDora: Er … still being here to have your birthday?\n\nMarco: Yeah, 'Ageing is better than the alternative', as they say.\n\nDora: Yeah, and it's true – so why not celebrate?\n\nCharles: You guys can have parties for your 40ths if you like. I just don't go in for that kind of self-indulgent attention-seeking.\n\nDora: Wow, that's a bit harsh! I had a huge bash for my 30th. And you came. And enjoyed yourself if I recall. Are you trying to say I was just doing it for attention?\n\nCharles: Not exactly … but … well … at least a small part of you must have been.\n\nDora: Remind me not to invite you to my 40th then, so you won't have to put up with my huge ego while I feed you and provide free drinks all night because I thought we were friends. \n\nCharles: I meant, er, I mean, not all attention-seeking is bad. It's just not my style is all.\n\nDora: Whereas it is mine?\n\nMarco: Anyway ...\n\nCharles: I didn't say that!\n\nDora: Er, yes, yes, you did. You said celebrating birthdays is self-indulgent and ...\n\nMarco: Guys, guys! Who knew birthdays was such a touchy subject? Speaking of which, I have to sort out my nine-year-old’s party the weekend after next.\n\nCharles: Now, that's a party I'd love to organise.\n\nMarco: Really? It's a nightmare. It's not like when we were kids. Now you have to take them all rock-climbing or hire a make-up artist to come and teach them how to look like a zombie or a film star. And there'd be trouble if someone else in school had the same kind of party and your kid gets accused of copying. That fear you said about no one turning up? It's a million times worse when you're scared your kid is going to have no one turn up.\n\nCharles: Is there that much pressure?\n\nMarco: Yeah, it's crazy. Last year, I got it right with a cinema trip. Simple, but always a winner. But we can't do the same thing again apparently. It says it in my 'Official Laws for 9-Year-Olds' book.\n\nCharles: That's a pity. I've got so many fond memories of birthday parties as a kid. Party food and games and watching cartoons until your parents arrived.\n\nMarco: Trust me, your parents were stressing out!\n\nDora: At the risk of restarting the argument, when do you think you stopped enjoying birthdays then?\n\nCharles: I dunno really … somewhere around moving away from home and getting a job and being a grown-up. I don't mean birthdays are immature. I mean, it takes a while to make new friends and so birthdays just become more low-key and it's drinks with a couple of friends or dinner or something. And I just got out of the habit, I guess. Maybe I just need to have a kids-style party like we used to have! Play musical chairs and eat pineapple and cheese on sticks and all that.\n\nDora: Very retro. I bet people would love that.\n\nMarco: Yeah, they would. Well, I would anyway. And maybe it'll catch on with my kids and it'll start a new party trend.\n\nCharles: You've got me thinking … it's not a terrible idea. Maybe I will have a party this year!",

        "transcript": "Dave: Jean, hi!\n\nJean: Hi, Dave. How are you?\n\nDave: Good, good.\n\nJean: Wait a second, I'm not calling you in Canada, right? You're back now, aren't you?\n\nDave: Yeah, I got back two days ago.\n\nJean: Oh good, phew. Because I wouldn't want to be calling you long distance without realising it and suddenly ...\n\nDave: You've spent a fortune on a long-distance call. No, I know, it's OK. I actually wouldn't answer the phone while I was over there if I saw the call was coming from England. But no worries, we're in the same country now.\n\nJean: Yeah. So, how was the trip? Did you meet your long-lost uncle?\n\nDave: I did, actually. It was very good. I flew to Toronto and stayed there for a few days. At first I was really worried about my accommodation because I kept reading these appalling stories about rental flats going all wrong. \n\nJean: Oh, was it one of those?\n\nDave: Yeah.\n\nJean: My friend had a disastrous experience in Barcelona with one of them. The place didn't look anything like the photos, and all the neighbours hated that there was a holiday flat in their building. Awkward situation. Urgh.\n\nDave: Right. So, as I was saying, I was really worried because I heard these stories. And at first I couldn't find the place. Turns out I was in the wrong building. It was next door, and on the top floor, and … wow. Jean, this place was fabulous! Really spacious, with these floor-to-ceiling windows and the most scenic views of the city. I could see the lake and the whole city skyline and skyscrapers from my bedroom. I had to pinch myself to prove I wasn't dreaming.\n\nJean: Sounds pretty cool. So, what's it like? The city, I mean. I've always wanted to go to Canada.\n\nDave: It's nice. I mean, it's another big, vibrant, modern city. But it's really clean, and there's lots of parks. One of the things I liked was the multiculturalism. We visited Chinatown, Little Italy, Greektown, Little India … umm, I can't remember the others but it was sort of a new area every three or four blocks, you know?\n\nJean: Hey, is it true that there's a whole part of the city that's underground? I read that somewhere about Toronto, or saw it on some TV show.\n\nDave: It's true! I asked about that. They call it the PATH. There's, like, almost 30 kilometres of restaurants, shops, cinemas and stuff all underground. In the middle of the downtown area.\n\nJean: Amazing!\n\nDave: Yeah, but actually once you're down there it's not that noticeable. There's actually a lot of natural light. I forgot we were underground. It's mostly useful to get out of the cold weather.\n\nJean: What temperature was it while you were there?\n\nDave: It was still only November, but it was getting cold. We had at least a day where it was less than zero. My uncle told me that in January and February it can go down to 20 below zero.\n\nJean: Oh, wow. I think I'd die!\n\nDave: Yeah, and the worst thing was what they call the 'wind-chill' factor. So they say the temperature is zero degrees, but minus eight with the wind chill. So it feels like minus eight. And my uncle said the wind-chill factor can go down to minus 40.\n\nJean: Stop it! You're making me feel cold just thinking about it. So, how was meeting your uncle? The famous Uncle George.\n\nDave: That was great too. He lives outside of Toronto, in a cottage by a lake. Really tranquil and unspoiled nature.\n\nJean: I'm dying to see photos. You want to meet up soon? Or are you too jet lagged still?\n\nDave: Yeah, I'm actually free tomorrow if you like.",

        "transcript": "A\n\nI'll never forget the first time I met our new contact from Retrolink, one of our top five customers. I had travelled to their office to meet him in person, talk about the history of our companies together and define a shared vision for future co-operation. I wanted to focus on building a good relationship with him which would be a good foundation for working together.\n\nSo, when we met I wanted to make a good impression and also show him respect. I greeted him with a handshake and addressed him by his surname. When I put my hand out I realised he had been moving in to give me a hug, so we did an awkward mixture of the two! Also, when I greeted him by his surname, he responded politely, though he used my first name. It was all a little uncomfortable.\n\nIn this situation, I guess I made assumptions about the level of formality he expected. Even though he had never met me before, he knew our two companies had been doing business with each other for years and he wanted to build on that history by being less formal with me from the beginning. The real learning here for me was that I shouldn't assume we all have the same ideas about meeting people for the first time.\n\nB\n\nI'd never worked with a virtual team on an international project before. It was quite exciting, though also challenging to work with people from different countries, many of whom I would never actually get to meet in person. There were a lot of things that were different about working in the same office and it was quite challenging at the beginning.\n\nFor example, there were different time zones, different IT systems and even different local regulations, which impacted on what each person was allowed to, or able to, do for the project.\n\nThere were also interpersonal differences, such as different ways of working, approaches to deadlines and when to reply to emails. And we shouldn't forget the fact that English was the project language and that most people on the team had to work in a language which wasn't their first. A positive of this was that it meant that everyone, including the native English speakers, had to make the effort to communicate clearly and clarify their own and everyone else's understanding.\n\nTo help us all get on the same page, we defined the communication norms and the rules the team would follow, as well as the meeting dates and deadlines. We laid this all out in a document called a team or project charter. This was really useful and in the end the project was a great success. I'm looking forward to working on my next international project.\n\nC\n\nI went through a bit of a rough patch last year at work. I was already committed to too much and then we lost a team member through restructuring and I quickly became overloaded. This led to me doing too much overtime and feeling very stressed. My boss was really helpful and she pushed back against the unrealistic targets that had been set for our department. She also introduced me to the smart approach to goal setting. It's an acronym, S-M-A-R-T. You use it to create goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timely.\n\nI used this approach to deal with all of the things that were overloading me. It helped me to prioritise some tasks, to do some later and to drop some completely.\n\nI often use this approach now and feel much more in control of my time and workload.\n\nD\n\nHave you ever missed a flight or had one cancelled? I did. It happened to me last week. My flight home from a business trip was the last one of the day and we were told it was going to be delayed. That's always a risk at the end of each day. The ground crew kept extending the delay until eventually they cancelled the flight completely. They then told us to go back through the airport to the departures area to talk to their agent who would organise hotels for everyone and rebook us on the following day's flight.\n\nAs soon as they made the announcement about the cancellation, I knew I had to think quickly as it would not be likely that the flight would have capacity to take everyone from my cancelled flight. I hurried back through the airport and was one of the first to make it to the desk. That turned out to be a good idea, as there were only nine seats available on the flight the next morning. Everyone else had to fly to a different airport and then continue back to our destination airport in coaches. Lucky me! Right?",

        "transcript": "Welcome to today's Business4U podcast. The focus of this podcast is to think about innovation and why it's important, and also to look at different types and stages of innovation. By the end of it, you will hopefully have a better grasp of the topic of innovation and be able to better understand and drive innovation in both your working and personal lives.\n\nSo, why is innovation important? Well, simply put, without innovation it would be difficult to make progress. Organisations and societies would stagnate. Innovation is what drives us forward. It's what forces us to compete in the business world. It's what leads to better products and services, and solutions to new and existing problems. From a business point of view, it's also something which is necessary for survival.\n\nFour key types of innovation are incremental, disruptive, architectural and radical.\n\nIncremental innovation involves innovating in increments, or small stages. Step by step. It focuses on existing markets and technologies and aims to make improvements and design changes to existing products and services.\n\nDisruptive innovation aims to bring new ideas, like technology or processes, to existing markets. In that sense, the innovations will disrupt the market and the companies currently serving that market. The first touchscreen smartphones disrupted the mobile phone industry because up to then, mobile phones had buttons and keypads.\n\nArchitectural innovation involves taking successful ideas from one market or industry and applying them to a new or different market. This often happens when people think of other unconventional uses of existing technology. A good example of this can be seen in vacuum company Dyson's entry into the hand dryer and hairdryer market. Their advanced airflow technology from their vacuum cleaners was applied in reverse to machines that blow out air. In the case of these examples, it's personal hairdryers and hand dryers in public toilets.\n\nAnd finally, we come to radical innovation. This is where a completely new idea is created for a market that doesn't exist yet. It's often what we think of when we think of innovation and it often swallows up existing markets. For example, the birth and growth of digital and downloadable music has practically led to the death of music CDs, and even DVDs. Similarly, film and TV streaming services may lead to the demise of traditional TV within a few short years.\n\nMoving on from types of innovation, let's have a quick look at five key stages of innovation.\n\nThe first stage is Idea generation. This is where you think of the initial idea and develop it into a more detailed proposal or plan.\n\nThe next stage is Support. You need to check if you can get support for it, for example from senior leaders or stakeholders in your company. If you're innovating in your personal life, then the support you might need could be from friends or family. Do they think it's a good idea and do they think it would work?\n\nThe third step is to Experiment and test out the idea. This could mean creating a sample or a prototype of it, if it's a product. Or if it's a service, you could test out a basic version of it.\n\nThe fourth step is Evaluation. You need to assess how successful your experiments were and what chances of larger success your idea will have.\n\nAnd finally, you then need to actually Implement your idea. That's the fifth stage.\n\nSo, there you have it. We've looked at four key types of innovation: incremental, disruptive, architectural and radical, and also five stages of successful innovation: firstly, idea generation. Then, get support. Next, experiment and test out the idea. The fourth stage is evaluation and finally implementation.",

        "transcript": "If I asked you to describe a great leader, I'd be willing to bet certain traits come to mind … someone charismatic, dynamic, inspiring, a confident public speaker. You're probably imagining a man too, but that's a bias we'll save for another talk! We tend to think of great leaders as people who naturally take to the stage, who draw other people to them by their sheer presence, who are extroverts. But history has also been transformed by people who don't fit these descriptions. People like Rosa Parks, Eleanor Roosevelt and Gandhi. These people would have described themselves as shy, quietly spoken … as introverts.\n\nOf course we're drawn to extroverts. They're usually charming and persuasive, fun to be around. They're not quietly in the corner somewhere reading a book where we might not notice them. Introverts are mostly happy to let the extroverts take the attention; they'd rather not be in the spotlight, they'd rather finish that book. If they become leaders, it's not because they want to be the centre of attention, it's because they feel compelled to act. They lead not because they enjoy giving orders but because circumstances have put them in a position to make change. If they're the boss, they allow space for the ideas of others to grow because they're not trying to make their mark. An introvert sounds like a pretty good boss, right? You won't need to worry about them stealing your ideas or talking over you in a meeting.\n\nSome of our great creators are introverts too. People like the writer JK Rowling, the great thinker Darwin and the designer of the first Apple computer, Steve Wozniak. It turns out coming up with good ideas is easier when you're engaged in quiet, solo contemplation than when you're leading the cheerleading squad. Not that I'm saying there's anything wrong with cheerleaders! Extroverts are great – some of my favourite people are extroverts. But why is the world so set up for extroverts and so hard for introverts? Why are we always encouraging our kids to speak up, join in, work as a team?\n\nNowadays, most schools and most workplaces are set up with the extrovert in mind. Children no longer sit in rows in desks, they sit in groups of four or six, doing group projects. Even subjects like maths and creative writing are taught with an emphasis on group collaboration, even though most writers sit alone in front of their computer or typewriter, with nothing between them and the blank page. A kid who prefers to go off into a corner and work alone starts to look like a problem. What's wrong with Janie? Why isn't she joining in? Studies show teachers think extroverts make better students, even though introverts actually tend to get higher grades. We're telling our introverted kids something is wrong with them, that they need to be more sociable, more outgoing. We're giving them fewer opportunities for the quiet contemplation they need in order to produce the best work and be their best selves.\n\nAnd then at work we do the same. Most offices today are open plan, everyone working and creating noise in one big room, attending team-building workshops or group brainstorming sessions; the introverts' worst nightmares. The introverts at school are judged negatively by their teachers and when they reach the workplace, they're passed over for promotion into leadership positions. But introverts typically take fewer risks and make more careful decisions, and don't we need those traits too?\n\nI'm not saying let's get rid of extroverts and grab all those talkative, sociable performers at primary school and send them off to the library for four hours a day of solitude until they learn to tone it down. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying we're doing something like the opposite of that to introverts and we need to stop. We need to allow them space to be themselves and then we'll end up getting the most out of our extroverts and our introverts. Let's teach all our kids how to work with others and how to work on their own. Let's create space in offices and at conferences for people to work on their own when they want to and give them the opportunity to come together to share ideas. Let's give staff 'away days', where they go off into the woods, walk up a mountain or wherever, to work on something alone, as well as the 'team-building day' where everyone learns to dance salsa together.\n\nThe future is complicated, with a lot of huge, complex problems to solve. Let's make sure we've got our best people working on those problems in the way that suits them best. And then we've got to make sure we listen to our extroverts and our introverts and everyone who sits somewhere in between on the scale. We're going to need all of them.",

        "transcript": "Presenter: The sound of kids hanging out together. Or, at least, how it sounded a few years ago. Nowadays a group of, well, just about anyone – kids, teens, tweens, their parents – might sound a lot more like this …\n\nMost of us spend hours a day with our heads bent over our smartphones. Research suggests teenagers spend as many as nine hours a day, while pre-teens spend up to six.\n\nTeen voice: I don't know, it's, like, the first thing I do in the morning, check in and see who's posted anything overnight. It's my alarm clock so I kind of have to look at it and then, you know, it's pretty hard not to scroll through.\n\nPresenter: And it's not just teenagers and millennials, Generation X and even the Baby Boomers are almost as bad.\n\nAdult voice: I'm online most of the day for work and you'd think I'd be sick of screens by the time I get home, but most of my news comes through Facebook and I'm really into food so I'll hold my hands up to being one of those people who posts photos of their meals.\n\nPresenter: But are we addicted to our phones and apps? And does it matter? Former Google and Facebook employees certainly think so. So they've set up a non-profit organisation, the Center for Humane Technology, to reverse the digital attention crisis and promote safe technology for children.\n\nExpert: Anyone who's seen queues round the block for the latest iPhone has to wonder what these people are thinking. You've literally got people sleeping in the street to get the newest device, probably not even talking to anyone else in the queue because they're on social media, taking selfies in the queue to post to Instagram. If that's not addiction, it's certainly obsession.\n\nPresenter: A more formal definition of addiction describes it as a repeated involvement with an activity, despite the harm it causes. Someone with an addiction has cravings – that feeling that you haven't checked your phone for two minutes and can't relax until you get your hands on it again. They may have a lack of self-control and not realise their behaviour is causing problems – like texting while cycling or falling off a cliff taking a selfie. And, in case you're wondering, I read about both of those via the news app on my phone, which updates every couple of minutes with the latest stories … definitely addicted. So the 'Truth about Tech' campaign by Common Sense Media and the Center for Humane Technology couldn't come fast enough for most of us. But it's children who are probably most at risk because of the effect tech addiction might be having on their brain development. Professor Mary Michaels of the Atlanta Future Tech Institute has been working with very young children. Mary, thanks for dropping by. What is your research telling us?\n\nMary: Well, we know that screen time is affecting key aspects of healthy child development, like sleep, healthy eating and what psychologists call 'serve and return' moments, which are when parents respond to babies seeking assurance and connection by making eye contact, smiling or talking. All perfectly normal things we do and which help lay the foundations of babies' brains. It's much harder to engage with a baby normally if you're looking at your phone. Or, even worse, if parents give a crying child a phone to distract them instead of talking to them or hugging them, and that might lead to them failing to develop their ability to regulate their own emotions.\n\nPresenter: And what about older children?\n\nMary: Again, we know that teenagers who spend a lot of time on social media are 56 per cent more likely to report being unhappy and 27 per cent more likely to suffer depression. Teenagers are especially vulnerable because they're more sensitive to highs and lows anyway, so we're looking at, potentially, higher instances of suicide, schizophrenia, anxiety and addiction in teens which is exacerbated by dependence on technology.\n\nPresenter: It sounds like a vicious circle. They're more likely to get addicted to smartphones and social media and that addiction itself makes them candidates for other addictions.\n\nMary: Yes, that's right. \n\nPresenter: Time to stage an intervention! Is there anything we can do to make tech less addictive?\n\nMary: Setting devices to greyscale, which is basically black and white, might make them less appealing. Scrolling through a newsfeed of boring, washed-out photos just doesn't create the same rush as bright colours perhaps. And you can turn off the notifications that are constantly pulling you back in to check your phone.\n\nPresenter: So is it ...",

        "transcript": "I'd like to turn now to the object which is the main point of this talk: the helix. This is a fascinating mathematical object which touches many parts of our lives. Movement, the natural world, the manufactured world and our genetic make-up are all connected to the shape of the helix.\n\nA helix is a type of three-dimensional curve that goes around a central cylindrical shape in the form of a spiral, like a corkscrew or a spiral staircase. The helix is a very popular shape in nature because it is very compact. In fact, helices are sometimes referred to as 'nature's space saver'. In architecture too, the helix shape of a spiral staircase is an attractive option in buildings where space is very restricted.\n\nThe most renowned type of helix is probably the double helix of DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA is made of two helices that curve around each other, a bit like a twisted ladder. DNA contains the genetic information or 'code' that determines the development and functioning of all known living things. The helix shape is a very efficient way to store a long molecule like DNA in the limited space of a cell.\n\nThere are different types of helices. Helices can twist clockwise, right-handed, or anti-clockwise, left-handed. An interesting experiment is to hold a clockwise helix, such as a corkscrew, up to a mirror. The clockwise helix appears to become counterclockwise.\n\nWe can perceive examples of helices in many areas of our world. Spiral staircases, cables, screws and ropes can be right-handed or left-handed helices. A helix that goes around a cone is called a conical helix. Examples of conical helices are screws or the famous spiral ramp designed by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright in the Guggenheim Museum in New York.\n\nHelices are also prevalent in the natural world. The horns of certain animals, viruses, seashells and the structure of plants, flowers and leaves can all contain helices. The human umbilical cord is in fact a triple helix.\n\nWith the discovery that the helix is the shape of the DNA molecule, it is not surprising that the helix is found in so many areas. It's one of the most natural shapes in nature.\n\nLet's turn our attention now to the mathematical description of the helix. You'll need a pen and paper for the next part of the talk as I am going to give you some variables to write down. Take your time to notice the different ...",

        "transcript": "Todd: OK. Michael, you are into spear fishing.\nMichael: Yes, I enjoy going spear fishing\nTodd: OK. Can you talk about that a bit?\nMichael: Yeah, sure. Spear fishing basically is a sport that you dive under the water with the aid of flippers, wet suit and weights but you don't use oxygen at all. It's all-- you hyperventilate before you go down to get your oxygen levels up then you dive down. \nYeah,  then you have to you sometimes hide under rocks or actually stalk the fish and when you see a species that is edible and of legal size you can catch the fish\nTodd: Oh, Wow. Now spear fishing, does that mean you throw the spear?\nMichael: No, you use spear guns which uses surgical rubber to propel the spear you just pull it down to cock it. It's kind of like a crossbow without the cross piece at the front.\nTodd: So do you ever see sharks down there?\nMichael: Yeah, you occasionally see sharks. It depends on where you are. You see a lot of.. there are some sharks called wobbegongs which are harmless sharks and they are actually quite friendly,  they won't attack you but if you've caught some fish and you keep them on your purse and the blood goes into the water it can attract bigger sharks. And a few times when we've been spear fishing, we've actually had the sharks come down and take the fish while we're there and it's a little bit scary but the sharks themselves are.. they just sit there and watch you in the water. They're kind of like dogs, they're scary because they follow you and they look at you, and you turn around and they'll be sitting there looking at you. So most of the time we like to.. when we catch the fish, to keep the blood out of the water. We put them on a float that floats a fair way away from actually where you are fishing as a safety precaution but if you know..of course, you see too many sharks you just get out of the water...but now, it's nice and exciting.",

Even the little squabbles that tend to come up seem to be solved fairly quickly, maturely and I love it. This is the best living arrangement I've ever had. At the same time, I think it's kind of something  that can be expected when you come to teach abroad. It takes a certain kind of person to decide to leave everything familiar behind and meet new people, have new experiences. You're not taping any of this are you. \nTodd:  No, I am actually.

That's why I came to Japan to learn Japanese and hopefully obtain a master degree in International Relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      After getting my master's degree in International Relations, I would like to go home and enter the diplomat school for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is a three year program, and then, after that hopefully come back to Japan and work for the Norwegian Embassy in Tokyo. \n\t\t\t\t\t          Todd: Must be pretty competitive.\n\t\t\t\t\t          Christian: It's very competitive, but I think if you know a certain language that not many people speak it gives you a competitive edge nevertheless so that's why I came to Japan because I know at this stage there are only 300 hundred people from Norway living in Japan and not all of them are here to study Japanese, they represent different companies or schools, or they're missionaries so, that's the track I'm on right now but we'll see how it goes in the end.\n\t\t\t\t              Todd: How about when you were a child, what was your dream job? Did you want to be a diplomat when you were say, 10?\n\t\t\t\t              Christian: No, when I was ten I probably didn't know what I wanted to do. I was just too busy playing in the street, you know, having fun with my friends and these things. When I was that young I really didn't have a dream job like fireman, police. I never really went through that stage, you know.\n\t\t\t                  Todd: I wanted to be a baseball player.\n\t\t\t                  Christian: Alright, fair enough.\n\t\t                      Todd: I'm still dreaming.\n\t\t                      Christian: Oh, that's good.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Jeanie, you are from Philadelphia, correct?Jeanie: Yep.Todd: Now is Philadelphia a safe city? Do you have lots of crime?Jeanie: Yeah, we've got lots of crime. Depending on the area where you are. Um, where I grew up, I lived in a black ghetto where there was like gun shooting at least three times a week. Usually it was, it had to do with conflicts between African Americans and Jamacians, um, pretty territorial. Basically, the African Americans were there first and when the Jamacians moved in they decided that they wanted to take over so lots of wars going on along with that.Todd: That's pretty scary.Jeanie: Yeah, so.Todd: How did you get along? How did you survive or..?Jeanie: Um, well, I've always been to myself for the most part. A lot of people in the neighborhood, thought I was very strange because anytime you ever saw me I was walking around reading a book or something like that. I didn't have any friends, because everyone would always say I was too smart to hang with them or something like that, so yeah, I basically just kept to myself. When people wanted to fight me, instead of mouthing off which is a very big part of it, I would just sit there and say OK, let's fight and they didn't understand that kind of thing. They felt like, no we have to argue first, so I didn't encourage arguing and so they would feel intimidated just by feeling that maybe there was something more to me than they knew about.Todd: Wow! You're brave. You were saying earlier though that there is also a serious problem with Asian gangs.Jeanie: Yeah, in the neighborhood we moved into, I moved out of my old neighborhood when I was about 17, so my new neighborhood, we don't have so much of the African Americans versus the Jamacains, we have Korean gangs, and they're often at odds with the Hispanics.Todd: Man!Jeanie: Yeah, so not so much gun shooting. I don't really hear so much about guns in that area, but lots of knives and robberies and such things.Todd: Now do you think you have a solution to solve the problem, that we can get rid of these gangs. Is it just the poverty, or?Jeanie: It has a lot to do with the poverty, but a lot of it also is the image that these people are striving to achieve. They do rely heavily on Hip-hop, the Hip-hop culture. They feel like in order to be really cool, they've got to due this stuff that they see on TV.Todd: Ah, so it's like a peer pressure thing. Not a peer pressure, it's an image thing.Jeanie: Mm, very much an image thing.Todd: Wow.Jeanie: And sometimes the only way to survive is to actually join a gang so that you don't get hurt from just someone not liking you.Todd: Wow. Well, you have a very candid views and stories to tell so thank you very muchJeanie: No worries.",

Do you think that Hip-hop music negatively influences people? Do you think it should be censored or should be controlled in anyway?Jeanie: I feel like it has a tendency to negatively influence people, mostly because the people it influences aren't very strong or very confident in themselves. They feel like that in order to be something they have to do what the people who made money are doing. For them it looks like the easy way out. For example if you're stuck in poverty and you look at the TV and you look at people who are exactly like you, who are stuck in poverty and suddenly all they did was, they did gang banging and stuff like that, and then they rapped about it, and they got money, it's like \"Wow\", why don't I do that. And I have to build up this hard image so that I can make money. You know, get to the top.Todd: So you're saying part of the problem is for people to aspire to be a popular Hip-hop artist, they actually have to do some type of criminal activity first?Jeanie: Yeah, it's the image that you get because in all the music they're rapping about what they did. You know, and if you ask somebody later on, \"oh did you really do that?\" and they say, \"Oh, no. It was just for a song\" then you know, people are all \"Oh, you're not cool.\" You know, you want to rap about something that you've actually been through. It's a really, you know, \"Yeah I did this. I'm really hard.\" You know. Otherwise you're just, you're just speaking. Todd: Well, do you think that the music should be censored in anyway?Jeanie: I think to a point it should be, just as far as kids, children don't need to hear this stuff all the time and you know, unfortunately what you get, even if they censor it in the stores and say \"Oh, it's, this is not for kids\", or you know, stuff like that, you're going to get in these areas, people driving down the street in their big expensive cars blasting this kind of music, so the kids are going to hear it anyway, so I don't feel that there is a real way to censor itTodd: Yeah, I guess this problem is always going to be around.Jeanie: Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Eucharia, can you talk about where you are from?Eucharia: I’m from Ireland and I’m from the second biggest city in Ireland which is Cork. Now the name ‘Cork’ doesn’t come from wine bottle cork, it comes from the irish word ‘kirkig’ which is ‘marsh’ so you can imagine how wet Cork is. We have a lot of rain.Todd: And is Cork a big city?Eucharia: It’s a sprawling city. Most people live outside of the city and commute and my parents live about a 25 minute walk to the city centre and that’s quite normal, so most of the city spreads outwards and the surburbs tend to be quite big and you can get lost quite easily!Todd: What are the people in Cork like?Eucharia: Well when I go home its really strange for me because the men in my city speak with a very high pitched accent voice so it sounds very strange to me, and girls tend to speak in a lower voice because a lower voice in Ireland usually means intelligent and most people would like to seem intelligent. However, most people love to laugh in Cork so there is a really good sense of humour: you just walk on the streets and you hear people laughing all of the time. It’s great.Todd: Oh that’s nice. And what would you say is the best thing about your city?Eucharia: The best thing are the people of course, but also the food. The entertainment is just fantastic. Every night you can go out, you can have dinner. After you can go to the theatre, you can go to classical music concerts, you can go to pop concerts, rock concerts. You can go dancing, different types of dancing. Oh I miss dancing! You can do Irish dancing, more Hip hop dancing, disco dancing. Anything is possible any night of the week.Todd: Ok and what’s the worst thing about your city?Eucharia: The worst thing has to be rain because Cork is such a wet place. We don’t have a lot of snow in Cork because when it snows the snow quickly fades away because the ground is made of limestone so I’ve never seen real snow before, but getting back to the rain, it rains almost non stop from autumn until spring.Todd: Wow, that’s a long time! Eucharia: So it’s a long time having a grey sky over you.Todd: Still it sounds like a nice place.",

The education system. The things. The whole administration, it's just very different from India I guess, yeah.\nTodd: Yeah, like can you give us an examples of how India might be different?\n\n                                            Nitya: Yeah, like, the first thing is like, here one period is ninety minutes, but there we have 45 minute periods only.\nTodd: Oh, I see.\nNitya: Like in the class system, and here it's like, even though if it's a quarter a system, you take a subject and you learn it only for two and a half months, but the same subject if it's back home in India, we do it like for one year, or six months so the length and the depth is more than here I guess.\nTodd: Now in India, in let's say primary school, or elementary school, normally how many students are in a class?\nNitya: Primary school is like 30 students, 30 or 35, but keep increasing as you go to secondary, and it goes up to sometimes 60, yep.\nTodd: Wow. Now in your town, in your village, is instruction in English or is it in another language?\nNitya: OK, like, though it's a small town, but we have a university with the second largest in India area wise in the whole world, (Wow) so I studied there my whole education and was there up to my high school, but then later I went to southern part of India for 4 years education\nTodd: Uh-huh, and so the instruction was in English?\nNitya: In English and in Hindi, both because they are central government schools, so it's supposed to be in English.\nTodd: Oh, I see.\nNitya: On the whole it turns out to be back in mother tongue when we speak in school and everything, but the teachers do give instructions in English.\nTodd: OK, and how about, even to a Japanese school, what about school lunches? Like what do kids eat for lunch at a school in India?\nNitya: In India?\nTodd: And how do they eat lunch? Is there a cafeteria? Do they bring a lunch?\nNitya: I think most of them bring lunch, and the cafeteria is supposed to be considered unhygienic by mothers, so they are not very favored towards cafeteria food, but we love it, because there are so many snacks and oily things which usually kids like, you know, spicy kind of things with mothers always against it, so we do bring lunches, sometimes we take it back, or eat it in the cafeteria, or give it to somebody, things like that.\nTodd: Well, in India, what is a typical lunch, that a mother would make for her children?\nNitya: OK, it is usually Chapatti, which is made by wheat flour, and some kind of, stew kind of thing, or you know, like potatoes, vegetables kind of thing.\nTodd: Right, you said, Chapatti? (yeah) What is a chapatti?\nNitya: A chapatti, it's like a pizza base, and it's made by wheat flower, (so it's) a round thing. It's a round thing.\nTodd: It's a thin round piece of bread.\nNitya: Yeah, exactly.\nTodd: And is there something on it, or in it?\nNitya: Yeah, we eat it with some potato curry, or things like that.\nTodd: Is the curry on the outside or the inside?\nNitya: No, it's separate.\nTodd: Oh, really.\nNitya: You eat it this with this.\nTodd: Oh, I see. Sounds pretty good. Alright. Anyway, thanks, Nitya.",

We call it the Celtic tiger phenomenon. Yeah.\nTodd: That's cute. The Celtic tiger in reference to the Asian tiger (yeah) which used to be the growing Asian economies.\nMarion: Yeah, exactly. So Ireland kind of has that place in Europe at the moment, has had like I say for quite a few years now.\nTodd: Like what industries are going really well in Ireland. What's making this happen?\nMarion: Above all, the computer industry. Yeah, I mean, we have lots of computer companies, companies making those computer chips.\nTodd: Right, right.\nMarion: I think actually I read somewhere that Ireland is the number one producing country of either those computer chips or some other element of a computer, cause I was very surprised and shocked that my small country could be number one in that arena, so we also have quite a number of people who move to Ireland from other places in Europe so we have a lot of speakers of different languages in Ireland and that has been used to set up call centers so for example, if you buy a mobile phone in Italy and something goes wrong with your mobile phone, you ring up a help desk, and say, \"Oh, sorry, my phone is broken, you know, can you help me?\" and the person who responds to you will probably be sitting in a call center in Ireland.\nTodd: That's pretty cool.\nMarion: Yeah, there's so many of them in Ireland. Actually, I've worked for three of them at different stages of my life, so we have ones for computer companies, for mobile phone companies, and what else, for some insurance companies actually, and banks. Yeah.\nTodd: That's pretty cool. Actually, I read that one of the reasons for the turn around is the good university system, or the education system in Ireland is quite top notch.\nMarion: Yeah, well, I mean, education has been very important all the way along in Ireland because of the fact that Irish people weren't allowed to have an education under british rule. Then once we got independence, you know, all along people were fighting to have education for their children and children used to be taught in hedge schools so the teachers were inside of a field basically, teaching kids and then if the policeman came of something, everybody would scatter, and you know, they didn't have anything, any like resources or anything, so in the minds of Irish people I think education has a a special place, and it is true that the university system is very well thought of and very well recognized throughout the rest of Europe I think.\nTodd: Ah, well, sounds good.

There's 33 million.\nTodd: Yeah, actually, is there any major Canadian cities in Saskatchewan?\nRina: Well, the capital is Regina. (Really) Yeah, if you've heard of that.\nTodd: No\nRina: But I live in, right now my parents live in Saskatoon.\nTodd: Oh, OK.\nRina: And that's, my town is between Regina and Saskatoon, called the midway town.\nTodd: What's it like growing up in a very small rural setting?\nRina: It was awesome. My parents, because they immigrated from Lebanon were very strict with me so I really wasn't allowed to do very much until I was about in grade 11, when my brother was old enough to come with me, but it was, once I was able to start going out and going to dances and things like that I loved it.\nTodd: Oh, really, even in your small town?\nRina: In my small town, yeah. Cause I had it, I was very close with a lot of, like a very small class, very very close with a lot of people there, yeah.\nTodd: Sounds good. So, in all of Canada, like when you go back and you settle down and you live in Canada, do you want to live in Saskatchewan?\nRina: No.\nTodd: No.\nRina: No, it's not, it's, I've developed a lot more since I was that age and it's just not the same anymore. I'd like a bigger center, preferably Vancouver, or Montreal, on one of the coasts. Yeah. So.\nTodd: Not Toronto?\nRina: No, I'm not a big fan of Toronto.\nTodd: Ah, why?\nRina: Because I'm a little jaded. When I was, in 94, we went to Niagara Falls, and we drove through Toronto and it was just so, it looked so busy and smoggy and just crazy, and so I never really liked it since then. I have that image in my head still of that.\nTodd: Yeah, well, that's how I feel about L. A.\nRina: Yeah.\nTodd: Yeah. I don't like Los Angeles. OK, well thanks.",

You don't like technology.\n\nJeff: No, I don't like technology.\nTodd: What do you mean you don't like technology.\n\nJeff: Technology is, I think it's gone against what it was originally invented for, and that is for convenience to make people's lives more easy and to give them more free time, and I think it's totally gone against what it was originally invented to do.\nTodd: Yeah, but technology does make your lived easier, like it saves us time, it communicates,\n\nJeff: But does it save us time?\n\nTodd: I think so. I mean, before you had to type something up, now you can just type it up on a word processor. It's quicker. Before you had to walk to a phone. Now the phone is in your pocket. You can just pick it up and call anytime, anywhere in the world.\n\nJeff: Kind of. I kind of agree with that, but sometimes that walk to the phone is sort of pleasant and you had time to think about other things, but now as you're walking to the phone, you're typing something into your PDA while you're listening to your MP3 player, and then you get into your car and you drive to your office and the first thing you do is check your e-mail and then right after that you check your voice mail and then you send an e-mail to someone and then, I think it's just sort of, it's cluttered. It;s cluttered our lives versus clean it up.\n\nTodd: Yeah, but maybe if you did not have that, then you would probably have something else that would just clutter up your life. I'm sure people were busy before they had technology.\n\nJeff: Mm, I agree. I think they were busy but maybe more wholesome things, or less, I think, I think you, we, our mind's are sort of, our minds are always bombarded with images or news and a lot of this stuff is not needed but because it is there we use it. I don't think we have to see so much news or read so many different things on the internet and see so much on television and the DVD player, get our news on our MP3 players and our hand-held, our little hand-held computers, our PDA's. I think it's just, we fill our time now with things that are not really needed or not maybe as useful or as clean as the old days: reading and writing and peotry, and when was the last time you wrote a letter to one of your friends and a nice hand-written letter, and put it in an envelope and put it in the mailbox.\n\nTodd: About three or four years.\n\nJeff: Or a postcard even.\n\nTodd: Four years.\n\nJeff: So, I think it's, technology is good but I think it's sometimes defeats it's own original purpose.",

It was one of the best times of my life.\n\nMark: Yeah.\n\nTodd:Oh, it was awesome. I mean, it was being with your friends,and you know, driving for the first time and having your first part-time job and playing sports and going to dances. It was great.\n\nMark:Now did, a lot of high schools in the states, I went to high school in the states and a lot of high schools have, there are these clicks, you know, there's like a popular group of kids, and then there are other kids who don't really feel like they belong (right) Yeah, I know you Todd. You strike me as you were probably one of the popular kids, so of course you're gonna think high school was great.\n\nTodd: Well, no, actually, I wasn't one of the popular kids, but I was in the popular group, so I played sports so I was one of the jocks.\n\nMark: Yeah, one of the jocks, always, they get into the popular clicks easier. So do you, can you imagine like how somebody might feel that wasn't in one of those groups, that they might have hated high school?\n\nTodd:Well, I don't know who hated high school but I remember there were the motor heads. Those were the guys that were always working on their car. They had really nice cars they fixed up. They probably didn't like high school too much, then there were the drama freaks, and the drama freaks were, they dressed really different and they were kind of into punk at that time. They were very artistic and very creative, very smart, and because they were so different, I think a lot of kids made fun of them, so maybe they didn't like high school.\n\nMark: Now were you one of the kids that made fun of them?\n\nTodd: Definitely not. I mean, I was never that way. Actually, I was the kid that somehow was friends with everybody because even though I was with the jocks, I wasn't a good jock. I was a terrible athlete, so I was maybe just surviving by being friends with them anyway, but yeah.\n\nMark: Now, you're a good baseball player though, right?\n\nTodd: Actually I was but I didn't play baseball because I, in high school because I, foolishly I wanted to make money. I wanted to get a part-time job and get a car, so I stopped. I played football and basketball, though.\n\nMark: OK, now most high schools, just about every high school, after ten years, you have a high school reunion. Did you go to your 10-year high school reunion?\n\nTodd: You know, I did not go to my high school reunion. My friends went and, you know, they said it was a pretty good time and everyone had changed, but I didn't go. Have you been to yours?\n\nMark: I did. I went to mine last year.\n\nTodd: Oh, really. Did everybody still look the same?\n\nMark: For the most part. What I found interesting is the popular clicks, that I talked about before, they still existed. It was ten years later and it was like all the popular, you know, they're not kids anymore, but all the popular people were hanging out together and all the nerds were kind of standing around on the side and looking lonely and depressed.\n\nTodd: Wow.\n\nMark: Yeah it as kind of sad.",

        "transcript": "Todd:  Now, Phil, you mentioned that you actually studied automotive engineering. \nPhil:  Yeah, that's correct. \nTodd:  OK, can you explain what automotive engineering is? \nPhil:  It's basically car design and basically technology involved in cars in all aspects: the engine, the performance, the aerodynamics, so it's basically an overview of all kind of car aspects for the future. \nTodd:  Cool, so you must know a lot about the cars of the future and stuff. I mean, how do you see cars in let's say twenty years, thirty years, forty years? \nPhil:  In the near future I think the big developments will be alternative fuels. At the moment petrol and diesel engines are causing a lot of damage to the planet and we're going to eventually run out of natural resources, so I think the developments will be towards electric or hybrid cars. \nTodd:  Right. \nPhil:  Maybe even using fuel cells such as hydrogen. \nTodd:  Well, like how many years away do you think this is? \nPhil:  Realistically, ten to fifteen years away before we start seeing the first ones in production but before we see everyone using them, it's going to be twenty years, I would have thought, I guess. \nTodd:  Right.... Now, I once had a student who was an engineer for Chyrsler, Daimal-Chrystler, and he was saying that they already have cars that can drive without people, like you can just say your location and it'll go there. Have you heard about that? \nPhil:  I've seen the technology from a German company called Volkswagon as well. The problem with this technology - it's brilliant. It's amazing what it can do, but people's attitude is the problem. People like the sense of freedom from having a car. \nTodd:  Right. \nPhil:  And if your car is driving you then you lose that. It's like being on a train of something, so you lose that individual sense of freedom. \nTodd:  Wow, that's right. That's a good point. \nPhil : And then, there's the infrastructure. \nTodd:  Oh, so you think that basically, it'll never take off, that people will always want to drive their own cars? \nPhil:  Possibly, although maybe they could develop a system where in the inner cities the system is used, basically to help, because traffic flow and congestion is a problem. \nTodd:  Right. \nPhil:  So maybe within the cities, the system could be used, but outside the city, people would always want their freedom in the country roads - the thrill of driving, the excitement. \nTodd:  Right... Now when you watch movies, you often see cars that can fly, or cars that can go underwater like in a James Bond movie. Do you see that maybe in the future? \nPhil:  Underwater I think would be a bit pointless, and very difficult to achieve the engineering. It's possible now, but the engineering is just ridiculously hi-tech, but I don't know about the flying cars. Maybe in hundreds of years but certainly not in my lifetime and not in anyone's lifetime who's listening to this website, no. \nTodd:  All right. Thanks a lot Phil.",

        "transcript": "Kara: So, Lupe, in your family setting, when you guys are having family get-togethers, you have a large family, do you normally speak English or Spanish or is it a mix, or how does it all work out at a party?Lupe: It's definitely a big mix, and as some people call it, Spanglish, because I do have some siblings that speak English, that were raised here and speak it well, and sometimes we feel more comfortable speaking in English, so we'll speak in English, but there are a lot of my family members who moved here when they were older, and never had the opportunity to learn to speak English, therefore I speak Spanish to them, and there's also times when I'm talking to a certain person and we will be speaking in English and I'll suddenly forget a word or it pops up into my head faster in Spanish so I'll go from English to Spanish and then right back to English and that's when we call it Spanglish, just because it's a little mixture of both. Sometimes I'm speaking in Spanish and I won't remember how to say something and I'll think of it in English. Therefore I'll say it in English, but I can only do that with the ones that speak both English and Spanish.Kara: And what about your nephews and neices. I know as far you and your sibling, you guys were all born in Mexico. Your nephews and nieces, a lot of them were born here in the United States. How is there Spanish, and how do you communicate with them?Lupe: Well, that was actually something that we talked about with our whole family because we decided them being born here, we wanted to make sure that they didn't lose that part of, you know, their heritage and their culture. We wanted them to still be able to speak Spanish, so we decided we'll all talk to them in Spanish, especially for the first five years of their life because once they started school we know it was going to be a little bit tougher once they started learning English. It was going to be easier for them to try to speak English, which most of them do. They come home and they suddenly just speak English and don't want to speak Spanish anymore, so we try really hard to speak only Spanish around them because we know all their English, they're practicing at school, so they really need to keep up with the Spanish at home. Kara: And do you feel like that is something you're losing, you're family's losing by being here in the United States, part of your language with the younger generation?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Lupe: I think it's definitely a choice. I know other people who prefer that their children don't speak Spanish. They have the opportunity to teach them and decide not to. Maybe they feel that if their kids only speak English, they won't feel left out at school, or you know, that sometimes what I've heard from other people. They want them to be and feel just like the other kids, so they don't want them speaking Spanish, but I think that is a choice that you make and you make it when they are young and for us, we decided we don't want them to lose that, and I think that we have a big say in that and there's a lot we can do about it and so we're all working really hard to make sure that they don't lose that and so far, you know, out of all my nephews and nieces, you know, maybe a couple are really forgetting their Spanish, but for the most part, all of them are doing really good and speaking both English and Spanish.",

What do you mean homeless?Jonathan: Well, I don't call one particular place home. I pretty much live out of a suitcase. I don't have roots holding me to one particular place. I was born and raised in Toronto but from a very young age I was traveling for different purposes: some for the work that I was doing, some for just pleasure travel and even now when I go back to Toronto, it doesn't really feel like home. In fact people comment about my accent, and they say, \"Oh, that's an interesting accent. Where you are from?\" and I say, \"Well, I'm from here.\"Jeff: So where do you split most of the majority of your time? Where's your base?Jonathan: Well, I don't really have a base. That's the thing. I spend about four, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less, months in Japan and I usually visit my parents for about a month a year, sometimes in Canada where they spend spring, summer and early autumn, and sometimes in this small little town in Mexico that they like to go to avoid the harsh Canadian winter.Jeff: So, you and... in between those times, in between Mexico, in between Canada, in between Japan, where are you?Jonathan: Wherever I sort of feel like going. Now I don't draw the kind of salary that allows me to live a glamourous lifestyle and travel around the world with the jet set, but I can certainly go and spend several months a year in different destinations, living a very basic existence but having enough time to be able to travel around and stay in simple accommodation, go out and hit the bars at night, talk to the people I meet in those different areas. At different times I have different interests.Jeff: So that sounds like a pretty exciting, pretty fun life. Do you ever get tired of it?Jonathan: I think that it's the kind of life that doesn't appeal to everyone and some people think I have this wonderful, fantastic life all the time. Sometimes, I would like to work a little bit more. Sometimes, I think, \"Oh, no! I have nothing to do for the next three months.\"Jeff: Except for travel.Jonathan: Yes. And as of now, this work that I'm about to do finishes in a couple of days and people have asked me, where am I going afterwards and my honest answer is I don't know. I literally have no idea where I'm going to be four or five days from now, and I have no idea what I'll be doing for the next three months until I need to be back in Japan for work three months from now.Jeff: Well, good luck on your next trip.Jonathan: Thank you.",

What's a backpacker and what do you think of them? Jonathan: I don't know if I'd go so far as to say I'm a backpacker. I actually have a bag that rolls on wheels, so I don't know if I fit that category. When I was younger, then I certainly did go around with the backpack and considered myself to be a little bit a part of that community. I wouldn't say I really would consider myself one anymore because a lot of people that I meet who consider themselves to be backpackers, they almost have a little bit of an unusual perception of what they are, and they think somehow they're different from say tourists, and I meet people who say these things, like, I'm not a tourist, I'm a traveller, or \"I'm not a tourist, I'm a backpacker\" in some way suggesting that they are above being a tourist in some way, but in the same hand, I'll meet people who are in some area like say Khao San Road in Bangkok, which is famous as being a backpacker street, and I meet people who stay there for two weeks and only talk to other backpackers, and they end up at the end of their holiday saying how much they love Thailand, whereas the realty was they never really went anywhere except perhaps to a little bit to a temple or something.Jeff: So, are backpackers boys and girls, old people and young people, Indians and Canadians. Is there any, like, are all backpackers Americans for example?Jonathan: Oh, no, actually, I meet very few Americans when I travel surprisingly. It seems that certain nationalities have a greater predisposition to travel. I meet as many Canadians as I do Americans despite the population of the United States being ten times larger than that of Canada's. I meet a lot of New Zealander's, whereas their population is comparatively tiny, but they can come from any place. I've met backpackers from all kinds of different walks of life, different age groups, different nationalities, but you do find that the majority of them are young people. Perhaps they're taking a year off before or after college. Maybe they just want to see a little bit of the world before they know they're going to be rooted in one place because perhaps from their field of study they think that their future is going to be more or less planned out and they want to get a bit of travel in before they embark on their career.Jeff: So you have a wheely case, and you're not really a backpacker so is it OK if I call you a wheely-packer?Jonathan: I suppose you could call me that, but I'm not sure whether other people would know that term, and if you don't mind, I'm not going to refer to myself as a wheely-packer.Jeff: OK.

MB: Sure, so we usually get up very early in the morning, probably around 6:30 in the morning and when we were in Papua New Guinea we had to walk to the area where we were going to have breakfast so we had to walk through the village and say good morning to all the villagers and then we shared breakfast together with our team which the villagers prepared for us.Matthew: What kind of food was that?MB: In Papua New Guinea they eat a lot of potatoes and sweet potatoes and and some fish and some noodles but mostly their staple... and also bananas. They have a lot of plants or fruits that they grow on their property we ate a lot of that and then after breakfast we usually have a short orientation about what kind of jobs we're going to do that day and we're usually broken down into different teams and then we work for maybe two hours and then we have a short break and then we work again until lunch time. These jobs can be anything from planing wood or cutting wood or helping to lay the floor or putting up the walls or painting the walls or anything like that. And then we have lunch with the team and also with the villagers usually and after lunch we, in the past, we usually play with the children after lunch for a little while and then we go back to work for maybe about three or four hours in the afternoon. And night-time is cleaning up as well as having dinner again together with our team, or with the villagers. It really depends and then we usually have a meeting where all the team members get together and we have a reflection time about what happened that day or any problems, or we get a chance to talk to each other about the different jobs we were doing, so it's a very busy day, every day, but it's really satisfying and a lot of fun and we learn so many things, so many new things every day.Matthew: That's great. You did mention that during the reflections, you talked about any problems that occurred. What kind of problems have occurred?MB: Not so many, but in the past sometimes students get sick or they don't adjust to the heat of the country were in or they're not used to working physical, doing physical work every day or, so they're getting tired easily or something like that, or sometimes we just talk about problems in adjusting to the new culture. Sometimes it's very hard and very sad to see such poverty and to see people suffering but if we have a chance to share our feelings with each other it makes it easier to talk about and to think about.",

MB, we know you go on lots of trips for Habitat For Humanity. Could you please explain exactly what is Habitat? MB: Sure. Habitat For Humanity is an NGO that's based out of America and it's committed to stopping poverty housing all over the world.Matthew: All over the world. OK, so normally do you do your work in America or where do you go?MB: I have gone on many trips in Asia actually. I'm mostly involved with Habitat For Humanity International.Matthew: So how many trips have you been on?MB: I've been on six different trips.Matthew: OK, six trips.MB: Yeah.Matthew: And where did you go on the last trip?MB: I went to Papua New Guinea for two weeks.Matthew: Two weeks.MB: Yeah, and I went with ten students and there were three teachers on the trip as well.Matthew: Students! And how do you convince students to go on these trips?MB: Well, I'm a member of a campus chapter through a university in Japan and I've been able to go on these trips with the students because they are very committed as well to stopping poverty housing and they've studied a lot about the different countries that we visit and they've studied a lot about how we can help by helping to build a house.Matthew: You said you went to Papua New Guinea last time.MB: Yeah.Matthew: Can you tell us a little bit about what that experience was like?MB: Sure. We had a wonderful time. We were there for two weeks and we were working on a wooden house. In the previous trips we never had used wood before so this was a new experience for the students and for myself and it was lot of work. It was a lot of hard work but we were able to finish most of the house. We didn't complete everything, but we worked as hard as we could and we put a lot of love into the house and it was a lot of fun.Matthew: So do you have... I mean, how do you... You're building a house. Do you have some special construction skills?MB: No, I don't. I'm an unskilled laborer, but when you go on a trip they have skilled laborers there, or skilled people there that teach you how to build, so we do very simple tasks and we try to help the local people or the family build their house.Matthew: When you say simple tasks, simple can different for different people. What's a simple task?MB: Well, like we learn how to mix cement which means that you have to mix it using the cement sand as well as water as well as rock or you learn how to plane wood which is to make it very smooth, or you learn how to hammer a piece of wood for a wall or for flooring or anything like that. Simple meaning a job that anyone could learn how to do.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, hey, Rebecca, speaking of environmental stuff, I was reading about a drought in Australia. You guys have a serious drought problem with water? Rebecca: Yeah, we do. We've had a drought for some time now and it seems to be getting worse and worse each year. At the moment, it depends on the area that you're in, but some areas are quite hard-hitted. We actually have restrictions on water now so you can't wash your car unless it's with a bucket of water. You can't water your garden at all, so my mom loves gardening, so to keep her garden, dad actually has fitted a special tube into the washing machine which filters the water out out into a bucket outside and she can use that grey water to water all her plants and that way she can keep her garden all nice.Todd: That's fantastic. You call it grey water?Rebecca: Mm. We call it grey water.Todd: Is it only water from the washing machine?Rebecca: Yeah, it is. We haven't done anything else with the shower water or anything, yet, and I think with the soaps that we use, they're more... not as hard on the plants, so they're actually growing really well.Todd: Oh, really. Actually, the garden is doing better with the grey water than normal water?Rebecca: Yeah. Especially grass. Yeah, I don't know, maybe something in the water that they really love.Todd: Right. All those dirt nutrients from the clothes.Rebecca: From the clothes, yes.Todd: So, has the government done anything like to raise water prices or limit how much water you can use per month or anything like that?Rebecca: There's a certain limit on water and then after that limit's reached, you actually pay quite a fair bit for water. Bottles of water have gone up to about three to four dollars for just a hundred-fifty mil-bottles, so it's quite expensive. Yeah, so water prices are quite high now.Todd: So, basically, everybody in Australia just has to hope that in the future there'll be more rain?Rebecca: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. I think the problem is that with the rains, it needs to rain into the basins where we catch the water so, if it doesn't rain into them, then the water's just useless to us when it rains. It just runs offbecause the ground's so dry.Todd: Right, you just have the run-off.Rebecca: Yeah.Todd: So, have you had other things like flooding or anything like that because of the drought?Rebecca: In certain areas when there's been big rainfalls, there has been a lot of flooding because the ground just doesn't soak it up. It's that dry, but other areas have got water so because Australia is so vast, so wide as well, yeah, there's different areas that are hit differently.Todd: Ah, that's terrible. Well, I hope it gets better.Rebecca: Yeah, so do I.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Rebecca, talking about your country, I hear that skin cancer is a serious problem in Australia? Rebecca: Yeah, it is. I think our environment is the cause of it in a way because we do have the beautiful beaches that you always want to go out and swim and be in the sun, have the barbecue, so you're outside a lot, especially during the time of the day that it is really quite stong.Todd: Right, so is the government doing anything, or do people do anything to try to prevent it?Rebecca: Yeah, the government's put out the slogan, \"Slip, slop, and slap\" so slip on some sun screen, slap on a hat, and yeah, something along those lines.Todd: Right, it works, right. Is skin cancer cases going down?Rebecca: I think the deaths from skin cancer are going down. The number of cases of skin cancer that are increasing still, maybe it's because they can check and see if you're going to get it earlier than what they used to, but, yeah they're able to sort of reduce the cases a bit, which is great.Todd: So have this changed the culture? Are people less wanting to be tan?Rebecca: No, I don't think so. There's a lot of products coming out on the market now where you get the tanning products, so I suppose they're helping you tan in a way that's not putting you out in the sun, but yeah, it's just the culture is to get outside and enjoy the sun. You do see down on the beach, everyone laying down on the beach, sun baking, enjoying the sun, but I think more so now, you see that they are putting on sun screen too, which is really good to hear.Todd: So, what about you? Are you somebody who tans very easily? Rebecca: I am. I suppose, I'm the lucky few people that don't have to sit out in the sun for ages to tan, but I do still like to put on the sun screen a lot. Every time I go outside I make sure I got it on. Especially, around the ears and nose. They tend to be major parts that skin cancer can form now.Todd: Well, yeah, it's winter right now and you still look pretty tan.Rebecca: Ah, thank you.",

There's the main part of the Great Barrier Reef and then there's a little island, and we went to the island because I don't like scuba diving, so I didn't go to the main part.\nTodd: So, you don't like scuba diving. Why?\nRebecca: I think it's the unknown, under the water, and just being confined and having this breathing aparatus on you.\nTodd: Right. Well, you know what, I can relate because I was certified to be a diver because all my friends were divers and I didn't enjoy it that much either.\nRebecca: Yeah. Like, it looks great underwater when you see it on TV and it would be awesome to see it, but yeah, I just can't get past the going underwater and not being able breathe properly.\nTodd: Right. Right. Actually, I think for me was I went with my friends and they were so excited about it and then when you would go under water, you're in pairs. You have a buddy and it seemed like you were kind of in line in an amusement park or something, you know.\nRebecca: Really.\nTodd: Yeah, like everybody kind of has to go around and you look around and you see all these other divers and... but I was the only person that felt this way. Everybody else loves diving and the photography so. But actually, is it true the Barrier Reef is being damaged? It's actually not as beautiful as used to be?\nRebecca: Yeah. It's... The name of it is coral bleaching, and the coral is actually turning white, now rather than having the colors it has, so that's been happening for a few years I think and it's getting worse and worse.\nTodd: Oh, so basically the coral is losing it's beautiful color?\nRebecca: Yeah, yeah, basically, just dies and can't be brought back.\nTodd: Well, what about, like you know, the marine life, like you know fish and stuff like that? Is that still abundant?\nRebecca: I assume that would probably go down as well once the coral starts to die off because that is the food source and their housing for the fish so with the loss of the Great Barrier Reef you also lose all the beautiful fish and marine life down there too.\nTodd: That's too bad.",

        "transcript": "Dai: So, I really don't see it. What's the allure of fishing. I mean, why ... what's the catch as it were?\n                              Darren: Well, I can understand that. It's something that looks as if it's not very interesting but it's that thrill and expectancy of just waiting and you can wait for hours and hours and catch nothing, but once that rod starts moving and you know you've got a fish on, especially for the bass that I fish for, there're very, very powerful fish and they can just take the rod and knock it off the rod stand and you're running off at the beach after your rod, which would mean you got a decent fish and the thrill of that moment is just .... it's hard to explain and the only way that you'll ever understand it is to actually have a go yourself. It's like everything. It doesn't suit everybody, but I think a lot more people would fish if they actually had a go and experienced catching a fish.\nDai: Is it a popular sport back home?\nDarren: It's the most popular sport in the U.K. as far as participants are concerned, but it's not very well publicized. It's much more football, rugby, cricket, golf.\nDai: I guess it's not really a spectator sport.\nDarren: No. Although they do actually show some of the fishing events now because of the prize money being so much. It's probably about 25,000 pound for first prize, so it's quite a serious business now and they do actually show that on the television.\nDai: Yeah, I mean, really, I mean, I'm sure a lot of people would find it - almost equate it to hunting in a way. I mean, how do you feel about that?\nDarren: I can understand that view, but I think they need to look at the way fisherman act. As I have said, I only keep fish that I would eat. People who fish the rivers would always put their fish back cause they don't eat the course fish, and that's the way I would see it. It's going back hundreds of years to when people used to hunt.\nDai: And that doesn't hurt the fish .... putting it back?\nDarren: As long as you do it quickly, there's never any harm. You can see the fish swimming away and there's no harm done.\nDai: So, you said that it's the most popular sport in Britain. Is that as new thing or has it always been that way? Do you think it will carry on being popular in the future? Cause it doesn't have a really .. kind of ... sexy image, does it, fishing?\nDarren: No, it doesn't, but there is a major campaign to get youngsters into fishing. It is a very laid back sport. You know, it's not a violent sport by any means, and I think the future is good for fishing, more so though in the rivers, the sea fishing. Unfortunately, the sea stocks are dwindling quite drastically with the trawlers and there's a lot of concern that the fish numbers in the sea are going down so I think sea fishing may become something that's done by fewer people and a lot more people would move in and do river fishing because the stocks there are a lot greater.\nDai: You've almost sold me. So, OK, next time I'll come down to Pembrokeshire and you can take me fishing. What should I bring with me?\nDarren: Well, I'd have enough kit for you to keep you going, but it's one of those things. Have a go at it. See what you like. See if you like it, sorry. If you don't, you don't. You just walk away and find something else, but I think, the majority of people who try it, would get hooked.\nDai: Nice.",

America is famous for well infamous for being one of the fattest countries in the world. Mike you said that in Singapore diet is something of an issue as well, can you please explain?\nMike: Right, well we have all the usual burger joints, Pizza Place, all the fast food basically in Singapore are also and because a lot of us are busy working so naturally this food actually seem like a good idea because it saves us a lot of time and if you're working in a city like Singapore, during lunchtime, you don't have time to basically queue with everybody for food and stuff ... so, fast food are actually good alternative to get your lunch. And on top of that, we have what we call, in Chinese we call it \"kopitian\". What it means is \"coffee shop\" in English and these coffee shops they don't serve, they serve coffee also but a lot of it is actually local delicacies, and Singaporean food are famous for being delicious but very, very high in cholesterol.\n                              \nClare: Well can you give me an example of a dish?\nMike: OK, one of the famous dish is actually originated from I think Malaysia or Indonesia. It's called \"Nasi Lemak\". Nasi Lemak is Malay for \"rice\". What this food ... what Nasi Lemak is actually it consists of fish, which is fried fish and fried egg with coconut rice and ...\nClare: What is coconut rice? I've never heard of that.\nMike: Coconut rice is actually normal rice cooked with, I think, coconut milk, if I'm not wrong and so rice gives off a very, very nice fragrance and we just call it coconut rice. And this coconut rice is, as you can imagine, very very high in cholesterol and ...\nClare: Right, and sugar too\nMike: Right. So Nasi Lemak is one fine example. Another example is probably \"char kway teow\". Char Kway Teow is actually a Tawainese word for fried noodles. So this char kway teow is basically Chinese rice noodles with some fish cakes and with a lot of chilly and bean sprouts and they use a lot of ... I think it's black sauce, Chinese black sauce. Actually I'm not really sure what's the American equivalent. So, just like Nasi Lemat previously, this char kway teow is also very, very high in ...\nClare: In cholesterol.\nMike: Right.\nClare: Although it sounds really, really good. I ate before coming here but I'm hungry again!\nMike: And I think most of the delicious food are high in cholesterol.\nClare: Because frying makes everything taste better.",

        "transcript": "Hanna: So, next week I have to do a debate in my finance class.\nDiego: Oh, really, what is your debate about?\nHanna: Our debate topic is about whether we should teach finance to kids, so things like investment and the stock market. Things like tax.Diego: OK, and what do you think about the topic?Hanna: I think it is really important that kids learn about things like this, particularly in our society these days, where literally everything revolves around money. I mean, even when you're fourteen or fifteen, you go out and get a job and you have to start doing things like paying tax, and I mean, you're gonna have savings, and you can invest that if you wanted to and turn that into more money, so even when you're really young I think it is important to know this kind of information.Diego: But don't you think that there's a lot of consequences when you're burdening kids from ... what was it - middle school, high school with financial responsibilities? I mean kids are kids after all. Shouldn't they be playing around ... going to the park instead of worrying about the stock market crashing in Europe or in the states?Hanna: Well, they don't have to worry about the stock market crashing, but I think it is good if just they know a little bit of information about it.Diego: But if they have all the information every time there's a drop in GE stocks, they're going to flip out and you know, they won't be able to sleep and you're giving kids too much to worry about in an age they shouldn't be worrying about these things. It is after all they're parents' responsibility to worry about these things, and eventually it's going to be their turn but I think it's just giving them something before they have to worry about it.Hanna: So you think junior high school's too early to start to start teaching kids about this kind of stuff?Diego: I think so. Yeah. Especially when you're making it because they have to take responsibility of their own money considering the fact that they don't even have an income.Hanna: What if they do have an income?Diego: Well, they're income would be like five dollars an hour, so I don't think they'll be investing anything of thatHanna: Well, you never know.Diego: Maybe.",

Sit up in trees to protect the trees.\nCheryl: People actually still do that? Tie themselves to trees?Nick: Oh, everyday in Tasmania.Cheryl: Oh, really?Nick: It's a big issue. A very big issue.Cheryl: That's interesting. I once heard of a girl who lived in a tree for a month because she wanted to stop the deforestation company or people from taking down that tree, so she lived up there and she had people bring her supplies but she never came down.Nick: That happens in Tasmania as well. There's people today which are up in trees, maybe up to fifty which permanently live up in trees.Cheryl: Wow!Nick: Yeah, so. I don't know how they do it.Cheryl: That's kind of crazy ... So Nick, from the companies point of view, playing the devil's advocate here, I think they provide jobs for all the people who are working to make trees into paper. What do you think they have to say about that?Nick: Well, it's true, they do provide jobs, and some cities, some small towns do rely on logging industry to provide jobs and support the shops in the place, but ...Cheryl: But!Nick: But! Yeah. So tourism is a very big industry in Tasmania, and maybe the logging industry takes away tourists jobs as well, because it makes certain areas not useful for tourism anymore, not very pretty.Cheryl: Yeah, your right.

I worked in my hometown in Tasmania, and in Tasmania, there's many environmental issues, particularly involving logging of native forests there.\nCheryl: Oh, logging.Nick: Yeah, logging.Cheryl: I recently heard about logging problems in Brazil, I mean Belize in Central America. But what kind of logging issues do you have in Tasmania?Nick: So, in Tasmania, there's some very old forests, maybe hundreds of thousands of years old, and some companies are destroying them, clear-felling the forest, parts of the forest there.Cheryl: Really! What are the companies using the forests for?Nick: To make paper actually. To make wood chips, and then turn wood chips into paper.Cheryl: So, there all paper companies?Nick: Mm, paper companies.Cheryl: Oh, really.Nick: Or paper companies in the end. So initially, loggers, the people which log, go in, they take the trees, they take the trees to big industry, which then break them to wood chips, then make them into paper. And my job was to try to find out how we could minimize the destructiveness of that operation.Cheryl: So what kind of destructiveness would the impact of having deforestation in Tassie ...?Nick: In Tassie?Cheryl: Well, like many animals die obviously, and much biodiversity is taken away, but there's ways to change that process and make it better, so some solutions are instead of clear-filling, just destroying the entire forest section, just take sections out of the forests. Make the forests look like, maybe a checkerboard, so you only take patches of forests, small patches and hopefully don't kill too many animals in the process.Cheryl: But wouldn't that still destroy a percentage of wildlife living in those patches? Nick: Yes, yeah, it will but we still use paper everywhere in the world, so if we use paper, well, the trees need to come from somewhere, so we need to get the practice possible.Cheryl: Mm, I see.Nick: So, it's a bit of give-and-take. Cheryl: We can't stop using paper right?Nick: Oh, I think we should stop using paper. I think we can, but at this stage it's difficult maybe.",

How do set that kind of lifestyle up?\nTodd: You mean like the nomadic lifestyle?\nJulia: Yeah, yeah, when you want to travel and just be free and how do you go about that?Todd: Well, it's interesting. Like I think people get the wrong idea about working that type of life, being like a nomad. First of all you're actually not a tourist and in a lot of ways you're not a traveler. Like I actually worked and oddly enough, you know when I was just traveling and just living from city to city and working digitally from my computer, I put in more than forty hours a week. I actually probably put in maybe fifty or sixty because I had so much time. I had nothing to do usually so I would work usually five to six days a week and usually ten hours a day. So the first thing is that you work a lot and because you work a lot, you have to look for places that are conductive, conducive I'm sorry, that are conducive for working. So the first thing you need is you need a hotel or like usually a short term apartment because it's usually best to stay in one place for about a month and you need a place that has a good desk and a good chair. I cannot emphasize the importance of a good chair. A good chair is actually so much more important than cable TV or a nice bed or a pool or whatever because you're going to sit in the chair all the time. So when I would travel, I would go to a hotel and the first thing I would ask is can I see...Julia: The chair?Todd: Can I see the chairs in the room and if I didn't like the chair, I'd say like look I'm going to be here for two weeks I'll stay but you gotta get me like a nice chair. So that was one thing. So usually you want to get like a short-term housing. You look on the internet, you know, two weeks at a time and usually you can find something cheap. You usually want to be in a major city because you need to have internet and that is the most important thing. You'd be surprised at what countries have fast internet. Like Vietnam really fast and you can work wireless from the beach. I used to sit on the beach with my laptop and have high speed wireless in some of the cities in Vietnam.Julia: Wow.Todd: Yeah, it's amazing. You know, Thailand, Bangkok, it's surprisingly not that fast. So Bangkok wasn't that fast but if you went to a smaller city like Chiang Mai, the internet was really fast.",

What kind of learner are you?\nTodd: Well I guess I'm maybe kinesthetic, that's movement, right, or doing things with your hands.\nJulia: Yeah, I think so or even your whole body?Todd: I don't know. Is kinesthetic using your hands or is it your whole body? Or does it matter?Julia: I'm not sure it matters. Perhaps there's two different types. I know there's something called TPR when we teach English, total physical response.Todd: Right. So that would be kinesthetic?Julia: That's maybe kinesthetic, that's where you give an instruction and the student performs the task and they use the whole body in that case but it can just be your hands or a body part. I think it's both.Todd: Yes, I think so, yeah. Yes, I mean, so basically if I do it like if I somehow have to make it or if I'm moving, I definitely think I learn better. You know, I learned how to do everything for web design and stuff like that by I think just moving the mouse, click here, click there, type here, type there, whereas like reading it from a book I just, you know, I couldn't learn it that way. So maybe, maybe, I'm kind of that way. The same with cooking, you know, like I have to do it. If I don't do it I'm not going to remember it. I just can't read a recipe and cook. So I think maybe the other thing I would be, would be, I guess would be an aural learner or auditory learner. So basically through hearing.Julia: My husband's the same, yeah.Todd: Yeah.Julia: He can hear a sentence, hear a new word, and remember it just from his ears.Todd: Really?Julia: Yeah.Todd: That's good.Julia: That's very good, yeah.Todd: Like I love podcasts and I love hearing things, that's probably why I have this website. I don't like reading too much. I do read and I actually don't even like watching TV very much. I don't like watching movies very much.Julia: Really?Todd: No. I would actually much rather listen to a radio program, a good podcast, than watch a movie.Julia: You see when I listen to a podcast...Todd: While I'm walking.Julia: There you go, definitely kinesthetic. If I listen to a podcast, I get a little bit frustrated that I can't see the people speaking.Todd: Really?Julia: It frustrates me a little bit that I can't see the faces when they're talking, when I don't know what they look like.Todd: Oh, I never even thought of that. Yeah, I just don't even care.Julia: I need to, I need visual input in order for it to, I don't know, go into that part of my brain where it stays, where it stores maybe.Todd: So we're definitely two different types of learners?Julia: Absolutely, yes.",

I certainly have to see a word if I'm learning a language. I have to see it written down.Todd: So you need a phonetic script? You need something?Julia: I need something visual.Todd: Yeah for it to stick in your head?Julia: For it to stay in my mind, it has to have a visual. I can't just hear it for example. I can't just hear a word and remember it. I have to have some sort of visual to connect it to.Todd: OK, so you're a visual learner, anything else?Julia: I think it's called a visual learner. I don't know the technical term for it but an emotional learner if a...Todd: Really?Julia: Yeah. If a piece of information or the thing that I'm learning is attached to an emotional experience, I store it very definitively. I can remember it. I can recall it. If it's just a neutral, say a sentence, I can't remember it. It has to have a back story. It has to have an emotional connection somehow.Todd: Right. It has to have some connection?Julia: Yes, yeah. Usually a personal story especially humor. If there's a joke involved, if it made me laugh at the time of learning it. I'm a laughter learner, I don't know if that's a real one but definitely an emotional response makes it much more easy for me to learn something.",

So I'm interested, so could you tell me a bit about that.\n                          Amy: I don't know how odd they were. I don't know. When I was in university, part time jobs, I used to work in restaurants and—the usual stuff—restaurants, and I think my favorite was working in a nightclub. It was a really, really big nightclub and I used to work on the floor, just kind of cleaning up, looking after all the drunk patrons. \nAnd my first night there was—actually, one of my favorite DJs was on, so that was great.  I got to listen to really good music whilst finding money on the floor, and cleaning up after folks. It was really good. \nPaul: You found some money on the floor. \nAmy: Yeah. You know, it was a busy club. Really, really full, a good couple of thousand people in there. And I guess people were doing whatever they were doing and they would drop big wads of cash. And because I was the person to clean up all the glass bottles, then I would find the wads of cash on the floor. So it was good. I’d get my wages, I’d get tips, and then I would get my own personal tips from finding money on the floor. \nPaul: So you must have found like a whole range of different things, like, what else did you find? \nAmy: Yeah. A little wraps of things, and then packets of things, yeah. I mean, I had to work hard for the money. It wasn’t easy because the place was full, absolutely rammed of people. Everybody is incredibly drunk or whatever and they all just want to dance and have a good time. And I have to make sure there’s no broken glass for safety reasons, obviously. So I’m pushing my way through the crowd and keeping eyes on the floor constantly with a torch. And alongside the broken glass that I would sweep up would be, yeah, wads of cash, sometimes little purses, little bags, things like that. \nWhen I find, like, identification for things—when it was a purse, I would do the right thing with it, hand it in but it was just a wad up, like a rolled up set of notes, I would just put them in my pocket for me, basically. \nPaul: Yeah, it’s difficult to know what to do with cash because you’re handing it to someone who—well, it’s cash, isn’t it? \nAmy: I know. \nPaul: Yeah, yeah. \nAmy: I remember finding some driving license and student ID, and I took—it was actually the same university that I went to at the time, and I just took it to uni when I was going during the week. And I handed it in to make sure that it got back to the owner because you know that’s the worst thing about when you lose your purse or your wallet. The cash, you can kind of just say goodbye to. It’s a given really that it’s going to be gone, but it’s your ID and your cards and everything. It’s such a hassle trying to get them back again. So I wanted to make sure that whoever drunken idiot dropped them in that club that it got back to their hands safely. \nPaul: Well, that’s nice. So you’re a thief with heart then. \nAmy: I’m not a thief. I’m an opportunist. \nPaul: I’m kidding. I’m kidding. \nAmy: It’s on the floor. \nPaul: I’m pulling your leg, Amy. No, I would have done the same. \nEnd of Transcript",

        "transcript": "Aimee: So Paul, speaking of technology, how long do you think you can go without checking your phone? \nPaul: Ah, it’s quite embarrassing, really, if I’m honest,  I check it a lot. I really do, like I’m always having to look at Facebook, my emails. I’m looking at the football news online… yeah, I mean ….It’s not something that I’m proud about; but it’s something that, yeah,  it’s quite a big part of my life, I think.\nAimee: If you left the house and you had forgotten your phone, would you feel something really missing?\nPaul:  I did actually I forgot my…I use my iPad a lot, and  I forgot my iPad the other day just as I was leaving, and my bus was about to arrive. And I really had the strong like pull to get back for it. But I caught myself and decided that yeah, I can manage without it, you know, for one day.\nAimee: Could you manage?\nPaul: Yeah, I did, I didn’t even think about it actually. It was just that you know, that sort of momentary pull where I thought I needed it, and then actually having you know, sort of considered it seriously. It was like, I don’t need it, so yeah,  I did find without it I didn’t have to be like hooked up to a life support system or anything. Yeah, it’s amazing really, how it comes to be such a central part in your life. How long do you think you could go without using the internet?\nAimee: Ahh, I check my phone thousands of times a day… To exaggerate, did I say thousands? I check it too much, I think, far too much. If I left my home, I would feel gutted. I would feel like I’m really, really missing something. It would definitely be a big, big pull, I think. I read a lot of things on the internet and I check things and, and yeah. When it’s not there, then I do feel like something is maybe I should be doing something, or missing out on something. And it’s not good - I’m embarrassed it’s not good at all. So I think I need to work on unplugging.\nPaul: I’ve heard a lot of people they try to do at least one or two days a week when they don’t use the internet at all. But that sounds like it could be quite a good idea. You know, maybe just you know, unplug.\nAimee: Yeah. Do you think you could?\nPaul: I think I could, yeah, I think I could. In fact, I really like hiking and being outdoors, and, I think one of the things I really love about it is that I’m … nobody can contact me, you know? And I’m kinda away from everything. And  I really enjoy those moments.\nAimee: Uhm, yeah. I don’t know if I could. I always have to cut down before going cold turkey, I think, I’ve got to cut down. I’m trying to cut down. You know, I mentioned before, I’m trying to get back into reading uhm, just get back into real books instead of screen time. So, yeah, I couldn’t go cold turkey, I think, a couple of days a week. I would need to cut down.\nPaul: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think we should probably yeah, make a concerted effort I think it is probably good for us to try to reduce our, you know, user time.",

So I think in the morning, I need to do other things but very often, I will quickly scan my phone and check because my phone is also my alarm clock, so it’s right there. It’s too handy. \nPaul: Yeah. I’m always one that wake up—I don’t know, I’ve got this really bad habit where I think something major has happened during the night. And so I wake up and I’m checking different websites and checking Facebook to see if there’s any messages or any great news over the course of the night. \nYeah, it’s a really bad habit, you know. It starts to kind of dominate your life. Yeah, I think it’s quite addictive things, isn’t it? \nAimee: Yeah. I’ve been thinking about it a lot recently. And it’s something I think that doesn’t need to be in the morning routine so much. It’s good to just get your head ready before you—your head and your body ready before you start thinking about checking emails and stuff. \nPaul: I agree. I heard somebody—there was a piece of advice, I can’t remember where I heard it from. But it was just to check your emails twice a day. You know, you don’t need to do more than that. Check once in the morning, once in the evening, that’s it. Check your news websites, maybe twice a day rather than every 30 minutes or something. \nAimee: Yeah, that’s—\nPaul: Yeah. I think it requires discipline doesn’t it? \nAimee: It does. \nPaul: Yeah. \nAimee: It’s good advice but I don’t know if it’s very practical because if you’re using a smartphone, which I do, then you’re using it first, it’s got so many different function and you need it for—need it, I guess is a loose term. But you use it for so many different things. So it’s always there, you know. Always there. \nHowever, I did start reading a book the other day, so I’m trying to stop looking at my phone and start reading a book instead. \nPaul: Oh, good for you. Yeah. \nAimee: Thanks. \nPaul: That’s good move. Yeah, I should perhaps do that myself.",

        "transcript": "Mark: So you were talking about how you got five brothers. Do you have a different relationship with each one of them? \nSorie: Yeah, definitely. They all range in age, so the oldest is 26 years old and the youngest is six years old. So I’m closer to my closest brother but they all have different personalities. And I have a great relationship with each one of them. \nMark: I’m wondering if the relationship you have with the oldest one is more like brotherly-sister and the relationships you have with the really young ones is more like some kind of mother and son relationship. \nSorie: Definitely. As I told you, my youngest brother is six years old. And my neighbors, they used to think that that was my child because of the difference in age. And I would be carrying him around and I would change his diapers. And when my mom was out, I was the one taking care of them or when my mom was sick, I was the one making their meals. \nAnd still have a different kind—I feel a different love for them than the love I feel for my brother. I feel like he’s more like a friend. I can talk to him; I can share my experiences with him. We’re close in age so we have a lot of similarities. And with my younger brothers, they often ask for advices and they want me to give them a little bit of my knowledge. So it’s very different with each one of them. \nHow about you? You said you had only one sister. \nMark: Yeah. I have one sister and she’s older than me. Definitely, there’s no sense of motherliness from her. I didn’t feel that at all. And we were just totally independent. I was a boy and she was a girl. She did girl things, I did boy things, and then we just lived in the same house. \nSorie: What’s the age gap between the two of you? \nMark: It’s like three years. \nSorie: Three years, okay. \nMark: Yeah. \nSorie: What’s the relationship you have with her right now?\nMark: The relationship I have with her right now—well, we live in different countries, so we’re so far apart. And she now has children, and I don’t have any children but we still intermittently keep in touch with each other. And it’s the same kind of feeling, the same, like; familial love obviously is very present. But it doesn’t—we don’t—I don’t know. You spoke about you’re talking to your brother about lots of things that you’ve been up to. And perhaps, I don’t talk to my sister about things, and I talk to my wife and my friends about those things. So it’s more like she’s my family rather than my friend. \nSorie: I see. Did you ever wish to have any brothers? \nMark: No. I just took it as it came. It wasn’t my choice, so I didn’t wish for any brothers or sisters anymore. She’s just my older sister. But I had lots of friends. Friends are very important to me, so my friends are like—my male friends, when I was younger, they’re like my brothers really. So it didn’t matter that they weren’t part of my family like an extended family.",

They’re all younger than I and I’m the only girl in the house. \nMark: The only girl, all younger than you? \nSorie: Yes. I am 27 and the youngest is six years old. He’s just gone to first grade right now. \nMark: That’s an incredible age span, isn’t it? \nSorie: Yes, that’s right. \nMark: Sort of busy mother. \nSorie: Yeah. She had me when she was 17 years old. So she’s still very young. And even though I didn’t have any sisters, she was so close in age that I felt like she was like my sister. \nMark: Right. So being the only girl didn’t really—you didn’t feel anything odd about that? \nSorie: I always tried my mom’s dresses and her shoes. And I wanted to be like her. But most of the time, I was spending with my brothers. And I remember, it was very hectic, it was like a zoo. I remember one time when my brother was chasing me with a big knife. \nMark: Wow. \nSorie: And closed the door and the knife was stuck in the door. \nMark: So having those brothers, did it make you like more boyish than girlish? \nSorie: Definitely, yeah. And I like that. I feel very comfortable around boys or males than females. Even growing up, I had more male friends than female friends. \nMark: Hmm, did you never kind of pine or crave for that sister? \nSorie: You know, not really. No, no. I wanted a big brother actually. And I really enjoyed the presence of boys. You just don’t have to worry about anything. You can just speak and be honest. Whenever we got together with my girlfriends, I had to be more concerned about their feelings and I actually don’t like that very much. \nMark: Hmm, I’m not like you though. I’m from a really small family. I just got my sister. I grew up with my sister, and I did feel like I could speak to her about most things. I don’t feel like I had to restrict myself from sharing certain things. \nSorie: I think it also depends on at certain age. When you’re younger, there is that time where you’re always fighting. And then you grow older and then you have families and then you have more things in common and the relationship changes throughout your life. \nMark: What I find really interesting about myself and my sister, I think we’re really, really different. But there’s something about us that, it makes us really, really similar. And I can’t quite put my finger on it but it’s like, yeah, it's like our humor is the same. We might laugh at the same thing and even now as we’re older already. I don’t feel like we particularly have many similar interests or much in common but we can still speak to each other and there’s definitely that sense of family connection.",

Dinner and get my daughter ready for bed, usually. Just get her sorted before I think about relaxing or doing anything else, because if I sit down, I never want to stand back up again when I get from work. \nSo yeah, my evening routine is usually pretty steady. Just get everybody fed, the youngest person washed into bed, and then I can relax. How about you? \nPaul: Yeah, I live alone, so I get back from work and I try to cook for myself. So most nights of the week, I'll probably go home and I then go to the supermarket, get some stuff to cook and cook dinner and then maybe relax in front of my computer, watch some TV and maybe do some work. \nBut maybe that's my routine for about five nights of the week. And then maybe, the other two nights, I'll go out with friends and go for dinner and maybe go for a few drinks. \nAimee: Sounds good. \nPaul: Yeah. \nAimee: Yeah, I was thinking about my weekday routine. I guess, weekend routine is more relaxed. It's not as stuck, I guess. The weekend, yeah, we'd maybe go for dinner or go for a bath. \nPaul: So Aimee, you sound, you know, very much into family life. Do you ever sort of miss being single? \nAimee: My single life routine? \nPaul: Yeah. \nAimee: I think I sometimes miss the freedom and maybe the—especially the freedom with my finances, just being able to spend my money on myself, going out to concerts or nightclubs. Yeah, sometimes but not very much. I think what has replaced it is good for my current lifestyle. I think it suits me. I'm happy. \nPaul: So you'd recommend family life to somebody like me who's single? \nAimee: If you find the right family, I think yeah. Family life is good. It's fun. You'd find that families can stick with other families and the adults can still have a laugh and have adult conversation and the kids can play. If the kids are happy, then the parents are happy and you can still have a laugh and hopefully, not talk about too many childish things. You don't have to talk about changing nappies or anything—\nPaul: So you still have a social life then? \nAimee: We try to, yes. We try to. Yeah, when budget allows and our daughter, she's five, so there's more freedom that comes when your children get older. When they're younger, then the rule a bit more unfortunately. But such as life. I would recommend it, Paul, yes. \nPaul: Okay. I'll have to think seriously about it. Thanks, Aimee. \nAimee: You're welcome.",

I mean, do you follow like a strict routine? \nAimee: Not really. I'm pretty laid-back, I think. \nPaul: I see. \nAimee: Work days, you have to follow a routine, I guess because you have to get ready, you have to get out the door. But on days off, I just do what I feel like pretty much. Pretty relaxed. \nPaul: Well, that I think is important isn't it, to relax on your days off. But like on a work day, so what do you do first in the morning? \nAimee: I think probably what everybody does first. I have to go to the bathroom. \nPaul: Okay. I mean, what do you do after that? Do you make yourself a hot drink? \nAimee: I wash my face and brush teeth, pretty much, and then cajole my daughter into getting on with her morning routine as well, making sure she's ready. \nPaul: I see. So you've got to get two people ready. \nAimee: Yes, I do. How about you? \nPaul: I just need to worry about myself really. I think that's enough, you know. \nAimee: Is that a big task? \nPaul: Yeah. Well, I always have a cup of tea in the morning. First thing, I always put the kettle on and make a hot drink. And I usually try to eat like a good breakfast, not just a piece of toast or something but maybe some eggs, scrambled eggs and maybe some bacon and some toast. Yeah, I try to leave the house with a full stomach. \nAimee: Yeah, that's good. I try to do that as well. Sometimes, we're pretty rushed and breakfast is sometimes eaten in the car. But we do get full stomachs eventually. \nPaul: Right, right. \nAimee: Do you ever have fruit with your breakfast? \nPaul: I don't. I know some people eat like a grapefruit. Actually, occasionally, I have a banana. \nAimee: Hmm. \nPaul: Yeah, because I just find it's really easy, and convenient, and quick. \nAimee: I agree. \nPaul: But stuff like, you know, grapefruits and oranges, you have to peel them. Yeah, I just don't have the time really in the morning. \nAimee: Too much like hard work? \nPaul: Yeah. But if I stay in like if I'm on a holiday in a hotel and they have like a nice breakfast, I always try to eat fruit. So I always try to eat a bit of everything actually. \nAimee: When it's there in front of you, ready. \nPaul: When it's made for you, yeah. \nAimee: I do that, too, definitely. \nPaul: Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Jeremy: Abidemi, so looking back at your life as a student, can you tell me a little bit about your experience with the best teacher that you had, and maybe a little bit about your worst teacher? \nAbidemi: Sure. I think I’ve had many, many great teachers. I’ve been really blessed in that way. Thinking back now, I remember my teacher when I was in primary 6 in Nigeria, actually. His name was Mr. Oleaer. And this teacher was a math and science teacher. And I think the best thing about him was he really took a personal interest in all of us. We could tell that he really cared. Although, he was very much a teacher, he took that authority role but at the same time, he was like our friend. Like during the break time, we would approach him, we would talk to him. And over the summer, he tutored a few of us for the entrance examination to high school because we have that system in Nigeria. \nSo it was just fun. Every time we saw him, we just have a good time with him. And I remembered he talked to me. He mentored—he was like a mentor. He came to me, and he was wondering what I wanted to be in the future and he made some suggestions because of the scores I had in his class. And to this day, I still remember him. He sticks in my mind. And having taught for a little bit as well, I think for me too, he’s one of the people that I tried to model myself after. I model myself after him. Maybe not even consciously, but I liked the fact that he was a teacher and we knew it but at the same time, he was very friendly. So I really love that aspect of him.\nHow about you, Jeremy? Anyone comes to mind? \nJeremy: You know, it was more just sort of teacher qualities that I remember from a number of different teachers. And what I always really—when I look back and think about teachers that made a difference, it was teachers that recognized students’ weakness and tried to counsel them or to sort of—in my case, it was that I was a very, very shy person. And a teacher who would talk to me a little bit and give me encouragement if I did a presentation, which was just the worst thing I could possibly ever do because I was so nervous. But teachers that recognized I had a real serious shy problem, and that they would just give a little bit of encouragement. And those with little bits of encouragement, over time I started to gain a little bit more confidence. And by the time I was in university, I still had a problem with giving presentations but—even in university, I had teachers who would compliment me on a job attempted—and I wouldn’t really say well done, but I tried. \nAnd those were the things that really stood out, teachers that recognize when people have issues in their life and they really try to encourage them to overcome those issues. It wasn’t just one teacher. It was a number of teachers. But not all teachers did that. Some of them, it wasn’t part of their job description to be a counselor, I guess, and it was more work and they just didn’t attempted or didn’t care or maybe didn’t recognize it. But some people really thought, here’s a guy who maybe needs a little bit of extra boost, and they would try to help me out. Those are the probably the things that stick out in my mind. And like you, I try to model myself after those teachers to try to find students who need a little bit of extra encouragement and make them feel better about themselves. \nAbidemi: I think that’s great. I think as teachers, everyone, if you have an opportunity to be a teacher, one of the best things you can do is to try and find the potential in each and everyone of your student because everyone has something special in them. And for a teacher to recognize that, it’s so awesome. It’s amazing. Yeah. \nJeremy: I think you’re right.",

        "transcript": "Jeremy: So Abidemi, you were a teacher at one time but now you’ve gone back to school. Can you tell me what that’s like? \nAbidemi: Well, Jeremy, I think it’s great. I think it’s awesome to be able to go back and play the role of a student after being a teacher for a few years. I’m actually loving it. I really enjoy learning. So that aspect of it is great. I love the fact that I have less responsibility as a student now, whereas before, as a teacher, I had the full pressure of all the students on me. If I had 30 students, that means 30 times as much pressure or so it felt like. But now, I just have to concern myself with only me. So that aspect I love. \nJeremy: Is there anything you miss about being a teacher? \nAbidemi: Maybe, yeah. I miss standing in front of a whole bunch of people and getting to teach them something that they don’t know about, share my own opinions and lead discussions. I really miss that. And getting to know each of my students in a different way, I miss that. So yeah, for sure. \nJeremy: Do you think you have a new appreciation of being a student now that you didn’t have before you became a teacher? \nAbidemi: Yes, definitely. Definitely. I wished I had been able to go back to be a student a long—way before this time. And I would love for every teacher to go back and become a student because personally, I think I was very strict as a teacher before. Some of students said it but I didn’t realize. I didn’t understand how but maybe I did give away too much homework and expected way too much. So now, if I had to go back, I would, yeah, be more lenient, I think. \nJeremy: So you think becoming a student again has made you, maybe, into a better teacher. \nAbidemi: For sure, definitely, definitely. It’s made me appreciate what my students do a lot more. \nJeremy: So do you have any desire to become a teacher again after you finish your degree? \nAbidemi: Yes, I do. Yes, I do. I would love to go back into the classroom as a teacher, whether it’d be to teach English or teach something else. I enjoyed that role a lot, so I look forward to it. \nJeremy: Yeah, I can say that I had a very similar experience. I was a teacher after I graduated my undergraduate, and I taught for a year in Korea. And just that experience really made me appreciate how much freedom you have as a student but also how much motivation you have to push yourself forward. How it has to be up to you to do it. You know, you don’t have anybody else breathing down your neck to do stuff. \nSo I really found my second go as being a student was much, much more successful than my first go because I enjoyed being in the classroom. I didn’t feel I had to be in the classroom. So yeah, I’d like being a teacher made me a much better student. And being a student for many, many years, my graduate degree also made me a much better teacher, I think. \nAbidemi: That’s great. \nJeremy: Yeah. \nAbidemi: That’s great. \nEnd of Transcript",

        "transcript": "Mark: So Sorie, talking about ocean sports and being on the ocean. Maybe you could talk about your ocean swimming experience in Ogasawara. \nSorie: Yeah, I love swimming, you know. It's so peaceful to be there in the ocean. And the ocean in Ogasawara was very clear and you could see so many fishes and I'd love to go swimming and immersed in the ocean. It was like another world. It was very beautiful but there was one time—oh, that time. \nMark: What happened? \nSorie: My friends had come to visit and so, we went fishing. But before they started fishing, I decided to go for a swim. And I swam, and I could see all the way to the bottom of the ocean. And I see this fish but they're actually not fish, they were sharks. They were white-tipped sharks. \nMark: Wow. \nSorie: There were four of them at the bottom of the ocean. And I just remember that one you have to do is to keep calm. So I did that. I swam out. I told my friends, \"There are four sharks down there, so get me out of here.\" So they got me out of there but my heart was beating so fast. I was so scared. \nMark: Were they dangerous? Those sharks? \nSorie: Well, they're not dangerous. They might be able to like bite a finger off but I didn't want that to happen either. So as soon as I saw them, I came out of the place. Yeah, but that was so scary. \nMark: Wow. Oh as far, it sounds beautiful and amazing and dangerous all the same time. \nSorie: That's right. So Mark, what about you? Do you have any encounters with fish? \nMark: With fish? Well, I remember fish in—don't you remember when we saw it together? We were swimming in that beach called Kominato, and we swam out around those rocks where we always went. How am I looking a pair of snorkels on it, so peaceful and pretty and like just tranquil and I'm looking at all the fish. And then suddenly, that freaky fish, it started at us. Do you remember that? \nSorie: Yeah, with huge eyes. \nMark: Huge eyes, and then he started coming towards us. \nSorie: That's right. So in the middle of the ocean, we decided, okay, let's just split. \nMark: We were swimming away from it and it was swimming after us, this little fish. \nSorie: It was very small. It was like 30 centimeters long but they’re really scary. \nMark: Yeah, we were quite far out from the beach and we did split, didn't we? \nSorie: And then what happened? \nMark: I went that way and you went that way. And just guess which way it went? \nSorie: My way. \nMark: And it just chased you all the way into the sea, into the beach. \nSorie: That's right. So I was swimming really quickly. I'm trying to get out of the beach and it was very close to me. And I thought it would bite my toes. But it didn't do anything. But I can't forget that time that a small fish got me out of the ocean. \nMark: It was so weird, isn't it, like, fish don't do that. \nSorie: They don't. And it was the only fish, like there were no other fish around. \nMark: Strange. \nSorie: Mysterious.",

        "transcript": "Sorie: So Mark, I hear you're a surfer but you're also a paddle boarder. \nMark: Hmm, no waves around here. \nSorie: So is that why you chose to paddle board?\nMark: Yeah, if I could surf, I'd be surfing everyday but luckily, we still live by the ocean here but it's flat out there on the ocean. And paddle boarding is the perfect way to get on the ocean. \nSorie: Okay. So what do you use? \nMark: It's like this huge long board. It's like 10 or 11 foot long. And you get to have paddle, which is not like a kayak paddle with paddles on either side, it's just got a place for you hand on one side and it's got kind of paddle bit on the other. And you stand up and off you go. \nSorie: So what is it called? \nMark: It's called sup. \nSorie: Sup. \nMark: Hmm.\nSorie: And it stands for? \nMark: Stand up paddle board, SUP. \nSorie: Awesome. \nMark: Yeah. \nSorie: So you go there everyday in the morning. You stand up on this board. Is it easy? \nMark: It's a bit tricky at first but it's a very versatile bit of equipment you can like kneel on it or you can sit across laying on it. And you can just use it like a canoe or a kayak. But if you're confident, you can start to stand up. But when you first stand up, you definitely fall in a first few times or even more.\n                          Sorie: And how is it to be there in the middle of the ocean on this board?\nMark: Tranquil. It's amazingly peaceful and tranquil. And you're right out there with the colors and the birds and the fish around you. A lot of jellyfish in the place where we live now. \nSorie: So yeah, I've heard you stories of you going on this sup and you tell me, you come back and you can see quite inside in the ocean? \nMark: Yeah. So clear because there's not much swell that's why there's no waves too. But yeah, the clarity is quite immense. And as I said this, there's jellyfish and they're as big as you are. They're like 5-or-6-foot. And their top like head bit, I don't know how big that is but their tentacles just wiggle down for about 5-feet long. \nSorie: Are you not scared of falling off? \nMark: I'm not really. I haven't fallen off since we moved here. I think I've got it finally but I wouldn't want to be in there with those jellyfish. \nSorie: No, you wouldn't. \nMark: Have you tried it? \nSorie: Yes. In the past, in a different place. But I only like to do it where I know that if I fall, I'll be safe. So I wouldn't want to try with jellyfish, no. \nMark: No. They're not everywhere though. You can go to the place where there's no jellyfish. Definitely, I recommend doing it.\nSorie: All right. I'll try. Thanks. \nEnd of Transcript",

        "transcript": "Amy: How about you? Have you ever been in an accident? \nPaul: Not a car accident. I was in a bicycle accident. \nAmy: Yeah? \nPaul: I laugh now but at the time, it was pretty bad. \nAmy: What happened? \nPaul: It was dark and it was Christmas day. And I was on my bicycle going down a quite steep slope and my telephone rang. And I looked at my mobile phone and I took it out of my pocket whilst riding my bike. And looked at it and noticed it was my dad and he was ringing to wish me a happy Christmas. \nSo I felt sort of compelled to answer the phone. So answering the phone, still going down the hill, probably gathering speed. It's dark and I'm trying to get my dad off the phone as soon as I can. And before I knew it, I drove straight into the back of a parked black car. \nAmy: Oh no. \nPaul: I saw it at the very last minute. So I hit the back of it and my body slammed into the ground, and I broke a few bones, yeah. Yeah. \nAmy: Oh no. \nPaul: Yeah, yeah. It was a pretty miserable Christmas to be honest with you. \nAmy: I'd say it's terrible. That's the worst. \nPaul: Yeah. \nAmy: Did the owner of the car see what happened? Did you damage the car? \nPaul: I didn't stay long enough. I got out of there pretty quickly. \nAmy: And went to the hospital. \nPaul: No, I was a bit stubborn. I don't know why. I was the worst night sleep I've ever had but yeah, I didn't go to the hospital until the next day. \nAmy: What bones did you break? \nPaul: I broke my collarbone, the clavicle. \nAmy: Oh, a nightmare. \nPaul: And I broke a few ribs. \nAmy: Oh no, ribs. That's the worst because they can't do anything for it. They just send you on your way and you just have to cough in pain. \nPaul: Hmm. \nAmy: Oh no. \nPaul: Yeah. But it could have been a lot worse, you know. \nAmy: Hmm, that's true. \nPaul: Yeah. I could have broken my neck. \nAmy: So how long did it take you to recover? \nPaul: It took me about probably six weeks, I suppose. \nAmy: Hmm. \nPaul: Yeah, because then—actually, in the following —it happened on Christmas day, so three months later in the March, I was lucky enough to win a place in the Tokyo marathon. And I really wanted to do it because it's quite difficult to get. It's like a lottery now. There's so many people who apply to get a position. \nSo I wasn't going to let this accident stop me from running the Tokyo marathon. So I was trying to rush it, really and I shouldn't have. But I did. I've run there. \nAmy: Did you? \nPaul: Yeah. \nAmy: Oh, my goodness. \nPaul: Yeah, I finished it but—\nAmy: Congratulations. But how were you? That must have really hindered your recovery. \nPaul: It hindered my training period for the marathon, yeah, so. \nAmy: But you finished it though. \nPaul: I finished it, yeah. \nAmy: Well done. \nPaul: I wouldn't do it again. Marathons are miserable things to be. Really. Why put yourselves through that pain? I still like running so maybe in the future, I'd do a half marathon or something, yeah. But a full marathon—my marathon days are over, I think. Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Jeremy: So you were 12 when you came to Canada. \nAbidemi: That’s right. \nJeremy: Do you remember anything that was either really similar or really different from how teachers taught or from the classroom experience? Were they more or less the same or were they shockingly different? \nAbidemi: Actually, I think they were different in a lot of ways. For some reason, I had finished my grade 6, which is like primary 6; they called it in Nigeria, which is the end of high school—no, sorry. The end of elementary school in Nigeria. \n\nSo when I came to Canada, they put me into grade 7 thinking it’s the next level. But my level was higher so they put me into grade 8 after that. So I got to skip a grade, which was really great. But I remember in terms of the way of thinking; in my English literature class, we had a conversation and we had to finish a story. And it was like, “Suddenly, something appeared in the sky. What is it?”\nAnd all my classmates were, “It’s a UFO.” For me, I’d never heard of a UFO. So they were like it’s a UFO. It makes somebody disappear, it picks up somebody, and one of their classmate and another person disappears. \nBut in my essay, I’m like—it was just weird. I had a totally different way of thinking and processing things. And that really surprised my teachers because when they wrote my composition, they compared it to the rest of the class, to my classmates and they were like, “Wow, this is interesting that you’re the same age and we’re all speaking the same language, but the way we view things is very different.” \nAnd I guess, to me as well, it was my first exposure to cultural differences. And then after that, many years later, coming to Japan and being different again, in a different setting, it made me think back to that time thinking, wow, you can’t always expect the same things. Differences come in weird places sometimes. \nJeremy: I see. \nAbidemi: So yeah, that’s one thing I remember. But a lot of things were the same. We are the same, and yeah, different. \nJeremy: So Abidemi, just in terms of sort of the simple things in life, when you came to Canada, were there any foods or drinks that you were particularly fond of right away or thought were particularly strange? \nAbidemi: Hmm, very good question. Food, a lot of food was all right, right off the bat, like we didn’t have any difficulties with that. But one thing I do remember was nacho chips. We were not used to cheese, the taste of cheese. So my sisters and I, what we would do is we would buy nacho chips, like, Doritos—I don’t know if everyone knows that—and we would wash it because the cheesy taste was strange. So we would wash it before eating it and then we would eat it. And I have some friends who will just stare at us, like, “What’s the point? Why would you buy that flavor of chips? That’s the whole point, to taste that.” But we were like, “No, we can’t eat this.” \n\nBut eventually now, I love Doritos. I have grown accustomed to the taste. \nJeremy: You probably made it healthier though. \nAbidemi: That’s true.",

I may not get it lying on the beach – you’ve got the sand, you’ve got the surf. I do get it, but I just get too bored. I’d rather be more active, doing some sort of swimming, some sort of activity….\nAimee: I really enjoy swimming in the ocean. If I go to the beach, I don’t sunbathe at all. I sit in the shade until I just want to swim in the ocean: go snorkeling, see something. That’s a lot more fun.\nPaul: Mmmm, yeah, see something, explore a bit. Yeah, yeah. I mean the sea creatures are actually fascinating really. You put that snorkel on, it's as if you’ve gone into a new world.\nAimee: I couldn’t do that in Scandinavia, I don’t think.\nPaul: Speaking of Scandinavia, I did a home stay when I was a high school student.\nAimee: Oh, did you?\nPaul: Yeah, and it was with a Danish family.

Uhm, like stereotypically very  strong, blond hair, and every day of the year without fail, she would swim in the sea.\nAimee: Oh my goodness.\nPaul: You know there’d big blocks of ice in the sea, and she’d still be swimming.\nAimee: A sturdy lass.\nPaul: Yeah, she swore by it.

Yes, but admiration, but I won’t want to follow her.\nAimee: I don’t think I could - only certain times a year.\nPaul: Yeah.",

Why would you like to live in that sort of climate?\nAimee: Uhm, The snow is just so beautiful and my image of those countries is that their infrastructure is sufficient enough to keep you warm when you’re inside. You know? But I’d say it's just so beautiful. The snow is amazing, It quietens everything. I think it’s glorious. I just really like it. I used to ski when I was younger. So I always ... I like skiing and I like the hills, and yeah, and the snow on hills is just beautiful for me. How about you?\nPaul: Well I, I love snow too, but I don’t like it when it gets so slushy and sloppy you know, and your feet are freezing. You know I think like, the ideal of snow is really appealing. I’m not sure about, you know, living in it. I prefer, I don’t know maybe the climate of like Southern Italy, kind of Mediterranean, climate I think that would be really quite pleasant. You know? Not too hot, by the sea, although yeah, in the summer, it does gets hot. But I don’t think it’s the humidity.\nAimee: Right, I was just thinking about that. What kind of heat is it? Is it a dry heat?\nPaul: I think it is a drier heat. Yeah, yeah, whereas the heat we obviously we get here is unbearable at times, right?\nAimee: Yeah, it’s really bad. Yeah.\nPaul: So, uhm….\nAimee: What’s the highest temperature?  What’s the range of temperature in Southern Italy , what kind of climate, do you know?\nPaul: Not sure, I guess maybe at this time of year it starts getting up towards 20 degrees C. \nAimee: That’s nice.\nPaul: And then I think it does you know places like Sicily, I think it does get pretty hot, probably like high 30s? Yeah, yeah, so and I think the winters are probably quite mild, unless you’re from the North of Italy of course, near the mountains. \nAimee: Yeah.\nPaul: Down in the south it remains kind of pretty mild, you know?\nAimee: Aha, if it’s  in the Med ... It's my images of that. I’ve never been to Italy so I don’t know. I’ve been to the South of France and it got really hot. That was a nice temperature. It was dry, and yeah the nighttime wasn’t too hot either, it was really nice during the day. That was a nice climate, I think.",

        "transcript": "Abidemi: So Jeremy, we both work in Japan, and I was just talking about how it feels like to go home. How does it feel like for you, Jeremy? \nJeremy: Well, when I go back to Canada, really the first thing that I notice is the air. And it’s a funny thing to think but I know when I arrive in Vancouver and I walk out of the airport, I can smell West Coast Canada air. And it really gives a kind of positive feeling to me. You know, it’s a small thing but you notice how clean. I know it’s a stereotype with Canada but it really is such a clean place. And also, Vancouver, you have the smell of the ocean and you have the mountains right there. So that’s the first that I always notice. \nBut when I go back and I visit my parents, it takes me about 10 minutes to get used to where I am being back home. You know, it doesn’t take long at all. And I think it’s because that’s the house that I grew up in and just the feeling that I grew up with, it returns immediately. You know, it goes away when I’m away, when I’m living in Japan but as soon as I get back home, that feeling of comfort comes back within minutes. And I look forward to the same thing that everybody looks forward to when they go back home, and food is right at the top of that list. \nYou know, I honestly look forward to turkey dinner, maybe more than anything in the world, or  prime rib or those types of things. But it’s just the small things; having mom make a snack or something like that. And just the feeling of being completely at ease and without a worry in the world is kind of what I most look forward to going back home. \nThere’s other things when you go out and you go to the stores and you circulate around town. It does feel a little bit like you’re an alien in your own town. And I mean—but that’s a feeling that I never mind. I have no problem being a foreigner in my own home now. I kind of enjoy the feeling. And sometimes, I even wish that I didn’t speak the language everybody else was speaking because I don’t want to hear everybody’s conversations to be honest. \nBut you know the feeling of being in my house or my parent’s house is really a feeling that is just complete comfort. \nAbidemi: How often do you get to back home now? \nJeremy: Well, just because of the cost, I can probably only go back once a year. And also, we have an infant boy and traveling with a one-year old on a 10-hour flight is—until you do it, you really never realize how terrible it is. But it is uncomfortable. It is really uncomfortable. So yeah, we’re only able to make it back to Canada probably once a year now but his grandparents love seeing him so much that we want to do it as much as we possibly can. \nAbidemi: I guess the fact that you can’t go as often as you would like makes it even much more worthwhile when you do get to go. \nJeremy: It’s true. It’s true, yeah. Just the expense and the time that we have to put in, while you’re there you basically savor every second. You don’t want to sleep. You just want to enjoy it. So yeah, it’s a pretty special experience going back home now. \nAbidemi: That’s awesome. \nEnd of Transcript",

It's been pretty bad in some places. I think, it's been the wettest January on record in the UK at the moment. \nPaul: Right, right, right. So do you think it's kind of indicative of climate change? Are you a climate change believer or a climate change denier? \nAimee: I think it's hard to deny really. I think what humans do to the planet is going to have some effect and science is science, you know. It's backed up by evidence and facts and scientists don't tend to say things until they know it's true or as true as it can be. So yeah, I'm definitely a believer in climate change, I think. We are affecting things on the planet. \nHow about you? \nPaul: I've read quite a lot about it. And yes, there is a science to support it but there's also a lot of science to — not to deny it but there's definitely a lot of questions that aren't answered yet. It's a very sort of complex issue. I mean, these global systems of weather and you've got all these like organic processes going on that we just don't really understand. And then trying to explain all these complex events by saying it's climate change, it's…\nI mean, what worries me is that by denying it, it seems to also be a sort of justification for us to continue living the way we are, which worries me a lot. Whether it's true or not, I think we need to be thinking about how we can live better. And that means, living in ways that are less, sort of, damaging on our environment. \nAimee: Yeah, I agree. I agree. I've also read a bit about weather systems that are perhaps not—because of climate of change, every planet has weather systems that come and go. And I understand that part but I also fully agree that we have to stop being so destructive. \nI think it's pretty clear. You can't continue cutting down acres and acres and acres of really valuable resources like the rainforest. I mean, we need that to breathe, so it just doesn't make sense. Yeah, I think we definitely have to stop being so destructive.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Okay. So Meg, this week we’re talking about just grooming habits and stuff. So let’s go now to like out teeth. Now, the dentist says you should floss every day. Do you floss every day?\nMeg: Now, I do actually. I’m pretty consistent with it because a couple years back I had some cavity issues that I didn’t want to go through again. And I wasn’t good about flossing before that but the dentist said that if I flossed and used mouthwash regularly, probably it could be avoided. And so ever since then, really every day, I do it.\nTodd: Well that’s good.\nMeg: Yeah. What about you?\nTodd: Well the dentist always says you should floss more. I’m pretty good about every other day. And then every now and then I’ll get it on a binge, like, “Oh I’m going to floss every meal like I’m supposed to,” but I’m pretty good. I brush my teeth twice a day. I know some people at work, I see them brushing after lunch.\nAre you one of those people that brushes their teeth three times a day?\nMeg: No, I do twice a day also. Do you do morning and night?\nTodd: Yeah. And actually, my dentist told me don’t do it three times a day because if you do it too much, it could do damage to your gums. Plus, he said I was brushing my teeth too hard. So I was pushing my gums back.\nMeg: Yeah. I actually had the exact same experience. Earlier this year, I went to the dentist because I felt like I maybe had some cavities because I had sensitivity in my teeth, and I was also brushing too hard because I was working, so I really want them to be so clean. And so my gums also were receding a little bit.\nTodd: Yeah, and so painful when it happens. You realize you have to reverse it, you know.\nMeg: Yeah. \nTodd: So what about the tongue scraper? Do you do little tongue scraper thing?\nMeg: I don’t have like a tongue scraper. I just kind of use my toothbrush and just brush it a little bit I guess. Do you use a tongue scraper?\nTodd: I have one. I use it sometimes.\nMeg: Well how does it work? What does it do?\nTodd: It’s just you’re raking leaves. You just put it in your mouth and you just scrape your tongue. And you do get some stuff that comes off of it and you’re like, “Oh wow.” But yeah.\nMeg: That sounds kind of gross actually.\nTodd: It is a little bit gross, yeah.\nMeg: But good for your mouth.\nTodd: Yes, definitely good. Definitely good. So then the other thing I guess we can talk about is a shaving now. So I’m the guy, so I have the facial hair.\nMeg: Right.\nTodd: But I’m pretty lucky. I only have to shave maybe twice a week. \nMeg: Oh really? \nTodd: I can get away with it, yeah.\nMeg: Yeah. \nTodd: Yeah. I don’t have the full on manly beard thing that comes out, so.\nMeg: Yeah, yeah. Some people have to shave like twice a day, so that seems like it would be inconvenient.\nTodd: Yeah. So do you – I guess because you’re a woman, do you have to do the legs thing?\nMeg: Yes, yes. I do shave my legs pretty much every time I take a shower.\nTodd: Really?\nMeg: Yeah.\nTodd: How annoying?\nMeg: Yeah. Well yeah, it is annoying. I actually really don’t like it. I wish I didn’t have to do it. And I mean, I guess I could choose to stop, but I’d rather do it. So yeah. \nTodd: Wow. \nMeg: Usually every time I take a shower because then if you’re wearing a skirt or shorts, it’s visible. So yeah, I’m just trying to be careful\nTodd: Wow. Honestly from a guy’s perspective, when I look and I think about women shaving basically their calves below their knees, it looks like it’d be very easy to cut yourself because your legs are kind of hard, do you know what I mean?\nMeg: Yeah. Yeah. I think for the calves, it’s not so bad because it’s kind of a straight – it’s more smooth, but the knee part, you have to be careful.\nTodd: Right, yeah.\nMeg: Because it’s like a shape, and the ankles and feet.\nTodd: Yeah. That’s like for guys our problem is right under the chin and then the Adam’s apple. The Adam’s apple is brutal because you kind of have to go around it, so it’s very easy to cut yourself.\nMeg: Yeah. Do you use an electric razor?\nTodd: No, I should. I’m very environmentally unfriendly. I use those plastic razors because they’re just so easy.\nMeg: Yeah.\nTodd: And actually, I kind of get away with it because of the gym I go to. They offer it. They have free razors in the men’s room. So I just do it there, save a few bucks.\nMeg: Yeah, might as well.\nTodd: Yeah, interesting. Well anyway, I guess we’re somewhat healthy.\nMeg: Yeah. We’re clean at least.\nTodd: Exactly.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Meg, I have an interesting question for you. \nMeg: Okay. \nTodd: So the other day I was talking with a friend and she asked me about, you know, showers like how many showers do I take a day. And I think I had mentioned I take three showers a day, that’s why that came up. And she thought that was absurd that nobody should take three showers a day.\nMeg: Yeah. It seems a little crazy to me.\nTodd: That’s odd. Like, you know, I thought that was kind of the norm actually these days.\nMeg: Really? \nTodd: Yeah, because you take a shower when you wake up. Then most people go to the gym. You take a shower when you’re done at the gym, which is usually mid-afternoon or early evening. And then I usually take a shower before I go to bed.\nMeg: I don’t think I have ever known anyone who’s taken three showers a day.\nTodd: Really?\nMeg: Do people that you know take three showers a day?\nTodd: I think I just assumed that all of my friends kind of did the same thing because they are guys and they also play sports. So they also take a shower – so yeah, when they wake up, before they go to bed and after they work out.\nMeg: Yeah. Well, I guess sports or working out definitely makes a difference. I might totally frighten you with the showers that I take because I do not shower three times a day. Typically, I shower once every two days.\nTodd: Really?\nMeg: Yeah, because especially with my skin, it gets pretty dried out if I’m showering so often with the soap and the water and everything. So I have to be careful with that. But if I’d played sports or something where I got sweaty, I’m definitely taking a shower after that, an extra shower. But yeah, I’ve never taken three showers in one day I don’t think.\nTodd: Well so you – even when it’s hot in summer, you just do it once every two days?\nMeg: If I get sweaty, then maybe more than that. But I don’t sweat very easily, so I usually don’t have to worry about it.\nTodd: Oh wow. No I think it must be what your skin gets conditioned to because one of the reasons why I always take a shower is not that I feel dirty. It’s like I feel like my skin gets itchy unless I take a shower.\nMeg: Yeah. Yeah. And it might be because – well and I think there’s a difference too with where I lived in America and living here in Japan like the humidity is different. And so my skin gets more dry here actually. It has the opposite effect. So I had to be more careful here maybe than I did in America.\nTodd: Yeah, that’s true. So what about – so washing your hair, you wash your hair every two days?\nMeg: Yes. I wash my hair every two days, use conditioner maybe once a week. My hair would also get super dried out. I don’t know if you can see it, but it’s a little frizzy right now. So that’s how naturally is my hair type, too. So maybe your hair type handles well getting showered, washed three times a day?\nTodd: Yeah. I mean, well for one, I wash my hair usually twice a day, sometimes just once. But always after I work out, I have to wash my hair. But one thing I never, ever do is use conditioner. And I don’t understand why people use conditioner on their hair.\nMeg: Well, short hair maybe you don’t have to worry about it as much.\nTodd: Okay.\nMeg: But with longer hair, and especially earlier this year, I had hair quite a bit longer than this even and the ends get dried out very easily. And they don’t replace like the hair oils because it’s coming from the roots. And so you have to add some extra moisture into the hair if you want it to stay looking decent. So yeah, probably more important to condition long hair than short hair.\nTodd: Okay. Yeah, because I’ve never understood why people use conditioner because when I use it, it just makes my hair seem waxy.\nMeg: Maybe you’re using too much conditioner or not washing it all out.\nTodd: Maybe. I don't know. I have to learn how to wash my hair. Okay, cool.",

        "transcript": "Abidemi: So Rory, in the last conversation we were talking about changing your personality and you never said what you thought of that.\nRory: Well, I think, I think when you learn a language often your personality does change. I notice with my students that they often seem quite different when they speak English to when they speak Japanese. I’m not sure if that’s a language thing or a cultural thing. But I mean you speak more than one language.\nAbidemi: Yes, I do.\nRory: Do you think your personality is different in each language?\nAbidemi: That’s a really good question. Just thinking of it right now, I think maybe for me it’s more a question of the culture because I think when I am in an environment where I’m expected to be more extroverted, I tend to try to live up to that.\nRory: Right.\nAbidemi: I tend to try to be more cheerful, more open, more friendly or friendlier, I should say. But when I’m somewhere where I know that it’s expected of me to be quieter, I do tend to become more quiet.\nRory: Right.\nAbidemi: So I don’t know. That’s a really good question.\nRory: And do you think there might be something in languages which make them like a more extroverted language or a more introverted language? Like I think about Italians – maybe it’s a stereotype of Italians, but they seem to be very extroverted and the language seems to help them in that extroversion.\nAbidemi: That’s true. That’s very true. That’s a good question because I’m just trying to think of culture and languages in general, and there’s that debate of how cultures and languages are intertwined. Is it the culture that came first or is it the language that made the culture the way it is. So I don’t know. I really don’t know. But I would love to read more research and find out.\nRory: Yeah. I mean, I noticed since I moved to Asia, to countries like Japan and Korea, the people do seem more introverted and the language also seems more introverted. So I wonder if the language or like you say, I wonder which came first, the language or the culture?\nAbidemi: And I think to add on to that, when I think of Asian students that I’ve noticed speaking English, which to some people is a more extroverted language, they always seem more confident. \nRory: Yeah. \nAbidemi: They seem friendlier. They seem more open to talking about themselves, their family life. But when you talk to them in their native language, it seems like they revert back to their cultural norms which would probably be less…\nRory: Right, yes.\nAbidemi: Yeah, so maybe there is something there.\nRory: Yeah. And I guess the culture over here in Asian countries is people are less likely to share information. There’s less – I mean, in the West especially recently, there’s quite a pressure on you to be more open.\nAbidemi: That’s true.\nRory: Whereas maybe in Korea, Japan and China, people are more closed and just have different boundaries.\nAbidemi: I’m just trying to think of African countries, like being a Nigerian myself, we’ve had the issue of colonization and where the Western British culture is valorized. So coming from that aspect, I wonder before how we were. Were we more introverted? Because in a lot of ways we’re very similar to Asian cultures and Asian values. We have a lot of that as well.\nBut now it’s true that being able to speak English and express yourself in a more Western way is a lot. It weighs a lot. It means a lot, so people really enjoy that. People really take their value from that. So yeah, I think it’s a really interesting topic.\nRory: Because I mean people often see England or British people as a bit introverted and a bit quiet, a bit cold and yet we share the same language as America. And people tend to think that people from North America are quiet brash and extroverted.\nAbidemi: That’s true.\nRory: So like I said it’s more cultural than language-based.\nAbidemi: Yeah, maybe. Maybe we’ve come to a solution then. We’ve found it. It is the culture more than the language then.",

Like as I get older, I much prefer my own company.\nAbidemi: Interesting.\nRory: I don’t really like going to parties that much if there’s going to be new people there. If it’s my friends, I’m happy to go out, but I don’t know. What about you?\nAbidemi: It’s funny what you said. I feel the same way. I think sometimes I’m an introvert and other times I can be an extrovert. But maybe in reverse to what you said. I feel like the older I get, the more extroverted I become.\nRory: That’s interesting.\nAbidemi: While I was younger, I was a lot shier, so I preferred my own company. But now I find that sometimes too, I really enjoy people. So I like to meet new ones. So yeah.\nRory: Yes. In the classroom, as a teacher, I’m quite an extrovert I think. I quite like being up in front of students and showing of, but I would never do that in front of other teachers or my friends, in my personal life.\nAbidemi: Interesting.\nRory: But something about the classroom maybe because it’s my environment and I’m in control that I feel more comfortable, like being more extroverted and showing off, camping up.\nAbidemi: I think it would be a little difficult to be introverted if you were a language teacher. I think it certainly helps to be extroverted or to act to be able to become more extroverted when you’re in the classroom for sure. For sure. \nRory: Yeah. And have you ever done anything really extroverted, like performed in public?\nAbidemi: Before I used to sing actually, and I have sang in concerts.\nRory: Right.\nAbidemi: And it’s true. I think that’s where my introverted self really comes out because although I enjoy singing and I like the attention to a certain extent, but I get really nervous. Really, really nervous when I’m in front of a large crowd. And sometimes I’m like, “Why am I doing this to myself? Why am I here?” \nRory: Yeah.\nAbidemi: But yeah, I don’t do that so much anymore.\nRory: Right. And do you think people can change? Do you think people – because people seem to want to become more extroverted? It seems to be like society says extroverted people are successful people.\nAbidemi: It’s true.\nRory: Do you think people can change or do you think people should try to change?\nAbidemi: I’ve heard of actually people saying that depending on the language that people change with the language. I’ve heard of some of my students saying that when they speak in a different language, their personality actually changes, where maybe in their own language, they may be quieter. But when they speak the different language, they become a lot more extroverted. \nRory: Right.\nAbidemi: It’s as if they change. So whether or not it’s a real change I think you can “fake it” quote-unquote even if you’re not an extrovert or an introvert. Maybe for a few hours or for the occasion. Yeah, you can pretend, and then go back.\nRory: Right. I wonder if when we speak a different language, we don’t have the same connections with the words.\nAbidemi: That’s true.\nRory: It makes it easier to maybe speak more honestly and not worry about what other people think of us.\nAbidemi: That’s true.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Marianne, we're talking about education. And things are changing. Society is changing as it always is. But these days, you can pretty much learn anything on your own. And there is a new debate going around that colleges no longer serve the purpose that it used to. That basically, you can just learn what you want to learn without going to college. What do you think about that?\nMarianne: Yes, that's a very good question. I really love this possibility of having access to knowledge just by yourself without having to attend a college for example. It's a great chance for everyone to have access to this knowledge. So I can think it's a good thing. \nBut I don't know why. I'm kind of skeptical because I think at some point, you have to have a time where you can exchange with a teacher or at least with other people who have the same knowledge as you. Because if you never, if you don't have this time and space where you can debate about what you learned, then there is no increase of the level of thinking. Like because you need to debate about things to learn more or maybe to correct things.\nIt's like the Wikipedia, right. Like it's a contributive dictionary or – encyclopedia. But everybody is writing in this page. And sometimes you see some updates but you don't know why, for example, someone made the change because you don't have the space where you can debate about is this wrong or correct about like the information that was uploaded was or correct. And if you just see the correction but you couldn't debate about this, then you cannot understand. \nSo I think for me, having a time and a space where you can debate is very important. And this is a place and the time that college can offer, for example, debate between teachers or debate between students about some topics. \nTodd: Wow! Those are really good points. Yeah, I agree. You know, I've taught at university for a while. And I do see some of the points of being a self-learner and just basically getting what you want – getting the information you want online. \nBut the problem is, when you go to university, you have that void or the vacuum really. And so, you're going to fill that with all these different types of information. And you might see things that you aren't – that you didn't even know that you liked. And also, there's that social element that's really strong in college. I don't think you're going to find that anywhere else where you, you know, make friends, you make relationships that last your whole life. \nSo I'm still a big believer of college but I can see that maybe we need to change the model to make them little bit better. \nMarianne: Uh-hmm.\nTodd: Which brings us to another question: how do you think we can change college to make better? Like what are some changes we can make to college?\nMarianne: Wow. \nTodd: Like I have one idea. One idea I have is that we're starting to see it a little bit with MOOCs but there's no reason that you can't take a class at any other university via video from your university. So example, if you go to UCLA, you can take art classes from Harvard or somewhere else. I think that would be really good if you can start doing that. So you're not only limited to the professors on your campus. \nMarianne: Wow. Yes, that's a great idea. Yes. \nTodd: Anything that you, looking back, you wish you could have done differently at university?\nMarianne: Well the big issue about university especially in the US is that it costs a lot of money. And so, if we could find ways to – because for example, you are talking about having access to a lot of content information for free actually – I mean, for free. Like you just have to pay your Internet connection and suddenly, you have access to a lot of knowledge. \nBut when you go to college, it costs a lot of money. So this is a big issue actually. So if you could find a way to, financially speaking, like if we can find a way to make university more accessible to a wider audience, it could be nice. But I know it's difficult because we have to pay teachers. We have to pay all the infrastructures about university, so it costs a lot of money. \nSo I don't have the solution right now but I think working on this like free education or cheaper education – I mean, cheaper in a way talking about the entrance fee, not losing the quality of education. Yeah. If we can work on this point. \nTodd: Yeah. I totally agree.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Marianne, we're going to talk about education, and we're going to talk about the qualities of a good and bad teacher. And I'm a teacher so this is important for me, so I'm going to be taking notes.\nWhat do you think makes a good teacher?\nMarianne: I have no idea. No, I'm kidding. Okay, so I have to remember like when I was in junior high school or high school for example, my good teachers, how were they. I think a good teacher has to be strict. Insisting sometimes because you can be lazy, or as a student it could be difficult to understand what the teacher is talking about. So the teacher really have to insist on very important things. \nAnd yes, the teacher has to be strict. But at the same time, the teacher-student relationship should be kind of equal or respectful. So the teach is not – of course, he is or she is superior because he has or she has knowledge. But it could be nice if the teacher can interact with the student. So if the student is able to give his opinion or her opinion about the subject the teacher is talking about, I think it's nice. Because I think the teacher, his responsibility or her responsibility is to raise critical thinking of the student. \nSo it's very important this time of interaction of exchange between teachers and students. So yes, it could be my definition like the teacher being strict but at the same time being open to talk about subjects. \nTodd: All right. Those are some good points. But going back to being strict, can you be specific? Do you mean like making sure they do their home work.\nMarianne: Yes.\nTodd: Making sure they're on time to class. \nMarianne: Yes. And punish them if they are late for example, like…\nTodd: Oh, punishment. Okay. \nMarianne: I mean, like say something like, you know, like you have an appointment. It's very important. For example, you have English class at 2:00 so be here at 2:00 and not 2:05. So it's very important because you have to show respect for the person who would deliver you content about English. And it's very important because it helps you in your life to – even for yourself, for the student, it's not only to show respect to teacher but it's also for the student to – for him or her to be able to keep her schedule. It's very important in life because otherwise you can spend your life being always late and not doing things on time. \nBut if you are always behaving this way, then you can never build anything in life. So you have to have also for yourself some strict attitude or strict capacity or I don't know how to say. \nTodd: No, that's perfect. Sounds good. How about some bad things? Have you had some bad teachers in the past? \nMarianne: Yes. Like for example, a teacher who are just strict and that's it, like there is no communication possible with them. It's terrible. For example, I remember when I was in junior high school, I had an art teacher actually, she was our art teacher and nobody liked her. She was just terrible like a very strict woman and very angry every time we went to attend her class. \nAnd I remembered I was really terrified by her. And for me, she didn't teach me anything. So this kind of strict attitude was not really helpful for me. \nTodd: Yeah. I like that. So strict but not too strict. \nMarianne: Yeah. Strict, it means in the sense that making the other responsible. Like an adult has to show teenagers that they will become future responsible adults, too. So they are not just like kids and you just don't say to your kids for example, \"Don't eat this,\" and that's it. If you can just say to your children, \"Don't eat this because you can be sick if you eat too much of this.\" Like you have to give them a reason or you have to make them responsible. They have to understand actually. \nTodd: No, I totally agree. Very, very good points.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Hey, Marianne. So we're talking about love and relationships in the modern era. So the question is do you think social media changes how people date? \nMarianne: Yes, definitely. In the sense that, well, social media are actually changing the way we interact with each other. Not only talking about love but just even with your friends or colleagues. It just changes the way of how – or the way how people interact with each other. \nSo for example, we have – I would say – well it's a difficult question because social media can help you to connect with people you would have – with who you wouldn't have any connection. But in the other hand, it can also kind of isolate you. Like because – well, if you use social media like you don't have the human interaction. You are just facing you with your screen and you are just alone with your social media. You do not encounter someone for real. \nSo I would say, sometimes it cannot help you to connect with other people, so to have a social life. It's a product but I think it could work this way unfortunately. So you really have to be the own master on your social – you have to have the power on your social media to pass this line. Social media should not prevent you from having a social life. It should help you to socialize in a different way maybe. But don't be like isolated or don't just close yourself because it's very easy to lose it.\nIt's just like social media reflects your – it's like a mirror. It just reflects you. So for example, if you try to look for a partner or if you play with your social – not social identity but there is a way to say this like a computer or Internet identity. Now there is a new identity. \nSo many – of course, like you play with this image. Like you upload photos you have chosen to upload. You upload content you have chosen to upload. So you show a different face on the social media. So it's not really who you are. So it completely changed the way you interact with others because if you think that yourself you are like lying in a way or inventing this new face, then also other people invent new faces. So I think it changed completely the relationship you have with others. \nTodd: Yeah. That's so true. I agree with you. One thing I think that's kind of weird is for example, you become friends with somebody and you know that they're married. And then you'll follow them over, let's say, four or five years but you don't have contact with them everyday. And then I'll notice that person never mentions their spouse on their social media profile. Never. \nAnd it makes you wonder sometimes, are they still together because you never see photos of the person. You only see photos of the individual. And me personally, I think that's kind of strange. What do you feel about that? Do you feel like if you're in a relationship, your social media account can be just you and only you? Or should it include your…\nMarianne: That's a good question. Yes. \nTodd: Your other person. \nMarianne: Yes. That's a very good question actually. Yes, because for example – your partner for example, he or she, like you are not allowed sometimes to upload photo of him or her. So how do you, yes, how do you decide like what kind of content. And it's the same question for your children for example. Many people upload photo of their babies, newborn babies. So it's very cute but nobody asks them are they okay with like having their photos on your social media? So yes, it's a good question. \nIn my case, well I use social media only for my work purpose, my job, or I just upload some events. So it's very like – it's more a platform where I exchange some information. And I don't talk too much about my private life. So I avoid this question about like uploading some content that concern my family or my partners or my children if I have some, so. \nTodd: Yeah. I guess, it's a tricky issue really, isn't it?\nMarianne: Yes.\nTodd: Anyway, thanks, Marianne.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Hello, Marianne. I thought we would talk about love and relationships today. \nMarianne: Okay. \nTodd: If you don't mind. \nMarianne: That's fine. \nTodd: And we would ask you about marriage in your country of France. And is it changing? Like are fewer people getting married? Are they getting married younger or later? Like how is marriage changing in France?\nMarianne: Well, marriage, it's kind of like very, like it's a traditional idea. Actually, it's a very conservative idea or very – it became like a conservative concept. \nSo actually nowadays, I would say that French people do not really care about getting married. They care more about like having a stable relationship or having a real love relationship. Because I would say like for example, for my grandfather and grandmother's generation, marriage was very, like, it was very important for the stability of the family and for the stability of – even for yourself. Like even for when you were a woman at this time, you have to rely on a husband to live because women were not independent. They couldn't work or they had difficult access to work. \nSo marriage was very important to have this possible life and having someone who can support you. But nowadays, because things are changing between men and women, they tend to be equal, so they tend to have the same rights. So marriage became less important to get some stability in your life. But the most important nowadays is to find someone that you can really rely on and someone that you really love to have a family. \nSo people get married like when they are older. So they really enjoy like being young and enjoy, like, having different partners for example and then decide who is the best one, best partner. And then when they are older, when they are sure, they can get married and have a family. But it's not the first priority. People are more independent; women and men nowadays in France. \nSo marriage is like kind of just like people put back – put the marriage back, it's not the first priority. The main priority is really about love, about finding happiness in your life if you find someone you love. \nTodd: Okay. Well, I think in the States it's very similar. But how do they feel about children? And also, how do they feel about, let's say, being with someone for their entire life? Like you find your soul-mate and then that's it.\nMarianne: Well, it's a very romantic idea. So I think it's – it doesn't have to do with marriage. Like it depends on your personality I would say because if you believe in this idea of the perfect soul-mate and someone you can live with forever, it's more like romantic. So I would say, nowadays, like still French people believe in everlasting or never-ending love. But it's not necessarily through marriage that you accomplish this.\nTodd: Okay. And what about children?\nMarianne: What do you – so what's your question about children?\nTodd: So you were saying that marriage isn't as important to people. Are they willing to have children out of wedlock? Or like do people feel like you have to be married to have children or they just…?\nMarianne: No, no. No, no. You have to love each other. You really have to love each other to have children. Like it doesn't matter so much if you are married or not, it's just a question of paper usually. For example, if the child should have the name of the father or the mother when you are not married, it could be this kind of issue. But like people can have children and then get married. \nLike for example, my friends – I have many friends around me who are just getting married now but they have already children like two or three children. So it's not, yeah, the question of having children or getting married before – we don't need – the order does not really matter nowadays. You have to marry the other if the other is really your ideal partner. But it does not matter if you have children before or after. \nTodd: That makes a lot of sense. I think it's the same in a lot of countries these days.",

        "transcript": "Adam: Hi Sarah. \nSarah: Hi. \nAdam: Today we’re talking about bucket list. Things you want to do before you die. Do you have anything? \nSarah: Actually, no. I don’t have a bucket list. And the reason why is because I’ve already done or I’m currently doing the things that I want to do. In addition, I like to live in the now, so like the present, like what’s happening. So I really don’t think of the distant future very much, just like what’s in front of me. \nFor example, I’m going to Singapore soon, in about 10 days. And I’m really looking forward to that and the new adventure and things that I’ll get to do there. \nAdam: What sort of things do you have in mind to explore in Singapore? \nSarah: First of all, swing dancing. My favorite kind of dance currently is Lindy hop swing dancing. And Singapore is one of the places in Asia that has several swing dance meet-up groups. So I look forward to dancing several of the nights while I’m there, but also trying all of the delicious food and just exploring a country that I’ve never been to.\nAdam: Wow, great. What are some of the things that you have wanted to do in the past that you have accomplished already?\nSarah: I think living in foreign countries. I’ve already lived in two foreign countries and I plan on living in foreign countries probably the rest of my life. So that’s a big one. And I think just everyday things, like finishing college and getting two master’s degrees and being able to support myself. It’s all things that are important to me. \nAdam: Yeah. Those are really great things. What are your two degrees in? \nSarah: My first degree is in teaching English to speakers of other languages. This degree allows me to be able to live in other countries and to teach English. And then my other degree is in global studies. So it’s like an inter-cultural degree where I learned about different cultures and religions. \nAdam: That’s really great. Have you ever eaten anything exotic or had any really interesting experiences that most people might not have had when you’re traveling to these different places and fulfilling your goals? \nSarah: I’ve definitely eaten a lot of different things, most of which I’m not really sure what a lot of it was. The strangest probably – jellyfish, maybe. I’d also gotten a chance to ride a lot of different animals. I’ve ridden a camel, donkey, horse, elephant, and even an ostrich. So that’s pretty exciting. \nAdam: Yeah. That’s really interesting. Have you done any other extreme activities? \nSarah: Yeah. I’ve been skydiving before. I’ve been volcano boarding. I’m trying to think what else I have done. I haven’t been bungee jumping. I think that’s probably one of the only ones that I haven’t done as of right now. But I really have no desire to do that one, so. \nAdam: Wow. That’s great. You’ve lived a good life.",

        "transcript": "Sarah: So Adam, we're talking about bucket lists, so things that you would like to do before you die. So what's your number one thing on your bucket list? \nAdam: Oh, difficult question. Number one, I'd probably have to say, oh, skydiving maybe. I’ve wanted to do it for a long time. And I went bungee jumping in New Zealand. That was fun but I still have not yet been sky-diving. And jumping out of the plane just sounds like an awesome idea to me. \nSarah: What other kind of adventure sports have you done? \nAdam: This summer, I was – what did I do? Sand boarding in Peru. That was fun. When I was younger I did a lot of snowboarding and skateboarding. And yeah, I really enjoy extreme sports. I ride a motorcycle currently. If I could I'd love to race cars professionally, although I don't know how good I'd be at it. But it just looks like so much fun. \nSarah: Yeah. Well, it’s never too late to start something you want to do, so you should add that to your bucket list. So tell me what else is on your bucket list? \nAdam: I really want to write a book. Be the author of a novel. I'm always in the process of writing something down but it never seems to come to complete book type end result. But maybe eventually, all of these little things that I have written down will come into a book form and I can publish it and complete my goal. \nSarah: What kind of things do you write? Like what kind of genre or is that kind of all the same or do you write many different styles? \nAdam: I wrote a lot of different things. One thing that I write is travel stories from my travels abroad or anecdotes that I come across when I'm traveling. Recently, I've been writing jokes. I really enjoy watching stand-up comedy and have got kind of inspired from them to write some stuff down, although I've never really presented it. \nAnd I also write, I guess, fantasy stories as well. I have a few short stories but it's been difficult for me to try to put them into book, like a longer version of them. The details are tricky to write down. \nSarah: Wow! That's really interesting. Hopefully, one day, we'll be able to read a book written by you. \nAdam: Yeah. That'd be great. \nSarah: Yeah. So tell me what else is on your list? \nAdam: The other things would be traveling to Europe, which I plan to do hopefully next summer, so I can cross that one off the list. I've always wanted to go to Europe especially Italy and Spain. So I'm excited to get that one done. \nAnd I'd also really like to go to Africa and go on a safari and see, you know, lions, tigers in the wild, in their natural habitat. I've also heard that you could see sharks, Great White sharks in South Africa on the coast. I had some friends that went and sat in a cage in the water and had Great White swim by. That sounds like a terrifying and once-in-a-lifetime experience. I'm terrified of sharks but it would be quite amazing to see. \nSarah: Yeah. I am terrified of sharks as well, so I probably will not be adding that to my bucket list. But yeah, I hope you get to do everything that's on your list there. \nAdam: Thanks. Me too!",

        "transcript": "Spencer: Yeah. So Curtis, what would your dream house be like? Tell me about the kitchen, living room, yard. \nCurtis: Well, I've thought a lot about my dream house and designing it. Actually, that's the kind of work that my father does, so he said he could draw the plans up for me. But I've done a lot of art and I really want to work my art into the house. \nSo the living room, I would like there to be kind of a frieze around the outside of the room where I actually do the art myself. Now, I used to do a lot of construction when I was younger, and so I would really like to take part in the process so that I have a kind of sense of ownership with the house that I've really built a part of that. \nThe kitchen, I want it to be a very large space and next to a room that has a lot of media so that you can kind of pay attention to things or watch tutorials and recipes while you're cooking, follow along with your favorite chefs or cooking channels. I'd like a really big industrial refrigerator and a huge island that I can work with, as well as a massive sink for cleaning things. \nI used to work at a restaurant and I loved the dishwasher there because it was so quick and easy. So I would like a restaurant-style dishwasher in my kitchen, too. \nSpencer: Yeah. So tell me about – what would your yard be like? \nCurtis: I would like a lot of grass. I really love a yard with nice grass especially when you're playing soccer, you can get under the ball and have a lot of fun like that. \nSpencer: It's nice to have a big backyard to play sports. \nCurtis: Yeah. I think so as well. \nSpencer: What about your bathroom? \nCurtis: My bathroom. Well, I would like to have a kind of a spa in there, honestly. I would like to have a big bathtub. But I want my house to have geothermal heating. And if I have a geothermal heating system, I can also probably have a hot spring in the bathroom. \nI like it to be quite big and have a nice shower as well. Just very nice open area with nice sinks. I don't want to feel constrained in my bathroom. I don't want it to be small. It has to be big. \nSpencer: What about your living room? \nCurtis: My living room. One of the things that was really important to me for my living room again, is the art that I want to have a lot of details around the outside that are murals or friezes that I have actually created on the wall and so that there's almost a kind of entertaining sense about it. Just being in there before you turn on any other devices or televisions or anything like that. That there is kind of a artistic and comfortable feel to it. It doesn't feel sterile, it feels very homey. \nSpencer: Cool. Would you have a big garage? \nCurtis: I probably would have a big garage because I really love driving, and I used to race cars at the track. And for the purposes of doing work on cars, or any other DIY work around the house, I would like to have a really big nice garage. \nSpencer: Would you have any sort of like swimming pool or – I know you said you wanted a sauna in your bathroom but…\nCurtis: I would really like a portion that's maybe separate from the bathroom, that has shutters that open up. So on a nice night, you can actually open it and see out over the yard or whatever landscapes that the house is built next to.\nSpencer: That would be cool. \nCurtis: But I would like the area to be a little bit private, hopefully surrounded by woods a little bit where you can't see your neighbors immediately. \nSpencer: Yeah, exactly.",

        "transcript": "Curtis: All right. So Spencer if you could design your dream home, what would it be like? \nSpencer: I know exactly what it would be like. It would be all wood, old-style beach house on the ocean and on the sand. So it would have ocean front porches all the way around. The biggest thing is the porches because I don't really care about having, you know, massive extra rooms for guests or whatever like I want to be able to be outside. Like being outside is big for me. \nI love screened-in porches as well. So that and a library. I'm a huge kind of book nerd, so I would love to have just a library with lots of different shelves and, you know, a couple of desks for studying. That's the dream home for me. What about you? \nCurtis: Actually, I'm wondering about the outside. Would you paint the house or would you just leave it the natural wood color? \nSpencer: I want a natural color. There's an island south that's all kind of pastel Easter egg looking colors and it's too much for me. Also too like all the beach houses in LA, they're all kind of too tacky for me. Like I don't know. I like kind of the old look kind of traditional style. \nCurtis: Do you think you would use natural wood on it or a different material? I know that the beaches are really tough on the siding and paneling. \nSpencer: That is true. \nCurtis: Okay. What would th e kitchen be like in your dream house? \nSpencer: I'm not much of a cook but I hope that my future husband is. So I would like to have a big kitchen for him. Lots of table space. I want one of those islands, you know, in the center of a kitchen where there's a marble countertop that has, you know, a couple of sinks and the ability to kind of put multiple different parts of vegetables or fruits out and about while you're cooking and preparing. \nYeah. I'd also like kind of a bar counter space as well so that people kind of pull up a chair and maybe help cook or maybe just be there for company while you're cooking. \nCurtis: And how about your living room, do you have any ideas for that? \nSpencer: Living room mainly just comfort. My parents had a living room in their house but it was all just really nice antique furniture and we were never allowed to go there. So it's kind of like what's the point of having a room in a house that you never go into?\nSo I would like a living room, yes, maybe with a fireplace and some antique furniture but nothing too nice that, you know, my child or my dog were to come in from outside could really like mess up. \nCurtis: And how about your yard, do you have any ideas for a yard around your house?\nSpencer: I want a lot of dogs. So I would like a big yard that they could be able to run around in, as well as if I have children, like have enough room for them to be able to, you know, slip and slide. So, you know, one of my best friends back home she had a yard that had a creek in it. And that was so much fun like growing up being able to like catch different, you know, creepy-crawlies in the stream as well as have a messy or muddy day if we wanted to. \nCurtis: And how about the bathroom? \nSpencer: I want a massive bathroom actually. You know, my favorite shower in the world has like five or six different faucets and it's just massive. That gives you space. I'm kind of a clumsy person, so if I fall down I don't want to be able to, you know – I don't want to hit my head on anything. \nI also like a big Jacuzzi bathtub. My grandparents have this really, really, big old porcelain tub that I swear like five people could fit into. So I'd really like to be able to have a big bathtub. \nCurtis: Okay. Thank you.",

        "name": "The Medic",
        "transcript": "Todd: So Meg, you are talking about being in the military, and you said you were a medic. Can you explain what that is? \nMeg: Yeah. So a medic, which now I believe is called health care specialist, is – I always say it's kind of similar to being like a paramedic where it's not a full nurse job. I think nurses have more training like in civilian side nurses, but similar to paramedic where you have certain, like, minor procedures that you're trained to do and high-level things than just an EMT like doing IVs and giving shots and stitches and things like that. \nAnd you're trained – because it's the military, you're especially trained for emergency situations, and how to treat someone who has maybe some serious life-threatening wounds. So that's a medic. \nTodd: Wow. That sounds like a really difficult job. I mean, it's not your typical, just soldier job. You must have had a lot of schooling and education. \nMeg: I had – well, everyone goes through the initial, about two and a half months like basic training. And that's more kind of basic combat skills and physical training that kind of thing. And then I had four months past that to train to be a medic. So we went through like emergency medical technician course just like civilian side. I got certified with that. And then we had additional training for the military skills like IVs and emergency procedures, that kind of thing. \nTodd: Right. Can you explain what IV is? \nMeg: IV is an intravenous – like getting fluids into your body. So if you've been injured and you've lost a lot of blood or maybe you're dehydrated and you need some fluid in your body quickly, then we stick a needle into your vein and then the fluids go in. And the needle comes back out but a little tube stays in. And then you can get fluids quickly that way. \nTodd: So anybody that's been to the doctor knows that's always kind of the anxious moment when the nurse or the person who's going to stick the needle in. Were you good at doing that? \nMeg: So once I learned how to do it, I think I was pretty good. And I actually enjoyed doing it, not in a creepy way but, you know, it was – I guess, because I was decent at it that it was a part of my job that I enjoyed. \nBut for myself, before we went through that training, I actually became dehydrated and needed to get an IV myself. And I was terrified because I really hadn't had that before in my life. And so, the nurse was going to come, you know, put the needle in my arm and I was like, \"No, isn't there another? I'll just drink a lot of water.\" And she was saying, \"Aren't you going to be a medic.\" And I was like, \"Oh, I haven't trained yet. Don't do it.\" So yeah. \nTodd: Oh, that's cool. Yeah. I was recently in the hospital and they had me strapped up for both blood and for the water, the intravenous drip. And it's annoying because you can't really move, like if you want to get up and walk anywhere, you're strapped with all these tubes. And it's not very convenient. \nMeg: Yeah, yeah. Or at least you have to careful. When I was getting the IV, I didn't know that the needle doesn't stay in your arm. Now, for some things, it does. For blood, maybe it's different, I'm not sure. But yeah, so I was trying to be so careful too but you still want it to go well so you don't want to move very much. \nTodd: Right. So what percentage of people would you say freak out when they get the needle? \nMeg: Probably 90% or 95%. \nTodd: Oh really? \nMeg: Yeah. Even, you know, tough Army guys would come in and be – and they'd be like, \"Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine in a bit.\" \"Well, we need to give you an IV.\" And they'd be like, \"Oh…\"\nTodd: Right. Yeah. Nobody likes that. \nMeg: No. \nTodd: So you transitioned. You were in the medical profession and then you moved to education. Why did you leave the medical profession for education? \nMeg: Yeah. That's interesting because I became a medic in the military because I thought after I – when I could continue college that I would be a nurse or a doctor. But my time serving as a medic helped me learn that that was not what I wanted to do for my career after all. \nSo I definitely am glad that I had those skills and the things that I learned and was able to experience. But I had – English had kind of been on the back burner. And so then I said, \"Okay, let me revisit this,\" and it led to English education. \nTodd: Wow. Have you ever thought about being like an English specialist for people in the medical fields like teaching doctors and nurses? \nMeg: I guess I haven't thought about that specifically. Sometimes I thought about going back to military. They do have something like English schools in the military. And so, I guess that would be related. Also it could be – yeah, so that would be interesting. Something to think about.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Meg, I thought we would talk a little bit about the military. Now, you were actually in the military. \nMeg: Yes. I was actually in the Army National Guard. So I enlisted when I was 17. In America, in the National Guard, each state can have kind of different rules, or different requirements. And so, in Indiana, you can enlist when you are 17 with parental permission. So I did that. \nTodd: Wow. Seventeen is really young age. \nMeg: Yeah. And it sort of happened really quick. I mean, I was a junior in high school and I got a call from a recruiter. And at first, I was really against it but then in Indiana, if you enlist and you serve your time, they'll pay your college tuition if you go to a state college. \nSo Indiana has Purdue, and I was interested in going to Purdue anyway, so it seemed like a good idea. \nTodd: That's fantastic. So how long were you in the service? \nMeg: I was in for six years all together. That was the minimum commitment. So I could have done more but I was ready to, maybe try some other things after that time. \nTodd: Did it go by fast? \nMeg: Looking back, it definitely did. I think, there are different stages that went by slow or fast. Like when I was in actual basic training, when you're in it, it was super slow. Like you're counting on the hours every day because you're just desperate to finish and get out and get back to your family. And I was, you know, 17, so it's a little different. \nBut now looking back, like, I can't believe it was a full six years, and now it's so many years past that already. So yeah, I guess, it did go by fast overall. \nTodd: Yeah, that's great. So what was it like being a woman in the military? \nMeg: It was – well, I served in a unit – I was a medic. And so, my unit, a medical unit, naturally has more women. The ratio is closer to 50-50 men and women, which isn't – at least that time wasn't – I don't have the current statistics, but it isn't that kind of ratio for the Army as a whole or the military as a whole. \nAnd so, for me there was – I was with a lot of other women also when I was serving. But for me personally, there were definitely challenges especially when I was first in basic training like I definitely felt personal pressure to try to keep up with the guys. With everything whether it's, you know, physically being able to lift and carry these heavy boxes and whatever. You know, you have the same requirements that you have to do. And you never want to be the weak link. \nAnd I think some other women, maybe suffered a little more because they couldn't keep up quite as well. And so that can be a little difficult. But maybe I'm naturally a bit more suited for those kinds of things. So I did okay but I definitely wanted to and tried hard to keep up with the physical aspect which isn't as easy sometimes for women. \nTodd: Well, that's interesting. So you do look pretty fit, so you must have been really fit back in the day. \nMeg: Yeah, I think. Yeah, especially basic training because you're never like not running. Anytime you're walking somewhere, you're just running, running, running, like they make you run everywhere. And you get like 5 minutes to eat breakfast and lunch, and dinner. Every time, you have to eat it so fast. And then you're doing all this physical training, and then going through obstacle courses, and carrying heavy packs and carrying your weapon round.\nYeah. So that was probably the most fit I've ever been. I'm definitely not that now. \nTodd: Right. So if you had a daughter, would you recommend that she goes in the military, or would you recommend other women to join the military?\nMeg: I would not recommend it. I guess, I don't go around telling everyone, \"Oh, you should just join the military.\" But I think if someone – if there is a woman who is interested in it or thinking about it, I would definitely – for me, I mean, it worked out great. There are a lot of like leadership and personal character qualities that I was really able to develop during my time that have continued to benefit me now.\nAnd so, for a woman who is interested, I would definitely say, \"Go for it.\"\nTodd: Awesome. Thanks. Thanks, Meg. \nMeg: Yeah.",

Do you know of any other things you can do in New York? \nAntoinette: Oh, absolutely. There are a lot of events for a sports enthusiast in New York. We’ve got basketball. The Knicks play. They’re an NBA team. We’ve got baseball. The Yankees and the Mets play, and there’s a feud. Yankees fans hate Mets fans and Mets fans hate Yankees fans. \nWarren: Right. They have two baseball teams. \nAntoinette: That’s right. \nWarren: Wow. \nAntoinette: Exciting. We even have a Subway Series. Well, it used to be a Subway Series because the teams would play different stadiums for about a week or so and the fans would just switch back and forth from one stadium to the other. But I think they recently built one stadium for both teams. \nWarren: Oh. Do you think one team is more popular than the other? \nAntoinette: I think probably the Yankees, unfortunately. \nWarren: The Yankees. \nAntoinette: Yeah. My family was a Mets fan and don’t tell anyone else in my family that I said that. \nWarren: Oh, so I guess, they don’t get along with each other?\nAntoinette: Oh, not at all. \nWarren: Oh well. Well, I’m from Canada. I really like hockey. I know that you guys have the Rangers. \nAntoinette: Yeah. We do have the Rangers. They play at Madison Square Garden, so you could easily find, like, buy tickets to see a game there. That’s the same place where the Knicks play. \nWarren: Oh, they both play at the same place? \nAntoinette: Yes, they do. \nWarren: Maybe, I could go to a basketball and a hockey game. \nAntoinette: You probably could if you stayed long enough. I think they have different seasons, right? \nWarren: Oh, do they? \nAntoinette: Yeah. Madison Square Garden is pretty big though, so maybe there’s more than one arena. I’m not sure. I’ve only been there two or three times in my life. \nWarren: Oh, okay. \nAntoinette: Well, we also have the US Open, if you like tennis. \nWarren: Right. \nAntoinette: Yeah. That’s held in Queens, not on Manhattan. \nWarren: Oh, okay. What about the US Tennis Open but there’s also the US Gold Open. Is that in New York as well? \nAntoinette: In New York? I don’t think the – is it? \nWarren: I’m not sure. \nAntoinette: I don’t think that the US Open for golf is in New York. I think – no, I don’t think that’s New York. Yeah. No. \nWarren: Okay. Have you seen tennis before? \nAntoinette: Yes, I have. I saw Serena Williams play. \nWarren: Oh, she’s great. \nAntoinette: She is. Yeah. Powerful woman. \nWarren: Yeah.

Like we have many foreigners and illegal foreigners actually. They come in with boats during the night, they’re landing, and we cannot control, we cannot stop them because Italy is in the middle of Europe. So from Northern Africa, for many like – I wouldn’t say underdeveloped countries but the countries that see Italy like the…\nWin: Dream.\nGoron: America or like dream, like opportunities, which is changing right with the recent crisis. \nMichael: It’s actually very interesting because we have the same problem in Norway. \nWin: I’m seeing the same problem everywhere. \nMichael: Because of the European economic agreement, it’s actually illegal to come and try to find work. But the problem is that people abused us and they come – they are just to, you know – beg for money or to steal money or steal things from others. And it’s really easy to pass the border without being controlled. \nGoron: I don’t think those people are bad. It’s like poverty makes you bad. \nMichael: No, I’m not saying they’re bad. \nWin: Yeah. \nGoron: If you are desperate, you feel desperate, you do something that is, like we say, illegal. \nMichael: And that’s a huge problem because in the EU right now, there’s several countries which have poverty, and it evolves from that, I think. It’s really hard like to create, to make everyone happy and to – I don’t think it’s possible to solve the poverty matter. \n                                So what about Vietnam? \nWin: Well, the city I’m living in is very – there is no really people who was born in the city. I mean, I was born in the city but I have roots from everywhere. And most of the people from the city is like that. We They’re from everywhere from the country and the city welcomes them no matter what. \nSo yes, we do have a problem that people keep flocking to my city to find jobs, and we have crimes and everything. But I think the fact that we have multi-origin people is one of the facts that makes the city interesting.",

        "transcript": "Win\nMichael\nGoron\n\n\n\n\nPaul: Goron: Hello, my name is Goron. I’m from Italy. \nWin: My name is Win. I’m from Vietnam. \nMichael: My name is Michael. I’m from Norway. \nGoron: So today, we’re going to discuss about mega cities. So do you have mega cities in your countries? \nWin: Well, Vietnam is still a developing country, but we have several big city. The city I’m from, Ho Chi Minh City is – I think it’s the biggest city in Vietnam. And we have people flocking from the countryside to the city every year. And the population keeps growing but infrastructure is not capable of keeping up with the population, so we kind of have some problem right there. \nMichael: No. Norway does not have any mega city. But even so, we have problems with infrastructure. We have a huge car queues but they’re actually right now, they are doing everything they can to develop that infrastructure. And most of our capital, Oslo, is actually planned – well, it plans for the roads to all be sub-terrestrial. \nGoron: Okay. In Italy, the biggest city is Rome. It’s a really ancient city, as you know. And so for this reason, it was built for horses, for a really small amount of people, not five million as, I think, we have today. \nSo the biggest problem in Rome is the traffic jam. Sometimes, it could be terrible, terrible. You can be stuck in the traffic for hours. And you just start to think, “Oh well, I want to get out of here.”\nMichael: Have you – do you have any kinds of rules or like there’s days, specific days where you cannot drive if your sign has this specific number or something like that? \nGoron: They tried to do that, but the drivers in Rome are really famous. They didn’t follow the rules. It’s really hard to have a car incident there. They’re driving like crazy. They are really stressed out about traffic jam and so they’re screaming. They’re horning? So it could be stressful. \nWin: Does the government try to renovate infrastructure of the city? \nGoron: The problem is like it’s really interesting because when they’re trying to dig into Rome, they find something, some monuments or something that’s from the Roman Empire. And they have to stop everything. So they cannot just destroy, you know, the columns or that they maybe, they find some new houses under the ground, then the…\nMichael: Or catacombs. \nGoron: Catacombs, yeah. So really, it’s – and so this one, it’s really difficult to dig into Rome and build new metros for example. \nMichael: So maybe for Italy, it would be better to create like a new capital, like political capital like in Brazil where they have Brasilia which was specifically built only for the politicians. \nGoron: It will be much better to move the capital of Milan actually. I think that, but it’s too much history in Rome to just say, “Oh well, let’s move it out somewhere else.” \nWin: I mean, I think…\nMichael: Would you say that urbanization is a problem in Rome that more and more people are coming to Rome from other places? And what would you think is the reason for that? \nGoron: Not really. It was a problem some decades ago, but not now. Not really. If you can avoid the big city, you do. But as we know, the biggest opportunities that you have for work, for everything are in the big cities. So this is the main reason.",

But overall, I do like chopsticks. I think it’s very handy. It’s just easier to pick up certain things. When I first came to Japan and saw people eating salad with chopsticks, I thought it was very strange. But if I tried to eat it with a fork now, it’s actually very difficult to pick up things like lettuce. And I prefer using chopsticks for things like that. \nAntoinette: When you first started using chopsticks, did you get hand cramps? \nWarren: Not so much because – I can’t recall when I started using them, but I actually, I became comfortable with them before coming to Japan. \nAntoinette: That’s good to know. \nWarren: Uh-hmm. \nAntoinette: Well, what about sleeping? How do you sleep? Do you prefer a bed or do you prefer the Japanese style futon? \nWarren: Well, it’s funny you say that. At first, I hated the idea of this thin little mattress but I did find that it’s actually quite nice for my back. I actually prefer it to Western beds because it’s better for my back. But I don’t like sleeping on the floor. I like being higher up. \nAntoinette: So a high futon. \nWarren: If I could get like, you know, a tatami mat that’s raised with a futon mattress on top, that would be best for me. \nAntoinette: You know, I think I’ve seen things like that in the stores, platform bed with tatami. \nWarren: Oh, that sounds nice. I should look for that. \nAntoinette: Yeah. I should find one for you and point you in that direction. Well, what about bathing? The Japanese are famous for their incense and the way they bathe. So do you prefer a Japanese style bathing situation or a Western style shower? \nWarren: Well, I actually much prefer the Japanese style now. When I go back home, I find it quite difficult. I like to be able to clean myself before going into the bathtub. \nAntoinette: That’s a good thing. I do enjoy that as well. What about the custom of taking your shoes off before going into a house? \nWarren: Well, that doesn’t bother me too much. Growing up in Canada, I always took my shoes off coming inside anyways. I don’t think it’s as much of a ritual in Canada but many people do it just to keep a clean house. \nBut sometimes, if I run out and I forget something like my car keys and I want to just run back inside, I’ll tend to want to keep my shoes on rather than taking them on and off every single time. \nAntoinette: Okay, tell me. Confess now. Do you sometimes keep your shoes on and go into the house? \nWarren: Yeah, sometimes I have. But I’ve caught my wife doing it a couple of times too, and she’s Japanese. So I guess I’m not that bad. \nAntoinette: Hey, I don’t think so. I do it, too. What about sitting on the floor versus sitting in chairs? Which do you prefer? \nWarren: Oh again, I really dislike sitting on the floor. It isn’t very comfortable for me. I’m a little bit tall. I have long legs and I don’t seem to have a place to put my legs when I’m on the floor. Usually, my legs will fall asleep quickly and my back will start to bother me. So I prefer to sit up in a chair. \nAntoinette: Oh yes. I guess my last question refers to eating habits – well, meals and how they’re served. Do you prefer to eat meals that are served to you individually or do you prefer to eat and share your food?\nWarren: Well, that’s a good question but I don’t know if I have a preference. I like the idea of eating all sorts of different things, so it can be fun eating in a Japanese style sometimes. But there are times where do I like to just have my own meal in front of me as well.",

        "transcript": "Warren: So Antoinette, you’ve been living in Japan for a while now, right? \nAntoinette: Yes, that's right. \nWarren: Well, can you tell me, do you like to use chopsticks or forks and knives more? \nAntoinette: It depends on what I’m eating really. For the most part, I enjoy using chopsticks. They are easy to use. I don’t have to worry about cutting anything. And especially if I’m eating Japanese food, which tends to be chopped in small pieces, small bite-size pieces, chopsticks are perfect. \nBut when I’m eating Western food or spaghetti, I prefer using Western style utensils. \nWarren: Oh okay, that makes sense. What about sleeping, do you like to sleep on like a Western bed or a Japanese futon? \nAntoinette: Actually, it depends on the season. \nWarren: Why is that? \nAntoinette: Well, in summer, I prefer sleeping on a futon. It seems cooler than a bed. But in winter, I love a cozy, plush bed with lots of pillows and quilts or duvets. And yeah, I like to feel cozy. \nWarren: That sounds nice. Okay. How about having shoes on or off in the house? \nAntoinette: Hmm, I like to go barefoot – well, with socks. My feet get cold. \nWarren: Well, do you use slippers? \nAntoinette: No. \nWarren: Okay. \nAntoinette: I find slippers uncomfortable unless they are the kind that fit your foot. They’re not actually the correct size for my foot. \nWarren: Oh, I see. So Japanese slippers are a different size from you. \nAntoinette: They are one-size fits all and I just feel like kicking them off anytime. \nWarren: Right. Okay. How about, you know, in Japan, a lot of times people sit on the floor, but you don’t really do that very much in the United States. Do you like sitting in chairs or on the floor more? \nAntoinette: I like both actually. Again, it depends on the season. The floor is so nice and cool in summer, and I like just feeling that coolness. But in winter, I want fabric underneath me, and I want cushions that tend to act – provide a barrier for cold wind. \nWarren: Right, right. Eating out is a little different, too. I think in Japan, you tend to share all the meals that you have but maybe back home you usually just buy one meal. \nAntoinette: That’s true. Maybe I’m a germ-phobic American – I don’t know. I like eating my own food. I don’t like to share. If it’s one huge serving plate that’s meant for several people, then fine. But I like just having my own plate of food. \nWarren: Oh, okay. There’s one more. What about having a shower or a bath? I think in Japan, they usually have like a detachable shower-head and you can shower yourself before going into the bath. What do you prefer? \nAntoinette: Well, I like showers, either way as long as the water is hot. Whether it’s detachable or not, as long as the water is hot, I like showers. And I like having water run down my body. That’s a pleasant feeling. But I also like sitting in a hot tub of water but not for too long. \nWarren: Well, what about the bathtubs because I think they are different sizes, aren’t they? \nAntoinette: They are. I like the fact that Japanese baths allow you to sit in water up to your neck. But I also like the fact that Western style baths allow you to recline in the water. \nWarren: Right. You can stretch out more. \nAntoinette: So you can stretch out, yeah. \nWarren: Oh, okay. I see. \nAntoinette: That’s a hard call.",

I’m doing that paper of cultural diversity of Ecuador, perhaps you can tell me a little bit more about it. \nFelipe: Well, that’s a really amazing topic we can talk about. Yeah. Well, Ecuador is really interesting because it has a lot of ethnic – many, many different ethnic groups. For example, depending on the regions, you know, for example in the coastal region, we have the Montubios ethnic group who have their own, you know, traditional language and food. \nIn the highlands, we have the Quechua communities, who speak, you know, Quechua, which is a language originally from Peru from the Inca Empire. And if you travel to the Amazon region, you can find many different kinds of ethnic groups such as the Huaoranis who live in the jungle, you know, in the Amazon region. \nAnd you also can find Afro-Americans, you know, people who came from Africa in the 16th Century who live in the north part of Ecuador. Though they don’t have the traditional language, they have traditional food and they have created their own, you know, music and many different traditions. \n\nKatia: That is amazing. How can that happen in such a small country like Ecuador, have so many differences, cultural differences? \nFelipe: Yeah. That’s because of history, you know, because if you look at the history of Ecuador, it’s quite diverse. You have that in the 16th Century, Spanish people came and they brought a lot of culture and this culture is now mixed with the indigenous culture because originally in Ecuador, some – I don’t know – 10,000 years ago, indigenous people have been living there. So that when Spanish people came, they both shared their own cultures. \nAnd also, you know, the Afro-American from Africa, they brought a lot of music and traditional culture from Africa. So that’s the reason why you have a lot of diversity. It’s really, really enjoyable, Ecuador. \nKatia: That is so interesting. Really, thank you for this information. I think it’s going to be really helpful for my paper. \nFelipe: Great. Okay. You’re welcome.",

        "transcript": "Abidemi: So Jeremy, you mentioned earlier that you’ve been back to Canada with your baby. How was that experience? \nJeremy: Well, I mean, until you fly with a toddler, you really never get to appreciate all of those times that you flew across the ocean, you know, watching movies or reading magazines or just sleeping on the flight because those days are over. \nAbidemi: Wow. \nJeremy: I mean, it’s not that bad but when you’re on the plane, you say, “Never again.” I remember about halfway into a 10-hour trans-Pacific flight, I thought, “Well, I can maybe do this every three years but not more than once a year for sure.” \nI mean, first of all, our boy was bigger than most children for his age. So he was about one year old. And, you know, they have these bassinets that you’re allowed to put your child in and, you know, the baby will hopefully sleep for a while. So the stewardess sets up the bassinet, we’re all ready to put him in there and then she says, “How old is he?” And he was 12 kilos, and this was for 11.5 maximum. \n\nAbidemi: Oh no. \nJeremy: And they wouldn’t let us put him in there, so they had to take the whole thing apart and basically, we had to find some way to have him sleep on our laps for the next nine hours. \nAbidemi: Oh, wow. \nJeremy: I mean, you know, one-year old like to crawl around. They like to scream, they like to cry. Other people on the flight don’t like that so much. So, you know, it’s basically every minute of silence you just savor and just pray that this will keep going, and it never does. \nBut, you know, once he falls asleep and the plane is quiet and they turn off the lights then, you know, it’s okay. But it’s too long. It’s too long for a one-year old. So I can maybe manage it once a year but that’s about it. \nAbidemi: I remember my sister, she has two kids and she told me a story a few years back when one of her daughters was still a toddler, and they went to Disneyland from Canada. And she said it was just horrible, and they would never do it again. \nAnd I just smiled. I didn’t have that experience. I was just thinking, “What could be so bad about it?” But hearing your story now, wow, I can only imagine. \nJeremy: Well, I think that – actually most people, most passengers on the flight are usually quite understanding. And I think it’s just, you know, in the parents’ head that everybody is judging them, everybody is looking at them. Because, you know, I get so worried about what other people are thinking, that inconveniencing others that I just work myself up so much, and my wife is the same way. \nBut, you know, talking – actually, we did have people say to us like, “Don’t worry about it.” They will just go out of their way to say, “Oh, what a cute baby” and stuff like that. So I think people were kind of aware of how stressful it is for parents. \nAnd they just – some people actually make an effort to make parents feel like everybody is not silently judging them or maybe not even silently. \nAbidemi: Okay. Not saying anything. If you had an advice, one advice to give to a parent that would travel with that child in the future, what would you tell them? \nJeremy: My best advice is if you can fly in the morning. So after baby wakes up and you have your breakfast and your flight is maybe at, I don’t know, 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning, I think that works out if it’s a, say, a 10-hour flight because you’ll land it’ll be probably around bedtime, like his normal bedtime. \nThe first time we did it, the flight was in the late evening. So basically, he’d been up all day. And then there was another 10 hours on top of that. So, you know, when we landed, the readjustment to his normal schedule was really, really difficult. But when we flew in the morning and it was a 10-hour flight, when we landed, he just basically went to sleep like a normal schedule. \nSo that’s a small thing but it really makes a big difference.",

        "transcript": "Michael: Abidemi: Jeremy, I heard you have a new baby. Congrats on that. \nJeremy: Thanks. \nAbidemi: So how has fatherhood changed you in any way? \nJeremy: You know, it's changed me probably in every way. You know, when you think of how your life is different, it's basically from when you wake up until – well, you eventually get to go to sleep. Everything is different. \nBut, you know, everything about it is positive, even things that you'd think would annoy you actually aren't really that annoying. Like having a toddler come and wake you up at 6 o'clock in the morning when you've got a cold and you've taken a bunch of sleeping medication the night before, like which happened this morning. And even that, having a toddler wake you up and just looking at you and laughing, it's awesome. It really is awesome. \nSo, you know, I always kind of worried before when I was thinking about having a kid about all these things – oh, I can't go out at night or I'm going to have to wake up so early in the morning and I'm going to be woken up in the middle of the night by a screaming child. \nAll of that stuff really doesn't bother me. It just, you know, it's part of the experience and yeah, sometimes maybe I'd like to sleep a little bit longer. But yeah, waking up and then having a little guy sit on my lap while he plays with the remote control and changes channels over and over again, I mean, that's somehow a very, very enjoyable experience. \nBut, you know, you get to see a little person change everyday and start figuring things out. And of course, every person, every parent thinks that their child is the smartest child in the world. He can turn off and on the light switch, you know, but it's those types of things that you just marvel at. \nSo, you know, I can say like most people that it's everything about it is very positive. But it's often just the really, really small things that make you appreciate this little wonder. \nAbidemi: And looking back on the experience now, what are some things that you would wish that you had known before your little boy came along? \nJeremy: Yeah, it's a good question. You know, I was so stressed out for the first couple of weeks after he was born. And from the moment he was born until he came back home, and then for the first number of weeks that we was home, we basically just hovered over him for weeks. And, you know, of course, you have to protective and careful of a new born baby. But not everything was as serious as we thought it was. \n\nAnd, you know, crying – we were worried about waking up our neighbors or we're worrying that, you know, something was seriously wrong. Babies cry. And if you really get stressed out about it then you're going to make your life miserable. \n                                So, you know, having done it once, just realizing that, you know, kids cry, kids get sick, kids throw up, kids need their nappies changed, I would just take a deep breath if I have to do it again and just realize, okay, this is just part of the experience. And you just got to roll with it. \nAbidemi: Okay. That's great.",

        "transcript": "Win\nMichael\nGoron\n\n\n\n\nGoron: When I want to look something like more original, I started to watch some Korean movies or Indian movies from Bollywood, which are really interesting. I was fairly surprised. Try it guys because Korean movies are great. Are great. \nMichael: Korean movies are good but the ones – the typical thing about Korean movies, they always end bad. \nWin: They always end with cancer. \nMichael: Whereas Hollywood movies, usually there's always like it has a good ending. \nGoron: And actually, Japanese movies do the same thing. The happy ending is not so granted. And probably many people like them for this reason. \nMichael: And I would say that even Norwegian movies, they try to, you know, go out from the norm that movies are supposed to end nicely. And that they have like a shocking ending. It's like reading a novel with a shocking ending that you wouldn't expect to happen. \nGoron: Because I think some love movies really have a bad effect on the real life because people are trying to have the same relationship that they see on the movies. And then when it's not like – love is not like that. It's not that beautiful. It's not like happy ending all the time. And so they…\nMichael: Oh but…\nWin: Yeah. \nGoron: And then – and they are shocked when their real life – they see that they…\nMichael: But not all movies are like that. I mean, even animation movies like you've seen Up, right? \nGoron: Well, the plot is like they fall in love, they have like a nice time, and then the problematic moment. You know, they overcome like the difficulties, and then at the end, they live all together. Happy ending.\nWin: Well, that's the usual Western discourse of how you produce a movie. But I think nowadays, movie producers are trying to do a lot of different things from the past. \nGoron: Yeah, they try but basically…\nMichael: It's interesting to say because maybe why we prefer movies to have good endings and why we prefer them to be very harmonic is because maybe we don't want to watch depressing things. We want the movie to give us a good feeling in the aftermath. \nGoron: To give us hope. \nMichael: Yeah, give us hope, give us like good thoughts. And you know when I watched Up for instance, which is an animation. When I just saw the first part of the movie, it really – I almost cried just watching it. I never cry to an animation film like that before. It was really, really touching.\nGoron: Right. I cried to the Lion King. [Laughs]\nMichael: When I was younger, I cried to the Lion King. \nGoron: No, I still cry when I see that. \nWin: I mean it's good to be emotional. \nGoron: Oh yeah. When the movie is good, it's good forever.",

        "transcript": "Win\nMichael\nGoron\n\n\n\n\nMichael: Okay. Hello, my name is Michael. Next to me I have Goron from Italy and Win from Vietnam. And today we’re going to do discuss movies, and specifically, we’re going to discuss about Hollywood movies. Do we like Hollywood movies, what is typical in our own countries and so on? So we’re going to start with you Goron. Please. \nGoron: I will say that generally, I like Hollywood movies. They are -- if I want to be like without thinking anything, you just like lie down on my couch and just eat something and drink and watch a movie, I would choose like a Hollywood movie. They are pretty fun. They are well done. They spend – they have huge budgets for those kinds of movies. Like the last superhero movies now, there’s about Ironman, Spiderman, the Avengers, all those kinds of movies. The story or the plot is pretty weak but, you know, you have this like visual effects which the impact on you is strong. And you just think, or at least I think, “Oh wow, how did they do that?” \nMichael: Yeah. I will give like that example there. You have Avatar. You know, the story is – it’s a huge cliché. \nGoron: Yeah. We heard about this story for… \nMichael: I knew how the movie would end. But, you know, just going there to see the good 3D effect that movie had, I think it had good 3D. It really immersed you in this whole world. You know, you saw those flying things from the forest. \nGoron: Yeah, but if you think, it was recorded by a 3D camera because just the camera was a million of dollars. \nMichael: Yes, but…\nGoron: The other 3D movies are really crap because everything in post production. So you can tell, “Oh this is 3D?” \nMichael: Yes. \nGoron: I mean, it’s dark and you have to wear glasses. And if you already have glasses, it’s uncomfortable. So it’s kind of – it sounds – it seems like a technology that’s trying to steal your money. \nMichael: It was a huge hype, I would say. They were charging more for it, and everyone tried to get on the 3D bandwagon. All the movies went into 3D and it became more normal for there to be 3D movies in cinemas than normal movies. But yeah, I agree totally with you. They went too far. Avatar was made, you know, from the ground up. The idea was to make it in 3D, and they really worked hard to provide a good 3D experience. While those other movies, they’re…\nGoron: I guess…\nMichael: It’s just not the same. \nGoron: Technology is not ready yet, probably. \nMichael: And I also agree with you that, you know, there is movies that you watch for the story, which are really good, and you love them. They don’t have to be 3D. They don’t have to be and you just focus on the story. And then you have the movies, like – you know, even Transformers with lots of explosions, lots of effects. It’s entertaining in another way. \nWin: I mean it depends on how we look at entertainment. I mean, some days you could – I mean, you want to watch something emotional and romantic, and then some days you just want some really easy stuff. \nBut I’m just saying that Hollywood isn’t all about the blockbuster and effect-heavy movies. I think Hollywood have made some really good thinking, really good food for thoughts. And it’s not that all bad.",

        "transcript": "Todd: I'm here with Rachel. We\n                      were talking about expiration dates. You were\n                      saying that you throw out your clothes regularly. \nRachel: Fairly regularly. \nTodd: Yeah. Do you donate them\n                      or just toss them? \nRachel: I put them in the\n                      recycling. \nTodd: There you go. \nRachel: And hope they're going\n                      to be remade into something else. \nTodd: Yeah, I guess, yeah I\n                      always take it out on the day that they'll say\n                      that they'll pick up clothes. \nRachel: Yeah. The reason for\n                      that is because I usually put, throw clothes out\n                      when they'll start to look a bit shabby, so I don't\n                      think anyone else wants to wear them. \nTodd: Right. \nRachel: By that stage. \nTodd: What about furniture? How\n                      often do you try to get new furniture? \nRachel: Almost never. \nTodd: Yeah. \nRachel: That's something I don't\n                      ... Yeah, I'll put up\n                        with what I've got. \nTodd: Yeah. \nRachel: It seems like such a\n                      waste to throw out such large things. \nTodd: Yeah, but you never want\n                      to replace the couch or the chair? \nRachel: The couch has been\n                      replaced three or four times. \nTodd: Right. \nRachel: That's a big one, but\n                      we've still got the same kitchen table. We had got\n                      to get some new chairs. \nTodd: Yeah, I've never been a\n                      big furniture guy, but I just when I see something\n                      that's really cheap ... I would never buy new\n                      furniture. I'm always amazed like who buys new\n                      furniture? Because when you walk by a store and\n                      you see the furniture, it's so expensive. I'm\n                      gonna sound really cheap, but it's like I'm like,\n                      wow, why would you pay hundreds of dollars or\n                      thousands of dollars for that when you can just\n                      buy one used or whatever for ten bucks or twenty\n                      bucks? \nRachel: I'm definitely a used\n                      furniture person now. \nTodd: Yeah. \nRachel: When we moved into our\n                      house we did go to a furniture store and bought\n                      all new furniture. It's easy. It's done.\n                      Everything looks new. It's kind of nice, but I\n                      almost exclusively buy second hand furniture now. Depending on which\n                      store you go to, you can get some really good\n                      bargains on some beautiful old antique, that look\n                      really nice in your house, and cost a fraction of\n                      something new. \nTodd: Yeah. That's why you like\n                      anything that's made with metal or wood because\n                      you usually think it's going to age well. \nRachel: Yes. \nTodd: Plastic, not so much. \nRachel: No, no. I've definitely\n                      sworn off plastic. I think plastic's a fill in if\n                      you need something quickly. \nTodd: Yeah. \nRachel: And cheaply, but\n                      definitely don't like to buy plastic now. \nTodd: What about electronic\n                      goods, like getting a new TV, a new refrigerator,\n                      stuff like that? How often do you buy? \nRachel: We just wait until that breaks down.\n                      That's a pretty easy one. \nTodd: What about the TV though?\n                      The TVs don't break down. They go on forever. How\n                      often do you think, oh I want a new TV, I want a\n                      new nicer TV? \nRachel: Our last TV broke. \nTodd: It did? \nRachel: Well, we had lightening\n                      hit the house, and we lost several electronic\n                      items. \nTodd: Wow. \nRachel: We lost a keyboard, and\n                      a computer. I think we lost two out of ... We had\n                      three hard disc DV players. \nTodd: It was an electrical surge that fried all\n                      the circuits?\nRachel: It fried the house, yeah\n                      pretty much. \nTodd: Wow. I did not know that\n                      could happen. \nRachel: Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Rachel, you said that in your home country, New Zealand, there're lots of birds that don't fly?\nRachel: Yes, there are a lot of birds that don't fly.\nTodd: Wow, so I only new of the kiwi and of course the penguin, but I didn't know of other ones. So first the kiwi. It doesn't fly, right?\nRachel: That's the famous one.\nTodd: Right.\nRachel: They don't fly but they can run very fast. I've seen them.\nTodd: Liike and are the kiwi all over? Like are there different types of kiwi?\nRachel: Yeah, there are several different varieties. They're very rare though, and they're nocturnal.\nTodd: Oh, nocturnal.\nRachel: I'd say most New Zealanders have never seen one in the wild. I've only seen them in Kiwi parks.\nTodd: Oh, really.\nRachel: Yeah, you don't see them.\nTodd: So, I thought they'd be like kangaroos in Australia, or something like you go and there's one.\nRachel: No, they're very precious and very rare. One that you see more often is  the pukeko which is ... it looks a little bit like a stork I suppose except it's dark blue.\nTodd: What's it called?\nRachel: Pukeko.\nTodd: Pukeko.\nRachel: Ah, yeah, and they're a lot more commom. And takahe is another one\nTodd: So the first one ...\nRachel: You can see them along the side of the road. When you're driving through the countryside they're much more common.\nTodd: So this pukeko, does it fly?\nRachel: No, they don't fly. \nTodd: Really, and it's like a stork. It has long legs?\nRachel: It has quite long legs. Yeah, it a very cute little bird, but it's very dark.\nTodd: How tall is it? Like up to your knee? Up to your hip?\nRachel: Up to your knees.\nTodd: Really.\nRachel: Cute little bird.\nTodd: That's awesome.  So what was the other one you mentioned?\nRachel: Takahe. It's very similar looking to that one. It's a little different. It's difficult to tell apart.\nTodd: Really, and it's also kind of dark blueish. \nRachel: Yeah, another one's a kakapo. A very famous one. It's New Zealand's flightless green parrot. It's kind of like a large fat parrot that lives on the ground.\nTodd: Really.\nRachel: It's extremely rare. I'm not sure what the numbers are now, but around twenty years ago I think there were only 45 left\nTodd: Oh, that is rare.\nRachel: Extremely rare, so there's an intensive breeding program for them, and of course nobody's seen those in the wild.\nTodd: Yeah, you have to be careful or it'll go like the way of the Tasmanian tiger.\nRachel: Yeah, they breed and they nest on the ground. They lay their eggs on the ground, so they're very vulnerable to introduced predators, to any animals.\nTodd: Yeah, I know that, you don't have snakes, but I know that snakes when they got into Guam they like decimated the bird population.\nRachel: Yep. That's what would happen and that's why New Zealand immigration customs is very strict about what kind of animals you can bring in. We don't even have snakes in zoos. \nTodd: That's smart.\nRachel: Michael Jackson famously came to New Zealand in the 1980's and wanted to bring his pet snake with him and he wasn't allowed to.\nTodd: Oh, good on you.\nRachel: There were no exceptions to that rule.\nTodd: Are there any other birds that don't fly? For example do you have penguins?\nRachel: Oh, yes, there's lots of penguins in New Zealand.\nTodd: In the south right?\nRachel: Yeah, in the south. Oh, they come up to the north sometimes.\nTodd: Really, that far north?\nRachel: Yeah, occasionally. The big colonies are down south.\nTodd: Ah, that's amazing. How cool. Any other birds that don't fly?\nRachel: Not that I can think of off the top of my head. I'd have to look it up on the Internet.\nTodd: No, that's still though ... that's quite a few. That's so nice.\nRachel: The most famous was the moa of course.\nTodd: The moa?\nRachel: Which is an ostrich sized bird.\nTodd: Oh, really.\nRachel: Yeah, but they were ... they were killed off before Europeans arrived in New Zealand.\nTodd: Oh, easy hunting.\nRachel: They were easy hunting. Yeah. And a big feast.\nTodd: It's funny how when you go to a place, you really want to see like a local animal, so last year I went to the Middle East. I went to U.A.E and Oman, and I just wanted to see a camel. I wanted to see a camel so bad, and I thought like I'd go down the road..\nRachel: Everyone drives a Mercedes these days.\nTodd:  and there'd be a camel, and I was kind of going out in the countryside. I wasn't just in the city, and I never saw a camel, and I was asking people that work there, and they're like, \"yeah, you do see them\" but I was just so heartbroken that I never saw a camel.\nRachel: Ooh!\nTodd: It's one of my favorite animals. I just think they look so cool, so when I go to New Zealand, I have to make sure I see a kiwi.\nRachel: But you'll have to go to the kiwi house.\nTodd: The Kiwi House. \nRachel: The Kiwi House it's called. Or just look up zoos.\nTodd: And they got 'em?\nRachel: Yep, they got 'em there. But you won't just see them driving around.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Rachel, you are from New Zealand, correct?\nRachel: Yes, that's right.\nTodd: Now when I lived in London many years ago my roommate was from New Zealand. Really nice guy, and he had the coolest job. He would ride around motorbike in New Zealand. In the bush as he called it. The wild as we say\nRachel: The bush.\nTodd: The bush. And his job was to just kill invasive species. That was his job. Just go out and plant traps for rabbits.\nRachel: Yes, that's right. Actually, I have a friend how does that now.\nTodd: Really?\nRachel: Yes.\nTodd: So it's that big of a problem? You have to like ...\nRachel: It's a huge problem, yeah.\nTodd: Really, like so what animals are a problem?\nRachel: Rabbits like you mentioned. Possums are a big problem in the bush because they eat a lot of the native plants\nTodd: We have possums too in America in Northern California and they are disgusting. I love animals but they're one animal I don't like. They just ... they're nasty.\nRachel: There's a big possum hunt in many areas every year and they're starting to sell the pelts as fur because they're not a protected species so there's no limits on how much you can catch and how much fur you can sell.\nTodd: Yeah, and they often have rabies right? At least in the states we have to be very careful.\nRachel: No we don't have rabies in New Zealand.\nTodd: Oh, that's good to know.\nRachel: So ...\nTodd: Yeah, we have crazy stories of possums or raccoons having rabies, so when you see one, like they tell you, do not touch it, don't go near it, because if you get bit you're ... Yeah, I got bit a dog while I was in Thailand and had to get the rabies shot and it was not fun.\nRachel: Oh, that sounds awful. \nTodd: Yeah, and luckily for me I went in to get the shot because I didn't know about really rabies. I wasn't educated about it, and I thought well, the dog just bit me a little bit, but I better go and check and the doctor was like, \"Oh, now, it can kill you\" like \"Yeah, you better get it checked out.\"\nRachel: This is one of the reasons we have very strick import laws in New Zealand. We've seen the damage that can be done, and we're very strick now. Rabies is one of the diseases that we don't have and very keen not to ever have.\nTodd: So you have a problem with possums and with rabbits.\nRachel: Rabbits on farms. There's also wild deer and boar in the forests who also do a lot of damage and stray cats and dogs as well also kill a lot of native species. There's no native animals in New Zealand. The only mammals that are native to New Zealand are dolphins and bats, so there's no natural hunters except for hawks. So the birds, a lot of the birds have lost the ability to fly and they nest on the ground, so they're enormously vulnerable to predator species like cats and dogs. They've almost completely decimated many bird species, so that's why they're hunters throughout New Zealand who are basically given free range to shoot whatever they can find because they're so destructive to the natural environment. \nTodd: Yeah, I think I read somewhere where you have some campaign to have like no predators by a certain year, right like a new things in New Zealand.\nRachel: I haven't heard of that but I wouldn't be surprised. I think that's always been a goal.\nTodd: I think it was ... it was in the news. I'll have to check so I could be wrong, but I think it was 2050 is the goal of the government to have no predators.\nRachel: That would be amazing.\nTodd: And they said the big one is dogs and cats. That's like the sticking point.\nRachel: They're starting to get much stricter about controlling cats and dogs now. Keeping cats inside and keeping dogs leashed, so that they don't run off into the bush and cause a lot of problems.\nTodd: But dogs I think are probably more domesticated. They're probably not as dangerous, but cats are basically ... they're not that domesticated. They're still natural hunters.\nRachel: Yeah, we keep them with us to hunt, you know, pests like mice. They live with us, so yeah, they catch a lot of birds, but with the birds nesting on the ground and unable to fly, it's very easy for the dogs to kill them as well.\nTodd: Oh, I see. And dogs can just be naughty sometimes\nRachel: Heck yes. They run off.\nTodd: So what do you think? Do you think your country can achieve this goal - no predators - by 2050?\nRachel: It sounds very challenging. I think at present, only some of the offshore islands are completely pest free. Well, no predators yeah that's not quite the same as no pests because pests also include things like rabbits and possums and deer that don't eat the native species so just predator free might be a bit more achievable I think.",

Thankfully they ... it's not ... there's not too much pressure where we live right now, so I don't feel too much pressure and I also work hard to fight against it. Yeah. Every year I tell myself, \"OK, they're so young. We have so much stuff already. We don't need to go crazy with gifts. Just get one or two\" and we do that and then last minute is like \"Oh, no! We don't have many gifts\" and then we end up buying a few more, so... We're not as bad as we could be. There's not as much pressure as there could be.\nTodd: Yeah. I'm lucky in that I live in Japan. You know, we both teach in Japan. So my family's in America, so Christmas usually always falls like the day after we finish school, so I can't actually make it home in time for Christmas, which is awesome because then I don't have to buy gifts for everybody. And I don't mind ... its not the money. I don't mind spending the money, but I really don't like shopping, and I hate having ... I have a huge family. Huge!\nAimee: Right.\nTodd: So the thought of having to buy 20 different gifts!\nAimee: It's a lot of gifts.\nTodd: Oh, really it's not the cost either, it's just I'm too lazy to think of \"Oh, what sweater can I buy this person or ...\" it's not my thing. And I don't want gifts and I don't want to give gifts.\nAimee: Well, you know that's fair.\nTodd: How about you? Are gifts still something special for you?\nAimee: I'm not ... I'm not very good at it. I'm trying to improve cause I know a well-thought-out gift can mean the world to someone, so I'm trying to improve. Yeah, but I'm not the best. I don't mind, I'm not like. I won't fall out with someone if they don't get me a present. I'm not like that.\nTodd: Well, like, I like getting people birthday gifts, I have to admit that. Birthday gifts I like. It's just having to buy twenty, thirty gifts within a one-month period to me just seems obscene. \nAimee: I know, and that's the pressure people are under cause that's the way it is, isn't it? And it's always ... it's always the mothers of the family that have to do it as well right? They're the ones that have to make sure they buy all the gifts for everyone, so they feel they have so much to do. That mental list of everything, and everyone they have to buy for, sof course they have to organize it, so they maybe start earlier, right, and taking advantage of things like Black Friday and Cyber Monday are manageable ways to deal with that load.\nTodd: You've changed my mind. I was very anti-both but now that you put it that way, maybe you're right.\nAimee: I don't know.\nTodd: Let's go!",

        "transcript": "Aimee: OK, so hey Todd, so I have a question. I've noticed recently in the U.K. that this holiday called Black Friday has appeared, and this is a new thing for us. I don't really know why it has appeared. I think it is American. Shops just give super discounts in November and people are going crazy for like TVs and stuff. Do you have experience with this?\n                              Todd: Yeah, unfortunately, I think it is one of our worst exports. Like I am not a fan of Black Friday. We've had it now probably for like ten or twenty years. I can't remember but it started where the department stores would have these massive sales on Friday which is the day after Thanksgiving, which is always on a Thursday in November.\nAimee: Ah, that's the connection. OK, after Thanksgiving.\nTodd: Right, and I think it was called Black Friday because that was the day that the stores could show that they had a profit for the year, or something like that.\nAimee: OK, so it's blatantly all about money?\nTodd: Oh, totally and originally, what they would do is they would entice people with really good bargains, but then they kept ratcheting up the bargain, so now they have these really, really low teaser products, like they only offer ten TVs or something like that for like twenty bucks.\nAimee: Oh, so it's like a limited, a really limited supply of really good deals?\nTodd: Yeah, and so then what you do is you get these huge crowds that converge on these stores, and then they open the doors and people rush in and literally it's a free-for-all. You have fights and it's so crazy.\nAimee: I've seen that. I've seen videos and clips, and it started happening in the U.K. now\nTodd: Oh, no!\nAimee: And I can't believe it that people can be so greedy.\nTodd: And especially what's bothersome is that you're with your family on a holiday. You're having a good time, and then you go to war practically. You know what I mean?\nAimee: Yeah, with strangers\nTodd: Yeah.\nAimee: Or your neighbor even. It doesn't matter who it is, just fighting over a cheap TV.\nTodd: I mean, I'm proud to say I've never been to a Black Friday.\nAimee: Me neither. Me neither. \nTodd: So I guess that's hypocritical for me to say that because you know, since I've never been to a Black Friday. I've only seen it, but I just don't like going to shopping malls and to, like, department stores very much - big box stores. I'm just not a shopper. \nAimee: So you prefer online shopping?\nTodd: I just prefer not shopping at all. Like I don't care like what I dress or how I dress. So, like, I buy my clothes at a supermarket. You know. I know, I'm not the most fashionable person, but as for Black Friday, you know, I think a lot of times, parents what to get stuff for their kids, you know, they want to get that special gift. Maybe I think that's what attracts a lot of the crowds. \nAimee: Yeah, it is, you know, once Thanksgiving is over then it's the build-up to Christmas, so of course there's the stress of preparing everything in time for that. It's hard to resist really good bargains, I guess if you're trying to be careful with your money. You're trying to be sensible or there's those gifts that, you know your child really wants, so I can understand people feel a lot of pressure to do that.\nTodd: I mean, some of the stores, look like they've been through a hurricane after the crowds go through it. It's crazy.\nAimee: It does sound awful. Doesn't sound like my idea of a good time.\nTodd: No. Now there is one option though if you don't want to face the crowds and all the hysteria, you can do what's called Cyber Monday.\nAimee: OK.\nTodd: Do you have Cyber Monday?\nAimee: No, I'm not familiar with it.\nTodd: So Cyber Monday - I think it's the Monday after Black Friday - and you just get all the deals online over a 24 hour period.\nAimee: OK, is like this remainder, leftover stock? Or is this like a new ...?\nTodd: No, this is just the online stuff, so I think it's just, you know, the Amazons and all the online stores, that they want to have their deals that people can buy.\nAimee: They wanted a piece of the action, basically.\nTodd: Yeah, yeah. Exactly so they can make it super, super ...\nAimee: It's too much!\nTodd: Yeah.\nAimee: It is all too much.\nTodd: I know, we should have like a, you know, I don't know, a cut back on spending. But if you cut back on spending, then you're hurting the economy, right, so ...\nAimee: I know. It's true.\nTodd: Yeah!",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Meg, in the last one we were talking about idioms, but we didn't cover them all. Let's go over some more idioms.\nMeg: OK. \nTodd: Alright so the first one is what activity is in your blood?\nMeg: Hmm, I would say anything with nature in my blood, so hiking or especially kayaking. I love going kayaking, and so it's hard for me to resist if I'm in a place with beautiful nature, I need to go outside.\nTodd: So what about baking? Isn't baking sort of just natural for you. Don't you just love to bake? Isn't it in your blood?\nMeg: I do also love to bake. Yeah. I guess hiking and baking are both in my blood together, kind of two different activities. So baking especially when I can make very creative and decorative desserts, to share with people, so I don't like to bake for myself, but sharing with others, it's quite enjoyable for me. Do you have any activities or things that are in your blood?\nTodd: Well, I think one is just teaching. I love teaching. I just want to teach all the time. Even if I won the lottery, I would be a teacher. I just like thinking of lessons, thinking of new ideas for lessons, trying technology with lessons, so even on my free time, I like thinking about it. And another thing is jogging. Even though, most people are surprised because I'm a little fat. I'm about 20 pounds overweight, but I run almost every day.\nMeg: I think I've seen you running before.\nTodd: Yeah, I literally run every day. Like if I don't run, I feel terrible, like it's the most relaxing thing for me.\nMeg: Yeah.\nTodd: I can't go two or three days - two days maybe - but I can't go three or four days without running.\nMeg: So jogging is really in your blood?\nTodd: Yeah, and I started when I was a kid. You know the movie Forest Gump, where he just starts running.\nMeg: Right, yes, yes.\nTodd: That was me as a kid.\nMeg: Run Forest Run!\nTodd: I would just run out of my driveway, also in the country, and just go running for an hour\nMeg: Wow!\nTodd: Just to run, I thought it was fun.\nMeg: Well, that's great.\nTodd: Yeah, it's definitely in my blood.\nTodd: OK, so we'll talk a little about feelings. So when you get criticized, do you take it to heart?\nMeg: I think my first reaction, is to take it to heart, so sometimes I might be a little oversensitive when I first get criticized, but after some time passes and I'm able to think about it, usually I can see how that criticism can be useful, and I can try to make a change or improve something. Or I can decide that I don't care about that person's opinion. What about you? What do you do? How do you respond?\nTodd: Yeah, I used to take things to heart a lot, but as I've gotten older, as many people do, now a lot of it just rolls off my back, as we say, like water off a duck's back, so it doesn't bother me at all\nMeg: Yeah.\nTodd: Yeah, I just realize everybody has different opinions and don't worry about it.\nMeg: Yeah, I think that's a good attitude to have.\nTodd: Yeah, OK, so the next one also about feelings and opinions. So are you more likely to bite your lip, or speak your mind when you disagree with somebody?\nMeg: I think it depends on the situation, so if I feel like someone else is being treated unfairly or there are some rules that are there for a reason that should be followed, I am ore likely to speak my mind, but if it's something personal, or just related to me I might bite my lip to try to keep the peace. What would you do, bite your lip or speak your mind?\nTodd: Well, I have a big mouth, so no, I always speak my mind. So I have a really big mouth. I just never keep it inside. Yeah, it's really hard for me to bite my lip.\nMeg: Hmm.\nTodd: Yeah, so. That can be a bad thing.\nMeg: But sometimes good.\nTodd: Yeah, say it like it is, as they say.",

        "transcript": "Todd: OK, Meg, let's talk about idioms related to the body.\nMeg: Ooh!\nTodd: So we have lots of idioms in English that we use for specific meanings, so to learn these idioms, we'll just talk about them by asking each other questions.\nMeg: OK.\nTodd: OK, the first one is about dating, so should a man always foot the bill on a date?\nMeg: Well, I think I'm a little bit of an traditionalist in that maybe at the beginning or the first date the man should foot the bill, but after that, if you're in a relationship, it doesn't really seem fair for the man to pay all the time. Do you agree?\nTodd: Yeah, I agree, I mean on a date I feel awkward if I don't pay the bill, so yeah. The man should foot the bill on the first date.\nMeg: Hmm!\nTodd: So the next one related to feet is when you dance, do you have two left feet?\nMeg: Yes, I definitely have two left feet. I'm not a good dancer by any means and I don't really enjoy it so I think I look a little awkward when I'm dancing. What about you?\nTodd: Yeah, I definitely have two left feet. Yeah, I just look like a mess on the dance floor, so and I don't enjoy it, and I think because I'm nervous I want to get out of there, so yeah.\nMeg: Right. I understand your feeling.\nTodd: Not my ... Alright so also related to feet is the leg, so in your city, what costs an arm and a leg? \nMeg: In my city where I live right now, I feel like fruit costs an arm and a leg. It can be quite expensive, especially if you want fruit that's out of season, but in my hometown, in America, you can usually get fruit very cheap, so it feels like it costs an arm and a leg here. What about for you?\nTodd: Yeah, the city I live in now is in Japan, and it's also very expensive. Taxis cost an arm and a leg, so to take a taxi ride is so expensive. In America where I'm from, I would say healthcare costs an arm and a leg. It's so expensive - crazy expensive.\nMeg: Right, much more ...\nTodd: You never want to get sick.\nMeg: Yes.\nTodd: Even health insurance costs an arm and a leg. It's very, very costly.\nMeg: I agree with that.\nTodd: Alright, let's now talk about feelings. So, is it OK to give people the cold shoulder sometimes?\nMeg: Hmm, well ...\nTodd: Nobody likes the cold shoulder.\nMeg: Right, nobody likes the cold shoulder. I don't think we should give people the cold shoulder, however, I have to admit that I have sometimes given a friend or a family member the cold shoulder when I've been upset about something.\nTodd: Yeah, the whole thing about the cold shoulder, is actually you do want them to talk to you. You just want them to feel bad.\nMeg: Right. Yes. \nTodd: Right?\nMeg: Yeah, it's kind of passive aggressive. \nTodd: Exactly, like I'm mad at you, but I really just want you to see that I'm mad at you and give me attention and I'm happy.\nMeg: Right, yes, you want to make it clear that you're mad ...\nTodd: Yeah, exactly\nMeg: by giving the cold shoulder.\nTodd: Right.\nMeg: Have you ever given someone the cold shoulder?\nTodd: Oh, yeah, I can be very moody, so I've definitely given people the cold shoulder. And then I'm embarrassed sometimes afterwards, like why did I do that? That's so bad. \nMeg: Yeah, you feel a little guilty later.\nTodd: Yeah, so we're both teachers. Do you ever give students the cold shoulder?\nMeg: No, I don't think I would ever give a student the cold shoulder because if they have questions or need help, I want to be able to assist them, so that's a little different I think. What about you?\nTodd: Yeah, no totally. Like the students give me the cold shoulder, right?\nMeg: Ah, yes.\nTodd: So you know that something's wrong, but yeah teachers can't give students the cold shoulder.\nMeg: No, you can't.\nTodd: It's impossible. Or it shouldn't be done.\nMeg: Mmm.\nTodd: Alright, those were some interesting points.",

So like, a lot of people have to move to London if they want to do the job they're interested in, and it just makes London really crowded and expensive because everybody has to live there, it seems. \nPernais: Sounds like Kingston.\nDoron: Really?\nPernais: Yes.\nDoron: Everybody moves to Kingston?\nPernais: Everybody's moving from rural areas to Kingston.\nDoron: What's the population of Kingston now, do you know?\nPernais: I think it's about a half a million.\nDoron: Half a million.  And was it much smaller before?\nPernais: I think it was because a lot of people lived out in the countryside, because farming was very profitable, maybe, some decades ago.  But now that, you know, technology is changing everything, people want, like, office jobs and they want to earn more, so lots of people actually move into the city areas now.\nDoron: Yeah, I think technology in the near future might actually help to stop that because you can pretty much do most jobs online from anywhere.  It's like, personally, I wouldn't want to live in London.  I'd rather live somewhere a little more rural, more peaceful, cheaper, and be able to do my job online.  So maybe that's something that'll change in the near future.\nPernais: Hopefully.\nDoron: Are you from Kingston?\nPernais: I am.\nDoron: Are you actually from the middle of Kingston?  I remember you have a town with a really cool name, right?\nPernais: I'm not from the middle of Kingston.  I'm from... just outside city center.\nDoron: How far outside city center?\nPernais: 8 miles from Kingston.\nDoron: And what's the name of your hometown.\nPernais: My hometown is called Bull Bay.\nDoron: Bull Bay?\nPernais: Yes.\nDoron: I thought it was called \"8 miles from Kingston\"\nPernais: Sometimes they call it that.\nDoron: Were you kidding me when you said that?\nPernais: No, the bigger part of it is called Bull Bay and then that's subdivided into 8 miles, 9 miles, 7 miles.\nDoron: So place names outside of Kingston are actually named after how far they are from Kingston.\nPernais: Yes.\nDoron: That's one of the coolest things I've ever heard.  I live 8 miles from Kingston.  Where do you live?  I live in 12 miles from London.  That's a great name.\nPernais: Or sometimes it's shortened to 8 miles.\nDoron: Wow.  Like in Detroit.  Maybe that's what it means, in the movie.",

Do you have a problem with people leaving, like for university or of to get better jobs going to other countries?\nPernais: Yes, a lot of people leave, but I don't know if it's so much a problem because Jamaicans have been migrating for decades now.  A lot of people don't know that half of the Jamaican population actually lives outside of Jamaica.\nDoron: Half?\nPernais: Yes.\nDoron: So that means there's like 5.4 million Jamaicans?\nPernais: Yes.\nDoron: And only half of them live in Jamaica?\nPernais: Yes.  Possibly.\nDoron: Where do they usually go?\nPernais: Most Jamaicans that migrate go to America.\nDoron: 'Cause it's so close.\nPernais: Yes.  And because they have family members there.  Maybe.  And other people go to Canada and the U.K., for example.\nDoron: Do you get a lot of immigration?  Do you get many people moving to Jamaica to live from other places?\nPernais: Recently, there has been an increase in that.  People coming from other Caribbean islands, especially with the situation, the economic situation in Haiti these days.  A lot of Haitians actually come over to Jamaica to find work, and, you know, to...  just to, just for a better life, really.\nDoron: Is it very close?\nPernais: It is very close.  It is quite close.\nDoron: How do they usually get to Jamaica?\nPernais: By boat.\nDoron: So...\nPernais: Which is quite dangerous, but...\nDoron: Yeah, I hear a lot of it in history the last couple of decades of boat people, right?  But you don't often hear about Haitian boat people.  Usually people getting in boats and trying to get to the States, right?\nPernais: Yes.  But I guess Jamaica's closer, so they go for Jamaica.\nDoron: Yeah. What kind of jobs do people go for when they get to Jamaica?\nPernais: Well, a lot of them end up working in bars and restaurants, and... yeah, just jobs like that.\nDoron: I guess there's a lot of tourists in Jamaica?\nPernais: There are quite a lot of tourists.\nDoron: So there must be a lot of jobs in the tourism industry.\nPernais: Yes.

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Natalie, you were saying that you are a foodie.\nNatalie: I'm a huge foodie. \nTodd: And you are now in Bangkok, and Bangkok is famous for its street stall food, but that's changing. \nNatalie: It is, so this is probably 70% of the reason why I moved to Bangkok because of the street food. So, yeah, the street food scene is changing. It seems like they're trying to take the model that's similar to the hawker centers in Singapore, so the hawker centers is basically where all of the street food carts that used to be on the corner of a street - what we call in Thai a soi - they've been moved into one big center, so almost like a deli center. I think it's in an effort to keep things clean, and to just have a hub where you get all of your food. It's easier for tourists. So that's happening a lot. There are pockets of areas in Bangkok where you can still get amazing street food on the street. Particularly in the business districts, like Silom. I think they will struggle to get their street food vendors off the streets because it is so convenient for people. When they leave work, it's right near the elevated sky train that we talked about earlier. People can just grab some noodles ... it's under a dollar ... get their dinner. Or perhaps they get their food to take away and then they go home. And these places are always really busy. There's usually a line to get in one of these street food places. They have little seats, little plastic chairs outside, and little metal tables, so you can eat there, but it is on the street, so there are areas now where you can get amazing street food, but it's not on the street anymore. It's in one of these small hawker-like centers. \nTodd: Yeah, that's too bad because I ate street food going way back to 25 years ago, when I first moved here, and it's just the best. I never got sick eating street food for all my years. It's always clean and safe, and one of the things I really like about the street stall vendors that people don't talk about is that they're always really nice, and I have a theory about this. The people that own the street stalls, often, that's their own small little business, so they're the one that's in control of it, and I think mentally, they're just happier people. Rather than if you go in some restaurant, the service can be quite poor because that person is kind of in servitude. They're not really in control of their little economic endeavor. So I love the street stall people, because they're just so positive. \nNatalie: Yeah, it does feel more entrepreneurial. And these guys ... something that I love about the street food as well, just while we're on the topic, is you walk down the street in Bangkok and there are all kinds of noises and there's color everywhere ... all the cars, the taxis, are super colorful; they're really famous for that ... but then you'll smell something. You will smell something being grilled, or you'll smell som tum ... this is where they have the pestle and mortar and they're mixing up papaya and salad and garlic, and ... the smell of fried garlic ... if you wanna sell something, just blast the smell of fried garlic out. You will get people in. And that's one of the things that I love about the street food here. And as you say, it is really cheap. And the thing is is these people have most likely been preparing this food since the night before. There is a huge misconception about street food being dirty, and obviously, of course there are gonna be places that have dirty street food and might make you sick, but the chances are, these people have been preparing these ingredients at home and then they've brought them into their street food cart and they're selling them all day, so they really care about what they're selling. And people go back time and time again. I can say that because I do, and I wouldn't go back if these people didn't make amazing food. \nTodd: Yeah, and if people were sick, right, then they would lose their business. \nNatalie: Yeah. \nTodd: You know, it's almost illogical, because when people think that, \"Oh, the street food is dirty,\" you can see the kitchen. You literally are sitting next to the cook in the kitchen. You can see everything they're doing right in front of you. Whereas in a restaurant, you have no idea what goes on in the kitchen. \nNatalie: Yeah. So I can give you some advice for street food. Don't be scared of street food. Try it. But there are a couple of things that you can do to make it a little bit safer. If you're getting something that's grilled ... so we have something here called mu ping, which is pork, and it has a kind of sauce on the top of it, it's like coconut and spices, it's delicious ... and you'll get it for 10 baht. But sometimes it'll be sat out, and it might've been out for a while, so maybe you're worried about dirt on it or bacteria growing on it or flies getting on it or something like that. The grill is usually on the cart, so ask the street food vendor ... or just pick it up yourself and put it back on the grill. So that will ... the flames will kill off any bacteria that's on there. Just put it on there for a couple of minutes ... as long as you need to be happy ... and then you can eat it and it will be roasting hot, but you can be assured that there's nothing in it. \nTodd: And they often do that themselves. \nNatalie: Yeah. \nTodd: Even if you don't ask. I've always wondered if they'll just flop it back on there really fast. Another thing that I love that they do in Thailand, too, is if you go to ... it's similar to the street food ... it's the hole-in-the-wall place where literally it's like a room with no door, and it's kind of an outdoor restaurant, and they have the hot water bucket, and you dip your spoon and fork in the hot water bucket. It's the most brilliant idea. It's something that almost restaurants should do, you know what I mean? \nNatalie: Yeah, it's ingenious. \nTodd: Yeah, I love that. It's like, \"Okay, let's just sterilize it real fast.\" \nNatalie: Yeah, so the idea is that the water's usually hot or boiling, so it will kill any bacteria that's on it. If you go to a street food place and perhaps they don't have that but they do have a table and chairs set up ... you get a box, usually, like a rectangular metal box ... and that has your chopsticks in it, or it has your spoon in it, or your knife and ... eh, we don't use knives in Thailand. It would be a spoon and a fork. Just use a napkin, wipe it down before you use it. They will have cleaned it before. I've never had any issue. But if you're not sure, just wipe it down with a napkin. There are always napkins. \nTodd: Yeah, it's so clever.",

        "transcript": "Todd: I'm here with Natalie and she is working in Bangkok. And how long have you been here? \nNatalie: I've been here about 10 months. \nTodd: It's interesting to hear your thoughts on Bangkok because I was an English teacher here over 20 years ago from 1994 to 1998. It was my first teaching job and Bangkok was very different then than it is now. Now I would say it's a pretty amazing cosmopolitan city. Could you agree? \nNatalie: Yeah, that's part of the reason why we chose it. My partner and I traveled for about a year and a half and we said, \"Okay, now let's live somewhere.\" So we decided to move to Bangkok because it has this great balance of you're still in Southeast Asia, so it still feels like it's developing, it's on its way to something, perhaps what we see Japan or China as now, but it's not quite there yet. And also you can get all the modern conveniences that you could possibly need here in the city. It's really well connected, so it feels like a regular metropolitan city, but at the same time it still feels like you're living in Southeast Asia, which is really cool. \nTodd: It has done an amazing job of one becoming this just bustling, beautiful cosmopolitan paradise. I mean, the skyline was not here 25 years ago. So all the buildings that they've built or it's just amazing. So now it almost rivals Hong Kong or New York and years ago they didn't have that. So in terms of the city planning, it's just phenomenal what they've done. But also, like you said, they've kept the kind of original cultural vibe to the city- \nNatalie: Absolutely. \nTodd: Which is pretty amazing. \nNatalie: You have different neighborhoods that you can live in. So there is the, I guess a main artery of Bangkok is the Skytrain. So we call it the BTS. And this a, I guess what they were considered to be high speed and transportation rail system that goes right through the heart of Bangkok. So a lot of the neighborhoods that I would talk about kind of populated around the Skytrain. So you will have pockets of Bangkok that will feel very Thai. So they will be further out on the BTS Skytrain. But you can still get to the heart of Bangkok where all the malls are, or perhaps where all the business areas are within, I don't know, 20 minutes. And obviously with it being in Southeast Asia it's still really cheap. \nNatalie: You can go way out into the areas that are super Thai. You get amazing street food, you'll see very few tourists and then you can, within 20 minutes you can be in, say the Japanese area, which is more expensive and it has a lot of Western restaurants and obviously Japanese restaurants. 20 minutes later you can be in the tourist center where you'll see all the malls and perhaps the more city side of Bangkok. So it's very accessible. \nTodd: Yeah, it's interesting. How have you been to Dubai? \nNatalie: I haven't, no. \nTodd: What's interesting is Dubai and Bangkok have almost the exact same developmental model. So what they did is they built a nice train line, an elevated train and then along the train they built a bunch of shopping malls and condos and they've built a world class airport and made it a hub for travel to other areas. And even though Dubai and Bangkok they're so different culturally, it's quite interesting to see that economically they're kind of thriving on the same model. They get lots of international travel, they have a lot of things for tourists to do when they go there. They get a lot of people now that want to retire or maybe live there. \nNatalie: Yeah. The people that I speak to you about that they're saying the same thing. Bangkok is almost the center of Southeast Asia. You can get pretty much anywhere in the world on a long haul flight. So you can fly to the UK directly from Bangkok, which is insane. You don't have to stop anywhere. If you want to go to Vietnam from somewhere in the West, you have to stop in Bangkok for the most part. There are very few direct flights. And you can get to the likes of Japan and China within just five or six hours.",

        "transcript": "Viyasan: So Gyri, can you tell me a little bit more about the lifestyle of school in Norway? For example, I've heard you guys don't have homework, don't have standardized tests. Tell me a little bit more about how school is in Norway.\nGyri: Yeah. So, we don't have a lot of homework, that's true. When I was little, or in grade school we had homework, but not too much. I think they changed it recently so that they almost have no homework anymore. \n                              \nViyasan: Okay. \nGyri: Also, in junior high I remember that we did have homework, but it was like, it didn't really matter if you did it or not. So it was, how I remember grade school and junior high is that it's pretty relaxed. \nViyasan: So that's very interesting, because I'm sure all around the world students who go to school have lots of homework, they have lots of classes to take, they're probably in classes for lots of hours in a day. That's pretty cool. Do you think it's working? What are your thoughts on it? \nGyri: Well, I think Norway really wants to focus on that ... if we have a lot of free time then we learn better, like we'll stay motivated instead of like having to go to school and then also having to work with school when you get home. Like you should ... Norwegians, I think, mostly agree that you do school at school, and then you do other things after so you don't have to think about school all the time. \nViyasan: So there's a large emphasis on what you do outside of the classroom. \nGyri: Yeah. \nViyasan: Got it, okay. \nGyri: Yeah, 'cause I think one of the problems that we have in Norway is like motivation, maybe because we're a more relaxed, or we're, yeah, we're more relaxed when it comes to education, other problems show up. So we have a lot of, I th- yeah, we have a problem with pupils that can't focus. \nViyasan: Got it. \nGyri: And we're also, we don't have enough teachers as well. So that's a problem now in Norway, that not enough people are getting their, or becoming teachers, and there are so many students that have other needs than the rest of the students and we don't have enough teachers to follow up on all of them. So that's Norway's focus now, I think. \nViyasan: Got it. \nGyri: To get more teachers, and have like, I think the goal is to have one teacher for every five kids. \nViyasan: Wow. \nGyri: Yeah. \nViyasan: That's intense. Wow. \nGyri: Yeah. So everyone gets the, gets a lot of- \nViyasan: To compare and contrast with Canada at least, and Toronto, in high school there is about one student, or sorry, one teacher per 28 students. \nGyri: Oh, wow. \nViyasan: Students. \nGyri: Yeah. \nViyasan: So it's very tough for the teacher to learn all the names, especially in the first few months, and they have to keep on doing that year, after year, after year, and every year usually it increases. So 28 turns into 30, 30 turns into 33, and so, wow, that's quite intense to see the differences. But how do you think the students are liking that approach of one teacher and five students? Do they like how that style of class is? \nGyri: I think so, because especially for some students that don't take, that don't learn as fast, they have a teacher that can help them to, yeah, and that helps their specific needs, because if you only have one teacher in like a big classroom, then the really, the kids that learn fast, they'll take everything on their own, and then you'll have like this, these bunch of kids that are lost. So I think people are pretty happy with this.\nViyasan: Got it. \nGyri: But it's not like ... This is the goal. I think right now maybe we maybe have a teacher for every 10 pupils or something. \nViyasan: And so, for example, there's different ways for teachers to grade a student or a certain class. Of course, there's the pass or fail, very binary, you either pass the class or you fail the class, there's percentages, so you can do very well or very poor in the class, there's the bell curve, of course, and I think the last one would be, yeah, portfolio based, so that's based off of different tasks and the teacher leaves a comment of how you did and ways to improve. Which ways do you think would be best for students to learn and how do they do it in Norway? \nGyri: Well, in Norway I think they do a combination of all of them, but we definitely do a lot of the latter, the portfolio based, so you don't necessarily get a grade, but you get feedback, detailed feedback on how you did and what you need to improve. And I think that's my, I prefer that method, because it's not as, like it focuses on the learning, not on the grade- \nViyasan: Got it. \nGyri: And I think that's important, but grades are useful as well. Especially if you're a competitive student, I think grades are very useful. But yeah, so I think the best way to do it is to have a combination of the different types of grading system. What about you? \nViyasan: Yeah, I agree. In Canada, well at least in Toronto what they do is they do a mix of both the bell curve and the percentage, and so usually depending on how your class performs, for example if you're in a statistics class filled with 50 students and the average that everyone gets on a certain test is 40% out of 100%, and that usually is the case because of how difficult the class is, there usually is a bell curve so that they meet a minimum of maybe 60%, so that way students that got a 70 on it get a 90 in the class. That's some ways that teachers grade university level classes, but of course in high school usually you're given a letter grade. For example, A plus is perfect, about 90%, and then A, A minus, B, B plus, that kind of stuff, or percentages as well. And so, I think they're both very cool to compare and contrast, but I definitely do like how Norway provides comments and detailed feedback, so it's not just “Yes, you got that right,” and “No, you got that wrong,” it's “This is what you did very well,” and “You can perform even better on those areas by following some of these steps.” I think that's very beneficial, especially for young students trying to grasp a concept, and really master a certain area and find out what they like. \nGyri: Yeah.",

        "name": "Standardized Tests",
        "transcript": "Gyri: So what is your opinion on standardized tests?\nViyasan: Standardized tests. Yeah, I've done quite a few standardized tests in Canada. In elementary school, we have the EQAO, so that's English, math, and I think literacy skills as well. But they have standardized tests that all elementary students do in grades three, in grade six, and grade nine. It depends. I think they're a good way to measure nationwide the skill of your students; for example, they do it every single year and when they do do that, you're able to see and track, okay, maybe in 2007 students had a 67% accuracy on their math test but maybe in 2009 it improved to 73%. So you can see that the quality of education is rising, and your students are able to grasp a lot more knowledge that they're taught in the classrooms. So I think if you're able to track it year by year, it's very good to see the quality of education and how students are understanding information that are taught in classrooms. \nGyri: Yeah, so the statistics are useful. \nViyasan: Yeah. \nGyri: But how does it affect you as an individual? \nViyasan: So I think that for career prospects and just generally for life and what you wanna do, and what your interests lie in, most people don't find those tests very useful. Although some of the information you do need for general life after school. Some people might not perform well on tests. I've had a couple of friends who just weren't interested in taking tests, didn't try very hard for their tests, and just didn't care very much about it, and would rather spend their time and energy on other things they like outside of the classroom. For example, maybe music, maybe in martial arts. They'd spend a lot more time in those areas rather than practicing those skills needed to perform well on those tests. So I guess it really depends on yourself and how you feel about taking tests. So there's some good things about it and of course there's some downsides to standardized tests. But what's your take Gyri? Does Norway have standardized tests? \nGyri: No, I don't think so. I'm not familiar with the term really. I remember in grade school we had these nationwide tests that everyone got but I don't think we ever got the results, they only used it to, for the statistics, to see how well the Norwegian population was learning. But in high school and junior high we never had those. I don't think, and not in college either. So yeah, I'm just not familiar with it. \nViyasan: So would you like to take a standardized test and see where you gauge? \nGyri: Well, they sound scary. They do, tests are scary always, I think but ... Yeah, I'm glad we don't have them in Norway. \nViyasan: So that's interesting because we're both university students. I had to take a lot of tests to get into college and university. How is it like in Norway, how do you get into college if you don't take any standardized tests? \nGyri: You just apply and some of the degrees that you're applying for you need higher grades from high school. \nViyasan: Okay. \nGyri: So we do have, we do get grades in high school. So these ... You have to have high grades to get into medicine, and law school, and all that. But a lot of the universities, or the degrees at the universities, they just take in the first people that apply. \nViyasan: Okay. \nGyri: Yeah. But it depends on the degree. \nViyasan: That's very similar, in Canada we have the same thing where in high school you submit your grades to certain top classes that you would like to pursue. For example, if you wanna go to business school you would submit your business courses, your math courses. But if you wanted to go to art school you would probably have to submit different art classes and show a portfolio. \nGyri: Oh, okay. \nViyasan: And so it's very interesting to see the different dynamic between what you have to submit and how it's graded. That's very cool. \nGyri: Yeah. We have all our grades in high school, all the different grades get ... Ugh, what's it called? I'm sorry. The ... \nViyasan: The average? \nGyri: Yeah, the average! \nViyasan: Got it. \nGyri: The average of our grades from high school is what we use. So I think that what you were saying that you only used the business related subjects if you wanna go to business school, that sounds actually a lot smarter than what we do in Norway. 'Cause you don't need to be good at math or a language to get into art school, for example, but they use all the grades from high school to determine if you can get in. \nViyasan: Got it, got it. \nGyri: At most schools, at least. \nViyasan: Yeah, that sounds pretty interesting.",
