Pictures can help you to remember things and then you don’t need to write so many words. Look.\nClare: That’s so good! The crown is for ‘King’ and the ‘H’ is for Henry. That’s cool. Then the heart is ‘love’ and a number six … well that is ehm … six.\nMark: Yes. So look at these notes. Let’s test your memory.\nClare: King Henry the Eighth was married six times.\nMark: Exactly!

As you can see, we’re on an open-top bus, so you can see all the attractions from your seat and you don’t need to walk anywhere. And please don’t worry about the rain, I’m sure it’ll stop soon. A-a-and please ask any questions at any time.\nTourist 1: I have a question.\nTour guide: Yes?\nTourist 1: Do you have extra umbrellas? I mean, if it rains a lot.\nTour guide: Err, no, we don’t have any extra umbrellas, but don’t worry, I’m sure the rain will stop soon. Right, OK, so where are we going on our wonderful tour? Well, the tour takes two hours and we are going to visit all the famous sites. First we’ll see Madame Tussauds, the museum with wax models of famous people and celebrities, then we’ll drive along the most famous shopping street in the world, Oxford Street. After that we’ll see the famous clock Big Ben and The Houses of Parliament. As we drive along the river you’ll see the popular attraction, the London Eye, from which you can see the whole city on a sunny day. Then we’ll see Tower Bridge and the famous Tower of London before arriving at Buckingham Palace, just in time for a cup of tea with the Queen.\nTourist 2: Is that included in the tour? A cup of tea with the Queen?\nTour guide: Err, well, no, not exactly, but there’s a lovely café near the palace where you can get a cup of tea. (Sound of a storm right overhead, loud thunder and very heavy downpour)\nTourist 1: I have another question.\nTour guide: Yes?\nTourist 1: Can we have our money back? We’re getting off the bus.\nTour guide: Err, well, you see ... Quick! Run! Everyone off the bus! ...",

        "transcript": "Girl: My presentation is about how you can use colour coding to organise your homework.\n\nTo start you need a few things from the stationery shop. This photo shows the things I use. They aren’t expensive. They are all cheap. I’ve got coloured pens and pencils, sticky notes, page markers, glue and folders. \n\nFirst, I choose a different colour for each school subject. The colour I choose has to be easy to remember so I make sure it means something to me. Maths is green because my ruler is green. PE is yellow because my trainers are yellow. \n\nHere is a photo of my folders. I use the cheapest kind and I add a coloured sticky note to the top and to the front. I keep all my notes inside the different folders. \n\nThis is a photo of some more sticky notes. I wrote them in the library when I was studying. The blue notes are for history. My history teacher has got a blue car! The black notes are for geography. One day I want to visit the Black Sea.\n\nThis photo shows the pages I need to read for homework. I use two coloured page markers to mark where it starts and ends. Those blue ones mark the pages I need to read for history. \n\nFinally, this last photo shows my wall calendar. This green star shows I have a maths test on Friday. This pink circle shows I’ve got French homework for Monday. It’s pink because ‘pink’ is ‘rose’ in French … and the rose is my favourite flower.\n\nHas anyone got any questions?",

Our shop sells clothes and accessories for men, women and children. I work in the children’s department. It can be crazy sometimes, but it’s fun.\n\nB\nI work during my summer holidays when I’m not at university. Oxford has thousands of tourists in the summer, so it’s easy to find a job as a tour guide. I take tourists to visit the university colleges and then we go down to the river. We go along the river on a boat. The tourists love the boat trip, but last summer one tourist fell in the river! I love meeting people from all over the world.\n\nC\nI like my job, but lots of people don’t like coming to see me because they hate dentists. Sometimes it’s very hard work, but it’s great to help people when they have a problem. It’s so important to look after your teeth.\n\nD\nMy job is very difficult, but I like it because I love flying. I fly planes that take people to different places on holiday. Most of the time I fly in Europe to places like Spain, Greece and Italy. The most difficult thing about my job is when the weather is bad. Snow and thunderstorms are the worst. The best thing is visiting different places.\n\nE\nI work in a hospital in the city centre. It’s a very big hospital. I help the doctors with the patients. I give them their medicine and look after them when they feel ill. I love my job but I don’t like the uniform and sometimes I have to work at night.",

        "transcript": "Hi, everyone. I know you're all busy so I'll keep this briefing quick. I have some important information about a change in the management team. As you already know, our head of department, James Watson, is leaving his position at the end of this week. His replacement is starting at the end of the next month. In the meantime, we'll continue with our projects as usual.\n\nI have two more quick points. Firstly, there will be some improvements made to the staff car park next month for a few weeks. It will be closed during that time.\n\nDon't worry, we've found a solution. We can use the local church car park until our own one is ready. If you arrive before 8.30 a.m., please use our small car park on Brown Street, and if you arrive after that, you should go directly to the church car park. It's only a five-minute walk away. But they need it in the evenings, so you have to leave before 6 p.m. Sorry about that – I know how much you all love working late!\n\nThe other thing I wanted to tell you about is that the canteen has now introduced a cashless payment system. So, you can't use cash for payments any more. You can pay directly with your smartphone or you can pay using your company ID card. The total amount put on your company ID card comes off your salary at the end of each month.\n\nOK. That's it? Are there any questions?",

I guess you're at work and you don't have your phone on, right? First of all, thank you, THANK YOU for the birthday card and message. I received it this morning. That's so nice of you. I'm organising a little party for my birthday. It's nothing very big – only a few of my best and closest friends. That means you too! We're going to have it at my cousin's house. She lives in the countryside in a nice big house with a swimming pool. I'd love to see you there. It's going to be this Friday. I'll send you the instructions on how to get there later, OK? \n\nAnyway, have fun at work. Don't work too hard, OK? Talk soon.\n\nAutomated message: You have two new messages. Message number two, received today at 5.15 p.m.\n\nAw, you're still not answering your phone! OK, here are the instructions to get to my cousin's house for the party. Are you going to take your car? If you take the car, drive straight on Forest Road until you get to the motorway. Drive past Brownsville and take exit 13A. That's 13A. You drive down the road there and turn left. It's the first big house on the right. OK? If you're taking a bus, you can get the number 80 to Brownsville. Call me when you get there and somebody can pick you up in a car. I can't wait. This is going to be so great!",

What did they say?\n\nWoman: Nothing much. At the end I asked them, 'What happens now?', and the woman said, 'We'll call you back with news in three or four days.'\n\nMan: Really?\n\nWoman: Yeah, I think I've got the job. There weren't a lot of other people there. I was the only interview that day, you know?\n\nMan: Well, good luck with it.\n\nB\nMan: Anyway, you were saying ...\n\nWoman: Oh, yeah, um ... let's see. Yes, so I was in the museum and there were, I don't know, a hundred people waiting to get into the room. Finally, I got in, and I tried to see the Mona Lisa but I couldn't look at it.\n\nMan: Why not?\n\nWoman: Because the room was filled with people taking photographs of it!\n\nMan: Oh, right.\n\nWoman: Yes! And selfies.\n\nMan: Wait a minute. You can take photos while you're in there?\n\nWoman: Yes, but you can't use flash. I don't know ... Why do we take photos of everything we see when we travel?\n\nMan: I know. And we never look at the photos after.\n\nWoman: Exactly! I'm tired of always taking photos. I don't feel I'm enjoying things.\n\nC\nMan: Who took this?\n\nWoman: I can't remember. Hmmm ...\n\nMan: What am I doing?\n\nWoman: You're sitting on the sofa, watching TV and eating chocolates. Nothing changes!\n\nMan: Ha! Very funny. You look very young, though.\n\nWoman: I know. Look at my hair – it was so long!\n\nMan: Mine too, look at me! Hey … I think I know who took this photo.\n\nWoman: Umm … who? Was it Dad?\n\nMan: No, it wasn’t Dad or Mum. Do you remember Barry?\n\nWoman: No.\n\nMan: Yes, YES! You do remember. Barry, your boyfriend at high school. You were seventeen and he was sixteen and he was so very polite: 'Hello, I'm Barry. It's very nice to meet you ...'\n\nWoman: Stop it! He was nice.\n\nMan: Yeah, well, he took the photo.\n\nD\nWoman: Let's see. OK. I'm glad we could talk about this. It's not easy to say.\n\nMan: What?\n\nWoman: Well, you're not in our group – for the class project.\n\nMan: What do you mean? You know I'm always in a group with you.\n\nWoman: I know. It's just that this time … this time we made the group differently and because you were late ...\n\nMan: I see. You don't want me in the group?\n\nWoman: No, no. It isn't that. It's that we've already made the group, see? There's four of us already.\n\nMan: So? We can't be a group of five?\n\nWoman: Well, the teacher said four people per group.\n\nMan: Oh.\n\nWoman: It's not about you or your work or anything like that. It's ... errrr ... well, we already have the group.\n\nMan: So I have to find another group.\n\nWoman: I'm sorry.",

Not the 19th, not the 28th, not two days later because your dog was ill or your computer broke – the 18th. If it's late, I won't mark it. I won't even read it – you'll fail the assignment! So, please hand it in on time. You can even hand it in early, if you like!\n\nYou can email me the essays at j.hartshorn@lmu.ac.uk. That's H-A-R-T-S-H-O-R-N. I'll reply to say I've got it. If I don't reply within a day, it might mean I didn't get it, so please email me again to make sure. You can also bring a paper copy of the essay to my office, but let's be kind to the trees, OK? Email is better for the trees and for me.\n\nDon't forget that you must reference every idea or quote you use that isn't your own idea. And the last page of your essay should be a list of all the books you used, in alphabetical order, not in the order you used them!\n\nAnd lastly, make it easy for me to read! That means use a clear font. Arial is best, but Times New Roman is fine too. Not Comic Sans please! Size 12 font for the essay, and size 14 for the titles and subheadings. And use page numbers.

You talked about Fibonacci numbers in the lecture. Sorry, I don't understand. Can you explain?\n\nProfessor: Of course. What do you want to know?\n\nStudent: OK … I hope this isn't a silly question, but what does Fibonacci actually mean?\n\nProfessor: No question is ever silly – it's always good to ask. OK, it's the name of a person. Fibonacci was a European mathematician in the Middle Ages.\n\nStudent: Ah, OK. Thanks. So, we know he was a person, but what are the Fibonacci numbers? I don't get it.\n\nProfessor: The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers. They go 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on. Do you see the sequence? Do you see how it works?\n\nStudent: I'm not sure.\n\nProfessor: OK. This is how it works. The first number is 1, then 1 again, then 2. The third number is the first number plus the second number. The fourth number is the second number plus the third number: 1 plus 2 is 3. The fifth number is the third number, 2, plus the fourth number, 3. So the fifth number in a Fibonacci sequence is 5.\n\nStudent: Ah! I think I understand now. But what about their importance? You said these were very important.\n\nProfessor: Yes, let me explain. This sequence of numbers is important because we see it in many things. Fibonacci numbers are common in geometry, they are common in nature, for example in plants. We see the sequence everywhere.\n\nStudent: Could you give us some more examples?\n\nProfessor: OK ... well, we don't have time right now but I can bring more examples in for next class, OK?",

I don't use coupons. I buy anything I see. So, when I shop, I don't look at prices. I just see the food or the thing and I get it and I buy it and I pay for it. And, then it's sometimes very expensive. So, I just waste money. I don't budget. I need to budget my money but I don't budget my money. What about you? Are you good at saving money?\n\nAbidemi: I don't think I'm too bad at saving money. I look at prices a lot. I also buy a lot of things on sale. So, I'm able to save some money.\n\nTodd: So, you look for discounts.\n\nAbidemi: Yes, I do.\n\nTodd: Do you use coupons or special offers?\n\nAbidemi: No, I don't, but if I see some I will use them.\n\nTodd: So, do you waste money on anything? Like, maybe eating out, buying clothes, renting movies?\n\nAbidemi: I waste money on buying clothes.\n\nTodd: Oh, okay!\n\nAbidemi: But, I save a little bit because I buy them on sale.\n\nTodd: Ah, do you buy things online?\n\nAbidemi: No, I don't. I usually go into the stores to shop.\n\nTodd: I'm good with clothes too. So, I don't spend much money on clothes. I only shop maybe once a year. Or, I only shop if I need something, like it's really cold and I need a jacket.\n\nAbidemi: I see.\n\nTodd: And, I'm really bad, so I often only wear clothes people give to me.\n\nAbidemi: That's good!\n\nTodd: Yeah, so I get shirts or ties for Christmas gifts or a birthday gift, and I do that. My mom often asks ... every year, my mom asks, \"What do you want for Christmas?\", \"What do you want for your birthday?\"\n\nAnd I'll say, \"Underwear and socks\" or \"Socks and T-shirts\". And so, she buys them for me and then I don't have to buy them.\n\nAbidemi: Wow. Sounds like you're an easy person to give a present to.\n\nTodd: Yes, for clothes. Yes, for clothes. But, I waste money on computers and electronics and those things are expensive. So, I buy a new computer every year. I have four computers now in my house.\n\nAbidemi: Wow.\n\nTodd: I have five mobile phones.\n\nAbidemi: Wow.\n\nTodd: I have an iPad. I have lots of electronic equipment. So, I spend so much money on those things.\n\nAbidemi: I waste money on traveling.\n\nTodd: Ah, yeah.\n\nAbidemi: Every year, I take about one or two trips to different countries. So, that's where a lot of my money go.\n\nTodd: Yeah, traveling is expensive.\n\nAbidemi: Yes, yes.\n\nTodd: But, when you travel, do you save money? Do you stay at cheap hotels? Or, do you buy cheap plane tickets?\n\nAbidemi: I try to. I try to all the time. But, usually the plane ticket is so expensive that a lot of my savings is already gone.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I know. I buy my tickets online, usually with Expedia. And, it's cheap. It's pretty cheap. I waste money on food. I eat out almost every day.\n\nAbidemi: Wow.\n\nTodd: Or, I buy my dinner at the supermarket almost every day. Do you waste money on food?\n\nAbidemi: No, I don't. I usually get bored if I eat out too much, because even though I am not a very good cook, there are some thing that I cook that I like to eat. So, I would miss those things. So, no, I don't waste money on eating out.\n\nTodd: Ah, that's interesting. So, you save money, I waste money. You have to teach me your tricks. You have to teach me your tips on saving money.\n\nAbidemi: Please teach me how to get cheap travel tickets.\n\nTodd: It's a deal.\n\nAbidemi: Thanks.",

Why?\n\nTodd: Well, she watches what she eats and she's very careful about the food she eats. So she doesn't eat meat, she doesn't eat fast food. She doesn't eat sugar. She doesn't drink coffee. So because she doesn't eat or drink all these foods, it's kind of hard if we go out to dinner or if I want to eat something because then I feel guilty.\n\nMeg: Do you also not eat those foods?\n\nTodd: No. Are you kidding? I mean, I always eat fast food and I love to eat sweets and stuff like that. So we both love exercise, right. So she exercises a lot. I exercise a lot. She exercises more than I do but yeah, the diet thing is kind of a hassle.\n\nMeg: Hmm.\n\nTodd: So what do you think I should do?\n\nMeg: Maybe you should also try to be healthy because it sounds like a good idea.\n\nTodd: Yeah, maybe. I'll give it a try. But the thing is, you know, she – there's one other problem. She eats five small meals a day, so never eats big meals. So we can't go to a restaurant and stuff like that. So it's just really hard to adjust. I mean, I love a big breakfast, you know. She never eats a big breakfast. She always eats these small little meals, so yeah.\n\nMeg: Well maybe, you can cook at home together.\n\nTodd: Maybe. Or maybe I should just get a new girlfriend.\n\nMeg: Maybe. Good luck.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Sarah, we have the holidays coming up. Are you going to do anything exciting?\n\nSarah: No, nothing exciting. I will just stay home most of the vacation, but there are a few things I'll do. I will bake a cake for Christmas. I will sing lots of Christmas songs with my children. We will sing together and video it. I want to send a video of us singing to grandparents. So we will sing Christmas songs, and we will videotape it. Then, we can send it to our grandparents. I think they will really like it.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's nice. So, will you have a big Christmas dinner?\n\nSarah: Yes, we have some things that we always eat. We'll have ham, and we'll have potatoes and cake, and my favorite thing is to cook fudge. I'll cook the fudge probably tomorrow night, and then we won't eat it until Christmas.\n\nTodd: Okay, oh cool.\n\nSarah: And it's really, it's really hard not to eat it, because it's so delicious, and everyone loves it. Every day, the children will ask me, \"Oh, can we eat it? Can we eat it?\" \"No, no, no, you can't eat it.\" We'll wait 'til Christmas to eat the fudge.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's good. I, I couldn't do that.\n\nSarah: What we won't do is, I won't do any work, and I won't do any chores like clean the house or do laundry. Those can wait until after Christmas, so I won't be working hard. I just want to relax. Todd, how 'bout you? What will you do?\n\nTodd: Well, I will get away. I don't like the cold, so I will go to Thailand, and I will stay there and just work actually.\n\nSarah: Oh.\n\nTodd: I will do stuff for Elllo. I will work on a book, a new book for Elllo, and I will just take it easy. I won't travel. I won't go to the beach. I won't go to the mountains. I won't do any of the touristy stuff. I will just take it easy, relax every day, and do what I call a workcation.\n\nSarah: Wow, what will the weather be like?\n\nTodd: Well, it's the best time of year in Thailand, so it's quite warm in December and January. It should be about, I don't know, 70, 80 degrees, 25 degrees Celsius., so it will be nice every day. It should be.\n\nSarah: Ah. Will you do anything special on Christmas Day?\n\nTodd: I won't. You know, usually, when I travel, I forget it's Christmas even sometimes. Obviously, I will see the decorations in the malls and things like that. But, I won't do anything on Christmas Day. They don't celebrate Christmas in Thailand. It's a Buddhist country, so it's a normal work day. Everybody will be going to work. All the shops will be open. It won't be different than any other day, so that will be nice.\n\nSarah: I see.\n\nTodd: So, I will be able to work like a normal day. I will probably call family and friends, and I will check Facebook and see what people are doing. But, I won't have a traditional Christmas.\n\nSarah: How about New Year's? Will they do anything special for New Year's?\n\nTodd: Yeah, in Bangkok, it gets really crazy on New Year's. But, even then, on New Year's, I probably won't do anything. I'm 49, so I've seen many, many New Year's. I'll probably just go out for a bit, and I'll probably be back home before midnight, actually. I won't do anything crazy. How 'bout you? What will you do for New Year's?\n\nSarah: Well, I have three kids, so my husband and I will probably stay home too. We like to have some fun. My husband bought crab, so we will eat crab for New Year's. I love champagne, so I'll have some champagne. We'll probably have a big, delicious dinner, and I'll drink some champagne. The kids will probably go to sleep at 10:00. Then, a little after midnight, I'll go to sleep too, so nothing exciting.\n\nTodd: Yeah, so, yeah, it sounds like we have pretty tame plans.\n\nSarah: Definitely.\n\nTodd: But, at least, I will be warm.\n\nSarah: Yes.",

I really want to take - you know - a rest, and then I'm going to have lunch with my family cause I haven't seen them for awhile, and then in the afternoon, there's this movie I really want to see, so I'm going to the cinema with my friends.\n\nPart 2: Hana talks about her plans.\n\nDaniel: Hey, Hana how are you?\n\nHana: I'm fine thank you.

        "transcript": "Winter Vacation\nAkane and Howard talk about their winter vacations.\n\nAkane's Vacation\nLast year, I went to Portugal just after Christmas. And I stayed there until… well, just after New Year's this year. In Portugal, I met up with one of my friends from Toronto. He had family that lived in Portugal, because his family was originally from Portugal.\n\nSo, they were kind enough to let me stay with them. I didn’t know any Portuguese, except for some simple words like “hello”, and “thank you”. I learned some simple words through an audio CD, before I went there. And the people that I stayed with didn’t know very much English either. However, we got along surprisingly well.\n\nThey were surprised that I was able to eat some of their exotic foods. They made some delicious meals every single day, like octopus, tripe and rabbit. It is quite exotic, but I thought it was quite good. They also made some excellent desserts, like crème caramel, and a rich sponge cake that they call Paon d’lo.\n\nHoward's Vacation\nOK, now I'll talk about my winter vacation. This winter vacation I spent two weeks in my hometown which is Daytona Beach, Florida. It was wonderful. The weather was warm every day. It was sunny every day and the temperature was almost 80 degrees.\n\nI visited my mother and I spent every morning having a nice leisurely cup of coffee and reading the newspaper and after that I got my bicycle out and and rode down to the beach and enjoyed the sun and the surf, and came back home and read a book and went to bed early.\n\nI had a wonderful time. I saw a couple of new movies, when I was home in Florida. I saw The Aviator and also an interesting movie called Spanglish, which I hope you all can see because it's an interesting movie about English and the Spanish.",

No, my dad is from San Francisco.\n\nAimee: So, your dad is from San Francisco and your mom is from Los Angeles.\n\nTodd: Yes, that's right.\n\nAimee: Okay, so which city is better?\n\nTodd: Ooh, wow. They both are great American cities. They are very, very different. I think San Francisco is better but I think people in LA think LA is better. So it's tough. Yeah.\n\nAimee: So, is LA bigger than San Francisco?\n\nTodd: Yes, it is much, much much bigger. LA is huge. It is about 10 million people, maybe more.\n\nAimee: That is huge.\n\nTodd: Yeah. San Francisco is only one million people.\n\nAimee: Oh, that's tiny.\n\nTodd: Yeah, it's much smaller than LA.\n\nAimee: Okay.\n\nTodd: Yeah, much smaller.\n\nAimee: Okay. And is LA more expensive than San Francisco.\n\nTodd: I don't think so. LA is expensive but San Francisco is more expensive. San Francisco is maybe the most expensive city in the US. Because of Google, Yahoo, Apple, all these famous companies.\n\nAimee: Yes, they are big companies.\n\nTodd: So it's big, there's many rich companies there and the space is very small so it's expensive.\n\nAimee: Right, okay. And so about the weather? Is LA warmer than San Francisco?\n\nTodd: Yeah, it's much warmer. It's much, much warmer. LA has beautiful weather so most days it's warm, no clouds, maybe 25 degrees Celsius.\n\nAimee: That sound so nice.\n\nTodd: Or above. Beautiful. San Francisco is much colder and it's much wetter. It rains a lot in San Francisco.\n\nAimee: I know that. What about the looks? Is LA prettier than San Francisco?\n\nTodd: No, not at all.\n\nAimee: No?\n\nTodd: No, not at all. San Francisco is much prettier. LA is pretty but San Francisco much prettier. It's near the sea, it's near nature. It has lots of beautiful buildings downtown. I think San Francisco is prettier but maybe people in Los Angeles think LA is prettier but I don't think so.\n\nAimee: Okay. You disagree with them.\n\nTodd: I do disagree.\n\nAimee: So how are those people? Are the people nicer in LA?\n\nTodd: I don't think so. I think the people in San Francisco are friendlier. People in Los Angeles are a little reserved. They are not as friendly.\n\nAimee: There are more people really.\n\nTodd: There are, it is true. It's a big city. I think people are nicer and more easy going in San Francisco.\n\nAimee: Okay. So now that we have talked about it, is LA better than San Francisco?\n\nTodd: No. No. I think, yeah, somebody from LA will disagree but I will say this, Los Angeles is maybe more exciting and is more interesting than San Francisco. There's lots to do there. It has the beach and it has lots of cool places like Disneyland. So LA is a really great place.\n\nAimee: LA has hills for hiking too, doesn't it?\n\nTodd: A little bit, not close. Actually San Francisco is closer to nature and hiking.\n\nAimee: Is it?\n\nTodd: Yeah.\n\nAimee: Okay, I didn't know that.\n\nTodd: So, you can choose on my description which city sounds more interesting.\n\nAimee: I want to go to both but I think I would prefer to go San Francisco.\n\nTodd: Yay. We need more people. No actually we don't need more people.",

Yeah, I was born there and I lived in the city for many years.\n\nSarah: Cool. What is the most interesting thing about your city?\n\nTodd: Well, San Francisco has many interesting things, but the most interesting thing is probably the architecture. There’s lots of very unique buildings. And the most unique building is probably the Trans-America building. It’s a building like a pyramid. It’s nice.\n\nSarah: Well, that’s really cool.\n\nTodd: Uh-hmm.\n\nSarah: What is the most expensive area in San Francisco?\n\nTodd: Well, it is very, very expensive. The most expensive area is a place called Pacific Heights, and it’s on the highest hill in San Francisco and it overlooks the Bay. It’s a really, really beautiful place.\n\nSarah: Hmm.\n\nTodd: That area by far has the best views of the city.\n\nSarah: Hmm, what is the most beautiful place in San Francisco?\n\nTodd: Well, actually the most beautiful place is outside the city. It’s a place called Muir Woods. And it has the tallest trees in the world, and some of these trees are really old. They are the oldest trees in North America. Some of them are over 2,000 years old.\n\nSarah: Wow. It sounds like some place I would like to see. So it sounds really expensive. Where is the cheapest place to live?\n\nTodd: The cheapest place to live is a place called Sunset. And Sunset is on the west side, and the houses are kind of old and they’re a little bit cheap. But one thing about Sunset is it has nicest view of the ocean, and you could watch the sunset every night. That’s why it’s called the Sunset area.\n\nSarah: Hmm. If I wanted to go there, when is the best time to visit?\n\nTodd: Well, the best time is probably in the fall because that’s when the weather is the nicest. It’s not too cold, and it’s not too hot. And it doesn’t rain that much.\n\nSarah: So when would be the worst time to visit?\n\nTodd: The worst time to visit would be probably February and March, because February and March are the coldest and wettest months. So – well, March isn’t that cold but sometimes it’s wet, so it rains a lot.\n\nSarah: Wow. That sounds really great. I want to go there.\n\nTodd: Yeah, you should. It’s great place.",

        "transcript": "Sarah: John, I've never met your family. Do you have a big family?\n\nJohn: Yeah, kind of. There are five people in my family, so it's a medium family. I have two brothers, so there are three boys in my family. And there's my mother and my father.\n\nSarah: How about your father? Do you look like him?\n\nJohn: Yes, I do. I do look like my father. When he was younger. He had blond hair like me and he has glasses. So do I. My mother has glasses, too. I'm the same height as my father. We are both 180 centimeters tall. My older brother is the same height as me and my father. But my younger brother is shorter than us.\n\nSarah: Ah.\n\nJohn: He has blond hair and glasses too, though.\n\nSarah: Oh. How tall is your younger brother?\n\nJohn: He's a bit shorter than us. I am not sure but I think he's around 170 centimeters tall.\n\nSarah: Oh. How about your mom?\n\nJohn: My mom is short, too. She's the same height as my younger brother.\n\nSarah: Oh.\n\nJohn: And my mom has red hair. Her hair is bright red, so my mother has different hair from the rest of my family. There are four people with blond people with blond hair and one person with red hair. But actually, all five of us wear glasses.\n\nSarah: Oh really?\n\nJohn: Yeah.\n\nSarah: So John, you're thin. What about the rest of your family? Are they thin, too?\n\nJohn: Well, my mother is skinny, too, like me. But my brothers are more like my dad in their body type. They are a little bit more muscular than me. They have big muscles and they're very strong. So they are heavier than me. That's my father. He weighs more than I do. And my brothers are also heavier than me.\n\nSarah: Oh, sounds like a good-looking family.\n\nJohn: Thank you.\n\nSarah: So John, you told me about me about your family's appearance. What about their personality?\n\nJohn: Well, all five people in my family have different personalities.\n\nYeah. My younger brother is really fun. It's great to spend time with him. For example, we usually play video games together. He likes to play racing games or sports games, and also, we play card games or just watching TV. He's so funny.\n\nNo matter what we're doing, he tells jokes and I love listening to him tell jokes about whatever we're doing at the time. And he's so cheerful and bright. He's always open to new people and new ideas. So I really like spending time with him. He makes me feel cheerful, too when we talk together.\n\nSarah: That's great. How about your older brother?\n\nJohn: Well, my older brother, he's a really good guy. He's not so entertaining like my younger brother but he's very smart. He's really serious. He likes to study and read. For example, he likes reading the Greek philosophers. He likes reading about Plato and Socrates. And he's always talking about philosophy. I like that stuff, too. I think it's interesting but he's not very funny.\n\nSarah: I see. How about your dad?\n\nJohn: My dad. Let's see, what can I say about my dad's personality? He's a hard worker. He's very devoted to everything he tries. He was raised on a farm so he knows a lot about animals. And now, he has a farm as a hobby. My dad raises horses and chickens. He loves animals and he has so many animals but he doesn't think of them as farm animals, they're his pets and he loves them.\n\nHe spends everyday outside where no matter what the weather, because he has to take care of his family, which is all of his animals. And he's a really smart guy. Maybe a bit serious at times. His sense of humor is maybe like you can imagine from an old man.\n\nSarah: I see. How about your mother? What's she like?\n\nJohn: My mother loves to read horror novels.\n\nSarah: Really?\n\nJohn: Yeah, horror books. So she knows a lot of stuff about crime or mysteries or police dramas and lawyers. She loves that stuff. So my mother is very interested in those kind of books and movies and TV shows, too. So she's kind of like a detective. My mother is very smart and enjoys solving puzzles.\n\nSarah: Wow. It sounds like an interesting family.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Meg, we are talking about clothes, and you always look nice at work. You have a very nice fashion sense.\n\nMeg: Oh, thank you.\n\nTodd: So you must go shopping a lot.\n\nMeg: I do go shopping sometimes. It's fun to go shopping and buy new clothes especially when it's a new season.\n\nTodd: Like what do you like to wear per season? For example, what do you like to wear in winter?\n\nMeg: In the winter, it's pretty cold, so I like to wear sweaters. Sometimes, a t-shirt with a sweater over it to stay warm. Lots of long-sleeve shirts. I like to wear long-sleeve shirts, and I still wear skirts in the winter, so sometimes, I wear tights underneath the skirts to stay warm.\n\nTodd: What about dresses? Do you like to wear dresses?\n\nMeg: I do like to wear dresses. In the winter, it's a good time actually to wear sweater-dresses. They're warm and a dress, so it's nice for work.\n\nTodd: Sweater-dresses.\n\nMeg: Have you seen a sweater-dress before?\n\nTodd: I have no idea what a sweater-dress is. What is a sweater-dress?\n\nMeg: It's a dress but made of sweater material.\n\nTodd: Ah.\n\nMeg: So sweater-cloth made into a dress. So it's very warm.\n\nTodd: Okay. I was picturing a sweater with a skirt attached to it.\n\nMeg: [Laughs] You might find that, but I think a sweater-dress is a little different.\n\nTodd: Okay. What about… What about in the summer?\n\nMeg: In the summer, I love to wear flip-flops. It's my favorite thing to wear. So I often wear flip-flops with jeans or shorts, skirts again. I don't wear tights in the summer because it's too hot.\n\nTodd: Right. Do you wear flip-flops to work?\n\nMeg: I can't wear flip-flops to work. So when I go to work, I often wear high heels or flats, some dress shoes.\n\nTodd: Okay. So do you like to wear shorts or skirts. Which do you prefer?\n\nMeg: I prefer shorts because it's more comfortable and easy to move around. But I also can't wear shorts to work. So I have many summer skirts for work.\n\nTodd: Okay. Now, let's talk about shoes. So women often have many types of shoes, high heels, boots, flats, like you just said, sneakers. So what kind of shoes besides flip-flops do you like to wear?\n\nMeg: I do have many pairs of shoes and so I like to wear flats and sandals especially in the summer. In the winter, I like to wear boots and rain shoes when it rains or rain boots. When I'm exercising, I like to wear sneakers or tennis shoes because it's good for your feet.\n\nTodd: Oh right. Now you travel a lot, we both travel a lot. What shoes do you usually take when you travel?\n\nMeg: When I travel, I usually take flats because they're easy to remove at the airport and they're light and convenient for traveling.\n\nTodd: Oh, right.\n\nMeg: What shoes do you usually use?\n\nTodd: Just my sneakers. So my sneakers I wear everywhere. Now, women sometimes have accessories, you know, like earrings, necklaces, scarves, things like that. What do you like to wear?\n\nMeg: I like to wear necklaces especially long necklaces. I don't like necklaces that are too short. It feels uncomfortable. I don't like to wear bracelets or a watch because I don't like anything on my wrist, but I do love to wear rings. I usually wear one ring each hand, just for fashion, not for anything special.\n\nTodd: Oh that's nice. Cool. Well anyway, thanks, Meg.\n\nMeg: Thank you.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Sarah, what are your plans for the weekend?\n\nSarah: I have really fun plans this weekend. On Saturday I'm meeting some friends, and we're going to hike up a nearby mountain. It's called Mount Tsurumi, and I think it'll be really fun.\n\nTodd: Oh, cool. How are you getting up the mountain? How are you getting up to the hiking point?\n\nSarah: We're going to take the bus probably. So we'll take a bus until the base of the mountain, and then we can hike to the top. We'll hike about four or five hours, depending on how much time I spend resting, which is a lot.\n\nTodd: So, who is going with you?\n\nSarah: I'm meeting three friends, and they're all English teachers like me. My friend's names are Hannah, Ben, and Michael.\n\nTodd: Oh, nice. I'm sorry, where are you hiking again?\n\nSarah: We're hiking at the mountain called Mount Tsurumi. It's pretty close to my house, it's not far. So, I can see it from my window, my bedroom window, and I always think, \"Oh, I would love to go to the top of that mountain.\" I'm really happy on Saturday to go and hike the mountain. Then, after we reach the top, we take the cable car down the mountain.\n\nTodd: Oh, I see. So you're hiking up the mountain, and then you're taking the cable car down?\n\nSarah: Yes. It'll probably be six hours in total between hiking, and resting, and cable car back down.\n\nTodd: Oh, wow. What time are you starting?\n\nSarah: We're starting at 10 O'Clock. We're starting at 10 O'Clock so that we can finish at 4 O'Clock and I can still get my children from school. Their school finishes at 5 O'Clock.\n\nTodd: Oh, wow. So you're really pushing it.\n\nSarah: Yeah. The timing will be tight, but I think it'll be okay.\n\nTodd: Cool.\n\nSarah: How about you Todd, what are you doing on Saturday?\n\nTodd: This weekend I'm not really doing anything. I think I'm just going to stay home, so I'm leaving for Thailand on Thursday. I'm flying out of [inaudible 00:02:19].\n\nSarah: That sounds really nice.\n\nTodd: Yeah. But actually now that I think of it, I am doing something on Saturday. My friend is having a dinner party, so I'm planning on attending that. That should be fun.\n\nSarah: Oh, that sounds fun. What time does it start?\n\nTodd: I think it starts at about 8. So, most people will probably be there around 8 O'Clock. I'm not planning on staying that long, so I'm just going to go and make a short appearance and then come back.\n\nTodd: Now, we are teachers, so we have grading to do. Are you doing any work this weekend, are you grading any papers?\n\nSarah: Yes. I'm grading some papers. My students are handing in their papers tomorrow, and then I'm grading them all day Sunday.\n\nTodd: Yikes.\n\nSarah: Yeah, so it won't be exciting, but I think if I work hard, I should be able to finish them.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I'm in the same boat actually, I have lots of papers to grade. And I want them finished, so I think I will do it on Friday night. I'm planning on staying late Friday and just doing it then.\n\nSarah: Okay.\n\nTodd: I'm not looking forward to it.\n\nSarah: So you'll be grading all night on Friday?\n\nTodd: I'll be grading all night on Friday, I won't be doing anything fun. But, I'll be leaving on Sunday, so it'll be worth it.\n\nSarah: Okay, have fun, have a good trip.\n\nTodd: You too, enjoy the hike.\n\nSarah: Thanks.",

How about you?\n\nDaniel: Well, I don’t really cook that often. I’m really busy during the week. So, I always just get something at the shop and get that. But, during the weekends, I always cook during the weekends because I really like making food. That’s what I do.\n\nHana: So, do you ever eat out?\n\nDaniel: Only occasionally, because I’m really busy during the week, and I prefer cooking, so not really often. I don’t go out really often to eat. Whenever I’m tired, and I don’t have time to cook during the week, I go and eat out with a friend, so! And you?\n\nHana: Well, I always , so I normally go and eat out during the weekend with my friends or family.\n\nDaniel: So do you ever buy take-away?\n\nHana: No, I never. Normally when I go out to eat, I like to sit and enjoy my food. How about you?\n\nDaniel: Well, that's really nice. Of course, I do like to sit and enjoy my food, but I have to admit that occasionally I have to buy take-away, especially when I'm coming late from work, and I'm driving. I'm so hungry that, most of the time, I don't really make it home, so I have to buy something on my way, and that's a shame, so that's the way it is.\n\nAnd do you usually have people over for dinner?\n\nHana: Yes, I sometimes do. I really like cooking so occasionally I invite my friends over and cook for them or we all cook together. How about you?\n\nDaniel: Not really. I do love cooking, but the problem is my place is really small, so even though I want to invite my friends. I never do it, because my place would only fit one or two people. So unfortunately, I never have my friends over for dinner.",

So I want to buy some computer stuff. Is there a computer store?\n\nKatie: There are two computer stores.\n\nTodd: Really? Ooh, that's good.\n\nKatie: There's a computer store on the first floor, and then very close to that there's also a Mac store.\n\nTodd: Ooh, that's perfect. I want to buy a new Mac.\n\nKatie: Oh, me too.\n\nTodd: They're so expensive, though.\n\nKatie: Mm-hmm.\n\nTodd: Okay, what about books? I really like books. Is there a bookstore with English books?\n\nKatie: There's a huge bookstore on the fourth floor.\n\nTodd: Ooh, that's good.\n\nKatie: It's really big. And there are lots of English books you can read there.\n\nTodd: Oh, great. Nice. And how about the food there?\n\nKatie: The food's okay. There's a big food court on the third floor, and you can get a variety of food. You can get a Subway.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's good. I love sandwiches. Is the food good there, though?\n\nKatie: They don't have any sandwiches that I like, basically.\n\nTodd: Oh, really. Okay. So what else is there at the mall?\n\nKatie: Oh, there's so much at the mall. There's a café on the ground floor.\n\nTodd: Oh, nice.\n\nKatie: If you like drinking coffee.\n\nTodd: I do. I like to go and study and just relax.\n\nKatie: That's the perfect place for you, then.\n\nTodd: I like to people watch.Yeah, that sounds good. Maybe we can watch a movie.\n\nKatie: Oh, it's a great people-watching place.\n\nTodd: Oh, cool.\n\nKatie: The windows are really big, and you can see out onto the street.\n\nTodd: Oh, cool. What else is there? Is there a movie theater?\n\nKatie: Mm-hmm. There's a movie theater on the fourth floor.\n\nTodd: Oh, great. Now, do they have English movies?\n\nKatie: They have English and Japanese movies.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's good. I should watch some Japanese movies too.\n\nKatie: They're interesting.\n\nTodd: And how about food? I hear there's a new supermarket, a big supermarket there.\n\nKatie: It's pretty big. And you can get lots of food there. It's on the first floor.\n\nTodd: Okay. Is there anything else I should see?\n\nKatie: What about the roof garden?\n\nTodd: Oh, what is the roof garden?\n\nKatie: It's on the fifth floor, and it's, well it's on the roof, and you can see a beautiful view of the city. And there's also places for you to sit and just enjoy the view.\n\nTodd: Oh, nice. A roof garden, I like that.\n\nKatie: It's really nice.\n\nTodd: Now, do you buy clothes at the mall? Do they have nice clothing shops?\n\nKatie: Yeah, they have nice clothing shops. Some of them are a little bit expensive.\n\nTodd: Ah, yeah.\n\nKatie: And I like buying cheap clothes.\n\nTodd: Okay. When's a good time to go?\n\nKatie: I think the best time to go is probably weekdays.\n\nTodd: Okay. Why?\n\nKatie: If you go on the weekend, there are so many children there.\n\nTodd: Oh.\n\nKatie: Ugh. It's hard to walk around.\n\nTodd: Yeah, and we're teachers, we teach kids all day.\n\nKatie: Mm-hmm.\n\nTodd: Okay. I don't want to go then.\n\nKatie: No, me neither.\n\nTodd: Well, I want to go there next week, maybe Thursday night.\n\nKatie: Okay.\n\nTodd: Do you want to join me?\n\nKatie: Yeah, that sounds good. Maybe we can watch a movie.\n\nTodd: Cool. I'll buy you dinner.\n\nKatie: Sounds great.",

I was born there. \n                        \nMy folks are British. My dad is from Manchester and my mom is from Scotland. They went out a long time ago. Yeah, growing up in Zimbabwe was \"lacker\" as we say there. That means really cool in Africans. \nIt was like you grow up in a big open free place with animals and sunshine and it's just a really healthy place to be. Well at least it was. Today it's not doing too well because the economy has crashed but growing up there was really slick. \nTodd: Wow! What animals could you see?\nLeath: Just about an hours drive out of any city, you are able to come across just about anything. I've seen leopards often at night about an hour out of the capital where I live. You see monkeys along the road, right up to the city outskirts. In certain areas you'll have to stop for elephants. There's quite a few buck warning signs because they are actully quite dangerous at night. They jump across the road and your cars hit them at windscreen height. It is a bit of a problem. So, there's buck everywhere. Away from residential areas, there's you know your big five, rhino, lion being the most... well interesting and I guess for foreigners. They are never really never around human settlement cause they are very very dangerous. They do take people from time to time. \nTodd: Wow! That's fascinating.

Why did you get it?\n\t\t                Jason: I got the tattoo because I used to actually work as a tattooist, a long time ago but now I stopped that, so I can come traveling. I designed the tattoo myself. I drew it onto paper then I got my friend to actually tattoo it onto my body. I got a wolf really because I really love animals, and a wolf is my favorite animal.\n\t\t                Todd:So, you drew the tattoo.\n\t                    Jason: I drew the tattoo, yeah.\n\t                    Todd:Did it hurt when it was being sketched in your body?\n                        Jason: Yeah, it did hurt, but tattoos can vary in amounts of pain depending where on your body it was. The chest is probably the worst place, which is where my tattoo is, so it hurt.\n                        Todd:Why is the chest the worst place?\n                        Jason: Because there's not much meat there, kind of, because there is a lot of bone.

Why don't you talk about that for awhile.\n\t\t                Jason: OK, well, London is a little bit colder that Japan, it's a little bit more expensive as well, so it is kind of nice to come here and spend my money.\n\t\t                Todd: So actually, you said South London right? Is that where Wimbleton is? South London?\n\t                    Jason: Wimbleton, No! Wimbleton's in West London.\n\t                    Todd: West London!\n                        Jason: Yeah. South London isn't famous for much, really, apart from rude people like me.\n                        Todd: So what's the difference between South London and West London and North London?\n                        Jason: Yeah, there is a big difference between all the places in London. Everyone's got different accents. Everyone acts differently. England has a lot of different places. For example, in North England they'll have different accents, completely different accents, from South England and sometimes even different languages, like in Wales and Scotland, so.\n                        Todd: So your accent is South London.\n                        Jason: My accent is South London, yeah. Someone from North London would sound completely different from me, and West London and so on, so.\n                        Todd: So is South London the best place to live?\n                        Jason: Oh, yeah, of course. Actually, Central London would be but it is way too expensive, kind of like Tokyo.\n                        Todd: OK. Were you born in South London?\n                        Jason: Yeah, I was born in South London. Yeah. But, you know, I've been everywhere in England, so and believe me there's a lot of different places, everywhere is different, so .",

I'm gonna have about one week.\n\t\t                Jason: One week. What I suggest you do then is stay in the suburbs of London for a start, because it's a lot cheaper. If you stay in North London then you can spend all your money on rent.\n\t\t                 And I guess you should go around Central London. That's where all the tourist attractions are. That's where all the nightlife is. It's just got everything you need really, but like I said rent is way too expensive there, so.                              \n\t                    Todd: OK, now I was thinking of taking a day trip to Oxford or Cambridge or Bath. What would you recommend?\n\t                    Jason: It depends really. Bath has got a lot of history. I guess Oxford is a lot quieter, but again there is a lot of nightlife there as well. It really depends what you want to do, but Bath is good for history, definitely.\n                        Todd: OK. What about Cambridge?\n                        Jason: Cambridge I'm not too sure about. I haven't been there so.\n                        Todd: Oh, really. OK. If I want to go to Oxford or to Bath, how can I get there? Do I have to drive?\n                        Jason: The easiest way is to get a train. It can vary how much you wanna pay really. It's kind of similar to Japanese trains. But traveling as far as Cambridge and Bath would be quite expensive, maybe 30 pounds, which is quite a lot of money really, so.",

And what internet websites do you listen to?\n                        Kerri: Well, usually it is just AP news or whatever.\n                        Todd: OK. How much of the news do you think is true?\n                        Kerri: I don't know. That's a tough question. I think that because there're so many journalists that often what makes into the papers is fairly accurate, but unfortunately some people leak information that is untrue to sway public opinion, so you have to kind of weed through things and consider why that news story is made public.\nTodd: Yeah. How do most people in your country get the news?\n                        Kerri: I think most people in the states get the news from TV and from the main broadcasting stations. The evening news sort of thing.\n                        Todd: OK. Thanks Keri.",

There are about four million people who live in Wales. It's a bit like Japan. It's quite cold in the winter. Not much snow. But lots of sheep there. And the people are quite friendly. I suppose it is quite a poor area. Not many rich people. A lot of people are farmers. And a lot of people are miners. They coal. They mine for coal. But it is a very beautiul land. Lots of mountains. So I like it. The weather is cold. Even in summer it is not too hot. So if you do surfing or windsurfing, which I do, you have to be very very brave. Yeah, but please come and visit Wales.",

The first time I lost my wallet\n                                I was in a taxi cab going home late at night and\n                                my wallet slipped out of my pocket and I\n                                didn't notice. \nThe second time I lost my wallet I went to a\n                                night club with my friends and I drank too much\n                                and I wasn't paying attention and I left my wallet\n                                on the counter of the bar. The third time I lost\n                                my wallet, I was hiking in a mountain region in\n                                Japan and I went into a small convenience store on\n                                the way home and I bought an ice-cream and I left\n                                my wallet on the counter and forgot about it. The\n                                fourth time I lost my wallet, I was in Ueno\n                                station, a really, really busy station in Tokyo\n                                and I left my wallet on the counter at a\n                                supermarket, and the most amazing thing is that I still have the same wallet. \nIn each of these instances I got my\n                                wallet back. In two of the cases, the person at\n                                the store called me and I just had to go back to\n                                the store and get it. In one instance, the person\n                                that ran the convenient store in the\n                                mountains mailed me my wallet, and another time I\n                                had to go to the police station and pick it up, but I think that says a lot about Japanese people.\n                                They're very, very honest and sometimes I think\n                                maybe Japan is the only country in the world where\n                                you could lose your wallet four times and still\n                                get it back.",

        "transcript": "One of my earliest memories involves my granddad and his garden. He had a huge garden when I was growing up. It was, I mean, it was more of a field than a garden really it was so big. He had lots of fruit trees, like fruit bushes, like elder berries, black berries, raspberries. He had strawberries as well, gooseberries, so every berry you could think of. He also had, let me see, apple trees and cooking apple trees, and he had lots of vegetables too as well like rhubarb, onions and lettuce, anything you could think of. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      When I was a little girl I didn't really like vegetables all that much to be honest, but I did love helping him pick his strawberries when they came in the summer. Strawberries always taste better when they are warm and from the sun, and you can pick them and put them straight in your mouth, beautiful. One of my funniest memories, though, well when I look back on it now, it's funny, is of helping my granddad when he was planting his onions one year, so I was staying with him for awhile and he said, \"OK Marion today we're going to go and we're going to plant some onions,\" in the spring.                               \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      So I went out and I was only I think about 5 years old, but I wanted to help so both of us went out and we planted two rows of onions, so he planted one row and I planted the other, or he really planted most of them I think. But I tried to help anyway, even though I was quite small, so then we did our job that day and I didn't really think anymore of it, until the onions started to grow and then suddenly they were ready to be harvested, or whatever, to be picked from the ground, and you could see that the stalks were growing nice and tall. We were out in the garden one day, my granddad and I again so it must have been a good few months later, further towards autumn, and my granddad came over and showed me the onion stalks and he said, \"Look Marion! The ones you planted are way bigger than the ones that I planted.\"                               \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      And I was so happy with myself. So happy that the job that I had done was better than even my granddad, who was a great gardener and now when I look back I realize, you know that wasn't really the case. That he was just saying it to make me feel better, and to make me proud of the work I'd done with him, but at the time it really worked. I was really, really so proud to have helped my granddad, the gardener, and to have done a better job than he did. I still wouldn't eat the onions though.",

Be strong and brave about it. So they were approaching the graveyard and suddenly my granddad saw what he thought was a priest sitting on the wall. So he say a man dressed in black, with a white collar, and he was so frightened, I mean, I can't imagine what he must have said at the time, but he and his friend were really, really scared, and they were talking between themselves, \"Oh, my God! What should we do? What should we do?\" but they were so frightened they couldn't move. So eventually, my granddad decided, OK, I'm just going to run for it. I'm going to make a run for it. So all of a sudden, he decided and he just ran straight past the graveyard, and then suddenly, this big dog came jumping down from the wall of the graveyard, and my granddad was so scared, he was like screaming, and everything, but as it turned out it was just a sheep dog that he'd seen so in the dark of night, in those days of no road lights and street lights or anything what he'd actually seen with his friend was a black sheep dog with a white collar, so not a ghost after all.",

Me, too. How much does it cost to send a postcard in Hong Kong overseas?\n\t\t\t\t\t          Laura: Well, to Asian countries, it costs about two dollars, two Hong Kong dollars. To European countries it costs about three dollars.\n\t\t\t\t\t          Todd: OK, and when you send mail in Hong Kong, do you send it from your house, or do you..\n\t\t\t\t              Laura: Well, we have to go the post office in order to send letters or parcels.\n\t\t\t\t              Todd: Really, OK!

Well, because it's so convenient to use the e-mails or instant communication or telephone.\n\t\t                      Todd: Yeah, OK last question. What time do post offices open and close?\n\t                          Laura: Well, it depends on the size of the post office. For large one, so, they work longer.

It's very good stuff, and I've got one recipe that comes to mind that has to do with chicken and rice. You can take several pieces of chicken and boil them in water with some salt until the chicken is cooked. You take out the pieces and with a couple of forks, shred the meat. In a pan you put garlic, onions, olive oil, and tomatoes. Fry that up. Put the chicken on top and then put a puree of tomatoes on top of that and just saute that for awhile and you can put it over white rice and you'll have yourself a nice meal \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      Todd: Wow, that sounds pretty good.\n\t\t\t\t\t          Alexandra:  Yeah, it's very good, and for change you can always add green peppers, red peppers and make it very colorful, and serve it with some white plantains and a little Cuban drink and you are good to go.\n\t\t\t\t\t          Todd: Alright, thanks.

So what do you do during those two hours.\n\t                    Kate: So we go to the gym for about an hour and then have a swim for half an hour and then sauna for about ten minutes and then finish off with a massage.\n\t                    Jessica: Really, a massaging chair?\n                        Kate: A massaging chair!\n                        Jessica: Wonderful, and so who do you go with? \n                        Kate: I go with Nicola.\n                        Jessica: And Nicola is? \n                        Kate: She's another teacher and she's who I live with, so.\n                        Jessica: Alright, good, good, good, good.

What's the biggest difference?\n                        Kate: They have games on the machines so if you're cycling, you're also playing a game where you have to blow up the other cyclists so it makes it a bit more interesting than just exercising.\n                        Jessica: Uh-huh! So it passes the time by. Yeah, lot quicker. And then why are you exercising? Do you have a certain reason, a goal in mind?\n                        Kate: Yeah, because I put on a lot of weight when I was in Australia because I was eating too much pizza and, good breakfast, and drinking far too much beer.\n                        Jessica: So you just want to shed those extra pounds.\n                        Kate: Yeah, that I put on and get back to the original weight that I was.\n                        Jessica: Well, good luck to you.\n                        Kate: Thank you.",

I got married in my wife's parents backyard. They have a really beautiful backyard, with a pool and it's nicely landscaped, with lots of nice flowers and bushes and trees. It was a kind of a small wedding we only had about 30 to 50 people there, all close friends of the family, and a few family members who I hadn't seen in a few years who were able to make it, but it was a pretty small affair and we had the food catered, some seafood and some meat, steak, type items, and it was a beautiful outdoor wedding. \n\t\t                  The actual ceremony only lasted about 15, 20 minutes. I cried, when I was supposed to like, deliver my lines. I cried and everyone told me afterwards, they were like, \" I couldn't hear a word you were saying because you were crying, right!\" and I was trying not to talk loud cause the louder I got the louder my crying noises got, so I was like \"Ah, mmm, will you merry me?\", just real quiet. But other than that it went pretty smooth.",

The band trip we went to Florida, Disneyland actually. It was a lot of fun. Actually getting the money for the band trip, I had to fundraise a lot, and that was just a big humongous problem, cause, I don't know, the band organization was kind of disorganized, anyway, so the band trip, we went to Disneyland. It was a lot of fun, but we ended up playing frisbee all the time because we had nothing better to do really, and to tell you the truth I like Disneyland, but it's kind of kiddish  to tell you the truth, um but it's a lot of fun. We actually, where did we march, Epcot. \n\t                      Todd: Oh, the Epcot Center.\n                          Alex: Yeah, we marched around the Epcot center an hour or a half or so. \n                          Todd: So how long was the trip down there?\n                          Alex: Oh, we actually, we flew so, it wasn't that long. A couple of hours at most. The funny part is, half the band isn't, they hadn't flown before the actual trip so everybody was kind of nervous. It was kind of funny, but yeah I made a lot of friends. It was very interesting. I mean I got made of, made fun of, excuse me, in school, because you know the whole marching band, band geek, whatever but it was a lot of fun. You make a lot of friends and you just get out there and do what you like and it's a lot of fun. \n                          Todd: Oh, that sounds like a fun trip.

There are some eggs, a carton of milk, some strawberry jam, some butter, some cheese, maybe some tofu, some green onions, carrots, some lettuce, and maybe some ice tea.\n\t                      Todd: OK, so do you follow a healthy diet?\n\t                      John: Ah, sometimes. I say about every other day I try to eat healthy and then on some days I just go donut and candy crazy.\n                          Todd: So donuts are your thing? You're really crazy about donuts. \n                          John: Yeah, baked goods, cakes, donuts, cheesecake, any kind of cake or sweet bread.\n                          Todd: Mm, actually you brought donuts today!\n                          John: Yeah, I was given donuts by a student so, yeah, I was glad there was other people to help me eat them so I didn't eat them all.\n                          Todd: That was very nice of your students. Um, do you prefer to cook at home or eat out?\n                          John: Um, usually I prefer to cook at home, just because there are a few dishes that my wife and I like to make and that we're pretty good at, and that we're real comfortable with, but if I'm real tired, if it's been a long day at work there's nothing better than just going to a restaurant and being served you food right away, not having to wait.\n                          Todd: So with your wife do you usually cook together or do you take turns cooking? Do you alternate?\nJohn: We usually take turns. When we first started dating we would cook together. We had a big kitchen, where she was living there was a big kitchen and there was room enough for both of us to move around, and we were still really comfortable with each other, and open and we always wanted to share ideas, but now we have a really small kitchen and there's really only room for one of us, and also too we're at the point in our relationship where I know that she makes fried chicken better than I do and she knows that I make chili better than she does so the other person should just get out of the kitchen, and let the one who's cooking, you know, do their job.",

My favorite thing though is pancakes and bacon for breakfast. I have no idea, but I just like it a lot. I also like chili. I make chili actually, and it's very spicy, but I like chili and cheesecake. I eat a lot of cereal, a lot, a lot of cereal. I'm addicted really.\n\t                      Todd: OK, like Sienfield? \n                          Alex: Yeah\n                          Todd: So you say you eat ramen? \n                          Alex: Yes\n                          Todd: OK, so how would you compare ramen in America and ramen in Japan?\n                          Alex: Oh, ramen in Japan is definitely better. I mean the amount of ramen shops just in general is a whole lot more than you'll find in all of America I bet, just in Tokyo, but yeah, the ramen in Japan is definitely better than in America. Especially those humongous bowls of ramen with the meat and the eggs and stuff on top they give you. You're not going to find that, at least where I am in America, a lot, so I like that a lot. \n                          Todd: And when you talk about ramen in the states, do you mean an actual ramen shop or like top ramen? Both actually. Ramen shops are very, at least where I am they're very, not, there's not a lot. So I usually when I want ramen, I have to buy the packaged, you know, Top Ramen, whatever. \n                          Todd: Yeah, how much does it cost?\n                          Alex: It depends where you do. The cheapest I found it was, they're having a sale, where I work actually, in a grocery store, was having a sale, like 50 cents a pack, so I loaded, and it was OK.\n                          Todd: That's pretty cheap.",

Not even that, maybe 100 yen. \nLois: In England it's cheap but probably not as cheap as in America. I think maybe because we have to import everything.

I think, he said something like that there was a really strong smell, so maybe a similar smell to truffles in France or Italy maybe. I'm not to sure, but sounds interesting anyway.",

And it's our national sport. \nTodd: OK. Uh, do you still play now?\nKevin: Ah, I played about five years ago. I played in Japan in Kobe. The club was called Kobe Regata club.\nTodd: OK.\nKevin: And they were very strong. Yeah, but in this country you play on sand, but in Wales you play on grass. It's a lot easier to play rugby in Wales. \nTodd: Um, What's the best thing about rugby?\nKevin: Violence. Ah, it's very good because you can run and you can hit somebody and you don't go to jail for doing it so...it's the same as if you've been to America, the same as American football. Uh, it's very strong and when you practice you become stronger. You're body becomes stronger and it's just fun to play rugby.\nTodd: Have you ever broken a bone or...?\nKevin: I've broken my nose, I've had about ten stitches in my bottom lip.

        "transcript": "Marion\nMy first pet was bought for me when I was still a baby, so I think, I think I was, I think I was less than six weeks old when my granddad bought me a little terrier pup. So as far, as long as I can remember from being very very young, I could always remember this little dog who grew up with me really. \nHer name was Lulu. I think my granddad named her. I don't really know why he called her Lulu but maybe after an English pop star, or maybe he liked the name, I'm not really sure, but he used to always call her \"Lula\" rather than Lulu, so I'm not too sure how the name came about, but anyway Lulu and I were about the same age really, so there wouldn't have been more than six weeks between us, and she was really cute, a very small dog, as most terriers are, I suppose, so yeah, quite small, and very small face, so she had really cute features and big brown eyes, from what I remember, so she was really sweet looking, and she was very friendly as well, and would be very happy and we would come and take her for walks or just play with her, and so yeah, we grew up together for the most part. I tried to spend as much time with her as I could cause she didn't actually live with me. She lived with her granddad still. He looked after her for me.\nBut yeah it was really sad. As she got older, obviously a dog doesn't live as long as we do, so about the time I was maybe, I don't know, twelve or thirteen I suppose, you could really see that poor Lulu was getting, getting much older and you know she had more difficulty in walking and she just looked like she had aged a lot really, so she finally passed away I think when I was about 16. So she lived to be quite old for a little dog like that, but it was really, really sad because we'd spent all that time together and the last few years, we'd been living in the same place and everything, yeah, so I was really, really sad when she passed away. Often times I think, with a pet, you know, when you've had a pet for so long, maybe you don't realize how really attached you are to that person, or to that pet, that animal, and so it really was a wrench when she died. It was very sad.",

So very quite really, not many cars would pass so the dog, Jonathan, used to run off in front of my granddad and my granddad's hearing wasn't too good at that time. He was already quite old, so he wouldn't always hear cars coming, so every time a car was coming, the dog would, Jonathan would come running back to my granddad so that, and he did this every time a car came so my granddad knew that if Jonathan came running back towards him, he knew that he had to stand in closer to the edge of the road so that, you know, he wouldn't be in danger of being knocked down by a car or anything because those old country roads, you know when I was younger, we used to walk in the middle of the road, or you know, not quite by the edge, cause there were so few cars, you didn't really need to keep by the edge and there were no foot paths along the side, so you were just walking along the edge of the road, so he was a really clever dog in he could alert my granddad, you know to whether a car was coming or not.\nI think most dogs are very intelligent. I've met some people who say their dog is a bit stupid but I don't believe that really. I think most dogs are quite intelligent, even if they're not really good guard dogs, you know, some dogs aren't good guard dogs. They don't bark enough when strangers come or something like that, but I still think they're probably very intelligent, and even if they're not, they're probably very affectionate, which is a plus definitely. It's almost as good as having a really intelligent guard dog I think.",

OK, first of all, I don't think I learned English as a foreign, a foreign language because I loved to listen to music, especially rock n' roll when I was a teenage. So when you love music, you become, like you, you want to sing with it so you memorize the whole lyrics and you know stuff and, so to me it was like, just, you know, a hobby, it was just a fun purely. It was the pure fun for me so, I didn't think I studied. \nTodd: Wow, that's great! So did you listen without reading the words, the lyrics, or did you just listen and read the lyrics at the same time?\nKawabe: Um, both! Both, yeah! Sometimes, I'd see words which I don't understand, so I look up the dictionary and you know check the meaning and, you know, the things was always like this.\nTodd: Um, so did you do anything else besides music?\nKawabe: Ah, what else? Yeah, the movie! The movie! Like, yeah, I loved to, one of my favorite movies, the Blues Brothers, because you know, that movie is interesting, and first of all, that funny, you know the funniest movie and like a great comedy in the history I think and that movie was famous for it's music, right, you know, that movie's soundtrack is great, and I have the CD in my room. And then.. \nTodd: You have it in your room?\nKawabe: Yeah!\nTodd: Really!\nKawabe: Yeah! I do and, so I saw that movie so many times. I don't remember how many times I saw that, and when you , you know, after the repetition, you know watching the same movies so many times you memorize a whole like words and sentence, what John Belushi was saying, what Dan Aykrod was saying, so it was a great study I think, for me! \nTodd: Wow! That's a great..\nKawabe: But at that time I don't think that was studying you know!\nTodd: Yeah, it was fun! So you enjoyed it!",

I usually do aerobic exercise for awhile and then do some weightlifting for maybe half an hour at the gym, then I'll return home, and as I work from my home, I turn on my computer and start working on what needs to be done. I usually skip breakfast and I'll work until about 12:00 then I'll prepare lunch and have a fairly big lunch because I don't eat breakfast. Then after lunch, I'll go back, continue working on Internet or whatever I have to do for work, until about 6:00 when I usually start getting phone calls from friends of mine who live abroad and then in the evenings if I'm not using my time doing things with the Internet or surfing the web, then I'm speaking to people on the Internet or on my phone and that pretty much sums up my usual daily routine.",

I love getting letters too but I don’t know, there’s something special about a parcel, especially when you don’t know what’s going to be inside it. So I opened the parcel this morning and there, just in time for Christmas, and everything is a big huge thing of Toblerone Chocolates, which I love and also, a six-pack of Tayto’s Cheese and Onion Crisps. Now, Tayto’s is an Irish company, and so it’s an Irish brand name and these crisps or potato chips, maybe as other countries call them, these crisps are absolutely the best crisps in the world. There is no competition. I think if you ask any Irish person, they’ll tell you the same thing, so there’re real, quite a strong flavor, I think but really cheesy, em, but it’s funny because I don’t, I don’t usually like crisps. I’m not a big crisp fan, but these cheese and onion Tayto’s, I’ve just finished the first packet and it really makes me feel, makes me feel closer to home, I …my friends, this is the taste of home. They’re so good. You should really try some.",

Back then, you weren't served meals at your seat. You had, if they had a dining car, if they had a dining car, you could go into the dining car and eat but some trains, especially on short distances, like when I lived in Jaffy, Missouri, it was halfway between Memphis and St. Louis. Those were short routes and they did not have dining cars. On this trip that we just got back from yesterday, we had our, we were in the lower car because it's a handicap car. My sister is handicapped, and they brought us a menu, and they brought us a full dinner, including salad and dessert and coffee or tea, whatever we would like to drink.\nAdrienne: How was the food on the train? Was it better than plain food?\nVivian: Oh, much better. Much better. It was fixed. The chef's did a fantastic job and I understand that it is cooked on the train. It may not be all cooked on the train but it certainly is prepared and the salads are prepared on the train so that you don't get these package food tastes.\nAdrienne: That sounds fun though.\nVivian: Oh, it was great fun!

Can you describe it?\nVivian: A poncho is sort of like a shawl, only it is closed. You can wear it like a sweater. You pull it over your head but you don't have any arms. You just have the shawl affect.\nAdrienne: Oh, I've seen those. Those are actually quite popular now. So what colors did you make?\nVivian: I made a mixture of sand colors that's tan and browns and darker browns, sort of a mixture. It's a nice pretty soft yarn in the same colors. It just blends in.\nAdrienne: Oh, sounds great. I'm sure your granddaughter will love that. What else did you start to make?\nVivian: Well, I wanted to make also, I bought some ponchos and I started to put an edging around them but with crocheting, but it didn't look right.\nAdrienne: What's crocheting? \nVivian: Crocheting is another needle, single needle, that you stick into the wool, and use a thread and you pull it through and you can make decoration on anything that you have knitted, only you use a different needle, and a different method of decoration, but it didn't look right so I pulled it all out and it was fun trying out those things.\nAdrienne: So when will you finish the, all of these projects do you think? Do you have a deadline?\nVivian: Yes, I do, very shortly, I'm almost through",

        "transcript": "Adrienne: So, Vivian, you have grandchildren!\nVivian: I have two lovely granddaughters.\nAdrienne: Granddaughters! What's it like being a grandma?\nVivian: It is a second chance on life because of when you are raising children as a young person you get caught up in the daily world, but with grandchildren it's all fun. I don't have to do this, or I don't have to do that, and when I get tired I can send them home to their parents.\nAdrienne: Right, that's the best part, right? So what else is different about being a mother versus being a grandmother?\nVivian: Being a mother you are totally responsible for your child. You are trying to raise them the best you know how to raise them and you're young and everything that you do you know that will be picked up by your child but when you have grandchildren that duty is up to their parents so I don't feel that I have to really teach them anything. I have to continue the teaching of their parents.\nAdrienne: So you get to do all the fun stuff now that you're a grandma?\nVivian: Yes, it really is fun. They take you by the hand, and take you to the store and point out everything in the world that mom and dad will not give them and it really costs you a lot of money sometimes, unless, you do put your foot down and say, ”NO!”\nAdrienne: So being a grandma is more expensive that being a parent?\nVivian: Absolutely, but it's a lot more fun because at this stage of life you have a little bit more money than you had when you were raising your child. \nAdrienne: I see. That's great.",

And it's hard to be as quick as I used to be and I always want to do more, now than I able to do. I can't do what I used to do when I was younger.\nAdrienne: Oh, that's disappointing and probably a little frustrating.\nVivian: Very frustrating! Very frustrating! Especially when you have been active all of your life and all of a sudden things are just, have slowed down to where you can't do all those running around, flying around tasks that you used to be able to do in the morning. \n                                Sometimes it takes me two days to get everything accomplished. Well those are definite disadvantages to getting older. Are there any advantages? Can you give us some hope? Yes! Yes! There is hope. You have reached an age where you understand where you have been. I'm very fortunate that I lived in the 1900's. I was born in 1924. I saw the airplane invented. I saw the beginning of penicillin. I saw the medication for polio which stopped it in its track. I saw so many things. World War II. I was married in World War II and my husband went overseas for two years during that time, and my first two years of marriage was by letters, so it was, it's a good time, 80, you look back on all those things and you're glad to be part of it. You begin to understand the changes that are taking place just as they took place when you were young, but you don't come to that realization until you become old. You don't become wiser. \n                                You just become more knowledgeable.\nAdrienne: Well, that doesn't sound so bad.",

        "transcript": "When I was living in Pisa, a few friends and I decided to go to Venice for the carnival, so the carnival in Venice, it's usually, usually about February or March, depending on when Easter is that year cause Easter can change every year, it's a different day, so this time it was, I think about, it was about the middle of February, that's right, so we went there about the 11th or 12th of February, and it was so cold. I remember just being bitterly, bitterly cold. I remember a few of us had to buy extra scarves and gloves and jumpers cause it was just so, so cold, especially at night. During the day wasn't so bad, it was still cold but it was really awful at night if you were walking around, but it was an awful lot of fun to be in Venice for carnival because, em, lots of people dress up in really, really elaborate costumes and masks. One of my friends there, she goes almost every year to the carnival and she does face-painting on the streets so I met up with her, kind of by chance. We knew that we were both going to be there but it's such a busy time we weren't sure if we were going to meet or not, so it was really good that we met up in the huge piazza, Piazza San Marco. She told me roughly which side of the piazza she would be and I found her, so that was really great to see her after such a long time and then the other amazing thing we did that weekend or that few days was that my friends and I went on a gondola. So, a gondola, you've probably seen on television or in a book or something, a gondola is the long, kind of, boat that they have in Venice and there's a man who stands at the back with a big, long pole that he steers the boat with so he drives the boat along by pushing this long stick into the mud on the bottom of the canal, I suppose. It was really amazing because that's one of the, I suppose, the most stereotypical things when you think of Venice and when I'd been there the first time I hadn't gone on a gondola because I thought aw, it's too touristy, I'm not going to do that, but my friends this time, they really wanted to go on one, so we went and we asked some of the guys, the gondoliere as they're called, by piazza san Marco and asked them how much it would cost but we'd forgotten that that day it was the 14th of February so it was Valentine's Day and, as you can imagine, going out in a gondola is, is usually a very romantic occasion for a couple and whatever, to go off and be maybe serenaded by, by another gondoliere, so they sing all sorts of, of songs like you've probably seen on TV or heard in television adverts so they wanted an awful lot of money, I remember, just because it was Valentine's Day, so there were a few of us trying to argue with them in Italian and you know, we were saying that it wasn't fair because it was just a group of us and we just wanted the experience so I think eventually they kind of gave us a more reasonable price so we set off in the gondola and went along the canals, the little canals around Piazza San Marco so it was really, really, really nice. We got to see a lot of the, the backstreets, like I say, and lovely old bridges crossing, crossing the canals. It's a really unique experience as Venice is a pretty unique city really. There was, em, our gondoliere was pretty funny in the end as it turned out. He was very nice, and so there was a few of us from Ireland in the gondola he was asking us all where we were from and so as soon as we told him Ireland he started singing us a song by U2 which is a bit strange, not the usual song that you expect from a gondoliere but, em, it was quite funny, anyway. So, like I say, a really unique experience.",

Mariel: Oh, yeah, that was in the 80's.Todd: OK, maybe that was my generation. So that's not popular anymore?Mariel: Some people like to wear ripped jeans, yeah, still, but mainly the rips are quite neat, so they're usually ripped a little bit around the pockets or around the cuffs, you know the bottoms, YeahTodd: OK, yeah. That sounds like designer jeans. Maybe then like.... are they specifically made just for that style?Mariel: Well, yeah. Actually, quite often the jeans you buy in the store are already ripped or already worn so they look like they're old but they are brand new.Todd: But designer jeans can be really expensive, right?Mariel: Oh, they can be very expensive but people are willing to pay the money because they're designer jeans. They're cool.Todd: Well, how much do you pay for jeans?Mariel: I can pay up to 120 Euros for jeans. Todd: A hundred and twenty Euros.Mariel: Yeah. Todd: That's a lot of money.Mariel: It's a lot of money, yeah, especially because I'm a student but I'm willing to put the money into it if the jeans fit very well.Todd: Just, lastly about jeans, these days there's many different colors. You have the light blue jeans, or the darker blue jeans. Which colors do you like to wear?Mariel: That depends on the time of the year actually. In the summer I like to wear light blue jeans and then in the winter I sometimes wear black jeans or really dark blue jeans.Todd: Oh, that's interesting. So you change the color by season?Mariel: Yeah, generally I think I wear more darker clothes in the winter.Todd: Well, just off hand, how many jeans do you think you have? How many pairs do you have at home?Mariel: I think I have about eight or nine pairs.Todd: That's a lot.Mariel: That's a lot but actually, I use only two pairs of them.Todd: Your favorites?Mariel: Yeah, my favorite jeans. And they're baggy.Todd: OK, thanks Mariel.Mariel: You're welcome. My pleasure.",

It's surrounded by lakes and forests and lots of cliffs and really beautiful scenery. Yeah.Todd: Well, that sounds nice.Mariel: Yeah. Yeah, I love it there. I go back there every year to visit my hometown.Todd: Now does your family still live in your hometown?Mariel: No, they live down south near Helsinki.Todd: OK, is that common? Everybody moves to the big city.Mariel: Pretty much, yeah. Especially young people. They want to get jobs and go to schools near Helsinki. Yeah.Todd: Now is Finland part of the European Union?Mariel: Yes, it is since 1995.Todd: OK, so because it's part of the European Union do a lot of young people decide to leave Finland and go live in other countries?Mariel: The Finnish young people are actually very outgoing and they're very interested foreign cultures so a lot of people take a year or two just to travel, just to see the world, visit some places, and yeah, a lot of people go out to other countries to study as well. Yep, mainly Europe but also a lot of my friends for example went to India for six months or to South America.Todd: OK. Sounds fun.Mariel: Yeah.Todd: But because you're in the European Union you can go live in France or Germany or Spain if you want, correct?Mariel: Yeah. It's very easy. Just go.Todd: But do most Finnish people prefer to stay in Finland or do a lot of people like to go move to warmer climates?Mariel: Finnish people are very patriotic. We really love our country. We like to visit other places but I think even if we live abroad for a long time most people always some back to Finland. I think especially if they want to have a family because Finland is a very safe place and it's very good to raise your kids in Finland.Todd: Sounds like a nice place.Mariel: Yeah, I think so.

It's pork or fish wrapped in leaves and put inside the underground oven and it's very salty and very good.\nMari: So the flavor is just salt?\nRon: The flavor is salt and also the leaf flavor that it's wrapped in.\nMari: What's your favorite dessert or junk food?\nRon: My favorite dessert has to be cake and ice-cream together.

So, Mari, are you a good cook?\nMari: I like to cook, more specifically, I like to cook for people. I like to have people over and eat with people. I don't really like to eat alone, so I don't like to cook for myself. I like to cook for other people, but more than cooking I like to bake.\n                              \nRon: Baking. What do you like to bake?\nMari: Cookies and brownies and cake.\nRon: That sounds very good. I would like to eat one of your brownies. OK, next, are you a good singer?\nMari: I am terrible at singing. I don't like going to karaoke and I don't like to sing. I like music, but I can't sing for my life. I, yesterday, or I guess in class it was a students birthday and I made my students sing Happy Birthday but they wouldn't start so I had to start them off singing and my voice was so bad, they started laughing at me, so I'm just a terrible singer.\nRon: That's funny. OK, next. Are you a good dancer?\nMari: No, I'm not a good dancer. I can't dance at all. I used to when I was younger, my parents would enroll me in ballet classes, so I did ballet for six years but I am not very good at dancing.\nRon: So, you're a teacher now right? So, were you a good student when you were a student?\nMari: I was a good student because I'm a dork. No, yeah, I think I was a good student. I tried hard in all of my classes. I always did my homework. I was always focused and took notes during class. If I didn't understand something, I would either ask questions in class or speak to the teacher or professor after class. I always really liked learning and so I think that's why I was a really good student.\nRon: And athletics? Were you a good athlete, and are you a good athlete now?\nMari: That's a tricky question. I like sports, and I like playing sports. I don't think I'm a very good athlete, probably compared to you, I'm probably not, but I really enjoy playing sports. In high school, I played soccer. I ran cross-country. I played ice-hockey and a little bit of lacrosse.\nRon: And which one was your favorite sport?\nMari: My favorite sport was ice-hockey.\nRon: Interesting.",

Can you cook?\nRon: I can't cook well, but I do cook, so I think the reason why I can't cook well is because I can eat anything, so I don't try very hard to make it take good.\n                              \nMari: What do you like to cook?\nRon: I like to barbecue outside on the grill.\nMari: What do you put on your barbecue?\nRon: When I cook meat, I don't put much, only salt, pepper, and a little bit of seasoning.\nMari: OK. Good. Next, do you think you're a good dancer?\nRon: No, I don't think I'm a good dancer and I don't really try to be a good dancer.\nMari: Do you not like to dance?\nRon: No, I don't like to dance.\nMari: At all?\nRon: Right.\nMari: I heard that you're a good line-dancer.\nRon: I would like to learn how to line dance, and I do like country music but I haven't been officially taught how to line dance.\nMari: So you don't dance at all?\nRon: No.\nMari: Next, are you a good singer?\nRon: No, I'm not a good singer but I do enjoy going to Karaoke.\nMari: What do you like to sing?\nRon: In Hawaii, when I go to Karaoke I enjoy singing Hawaiian music. If I'm in Japan I like to sing other English songs that they have, usually country music or 80's or 90's music.\nMari: Good. That's good. Do you think you're a good student?\nRon: I don't know if I'm a good student. Growing up I was not a good student but now I am trying harder to be a good student.\nMari: How were you not a good student growing up?\nRon: I didn't enjoy going to school and I didn't try very hard in school. Now I try a little harder. I make an effort. \nMari: Can you talk more about your effort? What do you do to try to be a good student?\nRon: I try to listen to the teachers now instead of doing my own thing, and I try to complete everything with good quality.\nMari: That's good. And, last do you think that you're a good athlete?\nRon: Growing up I was a good athlete. I played a few sports. Now I don't play any sports anymore because I'm old, but growing up I think I was a good athlete.\nMari: What sports did you play?\nRon: I played American football, baseball, and soccer.\nMari: Which one is your best sport?\nRon: I would say football. American football is my best sport.\nMari: How long did you play?\nRon: I played since I was eleven until age twenty-two.\nMari: So for eleven years. And you played when you were in university?\nRon: I played at the University of Hawaii.",

So, do you dream a lot?\nHana: Ahm, well yes, I usually remember my dream every day but I forget it so I don't really remember it now.\nDaniel: Oh because, you know, I've been reading a lot about dreams because lately I've been dreaming a lot and people said that you dream every single night but the difference is whether if you remember the dream or not, so do you know that?\nHana: Yeah, I read something similar to that. I heard that you dream seven dreams like seven different stories.\nDaniel: Seven?\nHana: Yeah and you only remember the fourth and fifth dream.\nDaniel: Why is that?\nHana: I don't know, you only can remember the fourth or fifth so that's why sometimes when you have a dream, there are many different stories.\nDaniel: So that means if what we read is true it's like we dream every night and every night we dream seven different stories.\nHana: Yes and I heard it's good if you write your dreams down while you remember it and it's really interesting.\nDaniel: Yeah it is but even if you remember the dreams because that has happened to me, you wake up, you remember the dream but really quickly and really say you forget the dream. Has that happen to you?\nHana: Yeah, that happens to me a lot that's why I think really should keep a diary of my dreams because I heard a lot of things that you dream about can be hints for your life or what you're thinking.\nDaniel: Oh that's really interesting so well, I think I'm going to get a notebook or something and keep it, you know, on my bedside table.\nHana: Yeah, me too.",

Actually, I’m from Melbourne. \nJosh: Melbourne? \nShirley: Hmm. \nJosh: Okay. So are there any nice parts in Melbourne? \nShirley: Well, you know Josh, Melbourne is a great city. And one of the reasons is because there are lots of parks. There’s a really big park right in the center of the city. \nJosh: Is it beautiful? \nShirley: It’s gorgeous. It’s called the Botanical Gardens. And they have plants from many different places around the world. And there’s a lake, a small lake in the center. But what I really love about that park is at one time of the year, they have lots of big fruit bats that fly into the park and they hang upside down from the trees. They are really huge, like big sacks. It’s very cool. \nJosh: That sounds beautiful. \nShirley: Yeah. \nJosh: So is there good shopping in your city? \nShirley: Oh, there’s great shopping in Melbourne. You know, Melbourne has people from many different countries. So we have a great variety of things; and clothing, cars, coffee shops, foods from many different countries. So it’s a great place to shop. \nJosh: Wonderful. What about housing? Is there cheap housing or is it really expensive? \nShirley: Well, it’s not cheap but it’s not as expensive as Sydney. Sydney is the biggest city in Australia. It’s very expensive to live. But in Melbourne, hmm, the housing is so-so. \nJosh: How do you get around in Melbourne? Do you take the bus? \nShirley: You can take the bus but Melbourne has something very special that no other city in Australia has. We have a tram system. I think they’re called trolley cars in America, maybe. \nJosh: Yeah, that sounds familiar. \nShirley: Yeah. Well, Melbourne has a really big tram system so you can go lots of places in the city by tram. It’s really good fun.\nJosh: What about the tram? Is it expensive? \nShirley: Not so expensive; cheaper than the bus. Maybe about the same as the train. Cheaper than a car. Probably, one of the cheapest ways to travel in the city. \nJosh: What about schools in Melbourne. Is there a big university? \nShirley: Melbourne has three or four really big universities and some smaller universities, too. Also, they have some very good private high schools and some very good public high schools. \nJosh: Great. That sounds like a great place to go to school. \nShirley: It’s a pretty great place to live.",

Those are hard. \nShirley: Yeah. \nJosh: So what did you do on Saturday? \nShirley: Well, Saturday morning, I usually clean the house. \nJosh: Okay. \nShirley: Yeah. It’s kind of boring, but I have to clean the bathroom and then the kitchen, and then the lounge room because I have lots of cats. And the cats leave hair everywhere. So I always have to clean on Saturday mornings. \nJosh: Yes, cats are messy. \nShirley: Yeah. \nJosh: So after you cleaned, what did you do? \nShirley: Well, in the afternoon, I went for a walk up the mountain. It was a beautiful sunny day. There were no clouds in the sky. \nJosh: Wow. \nShirley: It was gorgeous. So I walked up the mountain and I saw a ferret. \nJosh: A ferret? \nShirley: Yeah. \nJosh: Wow. \nShirley: They’re a little furry animal, four legs, tail—not like a rabbit, but about the same size as a rabbit. \nJosh: Okay. \nShirley: And they’re kind of gold brown color. \nJosh: Wow, did you see any other animals on your walk? \nShirley: No. I didn’t see any other animals on the ground. But I did see a beautiful bird flying in the sky. \nJosh: Wow. Do you know what kind? \nShirley: I think it was an ibis. It’s a big bird that usually walks in the water. It has long legs and it was white with a black head. \nJosh: Great. So after your walk, did you do anything else? \nShirley: I went home and then I watched some TV. \nJosh: Okay. \nShirley: That was about it for my Saturday. \nJosh: Okay. What did you do on Sunday? \nShirley: Sunday, I went to the art museum. \nJosh: Really? \nShirley: Yeah. \nJosh: Great. \nShirley: I really like to go and see new art; pictures or paintings or photographs or sometimes sculptures. \nJosh: Okay. So who’s your favorite artist? \nShirley: I don’t really have a favorite artist but I really like watercolors, so pictures that are painted with just soft—a kind of soft painting style. \nJosh: Do you like paintings of nature? \nShirley: I do like paintings of nature. I especially like paintings of flowers and animals and places that have water like lakes or rivers or the sea. \nJosh: Oh, that sounds like you had a great weekend. \nShirley: Yeah, it was good. Thanks. \nJosh: Okay.",

Have you heard of the big five? \nAna: I think so but I don't remember what it is. \nMike: So the big five are the animals that foreign tourists like to come and see in South Africa. And there are safaris and trips you can go on to wildlife reserves to see these animals. \nAna: So what are they? \nMike: So would you like to guess? \nAna: I guess lions. \nMike: Yes, that's one of them. \nAna: And elephants. \nMike: Yes. \nAna: And giraffes. \nMike: No. The giraffe is definitely a big animal but it's not one of the big five. The other three are rhinoceros, the – is it the water buffalo, I think. And the final one is – what is the final one? \nAna: Is it the cheetah? \nMike: Yes, the cheetah. Yes. The cheetah can run very, very fast. \nAna: Okay, and have you seen all of these animals? \nMike: Let me think. It's been a while since I visited a wildlife reserve but I've seen elephants before. And let's see; I've seen a lion. I don't think I've ever seen a cheetah. I've seen a rhinoceros from far away. \nAna: I've heard they're quite dangerous. \nMike: I don't think that there are not many of them in the wild. I don't know if there are any in the wild. They're all in wildlife enclosures so that actually I don't think many people are injured or killed by rhinoceroses. But actually, do you know what the most dangerous animal is in Africa? \nAna: Is it the lion? \nMike: No, it's not.  It's the hippopotamus. \nAna: Really? \nMike: I think they killed more people every year in the world than any other animal. \nAna: Wow, that's very surprising. \nMike: Maybe mosquitoes kill more with malaria but in terms of big animals, it's definitely the hippopotamus. \nAna: Wow. \nMike: They have very long teeth as well. \nAna: That's scary. \nMike: Yeah. It is pretty scary. You don't want to be – you know, they can swim as well. So they would – and if you go out on the river in a little bit on a dam and there's a hippopotamus, he can tip your boat over and bite you in half. \nAna: All right. So you should definitely look out for hippos when you go to South Africa. \nMike: Yeah. You should be careful. Crocodiles can also be nasty. \nAna: Okay.",

So does she study all animals or does she focus on a specific animal?\nMike: Well, she's worked at universities studying animals for a long time. So she's worked on many different kinds of animals. But at the moment, she is studying South African tortoises. \nAna: Oh, interesting. Do you have any tortoises in your house? \nMike: Yeah. Actually, we have more than 40 tortoises in our garden. \nAna: More than 40. Wow.\nMike: Yes. People are always very surprised when they visit and they see all our tortoises. \nAna: So, do you know a lot about tortoises as well? \nMike: I don't know very much about them but I mean, my mom has always got them around at the house or she's often busy with some sort of tortoise's related activity. And so sometimes, as a high school kid, I got home and she would have a tortoise that – a pregnant tortoise, a female tortoise with eggs inside. And in order to monitor these eggs, she would have it in a bath of water with an ultrasound scanner and a screen up on the dining room table. \nAna: Wow. That is really interesting. \nMike: I had a very interesting childhood with all of these animals and things around the house. \nAna: Oh, that's great. Did you have any other pets? \nMike: Yes. We've always had a couple of dogs and I like cats. So I've got my pet cat at home. \nAna: Wow. That's really interesting.",

        "transcript": "Michael: So Ana, you're from Portugal, right? \nAna: Yeah, right. \nMichael: Okay, because I'm actually thinking of going to visit Europe this summer, and I thought Portugal would be a great place to visit. \nAna: Oh yeah, Portugal is great especially in the summer. It will be really warm and you can go to lots of places in Portugal. You can go to the North where we have a lot of mountains and you can do all kinds of activities like archery and horse riding. \nMichael: Oh wow, that's interesting. Well, actually, I was thinking of going to the beach. Can you give me some advise for what's the best time of year to go. And perhaps there are not too many tourists are on. \nAna: Oh yeah, if you want to avoid tourists, you should definitely not come in August. August is really crowded and there are just so many people in the South of Portugal. You can try to come in June. \nMichael: All right. \nAna: June is already warm but there are not too many people. So it will be easier for you to find accommodation. There are some really nice hotels and hostels around. So what kind of place were you thinking of staying in? \nMichael: Well, actually, I don't really mind too much. I think I'd like to see what it's like for normal people in Portugal, what it would be like to go on a holiday and have an authentic Portuguese experience. So maybe – I don't really want to stay in a big international hotel. What's a typical Portuguese place to stay and is nice for a summer holiday? \nAna: That's interesting, yeah. In that case, you should definitely avoid the big hotels or any hostels. There are some apartments that you can rent. So you can just live in an apartment by the beach. \nMichael: All right. \nAna: Yeah, they're just in a normal building with other Portuguese people but you can rent it and stay there and it's really close to the beach. It's like a one-minute walk. So it will be really convenient for you. \nMichael: And this is by the Atlantic Ocean. \nAna: Yes. Yes, it is. \nMichael: All right. That sounds like a very good idea staying at an apartment. How much should I budget for that? \nAna: Hmm, I am not really sure. It will probably be a bit more expensive than a hotel. \nMichael: Really? \nAna: Not in the long term. You can pay about EUR 30 per night, I think. \nMichael: Well, that's huge. \nAna: For a nice location, yeah. If you come with friends though, you can also rent a villa. We have some villas also by the beach. \nMichael: Does it have a swimming pool? \nAna: It does have a swimming pool. And they have plenty of room. So if you want to come with a big group, that's definitely a better option. \nMichael: That sounds like a great idea. I can invite my colleagues along. So do you have any final tips for me, for my holiday in Portugal? \nAna: Well, I mean, if you want to stay in the South, in the Algarve, then I definitely recommend you check out the nightlife. I can be really lively in there in night markets where you can buy lots of souvenirs and people just hang around. So I definitely recommend that. \nMichael: Okay, and what was the name again? The Algarve? \nAna: The Algarve, yeah. That's the southern part of Portugal, so you can't miss it. \nMichael: Oh, I got to remember that. Thank you very much.",

It's right by Spain in Europe and we have really nice weather there. It's really sunny most of the year and really hot in summer. It can get really cold and really rainy in winter. But yeah, overall, it's a really nice country to live in. \nMichael: And I've heard you have nice beaches in Portugal. \nAna: Yes, we do. I used to go to the beach everyday with my family in summer. It was really great. But the beaches can get really crowded. Lots of people, so you might want to be a bit careful when you choose where to go. \nMichael: All right, I see. And where do you live in Portugal? \nAna: I live in a small village actually. You probably don't know it. It's called Palmela. But it's south of Lisbon and it's by the coast, so it's really nice. We get a nice view of the mountains and of the rivers. So I really enjoy living there. It's really quite. Not a lot of people. A lot of wine farms actually and really nice food. You should come and visit sometime. \nMichael: I like wine. And so you have good wine in Portugal. What sort of food do you eat in Portugal? \nAna: Let's see. We get a lot of fish because we're by the sea. And so codfish is a traditional and sardines and mackerels. \nMichael: Oh, I like sardines. \nAna: Yeah. It's really good. And we also have really good desserts. So for example, coffee cake, yogurt cake. We've got pastel de nata which is kind of an egg tart thing. So I really recommend you try that with our coffee when you go there. \nMichael: All right. And you speak Portuguese as your first language. \nAna: Yes, I do. I speak Portuguese. It's not the same as Brazilian Portuguese but it's really close and we can understand each other. So that's really great. \nMichael: All right. And can you understand Spanish as well? \nAna: Yeah. I can understand a little bit of Spanish but there are some differences between Portuguese and Spanish. \nMichael: How do you say hello in Portuguese? \nAna: Oh, you can say, \"Ola.\"\nMichael: Ola. \nAna: Yeah, it's fun. You should learn some Portuguese. \nMichael: Oh, I'd love to.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Okay. So Sarah, I see you eat soup every day at work. Why are you eating soup every day? \nSarah: That’s because I love to cook soup. \nTodd: So you make the soup? \nSarah: Yes, it’s very easy to make. \nTodd: So you cook it and then you just bring it to work everyday? \nSarah: Yeah. I just make a lot on Monday and then I bring it to work everyday of the week. \nTodd: Oh nice. So how do you make the soup? What’s your secret? \nSarah: Well, I like to cook very easy. So I buy meat that’s already cut up, usually, chicken and then some rice, usually brown rice and then I buy some vegetables. So after I bought the ingredients, I chop them up and I put them all together in water until boils and add some seasoning. \nTodd: Okay. So you say the water boils, so as soon as the water boils that’s when you put in all the ingredients? \nSarah: Yes, that’s right. \nTodd: So you don’t put in the ingredients before the water boils. \nSarah: No. I guess, it’s just easier for the water to be hot because then the vegetables and the meat cook a little faster. \nTodd: So how do you give the soup flavoring? \nSarah: I usually add salt and pepper, maybe some garlic. And depending on the type of soup, either maybe some soy sauce or lemon juice. \nTodd: Okay. Do you put in the flavoring after you put in the ingredients or before you put in the ingredients? \nSarah: Maybe after but usually, right about all at the same time. \nTodd: Okay. \nSarah: So I just put everything in at one time. \nTodd: And then after you cook the soup, do you put the soup in the refrigerator? Do you let it sit outside? \nSarah: I usually eat some right then, and I also put it in containers for the week. But I let it sit in the containers out on the counter for a while for it to cool before I put in the refrigerator. \nTodd: All right. And so, you don’t put it in the refrigerator until it is cool? \nSarah: Until it’s about room temperature. \nTodd: Okay, nice. And then how do you heat it up? Do you heat it up in a pot or do you heat it up in the microwave? \nSarah: In the microwave. It’s the easiest. \nTodd: Yeah. Nice. So you make enough for five meals? \nSarah: Maybe, sometimes. If I think I will get tired of eating it during the week then maybe I’ll just make enough for three or four meals. But if it’s some kind that I think is really delicious and I know I want to eat it everyday, then I’ll make a lot. \nTodd: Well, if that happens, when you make the soup, you can make it for six or seven and give me a bowl. \nSarah: Okay. I’ll do that next time. \nTodd: Oh great. Thanks. \n[End of Transcript]",

Yeah, I was born there and I lived in the city for many years. \nSarah: Cool. What is the most interesting thing about your city? \nTodd: Well, San Francisco has many interesting things, but the most interesting thing is probably the architecture. There’s lots of very unique buildings. And the most unique building is probably the Trans-America building. It’s a building like a pyramid. It’s nice. \n \nSarah: Well, that’s really cool. \nTodd: Uh-hmm. \nSarah: What is the most expensive area in San Francisco? \nTodd: Well, it is very, very expensive. The most expensive area is a place called Pacific Heights, and it’s on the highest hill in San Francisco and it overlooks the Bay. It’s a really, really beautiful place. \nSarah: Hmm.\nTodd: That area by far has the best views of the city. \nSarah: Hmm, what is the most beautiful place in San Francisco? \nTodd: Well, actually the most beautiful place is outside the city. It’s a place called Muir Woods. And it has the tallest trees in the world, and some of these trees are really old. They are the oldest trees in North America. Some of them are over 2,000 years old. \nSarah: Wow. It sounds like some place I would like to see. So it sounds really expensive. Where is the cheapest place to live? \nTodd: The cheapest place to live is a place called Sunset. And Sunset is on the west side, and the houses are kind of old and they’re a little bit cheap. But one thing about Sunset is it has nicest view of the ocean, and you could watch the sunset every night. That’s why it’s called the Sunset area. \nSarah: Hmm. If I wanted to go there, when is the best time to visit? \nTodd: Well, the best time is probably in the fall because that’s when the weather is the nicest. It’s not too cold, and it’s not too hot. And it doesn’t rain that much. \nSarah: So when would be the worst time to visit? \nTodd: The worst time to visit would be probably February and March, because February and March are the coldest and wettest months. So – well, March isn’t that cold but sometimes it’s wet, so it rains a lot. \nSarah: Wow. That sounds really great. I want to go there. \nTodd: Yeah, you should. It’s great place.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Meg, we are talking about clothes, and you always look nice at work. You have a very nice fashion sense. \nMeg: Oh, thank you. \nTodd: So you must go shopping a lot. \nMeg: I do go shopping sometimes. It's fun to go shopping and buy new clothes especially when it's a new season. \nTodd: Like what do you like to wear per season? For example, what do you like to wear in winter?\nMeg: In the winter, it's pretty cold. So I like to wear sweaters. Sometimes, a t-shirt with a sweater over it to stay warm. Lots of long-sleeve shirts. I like to wear long-sleeve shirts. And I still wear skirts in the winter. So sometimes, I wear tights underneath the skirts to stay warm. \nTodd: What about dresses? Do you like to wear dresses?\nMeg: I do like to wear dresses. In the winter, it's a good time actually to wear sweater-dresses. They're warm and a dress, so it's nice for work. \nTodd: Sweater-dresses. \nMeg: Have you seen a sweater-dress before?\nTodd: I have no idea what a sweater-dress is. What is a sweater-dress?\nMeg: It's a dress but made of sweater material. \nTodd: Ah. \nMeg: So sweater-cloth made into a dress. So it's very warm. \nTodd: Okay. I was picturing a sweater with a skirt attached to it. \nMeg: [Laughs] You might find that but I think a sweater-dress is a little different. \nTodd: Okay. What about… What about in the summer?\nMeg: In the summer, I love to wear flip-flops. It's my favorite thing to wear. So I often wear flip-flops with jeans or shorts, skirts again. I don't wear tights in the summer because it's too hot. \nTodd: Right. Do you wear flip-flops to work?\nMeg: I can't wear flip-flops to work. So when I go to work, I often wear high heels or flats, some dress shoes. \nTodd: Okay. So do you like to wear shorts or skirts. Which do you prefer?\nMeg: I prefer shorts because it's more comfortable and easy to move around. But I also can't wear shorts to work. So I have many summer skirts for work. \nTodd: Okay. Now, let's talk about shoes. So women often have many types of shoes, high heels, boots, flats, like you just said, sneakers. So what kind of shoes besides flip-flops do you like to wear?\nMeg: I do have many pairs of shoes and so I like to wear flats and sandals especially in the summer. In the winter, I like to wear boots and rain shoes when it rains or rain boots. When I'm exercising, I like to wear sneakers or tennis shoes because it's good for your feet. \nTodd: Oh right. Now you travel a lot, we both travel a lot. What shoes do you usually take when you travel? \nMeg: When I travel, I usually take flats because they're easy to remove at the airport and they're light and convenient for traveling. \nTodd: Oh, right. \nMeg: What shoes do you usually use? \nTodd: Just my sneakers. So my sneakers I wear everywhere. Now, women sometimes have accessories, you know, like earrings, necklaces, scarves, things like that. What do you like to wear?\nMeg: I like to wear necklaces especially long necklaces. I don't like necklaces that are too short. It feels uncomfortable. I don't like to wear bracelets or a watch because I don't like anything on my wrist, but I do love to wear rings. I usually wear one ring each hand, just for fashion, not for anything special. \nTodd: Oh that's nice. Cool. Well anyway, thanks, Meg. \nMeg: Thank you.",

But it's a big house, and it's really relaxing. It's a nice place to live.\nMeg: Wow. Sounds nice. How many rooms does it have?\nTodd: My house is pretty big. It's four rooms. It has a big sleeping room. It's a Japanese house. So it's not really a bedroom because you sleep on the floor. \nMeg: Oh. \nTodd: But it also has a living room. It has, like, an office room and it has a kitchen.\nMeg: Is it a big kitchen?\nTodd: No, it's a pretty small kitchen and it's a very old kitchen. I have a small stove. So it's very difficult to cook. But, you know, I have a refrigerator. I have a microwave. I have a nice kitchen table to eat at. So it's a pretty decent kitchen.\nMeg: It sounds okay. What about your living room? What do you have in the living room?\nTodd: My living room, it's pretty cool for a guy because it's a good place to watch sports. I have a really big TV, and I have cable TV, so I get all the football channels. \nMeg: Nice. \nTodd: And I have a really big sofa, so I can sit on my sofa and watch sports and drink beer. It's great.\nMeg: Sounds relaxing.\nTodd: Very relaxing.\nMeg: Well, do you also have a nice bathroom?\nTodd: I do. I actually have three bathrooms.\nMeg: Oh, really?\nTodd: It's kind of crazy, yes. So in English, we say bathroom, but I have two rooms that are for the toilet and I have one room or the bathroom with the toilet for the guests. And then I have a bathroom that I used. And then also I have a natural hot spring bath outside my house. So if I want to take a shower or bathe, I use that room.\nMeg: Wow. I'd love to have a hot spring at my house.\nTodd: Yeah, it's very nice. It's very, very nice.\nMeg: Does your house also have a yard?\nTodd: It kind of has a yard. So outside my house, there's an area for flowers and bushes. And it's like a yard or a garden around the house, but it's not a place you can play sports. There's no grass or anything. So it's a very, very small yard. But, you know, it's a nice place.\nMeg: Oh yeah. It sounds like a nice place to live.\nTodd: It is a nice place to live. I'm very, very lucky. \nMeg: You said you have a sleeping room, not a bedroom. What does that mean?\nTodd: Yeah. I live at a Japanese style house. So it's called the tatami room. And you sleep in the tatami room and you sleep on the floor on a futon. So I don't have a bed. So it's not a bedroom. It's a room that you sit in during the day and you can eat and talk with guests. But it's also a room that you sleep in at night. So yeah, I call it my sleeping room. \nBut I think in Japan, they just call it the tatami room.\nMeg: Is it comfortable sleeping on the floor?\nTodd: Yeah, it's really comfortable. Now I love it. So before, I slept on a bed. But now I sleep on the futon on the floor and I really like it. Actually, I prefer to sleep on the futon on the floor.\nMeg: Well, it sounds like your house is really comfortable.\nTodd: It is. It is. I never want to leave.",

Everything is close by, grocery stores, the mall, the station.\nTodd: Oh, that's great. So what about your apartment? Do you have a nice apartment?\nMeg: It's a nice apartment, but it's really small.\nTodd: Oh yeah? How many rooms?\nMeg: Well, there are three rooms. But each room is pretty small. There's a bedroom, a sitting room like a living room, and the kitchen room.\nTodd: Oh, wow. So in your bedroom, like, do you have a big queen size bed, a small bed?\nMeg: I have a small twin size bed or a single bed in the bedroom because it's pretty small. So there's not much space for a big bed.\nTodd: All right. So do you have a TV in your bedroom?\nMeg: No. Actually, I don't own a TV at all.\nTodd: Really? So there's no TV in the living room, too.\nMeg: There's no TV anywhere in the apartment.\nTodd: Wow. What do you do in your house?\nMeg: I have a laptop computer. So usually, I can watch some TV shows or videos on my laptop.\nTodd: All right. Okay. Do you like to watch movies in bed?\nMeg: Yeah. Sometimes I like to watch movies in bed or sometimes I prefer to sit in the living room and watch movies.\nTodd: Right. So you must have high-speed Internet.\nMeg: I do. Yes. I have an Internet box that my laptop can connect to.\nTodd: Okay. Cool. Do you have a nice big sofa?\nMeg: I have two small sofas. So you can push them together to make one big sofa or you can keep them separate. Usually, I keep them separate because there's more room for people to sit on.\nTodd: Okay. Now, you like to cook. So you must have a nice kitchen.\nMeg: Unfortunately, I have a very tiny kitchen.\nTodd: Oh no. How do you cook?\nMeg: I have to use some extra tables to have more space. The counter is really small, so there's not much space. So I have an extra table I use for preparing the food.\nTodd: Okay. Do you have an oven?\nMeg: I have a very small toaster oven. So it's not really an oven.\nTodd: All right. So do you have a microwave?\nMeg: I do have a microwave and a small refrigerator and one burner, like a stove top burner.\nTodd: Okay. Do you cook every night?\nMeg: I don't cook every night. Sometimes, I'm too busy. And sometimes because my kitchen is so small, I get a little frustrated. So I just pick up some food from a restaurant.\nTodd: All right. Now, you live in an apartment, so how many floors does your apartment building have?\nMeg: The building has five floors and I live on the fifth floor.\nTodd: Nice. Fifth floor. \nMeg: Yeah. The view is nice, but unfortunately, there's no elevator. \nTodd: Oh no. \nMeg: So you always have to take the stairs.\nTodd: Wow. Five flights of stairs.\nMeg: Five flights of stairs everyday. But it's good exercise.\nTodd: So you're on the fifth floor. Do you have a balcony?\nMeg: I have a small balcony where my washing machine is and I can also hang out my laundry out there.\nTodd: Oh cool, washing machine is outside.\nMeg: It is outside. It's a little different from my house in America.\nTodd: So from your view, what can you see?\nMeg: I can see the train station from one window and all the restaurants downtown.

        "transcript": "Meg: Hey, Todd. I know you've traveled a lot. What countries have you lived in?\nTodd: I've lived in three countries. I've traveled to many, many countries. But I've actually lived in three. I lived in England for one year. I lived in Thailand for four years. And I have lived in Japan for 15 years.\nMeg: Wow. So when you lived in England, why did you live there?\nTodd: It was the first country I traveled to after college. And I had a work permit, a work visa for one year. And I worked at a pub restaurant, which was great. It was in the countryside. And I really enjoyed it. And then I did that for six months. I lived near Cambridge. So, I was near Cambridge University. And then after that I moved to London. And again, I worked at a restaurant. And I lived in London and just worked.\nMeg: Wow. So it was after college. How old were you?\nTodd: I was 23 years old.\nMeg: Oh, and living in London. That must have been fun.\nTodd: It was fun. And interestingly, when I went to England, I could not speak English. So, I could not understand British people. It took me maybe two months before I could understand their English. So it was very, very difficult to understand British people when I first moved there.\nMeg: Ah, so you liked it.\nTodd: I did like England. It was fun. It was my first country. But the weather was cold for me. I'm from California, and California in the United States is very warm. So I didn't like the weather. But that's okay because all British people don't like the weather, too.\nMeg: Oh, really?\nTodd: Yeah. Everybody complains about the weather.\nMeg: So after England, did you move someplace warmer?\nTodd: I did. Right after England, I moved to Thailand. And I lived in Thailand for over four years.\nMeg: Wow. Why did you live in Thailand?\nTodd: I was traveling. And in Thailand I had no money and I needed a job. And I wanted to stay in Thailand, so I became an English teacher.\nMeg: Really?\nTodd: Yeah.\nMeg: Did you teach English there for four years?\nTodd: I did. So I went there and I began teaching English. Then I got a teaching course certificate to teach English in Thailand, and I really enjoyed it. The Thai students were really fun. And Thailand is a great place to live because the weather is really nice. The people are really friendly and the food is delicious. It has the best food in the world, I think.\nMeg: I've also heard that Thailand is beautiful. Is it true?\nTodd: It is. It has many, many beautiful islands and it has lots of beautiful places with nature and the mountains. It has jungles. It has beautiful beaches. So it's a nice place to live.\nMeg: So you like Thailand, too.\nTodd: I did. Thailand was great. Yeah.\nMeg: So England, Thailand, you said next was Japan?\nTodd: Yeah, so next was Japan. And Japan is nice. I am a teacher, an English teacher in Japan and I love teaching English in Japan. Like Thailand, the food is really, really good. The people are nice. The scenery is really beautiful. So Japan is really nice.\nMeg: Are there fun things to do in Japan?\nTodd: Yes. Actually, I like Japan the most because you get everything. You get lots of beautiful nature. So, you can go hiking. You can go see beautiful beaches. You can go to really nice islands. But also Japan has many, many nice cities. So you can go to Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka and the cities have lots to do. There's good shopping, great restaurants. It's easy to travel in Japan by train and bus. So, it's really nice.\nMeg: Oh, that sounds like the best of both worlds.\nTodd: Yeah, it is. Definitely a good place to live.",

For example, Spain, Belize and Indonesia.\nTodd: Wow, three different continents.\nMeg: Yeah, pretty far apart.\nTodd: Wow, that's cool. So Spain, that must be a really nice country. What did you think of Spain?\nMeg: Spain is really beautiful. There's a lot of beautiful nature and also some nice cities. While I was there, I lived in a small city called Caceres.\nTodd: Oh nice. Are the people really friendly in Spain?\nMeg: Yes. Actually, the people are very friendly and very helpful, especially if you're lost.\nTodd: Oh, that's great. I hear Spanish food is really, really good.\nMeg: Spanish food is delicious. I lived with a Spanish family and my Spanish mom cooked delicious meals every day for lunch. In Spain, seafood is really popular. So I ate a lot of fish and shrimp.\nTodd: Oh, I love fish and shrimp. \nMeg: Me too.\nTodd: Now, Spain is really warm, right?\nMeg: Yes. Spain was very hot while I was there during the summer.\nTodd: Oh yeah? How hot? How hot does it get?\nMeg: It got up past 40 Degrees Celsius during the summer.\nTodd: Wow.\nMeg: Yeah. It was pretty hot.\nTodd: Does it rain?\nMeg: It does rain. But when I was there in the summer, it didn't rain very often.\nTodd: So what about Belize? Belize is a really small country.\nMeg: Belize is very small, but it's also hot similar to Spain in the summer.\nTodd: Why did you go to Belize?\nMeg: I went to Belize on a study trip for school, and I stayed there for about two weeks.\nTodd: Okay. Now, does Belize have good food?\nMeg: Belize also has good food. There was a family that cooked for us and we had a lot of delicious almost Mexican type food.\nTodd: Oh really? So for example, what do you eat? Like, what do people eat in Belize?\nMeg: People eat – it's kind of like a taco but flat with a tortilla, and some meat and vegetables on top and some spices that make it really delicious.\nTodd: So the last country is Indonesia. When did you go to Indonesia?\nMeg: I actually went to Indonesia just last year.\nTodd: Oh wow. How long did you stay?\nMeg: I only stayed there for about a week.\nTodd: Oh yeah? Oh, short trip.\nMeg: Yeah, it was a short trip, but I was just visiting some friends there.\nTodd: Where did you go?\nMeg: I went to Jakarta and Bali.\nTodd: Oh, okay. So I hear Bali has really beautiful beaches. Is it true?\nMeg: Yeah, it's true. There are a lot of famous and beautiful beaches in Bali.\nTodd: Oh, did you surf in Bali?\nMeg: I've never surfed before. Usually, when I went to the beach, I just wanted to put my feet in the water. \nTodd: Oh yeah. Now, Bali also has  very famous scenery on the inside like the rice fields. Did you see the rice fields of Bali?\nMeg: No, I didn't see the rice fields. But I did go to some famous historical spots.\nTodd: So of the three countries – Spain, Belize and Indonesia – what country was your favorite?\nMeg: Maybe Spain was my favorite because I love learning language and it was really nice to stay with my Spanish family.\nTodd: Yeah. I could see that. I really want to go to Spain, and I hope to go soon.\nMeg: I hope you can go too. It's beautiful.",

        "transcript": "Sarah: So John, do you like to play golf?\nJohn: Well, no. I don't play golf very much, but I play disc golf. \nSarah: Disc golf? What's that? \nJohn: Well, some people call it Frisbee golf. Basically, there are courses at parks. It's similar to golf but the courses are much smaller. You use Frisbees or a flying disc and you have to throw it. So it's different from golf. You're not aiming for a small hole but actually, you need to throw the Frisbee into a basket. \nSarah: Oh, that sounds fun. Is it very easy? \nJohn: Well, it can be easy or it can be very difficult. It depends on the course. Many different parks have different disc golf courses. And you can be an easy beginner or you can be an expert. It all depends on how much you want to get involved. \nSarah: I see. \nJohn: My friends are I, we are beginners, so we just like to have fun. So we just do the easy courses and have a good time. I think it's relaxing. \nSarah: So you only need one Frisbee? \nJohn: Well actually, it's better to have two or three. You can play with one but in fact, when you learn more about disc golf, there are different sizes and weights of the discs. \nSarah: Why would you want a different size disc? \nJohn: Well, it's similar to the clubs in golf. When you throw you first throw, you want it to go very far, so you should use a heavier disc. But when you're near the basket, you should make a short throw, so you want a lightweight disc. \nSarah: I see. That's interesting. \nJohn: Yeah. So as I said, when you want to become an expert, you have to spend more money to get better equipment. It's like any sport, I guess. In fact, they have disc golf competitions now. So you can even participate in a tournament and win some prize money. \nSarah: Did you ever compete? \nJohn: Oh no. I'm just a beginner. I don't think I want to be too serious about it. \nSarah: So golf has 18 holes. How about disc golf? Does it have 18 holes, too? \nJohn: Well, not usually. Golf courses are very large, but disc golf courses are usually found in parks. So they usually have only six holes. But you can play 18 holes by doing all 6 three times each. \nSarah: I see. How do you keep score? \nJohn: Score keeping is like real golf. So the winner should have the lowest score. Every time you throw a Frisbee or a flying disc, you have to mark one point. So if you can do a hole in one, that means you can hit the basket on your first try, then you'll only have one point. That's best. \nSarah: Uh-hmm. \nJohn: But I'm not that good at it. So usually, I have three or four points for each course. \nSarah: I see. You said disc golf is at the park. Do you have little kids playing in the middle of the course?\nJohn: Sometimes, the kids – of course, they can play wherever they want. And the courses do go though the park where kids play. So we have to be very careful, and we have to use good sportsmanship to wait for the course to be clear. \nSarah: It sounds like a lot of fun. \nJohn: It is fun. Maybe you can join us next time. \nSarah: That sounds great. Thank you.",

And actually I took the bus into Vietnam.\n                              \nTodd: OK. \nAbidemi: Yes. And in Vietnam, I traveled from the north, from Hanoi, to Ho Chi Minh City. But because my time was so short, I could only spend one or two days in each city.\nTodd: Ah! What city did you like the most?\nAbidemi: I think I prefer Hanoi the most. The food, the street food is amazing. It’s a very lively city, lots of motorcycles and traffic so it reminded me of Nigeria where I was born a little bit.\nTodd: Oh cool!\nAbidemi: Yes. \nTodd: And what did you do in Vietnam?\nAbidemi: I spent time in Hanoi. I also went to visit Sapa, which has a lot of rice terraces. So these are mountains where they’ve planted rice fields. So the scenery, the view is really beautiful. And you also get to meet the native people, the local people there. So I enjoyed it.\nAnd then from there I went to Hoi An, which is a very historical city, very beautiful night scenery by the river. And then I went to Ho Chi Minh City but I could only spend one night there before leaving for Myanmar. \nTodd: OK. And then, how was Myanmar? What did you do there?\nAbidemi: Myanmar was my last stop. And I didn’t have so much time there but I managed to go—but I managed to visit some of the places I really wanted to see like Yangon, Bagan, and Mandalay. \nI would say that Bagan was the highlight. They had many temples from the past and just seeing that many of them, it was very impressive.\nTodd: That’s fantastic. \nAbidemi: Yes. \nTodd: So what country was your favorite? \nAbidemi: It’s hard to say. They each have their own good points but I think I would definitely like to visit Thailand again.\nTodd: Oh OK. Thailand is such a great place. Anyway, thanks Abidemi. \nAbidemi: Thank you, Todd.",

Can I park my car?\nTodd: Ah, that's a problem. You can't park your car because there's no space, but there's a cheap parking lot about maybe two blocks away.\nKatie: OK. \nTodd: So, it's only a couple dollars a day.\nKatie: OK, I guess I can park my car there. How about cooking there? Can I cook?\nTodd: Of course, you can cook. I have a stove, a frigerator. You can bring your own food. You can do whatever you want.\nKatie: Excellent. Thank you. Can I use the Internet?\nTodd: You can use the Internet. There's a password. I will write down the password before I leave, and I will write down the password before you get there.\nKatie: Excellent.

Can he smoke outside?\nTodd: Yeah, he can smoke outside, just please pick up cigarette butts, but of course, he can't smoke inside.\nKatie: OK, he can't smoke inside.\nTodd: No.\nKatie: OK, how about if we want to have a party? Can we have a party?\nTodd: Yeah, you can have a party. That's OK, but please be quiet. Don't be too loud. The neighbors live very close to my house.\nKatie: Alright, that sounds good. Thanks. And I have one more question. Can I use the washing machine?\nTodd: Yeah, of course. You can use anything. You use the washing machine. You can use the Internet. You can use the TV. You can use anything you like.\nKatie: Wow, excellent. That sounds great.

I like to try new dishes and I love baking as well. \nTodd: Oh, nice. That's interesting. Because I hate cooking. \nMeg: Oh, really? \nTodd: Yeah. And I don't know anything about baking, but I like cleaning. Cleaning is relaxing. \nMeg: Really? Is that true? \nTodd: Yeah. Really, I like cleaning. So, my house is usually very clean. \nMeg: My house is usually clean also, but I don't like cleaning very much.\nTodd: Yeah, I think most people don't like cleaning. But some people think cleaning is relaxing. Like me.\nMeg: That's true. What else do you like to do?\nTodd: Well, I like exercising. I like going to the gym. I like listening to podcasts. So, I listen to a lot of podcasts a lot. I like surfing the internet. And sometimes, I enjoy reading books.\nMeg: I also enjoy reading books when I have time. \nTodd: But these days, I often listen to books instead. I listen to audiobooks.\nMeg: Oh really? \nTodd: Yeah, I like listening to audiobooks. \nMeg: Why? \nTodd: Because I can exercise at the same time. \nMeg: So, exercising and reading at the same time.\nTodd: Yeah, it's fun. So, I love jogging and I go jogging almost every day, usually for one hour. I listen to audiobooks when I jog.\nMeg: So, you can do two things at once. \nTodd: Very important. Multitasking. I love multitasking.\nMeg: Sounds like you're good at multitasking. \nTodd: Let's talk about outdoor activities. Do you like doing yard work?\nMeg: I don't especially like doing yard work. But right now, I don't have a yard. So, doing yard work isn't something I have to worry about. What about you?\nTodd: I like doing yard work. I think it's very relaxing. It's like cleaning. So, I enjoy it. But like you, I don't have a yard. So, now I don't do yard work very much. Or I can't do yard work.\nMeg: So, you like gardening if you have a yard? \nTodd: Yeah. I grew up on a big house. So, we have lots of yard work, lots of gardening. So, yeah.\nMeg: Right.\nTodd: But what about other things like hiking, do you like hiking?\nMeg: I love hiking. Anything that is in nature, I love doing. I love hiking. I love kayaking. I love canoeing. Any outdoor sports. Do you like hiking?\nTodd: I do. I'm with you. I love hiking. What about things like rock climbing? \nMeg: I have never been rock climbing. Have you gone rock climbing? \nTodd: No. Rock climbing looks dangerous. So, I'm still scared.\nMeg: Yeah,\nTodd: So, I've never done rock climbing either. What about things like singing and dancing? Do you enjoy singing and dancing?\nMeg: I enjoy singing, but I'm not very good at it. So, I like singing when I'm alone or in my car. Are you good at singing?\nTodd: No, I'm terrible at singing. So, I hate singing. I really, really hate singing. But I like going to karaoke and listening to people sing.\nMeg: Yeah, some people are really good at singing. What about dancing?\nTodd: I hate dancing too. Yeah, I'm not good at dancing. So, dancing is very embarrassing for me. I don't like it.\nMeg: I'm not good at dancing either. \nTodd: Are there any other activities you really dislike doing? Like for me, I hate writing letters. For example, I don't like writing thank you letters. I don't like writing anything with my hand. Typing is okay. I don't mind typing things, but I hate writing.\nMeg: So, using your hand to write, you hate writing?\nTodd: Yeah, I like typing. Fingers is okay. Thumb is okay on the phone. I don't mind texting, I don't mind typing. I just don't like physically writing with a pencil or a pen.\nMeg: Yeah. Pen or a pencil, like writing a letter.\nTodd: Right. Because my writing is really bad, and it's hard to read. So, it's embarrassing.\nMeg: I'm sure it's fine.\nTodd: Yeah. How about you? For example, do you like iron in your clothes?\nMeg: I don't like having my clothes, but my clothes usually don't need ironing, so I don't have to worry about it too much. I don't like doing laundry. It's related to ironing clothes. So, it takes a long time. And the clothes, I have to dry the clothes. So, doing laundry is a little bit boring for me.\nTodd: I don't mind doing laundry if I go to the coin laundry, but I hate hanging my laundry out. I hate hanging out my laundry. It takes forever. I don't know why, you put it out, you take it back in, it just takes so much time. \nMeg: That's funny. I'm kind of the opposite. I don't mind hanging out my laundry, because I like saving money, so I don't have to use money at the coin laundry. \nTodd: Plus, you are helping the environment.\nMeg: That's true. I like helping the earth.\nTodd: Yeah, I should change. Okay. Thanks Meg.\nMeg: Yeah.",

I waste so much money. \nAbidemi: How? \nTodd: Well, I don't buy things on sale. I don't use coupons. I buy anything I see. \nAbidemi: So, when I shop, I don't look at prices. I just see the food or the thing and I get it and I buy it and I pay for it. And, then it's sometimes very expensive, so I just waste money. I don't budget. I need to budget my money but I don't budget my money. \nTodd: What about you? Are you good at saving money? \nAbidemi: I don't think I'm too bad at saving money. I look at prices a lot. I also buy a lot of things on sale, so I'm able to save some money. \nTodd: So, you look for discounts?\nAbidemi: Yes, I do. \nTodd: Do you use coupons or special offers? \nAbidemi: No, I don't, but if I see some I will use them. \nTodd: So, do you waste money on anything? Like, maybe eating out, buying clothes, renting movies? \nAbidemi: I waste money on buying clothes. \nTodd: Oh, okay! \nAbidemi: But, I save a little bit because I buy them on sale. \nTodd: Ah, do you buy things online? \nAbidemi: No, I don't. I usually go into the stores to shop. \nTodd:               I'm good with clothes too, so I don't spend much money on clothes. I only shop maybe once a year. Or, I only shop if I need something, like it's really cold and I need a jacket. \nAbidemi: I see. \nTodd: And, I'm really bad, so I often only wear clothes people give to me. \nAbidemi: That's good! \nTodd: Yeah, so I get shirts or ties for Christmas gifts or a birthday gift, and I do that. My mom often asks ... every year, my mom asks, \"What do you want for Christmas?\", \"What do you want for your birthday?\" \nTodd: And I'll say, \"Underwear and socks\" or \"Socks and T-shirts\". And so, she buys them for me and then I don't have to buy them. \nAbidemi: Wow. Sounds like you're an easy person to give a present to. \nTodd: Yes, for clothes. Yes, for clothes. But, I waste money on computers and electronics and those things are expensive, so I buy a new computer every year. I have four computers now in my house. \nAbidemi: Wow. \nTodd: I have five mobile phones. \nAbidemi: Wow. \nTodd: I have an iPad. I have lots of electronic equipment. So, I spend so much money on those things. \nAbidemi: I waste money on traveling. \nTodd: Ah, yeah. \nAbidemi: Every year, I take about one or two trips to different countries, so that's where a lot of my money go. \nTodd: Yeah, traveling is expensive. \nAbidemi: Yes, yes. \nTodd: But, when you travel, do you save money? Do you stay at cheap hotels? Or, do you buy cheap plane tickets? \nAbidemi: I try to. I try to all the time. But, usually the plane ticket is so expensive that a lot of my savings is already gone. \nTodd: Yeah, I know. I buy my tickets online, usually with Expedia. And, it's cheap. It's pretty cheap. I waste money on food. I eat out almost every day. \nAbidemi: Wow. \nTodd: Or, I buy my dinner at the supermarket almost every day. Do you waste money on food? \nAbidemi: No, I don't. I usually get bored if I eat out too much, because even though I am not a very good cook, there are some thing that I cook that I like to eat. So, I would miss those things. So, no, I don't waste money on eating out. \n\nTodd: Ah, that's interesting. So, you save money, I waste money. You have to teach me your tricks. You have to teach me your tips on saving money. \nAbidemi: Please teach me how to get cheap travel tickets. \nTodd: It's a deal. \nAbidemi: Thanks.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Meg, I'm going to give you a test.\n                                \n                              Meg: Okay. \nTodd: It's a personality test. \nMeg: Uh-oh.\nTodd: And we want to know, are you a pack rat?\nMeg: Am I a pack rat?\nTodd: Right. Do you save things, do you keep things, or are you a minimalist? Do you have very few things in your house?\nMeg: Well, I think I try to be a minimalist, but I'm a little bit of a pack rat.\nTodd: Okay. We'll take the test, let's see. Okay, the first question is, how many books do you have in your house?\nMeg: Not counting Kindle?\nTodd: Not counting Kindle. Physical books, how many books do you have?\nMeg: Physical books, I think I have around 15 books. \nTodd: Oh. Oh. \nMeg: Is that a lot? \nTodd: That's bad.\nMeg: That's so many?\nTodd: Yeah. \nMeg: Really?\nTodd: So negative-\nMeg: Uh-oh.\nTodd: Negative ... Boo. Negative one means pack rat [crosstalk 00:00:58] positive one means minimalist. Okay. Next question. How many shoes do you have?\nMeg: Can I not answer that question?\nTodd: No. You have to say. \nMeg: Okay. I think I have 25 pairs of shoes.\nTodd: Oh my gosh. I'm giving you negative two points. \nMeg: No, just one.\nTodd: All right. Next question is, how many blankets do you have? \nMeg: Blankets? I think I have 10 blankets.\nTodd: Oh my gosh. I knew you were a pack rat. I knew it, I knew it. Now you're negative five. \nMeg: But you need blankets for the cold winter. \nTodd: You only need one blanket.\nMeg: But if you have friends visiting you, you need more blankets.\nTodd: Okay. \nMeg: I have a lot of friends.\nTodd: Wow. That's a good point. Okay, next question. How many umbrellas do you have?\nMeg: I think I have around five or six umbrellas.\nTodd: Wow. And you live alone, correct?\nMeg: Yes. I live alone. \nTodd: Okay. So a pack rat is somebody who does not get rid of things they don't need. So, do you need five umbrellas? \nMeg: I do need those umbrellas. \nTodd: Why do you need ...\nMeg: I'll tell you. I'll tell you why. One is a very small umbrella that's easy to carry. Another umbrella is very large for a really rainy day. A third umbrella is decorative and very pretty. The fourth umbrella is for the sun. And the fifth umbrella is clear, to use on a really windy day. \nTodd: That's interesting. Now, the fourth umbrella, for the sun, that's called a parasol, correct?\nMeg: I guess so, but that sounds a little old-fashioned. \nTodd: Okay. I won't consider that. I consider an umbrella for the rain only. So, we'll say four.\nMeg: Four. \nTodd: So let's just ...\nMeg: Do I get a point back?\nTodd: You do. But let's do a recap. You are single, you live alone.\nMeg: Yes.\nTodd: You have four umbrellas.\nMeg: Yes.\nTodd: You have 10 blankets.\nMeg: Yes. \nTodd: You have 25 pairs of shoes.\nMeg: Correct.\nTodd: And you have 15 books?\nMeg: 15 books. \nTodd: I'm sorry, Meg, but you qualify as a pack rat.\nMeg: Oh no.\nTodd: You are not a minimalist. We're taking away your minimalist membership. \nMeg: Oh. Well I guess I need to get rid of some things, huh? And what about you? Are you a pack rat or a minimalist? \nTodd: I'm pretty much a minimalist, I think, because I only have two bags of stuff. \nMeg: Only two bags?\nTodd: Yeah. So, you can take everything I have and put it in two big suitcases.\nMeg: So you don't have 15 books?\nTodd: No, I have maybe four books. \nMeg: Only four books.\nTodd: And they're very small paperback books. \nMeg: What about blankets?\nTodd: I have one blanket. \nMeg: Just one.\nTodd: Just one.\nMeg: So if visitors come to your house ...\nTodd: That is true. \nMeg: ... they're out of luck. \nTodd: When somebody comes to my house, I ask my neighbor to borrow a blanket. I do. Why?\nMeg: You borrow a blanket?\nTodd: ... is that funny? Yes. This is-\nMeg: Wow. \nTodd: I am such a minimalist, my friend told me, he said I am the only person that has ...\nMeg: One blanket. \nTodd: No. A spoon and a fork. \nMeg: A spoon and a fork?\nTodd: That's it. I have one.\nMeg: Okay. So basically, your house is not prepared for any visitors. \nTodd: That's true. \nMeg: Whereas my house is prepared for many visitors.\nTodd: That's true. \nMeg: Okay. Umbrellas? \nTodd: I have maybe two. \nMeg: Two. So why two?\nTodd: Because I can't remember if I have one or I will leave the house and I won't take it, and so then I need to buy one and then...\nMeg: And then you get rid of one?\nTodd: No, then I just never buy another one. I'm pretty good. \nMeg: Oh. \nTodd: Only two. \nMeg: Okay.\nTodd: But shoes?\nMeg: Shoes.\nTodd: I only have four pairs of shoes. \nMeg: What is the purpose of each pair of shoes?\nTodd: I have one pair of shoes for work. Nice dress shoes. I have two sneakers, one pair of sneakers for running, jogging, one pair of sneakers for fashion, and one pair of Futsal shoes for soccer. That's it. That's it. \nMeg: Wow. Well, I have to say, you really sound like a minimalist. \nTodd: Yeah, and you really sound like a pack rat.",
