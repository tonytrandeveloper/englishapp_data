Pictures can help you to remember things and then you don’t need to write so many words. Look.\nClare: That’s so good! The crown is for ‘King’ and the ‘H’ is for Henry. That’s cool. Then the heart is ‘love’ and a number six … well that is ehm … six.\nMark: Yes. So look at these notes. Let’s test your memory.\nClare: King Henry the Eighth was married six times.\nMark: Exactly!

As you can see, we’re on an open-top bus, so you can see all the attractions from your seat and you don’t need to walk anywhere. And please don’t worry about the rain, I’m sure it’ll stop soon. A-a-and please ask any questions at any time.\nTourist 1: I have a question.\nTour guide: Yes?\nTourist 1: Do you have extra umbrellas? I mean, if it rains a lot.\nTour guide: Err, no, we don’t have any extra umbrellas, but don’t worry, I’m sure the rain will stop soon. Right, OK, so where are we going on our wonderful tour? Well, the tour takes two hours and we are going to visit all the famous sites. First we’ll see Madame Tussauds, the museum with wax models of famous people and celebrities, then we’ll drive along the most famous shopping street in the world, Oxford Street. After that we’ll see the famous clock Big Ben and The Houses of Parliament. As we drive along the river you’ll see the popular attraction, the London Eye, from which you can see the whole city on a sunny day. Then we’ll see Tower Bridge and the famous Tower of London before arriving at Buckingham Palace, just in time for a cup of tea with the Queen.\nTourist 2: Is that included in the tour? A cup of tea with the Queen?\nTour guide: Err, well, no, not exactly, but there’s a lovely café near the palace where you can get a cup of tea. (Sound of a storm right overhead, loud thunder and very heavy downpour)\nTourist 1: I have another question.\nTour guide: Yes?\nTourist 1: Can we have our money back? We’re getting off the bus.\nTour guide: Err, well, you see ... Quick! Run! Everyone off the bus! ...",

        "transcript": "Girl: My presentation is about how you can use colour coding to organise your homework.\n\nTo start you need a few things from the stationery shop. This photo shows the things I use. They aren’t expensive. They are all cheap. I’ve got coloured pens and pencils, sticky notes, page markers, glue and folders. \n\nFirst, I choose a different colour for each school subject. The colour I choose has to be easy to remember so I make sure it means something to me. Maths is green because my ruler is green. PE is yellow because my trainers are yellow. \n\nHere is a photo of my folders. I use the cheapest kind and I add a coloured sticky note to the top and to the front. I keep all my notes inside the different folders. \n\nThis is a photo of some more sticky notes. I wrote them in the library when I was studying. The blue notes are for history. My history teacher has got a blue car! The black notes are for geography. One day I want to visit the Black Sea.\n\nThis photo shows the pages I need to read for homework. I use two coloured page markers to mark where it starts and ends. Those blue ones mark the pages I need to read for history. \n\nFinally, this last photo shows my wall calendar. This green star shows I have a maths test on Friday. This pink circle shows I’ve got French homework for Monday. It’s pink because ‘pink’ is ‘rose’ in French … and the rose is my favourite flower.\n\nHas anyone got any questions?",

Our shop sells clothes and accessories for men, women and children. I work in the children’s department. It can be crazy sometimes, but it’s fun.\n\nB\nI work during my summer holidays when I’m not at university. Oxford has thousands of tourists in the summer, so it’s easy to find a job as a tour guide. I take tourists to visit the university colleges and then we go down to the river. We go along the river on a boat. The tourists love the boat trip, but last summer one tourist fell in the river! I love meeting people from all over the world.\n\nC\nI like my job, but lots of people don’t like coming to see me because they hate dentists. Sometimes it’s very hard work, but it’s great to help people when they have a problem. It’s so important to look after your teeth.\n\nD\nMy job is very difficult, but I like it because I love flying. I fly planes that take people to different places on holiday. Most of the time I fly in Europe to places like Spain, Greece and Italy. The most difficult thing about my job is when the weather is bad. Snow and thunderstorms are the worst. The best thing is visiting different places.\n\nE\nI work in a hospital in the city centre. It’s a very big hospital. I help the doctors with the patients. I give them their medicine and look after them when they feel ill. I love my job but I don’t like the uniform and sometimes I have to work at night.",

        "transcript": "Hi, everyone. I know you're all busy so I'll keep this briefing quick. I have some important information about a change in the management team. As you already know, our head of department, James Watson, is leaving his position at the end of this week. His replacement is starting at the end of the next month. In the meantime, we'll continue with our projects as usual.\n\nI have two more quick points. Firstly, there will be some improvements made to the staff car park next month for a few weeks. It will be closed during that time.\n\nDon't worry, we've found a solution. We can use the local church car park until our own one is ready. If you arrive before 8.30 a.m., please use our small car park on Brown Street, and if you arrive after that, you should go directly to the church car park. It's only a five-minute walk away. But they need it in the evenings, so you have to leave before 6 p.m. Sorry about that – I know how much you all love working late!\n\nThe other thing I wanted to tell you about is that the canteen has now introduced a cashless payment system. So, you can't use cash for payments any more. You can pay directly with your smartphone or you can pay using your company ID card. The total amount put on your company ID card comes off your salary at the end of each month.\n\nOK. That's it? Are there any questions?",

I guess you're at work and you don't have your phone on, right? First of all, thank you, THANK YOU for the birthday card and message. I received it this morning. That's so nice of you. I'm organising a little party for my birthday. It's nothing very big – only a few of my best and closest friends. That means you too! We're going to have it at my cousin's house. She lives in the countryside in a nice big house with a swimming pool. I'd love to see you there. It's going to be this Friday. I'll send you the instructions on how to get there later, OK? \n\nAnyway, have fun at work. Don't work too hard, OK? Talk soon.\n\nAutomated message: You have two new messages. Message number two, received today at 5.15 p.m.\n\nAw, you're still not answering your phone! OK, here are the instructions to get to my cousin's house for the party. Are you going to take your car? If you take the car, drive straight on Forest Road until you get to the motorway. Drive past Brownsville and take exit 13A. That's 13A. You drive down the road there and turn left. It's the first big house on the right. OK? If you're taking a bus, you can get the number 80 to Brownsville. Call me when you get there and somebody can pick you up in a car. I can't wait. This is going to be so great!",

What did they say?\n\nWoman: Nothing much. At the end I asked them, 'What happens now?', and the woman said, 'We'll call you back with news in three or four days.'\n\nMan: Really?\n\nWoman: Yeah, I think I've got the job. There weren't a lot of other people there. I was the only interview that day, you know?\n\nMan: Well, good luck with it.\n\nB\nMan: Anyway, you were saying ...\n\nWoman: Oh, yeah, um ... let's see. Yes, so I was in the museum and there were, I don't know, a hundred people waiting to get into the room. Finally, I got in, and I tried to see the Mona Lisa but I couldn't look at it.\n\nMan: Why not?\n\nWoman: Because the room was filled with people taking photographs of it!\n\nMan: Oh, right.\n\nWoman: Yes! And selfies.\n\nMan: Wait a minute. You can take photos while you're in there?\n\nWoman: Yes, but you can't use flash. I don't know ... Why do we take photos of everything we see when we travel?\n\nMan: I know. And we never look at the photos after.\n\nWoman: Exactly! I'm tired of always taking photos. I don't feel I'm enjoying things.\n\nC\nMan: Who took this?\n\nWoman: I can't remember. Hmmm ...\n\nMan: What am I doing?\n\nWoman: You're sitting on the sofa, watching TV and eating chocolates. Nothing changes!\n\nMan: Ha! Very funny. You look very young, though.\n\nWoman: I know. Look at my hair – it was so long!\n\nMan: Mine too, look at me! Hey … I think I know who took this photo.\n\nWoman: Umm … who? Was it Dad?\n\nMan: No, it wasn’t Dad or Mum. Do you remember Barry?\n\nWoman: No.\n\nMan: Yes, YES! You do remember. Barry, your boyfriend at high school. You were seventeen and he was sixteen and he was so very polite: 'Hello, I'm Barry. It's very nice to meet you ...'\n\nWoman: Stop it! He was nice.\n\nMan: Yeah, well, he took the photo.\n\nD\nWoman: Let's see. OK. I'm glad we could talk about this. It's not easy to say.\n\nMan: What?\n\nWoman: Well, you're not in our group – for the class project.\n\nMan: What do you mean? You know I'm always in a group with you.\n\nWoman: I know. It's just that this time … this time we made the group differently and because you were late ...\n\nMan: I see. You don't want me in the group?\n\nWoman: No, no. It isn't that. It's that we've already made the group, see? There's four of us already.\n\nMan: So? We can't be a group of five?\n\nWoman: Well, the teacher said four people per group.\n\nMan: Oh.\n\nWoman: It's not about you or your work or anything like that. It's ... errrr ... well, we already have the group.\n\nMan: So I have to find another group.\n\nWoman: I'm sorry.",

Not the 19th, not the 28th, not two days later because your dog was ill or your computer broke – the 18th. If it's late, I won't mark it. I won't even read it – you'll fail the assignment! So, please hand it in on time. You can even hand it in early, if you like!\n\nYou can email me the essays at j.hartshorn@lmu.ac.uk. That's H-A-R-T-S-H-O-R-N. I'll reply to say I've got it. If I don't reply within a day, it might mean I didn't get it, so please email me again to make sure. You can also bring a paper copy of the essay to my office, but let's be kind to the trees, OK? Email is better for the trees and for me.\n\nDon't forget that you must reference every idea or quote you use that isn't your own idea. And the last page of your essay should be a list of all the books you used, in alphabetical order, not in the order you used them!\n\nAnd lastly, make it easy for me to read! That means use a clear font. Arial is best, but Times New Roman is fine too. Not Comic Sans please! Size 12 font for the essay, and size 14 for the titles and subheadings. And use page numbers.

You talked about Fibonacci numbers in the lecture. Sorry, I don't understand. Can you explain?\n\nProfessor: Of course. What do you want to know?\n\nStudent: OK … I hope this isn't a silly question, but what does Fibonacci actually mean?\n\nProfessor: No question is ever silly – it's always good to ask. OK, it's the name of a person. Fibonacci was a European mathematician in the Middle Ages.\n\nStudent: Ah, OK. Thanks. So, we know he was a person, but what are the Fibonacci numbers? I don't get it.\n\nProfessor: The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers. They go 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on. Do you see the sequence? Do you see how it works?\n\nStudent: I'm not sure.\n\nProfessor: OK. This is how it works. The first number is 1, then 1 again, then 2. The third number is the first number plus the second number. The fourth number is the second number plus the third number: 1 plus 2 is 3. The fifth number is the third number, 2, plus the fourth number, 3. So the fifth number in a Fibonacci sequence is 5.\n\nStudent: Ah! I think I understand now. But what about their importance? You said these were very important.\n\nProfessor: Yes, let me explain. This sequence of numbers is important because we see it in many things. Fibonacci numbers are common in geometry, they are common in nature, for example in plants. We see the sequence everywhere.\n\nStudent: Could you give us some more examples?\n\nProfessor: OK ... well, we don't have time right now but I can bring more examples in for next class, OK?",

I don't use coupons. I buy anything I see. So, when I shop, I don't look at prices. I just see the food or the thing and I get it and I buy it and I pay for it. And, then it's sometimes very expensive. So, I just waste money. I don't budget. I need to budget my money but I don't budget my money. What about you? Are you good at saving money?\n\nAbidemi: I don't think I'm too bad at saving money. I look at prices a lot. I also buy a lot of things on sale. So, I'm able to save some money.\n\nTodd: So, you look for discounts.\n\nAbidemi: Yes, I do.\n\nTodd: Do you use coupons or special offers?\n\nAbidemi: No, I don't, but if I see some I will use them.\n\nTodd: So, do you waste money on anything? Like, maybe eating out, buying clothes, renting movies?\n\nAbidemi: I waste money on buying clothes.\n\nTodd: Oh, okay!\n\nAbidemi: But, I save a little bit because I buy them on sale.\n\nTodd: Ah, do you buy things online?\n\nAbidemi: No, I don't. I usually go into the stores to shop.\n\nTodd: I'm good with clothes too. So, I don't spend much money on clothes. I only shop maybe once a year. Or, I only shop if I need something, like it's really cold and I need a jacket.\n\nAbidemi: I see.\n\nTodd: And, I'm really bad, so I often only wear clothes people give to me.\n\nAbidemi: That's good!\n\nTodd: Yeah, so I get shirts or ties for Christmas gifts or a birthday gift, and I do that. My mom often asks ... every year, my mom asks, \"What do you want for Christmas?\", \"What do you want for your birthday?\"\n\nAnd I'll say, \"Underwear and socks\" or \"Socks and T-shirts\". And so, she buys them for me and then I don't have to buy them.\n\nAbidemi: Wow. Sounds like you're an easy person to give a present to.\n\nTodd: Yes, for clothes. Yes, for clothes. But, I waste money on computers and electronics and those things are expensive. So, I buy a new computer every year. I have four computers now in my house.\n\nAbidemi: Wow.\n\nTodd: I have five mobile phones.\n\nAbidemi: Wow.\n\nTodd: I have an iPad. I have lots of electronic equipment. So, I spend so much money on those things.\n\nAbidemi: I waste money on traveling.\n\nTodd: Ah, yeah.\n\nAbidemi: Every year, I take about one or two trips to different countries. So, that's where a lot of my money go.\n\nTodd: Yeah, traveling is expensive.\n\nAbidemi: Yes, yes.\n\nTodd: But, when you travel, do you save money? Do you stay at cheap hotels? Or, do you buy cheap plane tickets?\n\nAbidemi: I try to. I try to all the time. But, usually the plane ticket is so expensive that a lot of my savings is already gone.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I know. I buy my tickets online, usually with Expedia. And, it's cheap. It's pretty cheap. I waste money on food. I eat out almost every day.\n\nAbidemi: Wow.\n\nTodd: Or, I buy my dinner at the supermarket almost every day. Do you waste money on food?\n\nAbidemi: No, I don't. I usually get bored if I eat out too much, because even though I am not a very good cook, there are some thing that I cook that I like to eat. So, I would miss those things. So, no, I don't waste money on eating out.\n\nTodd: Ah, that's interesting. So, you save money, I waste money. You have to teach me your tricks. You have to teach me your tips on saving money.\n\nAbidemi: Please teach me how to get cheap travel tickets.\n\nTodd: It's a deal.\n\nAbidemi: Thanks.",

Why?\n\nTodd: Well, she watches what she eats and she's very careful about the food she eats. So she doesn't eat meat, she doesn't eat fast food. She doesn't eat sugar. She doesn't drink coffee. So because she doesn't eat or drink all these foods, it's kind of hard if we go out to dinner or if I want to eat something because then I feel guilty.\n\nMeg: Do you also not eat those foods?\n\nTodd: No. Are you kidding? I mean, I always eat fast food and I love to eat sweets and stuff like that. So we both love exercise, right. So she exercises a lot. I exercise a lot. She exercises more than I do but yeah, the diet thing is kind of a hassle.\n\nMeg: Hmm.\n\nTodd: So what do you think I should do?\n\nMeg: Maybe you should also try to be healthy because it sounds like a good idea.\n\nTodd: Yeah, maybe. I'll give it a try. But the thing is, you know, she – there's one other problem. She eats five small meals a day, so never eats big meals. So we can't go to a restaurant and stuff like that. So it's just really hard to adjust. I mean, I love a big breakfast, you know. She never eats a big breakfast. She always eats these small little meals, so yeah.\n\nMeg: Well maybe, you can cook at home together.\n\nTodd: Maybe. Or maybe I should just get a new girlfriend.\n\nMeg: Maybe. Good luck.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Sarah, we have the holidays coming up. Are you going to do anything exciting?\n\nSarah: No, nothing exciting. I will just stay home most of the vacation, but there are a few things I'll do. I will bake a cake for Christmas. I will sing lots of Christmas songs with my children. We will sing together and video it. I want to send a video of us singing to grandparents. So we will sing Christmas songs, and we will videotape it. Then, we can send it to our grandparents. I think they will really like it.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's nice. So, will you have a big Christmas dinner?\n\nSarah: Yes, we have some things that we always eat. We'll have ham, and we'll have potatoes and cake, and my favorite thing is to cook fudge. I'll cook the fudge probably tomorrow night, and then we won't eat it until Christmas.\n\nTodd: Okay, oh cool.\n\nSarah: And it's really, it's really hard not to eat it, because it's so delicious, and everyone loves it. Every day, the children will ask me, \"Oh, can we eat it? Can we eat it?\" \"No, no, no, you can't eat it.\" We'll wait 'til Christmas to eat the fudge.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's good. I, I couldn't do that.\n\nSarah: What we won't do is, I won't do any work, and I won't do any chores like clean the house or do laundry. Those can wait until after Christmas, so I won't be working hard. I just want to relax. Todd, how 'bout you? What will you do?\n\nTodd: Well, I will get away. I don't like the cold, so I will go to Thailand, and I will stay there and just work actually.\n\nSarah: Oh.\n\nTodd: I will do stuff for Elllo. I will work on a book, a new book for Elllo, and I will just take it easy. I won't travel. I won't go to the beach. I won't go to the mountains. I won't do any of the touristy stuff. I will just take it easy, relax every day, and do what I call a workcation.\n\nSarah: Wow, what will the weather be like?\n\nTodd: Well, it's the best time of year in Thailand, so it's quite warm in December and January. It should be about, I don't know, 70, 80 degrees, 25 degrees Celsius., so it will be nice every day. It should be.\n\nSarah: Ah. Will you do anything special on Christmas Day?\n\nTodd: I won't. You know, usually, when I travel, I forget it's Christmas even sometimes. Obviously, I will see the decorations in the malls and things like that. But, I won't do anything on Christmas Day. They don't celebrate Christmas in Thailand. It's a Buddhist country, so it's a normal work day. Everybody will be going to work. All the shops will be open. It won't be different than any other day, so that will be nice.\n\nSarah: I see.\n\nTodd: So, I will be able to work like a normal day. I will probably call family and friends, and I will check Facebook and see what people are doing. But, I won't have a traditional Christmas.\n\nSarah: How about New Year's? Will they do anything special for New Year's?\n\nTodd: Yeah, in Bangkok, it gets really crazy on New Year's. But, even then, on New Year's, I probably won't do anything. I'm 49, so I've seen many, many New Year's. I'll probably just go out for a bit, and I'll probably be back home before midnight, actually. I won't do anything crazy. How 'bout you? What will you do for New Year's?\n\nSarah: Well, I have three kids, so my husband and I will probably stay home too. We like to have some fun. My husband bought crab, so we will eat crab for New Year's. I love champagne, so I'll have some champagne. We'll probably have a big, delicious dinner, and I'll drink some champagne. The kids will probably go to sleep at 10:00. Then, a little after midnight, I'll go to sleep too, so nothing exciting.\n\nTodd: Yeah, so, yeah, it sounds like we have pretty tame plans.\n\nSarah: Definitely.\n\nTodd: But, at least, I will be warm.\n\nSarah: Yes.",

I really want to take - you know - a rest, and then I'm going to have lunch with my family cause I haven't seen them for awhile, and then in the afternoon, there's this movie I really want to see, so I'm going to the cinema with my friends.\n\nPart 2: Hana talks about her plans.\n\nDaniel: Hey, Hana how are you?\n\nHana: I'm fine thank you.

        "transcript": "Winter Vacation\nAkane and Howard talk about their winter vacations.\n\nAkane's Vacation\nLast year, I went to Portugal just after Christmas. And I stayed there until… well, just after New Year's this year. In Portugal, I met up with one of my friends from Toronto. He had family that lived in Portugal, because his family was originally from Portugal.\n\nSo, they were kind enough to let me stay with them. I didn’t know any Portuguese, except for some simple words like “hello”, and “thank you”. I learned some simple words through an audio CD, before I went there. And the people that I stayed with didn’t know very much English either. However, we got along surprisingly well.\n\nThey were surprised that I was able to eat some of their exotic foods. They made some delicious meals every single day, like octopus, tripe and rabbit. It is quite exotic, but I thought it was quite good. They also made some excellent desserts, like crème caramel, and a rich sponge cake that they call Paon d’lo.\n\nHoward's Vacation\nOK, now I'll talk about my winter vacation. This winter vacation I spent two weeks in my hometown which is Daytona Beach, Florida. It was wonderful. The weather was warm every day. It was sunny every day and the temperature was almost 80 degrees.\n\nI visited my mother and I spent every morning having a nice leisurely cup of coffee and reading the newspaper and after that I got my bicycle out and and rode down to the beach and enjoyed the sun and the surf, and came back home and read a book and went to bed early.\n\nI had a wonderful time. I saw a couple of new movies, when I was home in Florida. I saw The Aviator and also an interesting movie called Spanglish, which I hope you all can see because it's an interesting movie about English and the Spanish.",

No, my dad is from San Francisco.\n\nAimee: So, your dad is from San Francisco and your mom is from Los Angeles.\n\nTodd: Yes, that's right.\n\nAimee: Okay, so which city is better?\n\nTodd: Ooh, wow. They both are great American cities. They are very, very different. I think San Francisco is better but I think people in LA think LA is better. So it's tough. Yeah.\n\nAimee: So, is LA bigger than San Francisco?\n\nTodd: Yes, it is much, much much bigger. LA is huge. It is about 10 million people, maybe more.\n\nAimee: That is huge.\n\nTodd: Yeah. San Francisco is only one million people.\n\nAimee: Oh, that's tiny.\n\nTodd: Yeah, it's much smaller than LA.\n\nAimee: Okay.\n\nTodd: Yeah, much smaller.\n\nAimee: Okay. And is LA more expensive than San Francisco.\n\nTodd: I don't think so. LA is expensive but San Francisco is more expensive. San Francisco is maybe the most expensive city in the US. Because of Google, Yahoo, Apple, all these famous companies.\n\nAimee: Yes, they are big companies.\n\nTodd: So it's big, there's many rich companies there and the space is very small so it's expensive.\n\nAimee: Right, okay. And so about the weather? Is LA warmer than San Francisco?\n\nTodd: Yeah, it's much warmer. It's much, much warmer. LA has beautiful weather so most days it's warm, no clouds, maybe 25 degrees Celsius.\n\nAimee: That sound so nice.\n\nTodd: Or above. Beautiful. San Francisco is much colder and it's much wetter. It rains a lot in San Francisco.\n\nAimee: I know that. What about the looks? Is LA prettier than San Francisco?\n\nTodd: No, not at all.\n\nAimee: No?\n\nTodd: No, not at all. San Francisco is much prettier. LA is pretty but San Francisco much prettier. It's near the sea, it's near nature. It has lots of beautiful buildings downtown. I think San Francisco is prettier but maybe people in Los Angeles think LA is prettier but I don't think so.\n\nAimee: Okay. You disagree with them.\n\nTodd: I do disagree.\n\nAimee: So how are those people? Are the people nicer in LA?\n\nTodd: I don't think so. I think the people in San Francisco are friendlier. People in Los Angeles are a little reserved. They are not as friendly.\n\nAimee: There are more people really.\n\nTodd: There are, it is true. It's a big city. I think people are nicer and more easy going in San Francisco.\n\nAimee: Okay. So now that we have talked about it, is LA better than San Francisco?\n\nTodd: No. No. I think, yeah, somebody from LA will disagree but I will say this, Los Angeles is maybe more exciting and is more interesting than San Francisco. There's lots to do there. It has the beach and it has lots of cool places like Disneyland. So LA is a really great place.\n\nAimee: LA has hills for hiking too, doesn't it?\n\nTodd: A little bit, not close. Actually San Francisco is closer to nature and hiking.\n\nAimee: Is it?\n\nTodd: Yeah.\n\nAimee: Okay, I didn't know that.\n\nTodd: So, you can choose on my description which city sounds more interesting.\n\nAimee: I want to go to both but I think I would prefer to go San Francisco.\n\nTodd: Yay. We need more people. No actually we don't need more people.",

Yeah, I was born there and I lived in the city for many years.\n\nSarah: Cool. What is the most interesting thing about your city?\n\nTodd: Well, San Francisco has many interesting things, but the most interesting thing is probably the architecture. There’s lots of very unique buildings. And the most unique building is probably the Trans-America building. It’s a building like a pyramid. It’s nice.\n\nSarah: Well, that’s really cool.\n\nTodd: Uh-hmm.\n\nSarah: What is the most expensive area in San Francisco?\n\nTodd: Well, it is very, very expensive. The most expensive area is a place called Pacific Heights, and it’s on the highest hill in San Francisco and it overlooks the Bay. It’s a really, really beautiful place.\n\nSarah: Hmm.\n\nTodd: That area by far has the best views of the city.\n\nSarah: Hmm, what is the most beautiful place in San Francisco?\n\nTodd: Well, actually the most beautiful place is outside the city. It’s a place called Muir Woods. And it has the tallest trees in the world, and some of these trees are really old. They are the oldest trees in North America. Some of them are over 2,000 years old.\n\nSarah: Wow. It sounds like some place I would like to see. So it sounds really expensive. Where is the cheapest place to live?\n\nTodd: The cheapest place to live is a place called Sunset. And Sunset is on the west side, and the houses are kind of old and they’re a little bit cheap. But one thing about Sunset is it has nicest view of the ocean, and you could watch the sunset every night. That’s why it’s called the Sunset area.\n\nSarah: Hmm. If I wanted to go there, when is the best time to visit?\n\nTodd: Well, the best time is probably in the fall because that’s when the weather is the nicest. It’s not too cold, and it’s not too hot. And it doesn’t rain that much.\n\nSarah: So when would be the worst time to visit?\n\nTodd: The worst time to visit would be probably February and March, because February and March are the coldest and wettest months. So – well, March isn’t that cold but sometimes it’s wet, so it rains a lot.\n\nSarah: Wow. That sounds really great. I want to go there.\n\nTodd: Yeah, you should. It’s great place.",

        "transcript": "Sarah: John, I've never met your family. Do you have a big family?\n\nJohn: Yeah, kind of. There are five people in my family, so it's a medium family. I have two brothers, so there are three boys in my family. And there's my mother and my father.\n\nSarah: How about your father? Do you look like him?\n\nJohn: Yes, I do. I do look like my father. When he was younger. He had blond hair like me and he has glasses. So do I. My mother has glasses, too. I'm the same height as my father. We are both 180 centimeters tall. My older brother is the same height as me and my father. But my younger brother is shorter than us.\n\nSarah: Ah.\n\nJohn: He has blond hair and glasses too, though.\n\nSarah: Oh. How tall is your younger brother?\n\nJohn: He's a bit shorter than us. I am not sure but I think he's around 170 centimeters tall.\n\nSarah: Oh. How about your mom?\n\nJohn: My mom is short, too. She's the same height as my younger brother.\n\nSarah: Oh.\n\nJohn: And my mom has red hair. Her hair is bright red, so my mother has different hair from the rest of my family. There are four people with blond people with blond hair and one person with red hair. But actually, all five of us wear glasses.\n\nSarah: Oh really?\n\nJohn: Yeah.\n\nSarah: So John, you're thin. What about the rest of your family? Are they thin, too?\n\nJohn: Well, my mother is skinny, too, like me. But my brothers are more like my dad in their body type. They are a little bit more muscular than me. They have big muscles and they're very strong. So they are heavier than me. That's my father. He weighs more than I do. And my brothers are also heavier than me.\n\nSarah: Oh, sounds like a good-looking family.\n\nJohn: Thank you.\n\nSarah: So John, you told me about me about your family's appearance. What about their personality?\n\nJohn: Well, all five people in my family have different personalities.\n\nYeah. My younger brother is really fun. It's great to spend time with him. For example, we usually play video games together. He likes to play racing games or sports games, and also, we play card games or just watching TV. He's so funny.\n\nNo matter what we're doing, he tells jokes and I love listening to him tell jokes about whatever we're doing at the time. And he's so cheerful and bright. He's always open to new people and new ideas. So I really like spending time with him. He makes me feel cheerful, too when we talk together.\n\nSarah: That's great. How about your older brother?\n\nJohn: Well, my older brother, he's a really good guy. He's not so entertaining like my younger brother but he's very smart. He's really serious. He likes to study and read. For example, he likes reading the Greek philosophers. He likes reading about Plato and Socrates. And he's always talking about philosophy. I like that stuff, too. I think it's interesting but he's not very funny.\n\nSarah: I see. How about your dad?\n\nJohn: My dad. Let's see, what can I say about my dad's personality? He's a hard worker. He's very devoted to everything he tries. He was raised on a farm so he knows a lot about animals. And now, he has a farm as a hobby. My dad raises horses and chickens. He loves animals and he has so many animals but he doesn't think of them as farm animals, they're his pets and he loves them.\n\nHe spends everyday outside where no matter what the weather, because he has to take care of his family, which is all of his animals. And he's a really smart guy. Maybe a bit serious at times. His sense of humor is maybe like you can imagine from an old man.\n\nSarah: I see. How about your mother? What's she like?\n\nJohn: My mother loves to read horror novels.\n\nSarah: Really?\n\nJohn: Yeah, horror books. So she knows a lot of stuff about crime or mysteries or police dramas and lawyers. She loves that stuff. So my mother is very interested in those kind of books and movies and TV shows, too. So she's kind of like a detective. My mother is very smart and enjoys solving puzzles.\n\nSarah: Wow. It sounds like an interesting family.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Meg, we are talking about clothes, and you always look nice at work. You have a very nice fashion sense.\n\nMeg: Oh, thank you.\n\nTodd: So you must go shopping a lot.\n\nMeg: I do go shopping sometimes. It's fun to go shopping and buy new clothes especially when it's a new season.\n\nTodd: Like what do you like to wear per season? For example, what do you like to wear in winter?\n\nMeg: In the winter, it's pretty cold, so I like to wear sweaters. Sometimes, a t-shirt with a sweater over it to stay warm. Lots of long-sleeve shirts. I like to wear long-sleeve shirts, and I still wear skirts in the winter, so sometimes, I wear tights underneath the skirts to stay warm.\n\nTodd: What about dresses? Do you like to wear dresses?\n\nMeg: I do like to wear dresses. In the winter, it's a good time actually to wear sweater-dresses. They're warm and a dress, so it's nice for work.\n\nTodd: Sweater-dresses.\n\nMeg: Have you seen a sweater-dress before?\n\nTodd: I have no idea what a sweater-dress is. What is a sweater-dress?\n\nMeg: It's a dress but made of sweater material.\n\nTodd: Ah.\n\nMeg: So sweater-cloth made into a dress. So it's very warm.\n\nTodd: Okay. I was picturing a sweater with a skirt attached to it.\n\nMeg: [Laughs] You might find that, but I think a sweater-dress is a little different.\n\nTodd: Okay. What about… What about in the summer?\n\nMeg: In the summer, I love to wear flip-flops. It's my favorite thing to wear. So I often wear flip-flops with jeans or shorts, skirts again. I don't wear tights in the summer because it's too hot.\n\nTodd: Right. Do you wear flip-flops to work?\n\nMeg: I can't wear flip-flops to work. So when I go to work, I often wear high heels or flats, some dress shoes.\n\nTodd: Okay. So do you like to wear shorts or skirts. Which do you prefer?\n\nMeg: I prefer shorts because it's more comfortable and easy to move around. But I also can't wear shorts to work. So I have many summer skirts for work.\n\nTodd: Okay. Now, let's talk about shoes. So women often have many types of shoes, high heels, boots, flats, like you just said, sneakers. So what kind of shoes besides flip-flops do you like to wear?\n\nMeg: I do have many pairs of shoes and so I like to wear flats and sandals especially in the summer. In the winter, I like to wear boots and rain shoes when it rains or rain boots. When I'm exercising, I like to wear sneakers or tennis shoes because it's good for your feet.\n\nTodd: Oh right. Now you travel a lot, we both travel a lot. What shoes do you usually take when you travel?\n\nMeg: When I travel, I usually take flats because they're easy to remove at the airport and they're light and convenient for traveling.\n\nTodd: Oh, right.\n\nMeg: What shoes do you usually use?\n\nTodd: Just my sneakers. So my sneakers I wear everywhere. Now, women sometimes have accessories, you know, like earrings, necklaces, scarves, things like that. What do you like to wear?\n\nMeg: I like to wear necklaces especially long necklaces. I don't like necklaces that are too short. It feels uncomfortable. I don't like to wear bracelets or a watch because I don't like anything on my wrist, but I do love to wear rings. I usually wear one ring each hand, just for fashion, not for anything special.\n\nTodd: Oh that's nice. Cool. Well anyway, thanks, Meg.\n\nMeg: Thank you.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Sarah, what are your plans for the weekend?\n\nSarah: I have really fun plans this weekend. On Saturday I'm meeting some friends, and we're going to hike up a nearby mountain. It's called Mount Tsurumi, and I think it'll be really fun.\n\nTodd: Oh, cool. How are you getting up the mountain? How are you getting up to the hiking point?\n\nSarah: We're going to take the bus probably. So we'll take a bus until the base of the mountain, and then we can hike to the top. We'll hike about four or five hours, depending on how much time I spend resting, which is a lot.\n\nTodd: So, who is going with you?\n\nSarah: I'm meeting three friends, and they're all English teachers like me. My friend's names are Hannah, Ben, and Michael.\n\nTodd: Oh, nice. I'm sorry, where are you hiking again?\n\nSarah: We're hiking at the mountain called Mount Tsurumi. It's pretty close to my house, it's not far. So, I can see it from my window, my bedroom window, and I always think, \"Oh, I would love to go to the top of that mountain.\" I'm really happy on Saturday to go and hike the mountain. Then, after we reach the top, we take the cable car down the mountain.\n\nTodd: Oh, I see. So you're hiking up the mountain, and then you're taking the cable car down?\n\nSarah: Yes. It'll probably be six hours in total between hiking, and resting, and cable car back down.\n\nTodd: Oh, wow. What time are you starting?\n\nSarah: We're starting at 10 O'Clock. We're starting at 10 O'Clock so that we can finish at 4 O'Clock and I can still get my children from school. Their school finishes at 5 O'Clock.\n\nTodd: Oh, wow. So you're really pushing it.\n\nSarah: Yeah. The timing will be tight, but I think it'll be okay.\n\nTodd: Cool.\n\nSarah: How about you Todd, what are you doing on Saturday?\n\nTodd: This weekend I'm not really doing anything. I think I'm just going to stay home, so I'm leaving for Thailand on Thursday. I'm flying out of [inaudible 00:02:19].\n\nSarah: That sounds really nice.\n\nTodd: Yeah. But actually now that I think of it, I am doing something on Saturday. My friend is having a dinner party, so I'm planning on attending that. That should be fun.\n\nSarah: Oh, that sounds fun. What time does it start?\n\nTodd: I think it starts at about 8. So, most people will probably be there around 8 O'Clock. I'm not planning on staying that long, so I'm just going to go and make a short appearance and then come back.\n\nTodd: Now, we are teachers, so we have grading to do. Are you doing any work this weekend, are you grading any papers?\n\nSarah: Yes. I'm grading some papers. My students are handing in their papers tomorrow, and then I'm grading them all day Sunday.\n\nTodd: Yikes.\n\nSarah: Yeah, so it won't be exciting, but I think if I work hard, I should be able to finish them.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I'm in the same boat actually, I have lots of papers to grade. And I want them finished, so I think I will do it on Friday night. I'm planning on staying late Friday and just doing it then.\n\nSarah: Okay.\n\nTodd: I'm not looking forward to it.\n\nSarah: So you'll be grading all night on Friday?\n\nTodd: I'll be grading all night on Friday, I won't be doing anything fun. But, I'll be leaving on Sunday, so it'll be worth it.\n\nSarah: Okay, have fun, have a good trip.\n\nTodd: You too, enjoy the hike.\n\nSarah: Thanks.",

How about you?\n\nDaniel: Well, I don’t really cook that often. I’m really busy during the week. So, I always just get something at the shop and get that. But, during the weekends, I always cook during the weekends because I really like making food. That’s what I do.\n\nHana: So, do you ever eat out?\n\nDaniel: Only occasionally, because I’m really busy during the week, and I prefer cooking, so not really often. I don’t go out really often to eat. Whenever I’m tired, and I don’t have time to cook during the week, I go and eat out with a friend, so! And you?\n\nHana: Well, I always , so I normally go and eat out during the weekend with my friends or family.\n\nDaniel: So do you ever buy take-away?\n\nHana: No, I never. Normally when I go out to eat, I like to sit and enjoy my food. How about you?\n\nDaniel: Well, that's really nice. Of course, I do like to sit and enjoy my food, but I have to admit that occasionally I have to buy take-away, especially when I'm coming late from work, and I'm driving. I'm so hungry that, most of the time, I don't really make it home, so I have to buy something on my way, and that's a shame, so that's the way it is.\n\nAnd do you usually have people over for dinner?\n\nHana: Yes, I sometimes do. I really like cooking so occasionally I invite my friends over and cook for them or we all cook together. How about you?\n\nDaniel: Not really. I do love cooking, but the problem is my place is really small, so even though I want to invite my friends. I never do it, because my place would only fit one or two people. So unfortunately, I never have my friends over for dinner.",

So I want to buy some computer stuff. Is there a computer store?\n\nKatie: There are two computer stores.\n\nTodd: Really? Ooh, that's good.\n\nKatie: There's a computer store on the first floor, and then very close to that there's also a Mac store.\n\nTodd: Ooh, that's perfect. I want to buy a new Mac.\n\nKatie: Oh, me too.\n\nTodd: They're so expensive, though.\n\nKatie: Mm-hmm.\n\nTodd: Okay, what about books? I really like books. Is there a bookstore with English books?\n\nKatie: There's a huge bookstore on the fourth floor.\n\nTodd: Ooh, that's good.\n\nKatie: It's really big. And there are lots of English books you can read there.\n\nTodd: Oh, great. Nice. And how about the food there?\n\nKatie: The food's okay. There's a big food court on the third floor, and you can get a variety of food. You can get a Subway.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's good. I love sandwiches. Is the food good there, though?\n\nKatie: They don't have any sandwiches that I like, basically.\n\nTodd: Oh, really. Okay. So what else is there at the mall?\n\nKatie: Oh, there's so much at the mall. There's a café on the ground floor.\n\nTodd: Oh, nice.\n\nKatie: If you like drinking coffee.\n\nTodd: I do. I like to go and study and just relax.\n\nKatie: That's the perfect place for you, then.\n\nTodd: I like to people watch.Yeah, that sounds good. Maybe we can watch a movie.\n\nKatie: Oh, it's a great people-watching place.\n\nTodd: Oh, cool.\n\nKatie: The windows are really big, and you can see out onto the street.\n\nTodd: Oh, cool. What else is there? Is there a movie theater?\n\nKatie: Mm-hmm. There's a movie theater on the fourth floor.\n\nTodd: Oh, great. Now, do they have English movies?\n\nKatie: They have English and Japanese movies.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's good. I should watch some Japanese movies too.\n\nKatie: They're interesting.\n\nTodd: And how about food? I hear there's a new supermarket, a big supermarket there.\n\nKatie: It's pretty big. And you can get lots of food there. It's on the first floor.\n\nTodd: Okay. Is there anything else I should see?\n\nKatie: What about the roof garden?\n\nTodd: Oh, what is the roof garden?\n\nKatie: It's on the fifth floor, and it's, well it's on the roof, and you can see a beautiful view of the city. And there's also places for you to sit and just enjoy the view.\n\nTodd: Oh, nice. A roof garden, I like that.\n\nKatie: It's really nice.\n\nTodd: Now, do you buy clothes at the mall? Do they have nice clothing shops?\n\nKatie: Yeah, they have nice clothing shops. Some of them are a little bit expensive.\n\nTodd: Ah, yeah.\n\nKatie: And I like buying cheap clothes.\n\nTodd: Okay. When's a good time to go?\n\nKatie: I think the best time to go is probably weekdays.\n\nTodd: Okay. Why?\n\nKatie: If you go on the weekend, there are so many children there.\n\nTodd: Oh.\n\nKatie: Ugh. It's hard to walk around.\n\nTodd: Yeah, and we're teachers, we teach kids all day.\n\nKatie: Mm-hmm.\n\nTodd: Okay. I don't want to go then.\n\nKatie: No, me neither.\n\nTodd: Well, I want to go there next week, maybe Thursday night.\n\nKatie: Okay.\n\nTodd: Do you want to join me?\n\nKatie: Yeah, that sounds good. Maybe we can watch a movie.\n\nTodd: Cool. I'll buy you dinner.\n\nKatie: Sounds great.",

I was born there. \n                        \nMy folks are British. My dad is from Manchester and my mom is from Scotland. They went out a long time ago. Yeah, growing up in Zimbabwe was \"lacker\" as we say there. That means really cool in Africans. \nIt was like you grow up in a big open free place with animals and sunshine and it's just a really healthy place to be. Well at least it was. Today it's not doing too well because the economy has crashed but growing up there was really slick. \nTodd: Wow! What animals could you see?\nLeath: Just about an hours drive out of any city, you are able to come across just about anything. I've seen leopards often at night about an hour out of the capital where I live. You see monkeys along the road, right up to the city outskirts. In certain areas you'll have to stop for elephants. There's quite a few buck warning signs because they are actully quite dangerous at night. They jump across the road and your cars hit them at windscreen height. It is a bit of a problem. So, there's buck everywhere. Away from residential areas, there's you know your big five, rhino, lion being the most... well interesting and I guess for foreigners. They are never really never around human settlement cause they are very very dangerous. They do take people from time to time. \nTodd: Wow! That's fascinating.

Why did you get it?\n\t\t                Jason: I got the tattoo because I used to actually work as a tattooist, a long time ago but now I stopped that, so I can come traveling. I designed the tattoo myself. I drew it onto paper then I got my friend to actually tattoo it onto my body. I got a wolf really because I really love animals, and a wolf is my favorite animal.\n\t\t                Todd:So, you drew the tattoo.\n\t                    Jason: I drew the tattoo, yeah.\n\t                    Todd:Did it hurt when it was being sketched in your body?\n                        Jason: Yeah, it did hurt, but tattoos can vary in amounts of pain depending where on your body it was. The chest is probably the worst place, which is where my tattoo is, so it hurt.\n                        Todd:Why is the chest the worst place?\n                        Jason: Because there's not much meat there, kind of, because there is a lot of bone.

Why don't you talk about that for awhile.\n\t\t                Jason: OK, well, London is a little bit colder that Japan, it's a little bit more expensive as well, so it is kind of nice to come here and spend my money.\n\t\t                Todd: So actually, you said South London right? Is that where Wimbleton is? South London?\n\t                    Jason: Wimbleton, No! Wimbleton's in West London.\n\t                    Todd: West London!\n                        Jason: Yeah. South London isn't famous for much, really, apart from rude people like me.\n                        Todd: So what's the difference between South London and West London and North London?\n                        Jason: Yeah, there is a big difference between all the places in London. Everyone's got different accents. Everyone acts differently. England has a lot of different places. For example, in North England they'll have different accents, completely different accents, from South England and sometimes even different languages, like in Wales and Scotland, so.\n                        Todd: So your accent is South London.\n                        Jason: My accent is South London, yeah. Someone from North London would sound completely different from me, and West London and so on, so.\n                        Todd: So is South London the best place to live?\n                        Jason: Oh, yeah, of course. Actually, Central London would be but it is way too expensive, kind of like Tokyo.\n                        Todd: OK. Were you born in South London?\n                        Jason: Yeah, I was born in South London. Yeah. But, you know, I've been everywhere in England, so and believe me there's a lot of different places, everywhere is different, so .",

I'm gonna have about one week.\n\t\t                Jason: One week. What I suggest you do then is stay in the suburbs of London for a start, because it's a lot cheaper. If you stay in North London then you can spend all your money on rent.\n\t\t                 And I guess you should go around Central London. That's where all the tourist attractions are. That's where all the nightlife is. It's just got everything you need really, but like I said rent is way too expensive there, so.                              \n\t                    Todd: OK, now I was thinking of taking a day trip to Oxford or Cambridge or Bath. What would you recommend?\n\t                    Jason: It depends really. Bath has got a lot of history. I guess Oxford is a lot quieter, but again there is a lot of nightlife there as well. It really depends what you want to do, but Bath is good for history, definitely.\n                        Todd: OK. What about Cambridge?\n                        Jason: Cambridge I'm not too sure about. I haven't been there so.\n                        Todd: Oh, really. OK. If I want to go to Oxford or to Bath, how can I get there? Do I have to drive?\n                        Jason: The easiest way is to get a train. It can vary how much you wanna pay really. It's kind of similar to Japanese trains. But traveling as far as Cambridge and Bath would be quite expensive, maybe 30 pounds, which is quite a lot of money really, so.",

And what internet websites do you listen to?\n                        Kerri: Well, usually it is just AP news or whatever.\n                        Todd: OK. How much of the news do you think is true?\n                        Kerri: I don't know. That's a tough question. I think that because there're so many journalists that often what makes into the papers is fairly accurate, but unfortunately some people leak information that is untrue to sway public opinion, so you have to kind of weed through things and consider why that news story is made public.\nTodd: Yeah. How do most people in your country get the news?\n                        Kerri: I think most people in the states get the news from TV and from the main broadcasting stations. The evening news sort of thing.\n                        Todd: OK. Thanks Keri.",

There are about four million people who live in Wales. It's a bit like Japan. It's quite cold in the winter. Not much snow. But lots of sheep there. And the people are quite friendly. I suppose it is quite a poor area. Not many rich people. A lot of people are farmers. And a lot of people are miners. They coal. They mine for coal. But it is a very beautiul land. Lots of mountains. So I like it. The weather is cold. Even in summer it is not too hot. So if you do surfing or windsurfing, which I do, you have to be very very brave. Yeah, but please come and visit Wales.",

The first time I lost my wallet\n                                I was in a taxi cab going home late at night and\n                                my wallet slipped out of my pocket and I\n                                didn't notice. \nThe second time I lost my wallet I went to a\n                                night club with my friends and I drank too much\n                                and I wasn't paying attention and I left my wallet\n                                on the counter of the bar. The third time I lost\n                                my wallet, I was hiking in a mountain region in\n                                Japan and I went into a small convenience store on\n                                the way home and I bought an ice-cream and I left\n                                my wallet on the counter and forgot about it. The\n                                fourth time I lost my wallet, I was in Ueno\n                                station, a really, really busy station in Tokyo\n                                and I left my wallet on the counter at a\n                                supermarket, and the most amazing thing is that I still have the same wallet. \nIn each of these instances I got my\n                                wallet back. In two of the cases, the person at\n                                the store called me and I just had to go back to\n                                the store and get it. In one instance, the person\n                                that ran the convenient store in the\n                                mountains mailed me my wallet, and another time I\n                                had to go to the police station and pick it up, but I think that says a lot about Japanese people.\n                                They're very, very honest and sometimes I think\n                                maybe Japan is the only country in the world where\n                                you could lose your wallet four times and still\n                                get it back.",

        "transcript": "One of my earliest memories involves my granddad and his garden. He had a huge garden when I was growing up. It was, I mean, it was more of a field than a garden really it was so big. He had lots of fruit trees, like fruit bushes, like elder berries, black berries, raspberries. He had strawberries as well, gooseberries, so every berry you could think of. He also had, let me see, apple trees and cooking apple trees, and he had lots of vegetables too as well like rhubarb, onions and lettuce, anything you could think of. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      When I was a little girl I didn't really like vegetables all that much to be honest, but I did love helping him pick his strawberries when they came in the summer. Strawberries always taste better when they are warm and from the sun, and you can pick them and put them straight in your mouth, beautiful. One of my funniest memories, though, well when I look back on it now, it's funny, is of helping my granddad when he was planting his onions one year, so I was staying with him for awhile and he said, \"OK Marion today we're going to go and we're going to plant some onions,\" in the spring.                               \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      So I went out and I was only I think about 5 years old, but I wanted to help so both of us went out and we planted two rows of onions, so he planted one row and I planted the other, or he really planted most of them I think. But I tried to help anyway, even though I was quite small, so then we did our job that day and I didn't really think anymore of it, until the onions started to grow and then suddenly they were ready to be harvested, or whatever, to be picked from the ground, and you could see that the stalks were growing nice and tall. We were out in the garden one day, my granddad and I again so it must have been a good few months later, further towards autumn, and my granddad came over and showed me the onion stalks and he said, \"Look Marion! The ones you planted are way bigger than the ones that I planted.\"                               \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      And I was so happy with myself. So happy that the job that I had done was better than even my granddad, who was a great gardener and now when I look back I realize, you know that wasn't really the case. That he was just saying it to make me feel better, and to make me proud of the work I'd done with him, but at the time it really worked. I was really, really so proud to have helped my granddad, the gardener, and to have done a better job than he did. I still wouldn't eat the onions though.",

Be strong and brave about it. So they were approaching the graveyard and suddenly my granddad saw what he thought was a priest sitting on the wall. So he say a man dressed in black, with a white collar, and he was so frightened, I mean, I can't imagine what he must have said at the time, but he and his friend were really, really scared, and they were talking between themselves, \"Oh, my God! What should we do? What should we do?\" but they were so frightened they couldn't move. So eventually, my granddad decided, OK, I'm just going to run for it. I'm going to make a run for it. So all of a sudden, he decided and he just ran straight past the graveyard, and then suddenly, this big dog came jumping down from the wall of the graveyard, and my granddad was so scared, he was like screaming, and everything, but as it turned out it was just a sheep dog that he'd seen so in the dark of night, in those days of no road lights and street lights or anything what he'd actually seen with his friend was a black sheep dog with a white collar, so not a ghost after all.",

Me, too. How much does it cost to send a postcard in Hong Kong overseas?\n\t\t\t\t\t          Laura: Well, to Asian countries, it costs about two dollars, two Hong Kong dollars. To European countries it costs about three dollars.\n\t\t\t\t\t          Todd: OK, and when you send mail in Hong Kong, do you send it from your house, or do you..\n\t\t\t\t              Laura: Well, we have to go the post office in order to send letters or parcels.\n\t\t\t\t              Todd: Really, OK!

Well, because it's so convenient to use the e-mails or instant communication or telephone.\n\t\t                      Todd: Yeah, OK last question. What time do post offices open and close?\n\t                          Laura: Well, it depends on the size of the post office. For large one, so, they work longer.

It's very good stuff, and I've got one recipe that comes to mind that has to do with chicken and rice. You can take several pieces of chicken and boil them in water with some salt until the chicken is cooked. You take out the pieces and with a couple of forks, shred the meat. In a pan you put garlic, onions, olive oil, and tomatoes. Fry that up. Put the chicken on top and then put a puree of tomatoes on top of that and just saute that for awhile and you can put it over white rice and you'll have yourself a nice meal \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      Todd: Wow, that sounds pretty good.\n\t\t\t\t\t          Alexandra:  Yeah, it's very good, and for change you can always add green peppers, red peppers and make it very colorful, and serve it with some white plantains and a little Cuban drink and you are good to go.\n\t\t\t\t\t          Todd: Alright, thanks.

So what do you do during those two hours.\n\t                    Kate: So we go to the gym for about an hour and then have a swim for half an hour and then sauna for about ten minutes and then finish off with a massage.\n\t                    Jessica: Really, a massaging chair?\n                        Kate: A massaging chair!\n                        Jessica: Wonderful, and so who do you go with? \n                        Kate: I go with Nicola.\n                        Jessica: And Nicola is? \n                        Kate: She's another teacher and she's who I live with, so.\n                        Jessica: Alright, good, good, good, good.

What's the biggest difference?\n                        Kate: They have games on the machines so if you're cycling, you're also playing a game where you have to blow up the other cyclists so it makes it a bit more interesting than just exercising.\n                        Jessica: Uh-huh! So it passes the time by. Yeah, lot quicker. And then why are you exercising? Do you have a certain reason, a goal in mind?\n                        Kate: Yeah, because I put on a lot of weight when I was in Australia because I was eating too much pizza and, good breakfast, and drinking far too much beer.\n                        Jessica: So you just want to shed those extra pounds.\n                        Kate: Yeah, that I put on and get back to the original weight that I was.\n                        Jessica: Well, good luck to you.\n                        Kate: Thank you.",

I got married in my wife's parents backyard. They have a really beautiful backyard, with a pool and it's nicely landscaped, with lots of nice flowers and bushes and trees. It was a kind of a small wedding we only had about 30 to 50 people there, all close friends of the family, and a few family members who I hadn't seen in a few years who were able to make it, but it was a pretty small affair and we had the food catered, some seafood and some meat, steak, type items, and it was a beautiful outdoor wedding. \n\t\t                  The actual ceremony only lasted about 15, 20 minutes. I cried, when I was supposed to like, deliver my lines. I cried and everyone told me afterwards, they were like, \" I couldn't hear a word you were saying because you were crying, right!\" and I was trying not to talk loud cause the louder I got the louder my crying noises got, so I was like \"Ah, mmm, will you merry me?\", just real quiet. But other than that it went pretty smooth.",

The band trip we went to Florida, Disneyland actually. It was a lot of fun. Actually getting the money for the band trip, I had to fundraise a lot, and that was just a big humongous problem, cause, I don't know, the band organization was kind of disorganized, anyway, so the band trip, we went to Disneyland. It was a lot of fun, but we ended up playing frisbee all the time because we had nothing better to do really, and to tell you the truth I like Disneyland, but it's kind of kiddish  to tell you the truth, um but it's a lot of fun. We actually, where did we march, Epcot. \n\t                      Todd: Oh, the Epcot Center.\n                          Alex: Yeah, we marched around the Epcot center an hour or a half or so. \n                          Todd: So how long was the trip down there?\n                          Alex: Oh, we actually, we flew so, it wasn't that long. A couple of hours at most. The funny part is, half the band isn't, they hadn't flown before the actual trip so everybody was kind of nervous. It was kind of funny, but yeah I made a lot of friends. It was very interesting. I mean I got made of, made fun of, excuse me, in school, because you know the whole marching band, band geek, whatever but it was a lot of fun. You make a lot of friends and you just get out there and do what you like and it's a lot of fun. \n                          Todd: Oh, that sounds like a fun trip.

        "transcript": "Todd: OK, John, at your house do you have a refrigerator?\nJohn: Yes, a very small refrigerator.\n\t\t                  \nTodd: OK, what is in your refrigerator?\n\t\t                  John: Let's see. There are some eggs, a carton of milk, some strawberry jam, some butter, some cheese, maybe some tofu, some green onions, carrots, some lettuce, and maybe some ice tea.\n\t                      Todd: OK, so do you follow a healthy diet?\n\t                      John: Ah, sometimes. I say about every other day I try to eat healthy and then on some days I just go donut and candy crazy.\n                          Todd: So donuts are your thing? You're really crazy about donuts. \n                          John: Yeah, baked goods, cakes, donuts, cheesecake, any kind of cake or sweet bread.\n                          Todd: Mm, actually you brought donuts today!\n                          John: Yeah, I was given donuts by a student so, yeah, I was glad there was other people to help me eat them so I didn't eat them all.\n                          Todd: That was very nice of your students. Um, do you prefer to cook at home or eat out?\n                          John: Um, usually I prefer to cook at home, just because there are a few dishes that my wife and I like to make and that we're pretty good at, and that we're real comfortable with, but if I'm real tired, if it's been a long day at work there's nothing better than just going to a restaurant and being served you food right away, not having to wait.\n                          Todd: So with your wife do you usually cook together or do you take turns cooking? Do you alternate?\nJohn: We usually take turns. When we first started dating we would cook together. We had a big kitchen, where she was living there was a big kitchen and there was room enough for both of us to move around, and we were still really comfortable with each other, and open and we always wanted to share ideas, but now we have a really small kitchen and there's really only room for one of us, and also too we're at the point in our relationship where I know that she makes fried chicken better than I do and she knows that I make chili better than she does so the other person should just get out of the kitchen, and let the one who's cooking, you know, do their job.",
