I have seen a lot of cobras, and fighting with cobras, each other, but run away so I can not.\n\nTodd: So, you're not afraid of cobras?\n\nNanju: No\n\nTodd: Like have you ever seen a cobra by your house?\n\nNanju: Yeah, I have seen a lot of cobras, which is going to be 12 feet.\n\nTodd: Really!\n\nNanju: Yeah, sure.\n\nTodd: And your not afraid?\n\nNanju: No, I will get some sticks and go through about from my home or something.\n\nTodd: So you get a stick and you go and kill it?\n\nNanju: No, I won't kill it. Killing of cobra is very illegal in India. Not illegal, it's like god, so we won't.\n\nTodd: Sin. It's a sin.

What did they say?\n\nWoman: Nothing much. At the end I asked them, 'What happens now?', and the woman said, 'We'll call you back with news in three or four days.'\n\nMan: Really?\n\nWoman: Yeah, I think I've got the job. There weren't a lot of other people there. I was the only interview that day, you know?\n\nMan: Well, good luck with it.\n\nB\nMan: Anyway, you were saying ...\n\nWoman: Oh, yeah, um ... let's see. Yes, so I was in the museum and there were, I don't know, a hundred people waiting to get into the room. Finally, I got in, and I tried to see the Mona Lisa but I couldn't look at it.\n\nMan: Why not?\n\nWoman: Because the room was filled with people taking photographs of it!\n\nMan: Oh, right.\n\nWoman: Yes! And selfies.\n\nMan: Wait a minute. You can take photos while you're in there?\n\nWoman: Yes, but you can't use flash. I don't know ... Why do we take photos of everything we see when we travel?\n\nMan: I know. And we never look at the photos after.\n\nWoman: Exactly! I'm tired of always taking photos. I don't feel I'm enjoying things.\n\nC\nMan: Who took this?\n\nWoman: I can't remember. Hmmm ...\n\nMan: What am I doing?\n\nWoman: You're sitting on the sofa, watching TV and eating chocolates. Nothing changes!\n\nMan: Ha! Very funny. You look very young, though.\n\nWoman: I know. Look at my hair – it was so long!\n\nMan: Mine too, look at me! Hey … I think I know who took this photo.\n\nWoman: Umm … who? Was it Dad?\n\nMan: No, it wasn’t Dad or Mum. Do you remember Barry?\n\nWoman: No.\n\nMan: Yes, YES! You do remember. Barry, your boyfriend at high school. You were seventeen and he was sixteen and he was so very polite: 'Hello, I'm Barry. It's very nice to meet you ...'\n\nWoman: Stop it! He was nice.\n\nMan: Yeah, well, he took the photo.\n\nD\nWoman: Let's see. OK. I'm glad we could talk about this. It's not easy to say.\n\nMan: What?\n\nWoman: Well, you're not in our group – for the class project.\n\nMan: What do you mean? You know I'm always in a group with you.\n\nWoman: I know. It's just that this time … this time we made the group differently and because you were late ...\n\nMan: I see. You don't want me in the group?\n\nWoman: No, no. It isn't that. It's that we've already made the group, see? There's four of us already.\n\nMan: So? We can't be a group of five?\n\nWoman: Well, the teacher said four people per group.\n\nMan: Oh.\n\nWoman: It's not about you or your work or anything like that. It's ... errrr ... well, we already have the group.\n\nMan: So I have to find another group.\n\nWoman: I'm sorry.",

        "transcript": "Marion\nMy first pet was bought for me when I was still a baby, so I think, I think I was, I think I was less than six weeks old when my granddad bought me a little terrier pup. So as far, as long as I can remember from being very very young, I could always remember this little dog who grew up with me really. \nHer name was Lulu. I think my granddad named her. I don't really know why he called her Lulu but maybe after an English pop star, or maybe he liked the name, I'm not really sure, but he used to always call her \"Lula\" rather than Lulu, so I'm not too sure how the name came about, but anyway Lulu and I were about the same age really, so there wouldn't have been more than six weeks between us, and she was really cute, a very small dog, as most terriers are, I suppose, so yeah, quite small, and very small face, so she had really cute features and big brown eyes, from what I remember, so she was really sweet looking, and she was very friendly as well, and would be very happy and we would come and take her for walks or just play with her, and so yeah, we grew up together for the most part. I tried to spend as much time with her as I could cause she didn't actually live with me. She lived with her granddad still. He looked after her for me.\nBut yeah it was really sad. As she got older, obviously a dog doesn't live as long as we do, so about the time I was maybe, I don't know, twelve or thirteen I suppose, you could really see that poor Lulu was getting, getting much older and you know she had more difficulty in walking and she just looked like she had aged a lot really, so she finally passed away I think when I was about 16. So she lived to be quite old for a little dog like that, but it was really, really sad because we'd spent all that time together and the last few years, we'd been living in the same place and everything, yeah, so I was really, really sad when she passed away. Often times I think, with a pet, you know, when you've had a pet for so long, maybe you don't realize how really attached you are to that person, or to that pet, that animal, and so it really was a wrench when she died. It was very sad.",

No, my dad is from San Francisco.\n\nAimee: So, your dad is from San Francisco and your mom is from Los Angeles.\n\nTodd: Yes, that's right.\n\nAimee: Okay, so which city is better?\n\nTodd: Ooh, wow. They both are great American cities. They are very, very different. I think San Francisco is better but I think people in LA think LA is better. So it's tough. Yeah.\n\nAimee: So, is LA bigger than San Francisco?\n\nTodd: Yes, it is much, much much bigger. LA is huge. It is about 10 million people, maybe more.\n\nAimee: That is huge.\n\nTodd: Yeah. San Francisco is only one million people.\n\nAimee: Oh, that's tiny.\n\nTodd: Yeah, it's much smaller than LA.\n\nAimee: Okay.\n\nTodd: Yeah, much smaller.\n\nAimee: Okay. And is LA more expensive than San Francisco.\n\nTodd: I don't think so. LA is expensive but San Francisco is more expensive. San Francisco is maybe the most expensive city in the US. Because of Google, Yahoo, Apple, all these famous companies.\n\nAimee: Yes, they are big companies.\n\nTodd: So it's big, there's many rich companies there and the space is very small so it's expensive.\n\nAimee: Right, okay. And so about the weather? Is LA warmer than San Francisco?\n\nTodd: Yeah, it's much warmer. It's much, much warmer. LA has beautiful weather so most days it's warm, no clouds, maybe 25 degrees Celsius.\n\nAimee: That sound so nice.\n\nTodd: Or above. Beautiful. San Francisco is much colder and it's much wetter. It rains a lot in San Francisco.\n\nAimee: I know that. What about the looks? Is LA prettier than San Francisco?\n\nTodd: No, not at all.\n\nAimee: No?\n\nTodd: No, not at all. San Francisco is much prettier. LA is pretty but San Francisco much prettier. It's near the sea, it's near nature. It has lots of beautiful buildings downtown. I think San Francisco is prettier but maybe people in Los Angeles think LA is prettier but I don't think so.\n\nAimee: Okay. You disagree with them.\n\nTodd: I do disagree.\n\nAimee: So how are those people? Are the people nicer in LA?\n\nTodd: I don't think so. I think the people in San Francisco are friendlier. People in Los Angeles are a little reserved. They are not as friendly.\n\nAimee: There are more people really.\n\nTodd: There are, it is true. It's a big city. I think people are nicer and more easy going in San Francisco.\n\nAimee: Okay. So now that we have talked about it, is LA better than San Francisco?\n\nTodd: No. No. I think, yeah, somebody from LA will disagree but I will say this, Los Angeles is maybe more exciting and is more interesting than San Francisco. There's lots to do there. It has the beach and it has lots of cool places like Disneyland. So LA is a really great place.\n\nAimee: LA has hills for hiking too, doesn't it?\n\nTodd: A little bit, not close. Actually San Francisco is closer to nature and hiking.\n\nAimee: Is it?\n\nTodd: Yeah.\n\nAimee: Okay, I didn't know that.\n\nTodd: So, you can choose on my description which city sounds more interesting.\n\nAimee: I want to go to both but I think I would prefer to go San Francisco.\n\nTodd: Yay. We need more people. No actually we don't need more people.",

In spring it's a bit cool. You can walk around very relaxed. It the best. It's a combination of all the seasons in one. \n                          Todd: OK. what's your favorite movie?\n                          Shawn: My favorite movie! I'd have to say \"Gladiator.\" Russel Crow. It's a tragic movie about a very strong leader who, how-should-I-say, triumphs over, how-should-I-say, over very overpowering conflicts. It's, um, plus, I'm a bit of an action movie buff. I know it's sad to hear but, it's definitely an interesting movie.",

I waste so much money. \nAbidemi: How? \nTodd: Well, I don't buy things on sale. I don't use coupons. I buy anything I see. \nAbidemi: So, when I shop, I don't look at prices. I just see the food or the thing and I get it and I buy it and I pay for it. And, then it's sometimes very expensive, so I just waste money. I don't budget. I need to budget my money but I don't budget my money. \nTodd: What about you? Are you good at saving money? \nAbidemi: I don't think I'm too bad at saving money. I look at prices a lot. I also buy a lot of things on sale, so I'm able to save some money. \nTodd: So, you look for discounts?\nAbidemi: Yes, I do. \nTodd: Do you use coupons or special offers? \nAbidemi: No, I don't, but if I see some I will use them. \nTodd: So, do you waste money on anything? Like, maybe eating out, buying clothes, renting movies? \nAbidemi: I waste money on buying clothes. \nTodd: Oh, okay! \nAbidemi: But, I save a little bit because I buy them on sale. \nTodd: Ah, do you buy things online? \nAbidemi: No, I don't. I usually go into the stores to shop. \nTodd:               I'm good with clothes too, so I don't spend much money on clothes. I only shop maybe once a year. Or, I only shop if I need something, like it's really cold and I need a jacket. \nAbidemi: I see. \nTodd: And, I'm really bad, so I often only wear clothes people give to me. \nAbidemi: That's good! \nTodd: Yeah, so I get shirts or ties for Christmas gifts or a birthday gift, and I do that. My mom often asks ... every year, my mom asks, \"What do you want for Christmas?\", \"What do you want for your birthday?\" \nTodd: And I'll say, \"Underwear and socks\" or \"Socks and T-shirts\". And so, she buys them for me and then I don't have to buy them. \nAbidemi: Wow. Sounds like you're an easy person to give a present to. \nTodd: Yes, for clothes. Yes, for clothes. But, I waste money on computers and electronics and those things are expensive, so I buy a new computer every year. I have four computers now in my house. \nAbidemi: Wow. \nTodd: I have five mobile phones. \nAbidemi: Wow. \nTodd: I have an iPad. I have lots of electronic equipment. So, I spend so much money on those things. \nAbidemi: I waste money on traveling. \nTodd: Ah, yeah. \nAbidemi: Every year, I take about one or two trips to different countries, so that's where a lot of my money go. \nTodd: Yeah, traveling is expensive. \nAbidemi: Yes, yes. \nTodd: But, when you travel, do you save money? Do you stay at cheap hotels? Or, do you buy cheap plane tickets? \nAbidemi: I try to. I try to all the time. But, usually the plane ticket is so expensive that a lot of my savings is already gone. \nTodd: Yeah, I know. I buy my tickets online, usually with Expedia. And, it's cheap. It's pretty cheap. I waste money on food. I eat out almost every day. \nAbidemi: Wow. \nTodd: Or, I buy my dinner at the supermarket almost every day. Do you waste money on food? \nAbidemi: No, I don't. I usually get bored if I eat out too much, because even though I am not a very good cook, there are some thing that I cook that I like to eat. So, I would miss those things. So, no, I don't waste money on eating out. \n\nTodd: Ah, that's interesting. So, you save money, I waste money. You have to teach me your tricks. You have to teach me your tips on saving money. \nAbidemi: Please teach me how to get cheap travel tickets. \nTodd: It's a deal. \nAbidemi: Thanks.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Sarah, we have the holidays coming up. Are you going to do anything exciting?\n\nSarah: No, nothing exciting. I will just stay home most of the vacation, but there are a few things I'll do. I will bake a cake for Christmas. I will sing lots of Christmas songs with my children. We will sing together and video it. I want to send a video of us singing to grandparents. So we will sing Christmas songs, and we will videotape it. Then, we can send it to our grandparents. I think they will really like it.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's nice. So, will you have a big Christmas dinner?\n\nSarah: Yes, we have some things that we always eat. We'll have ham, and we'll have potatoes and cake, and my favorite thing is to cook fudge. I'll cook the fudge probably tomorrow night, and then we won't eat it until Christmas.\n\nTodd: Okay, oh cool.\n\nSarah: And it's really, it's really hard not to eat it, because it's so delicious, and everyone loves it. Every day, the children will ask me, \"Oh, can we eat it? Can we eat it?\" \"No, no, no, you can't eat it.\" We'll wait 'til Christmas to eat the fudge.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's good. I, I couldn't do that.\n\nSarah: What we won't do is, I won't do any work, and I won't do any chores like clean the house or do laundry. Those can wait until after Christmas, so I won't be working hard. I just want to relax. Todd, how 'bout you? What will you do?\n\nTodd: Well, I will get away. I don't like the cold, so I will go to Thailand, and I will stay there and just work actually.\n\nSarah: Oh.\n\nTodd: I will do stuff for Elllo. I will work on a book, a new book for Elllo, and I will just take it easy. I won't travel. I won't go to the beach. I won't go to the mountains. I won't do any of the touristy stuff. I will just take it easy, relax every day, and do what I call a workcation.\n\nSarah: Wow, what will the weather be like?\n\nTodd: Well, it's the best time of year in Thailand, so it's quite warm in December and January. It should be about, I don't know, 70, 80 degrees, 25 degrees Celsius., so it will be nice every day. It should be.\n\nSarah: Ah. Will you do anything special on Christmas Day?\n\nTodd: I won't. You know, usually, when I travel, I forget it's Christmas even sometimes. Obviously, I will see the decorations in the malls and things like that. But, I won't do anything on Christmas Day. They don't celebrate Christmas in Thailand. It's a Buddhist country, so it's a normal work day. Everybody will be going to work. All the shops will be open. It won't be different than any other day, so that will be nice.\n\nSarah: I see.\n\nTodd: So, I will be able to work like a normal day. I will probably call family and friends, and I will check Facebook and see what people are doing. But, I won't have a traditional Christmas.\n\nSarah: How about New Year's? Will they do anything special for New Year's?\n\nTodd: Yeah, in Bangkok, it gets really crazy on New Year's. But, even then, on New Year's, I probably won't do anything. I'm 49, so I've seen many, many New Year's. I'll probably just go out for a bit, and I'll probably be back home before midnight, actually. I won't do anything crazy. How 'bout you? What will you do for New Year's?\n\nSarah: Well, I have three kids, so my husband and I will probably stay home too. We like to have some fun. My husband bought crab, so we will eat crab for New Year's. I love champagne, so I'll have some champagne. We'll probably have a big, delicious dinner, and I'll drink some champagne. The kids will probably go to sleep at 10:00. Then, a little after midnight, I'll go to sleep too, so nothing exciting.\n\nTodd: Yeah, so, yeah, it sounds like we have pretty tame plans.\n\nSarah: Definitely.\n\nTodd: But, at least, I will be warm.\n\nSarah: Yes.",

The band trip we went to Florida, Disneyland actually. It was a lot of fun. Actually getting the money for the band trip, I had to fundraise a lot, and that was just a big humongous problem, cause, I don't know, the band organization was kind of disorganized, anyway, so the band trip, we went to Disneyland. It was a lot of fun, but we ended up playing frisbee all the time because we had nothing better to do really, and to tell you the truth I like Disneyland, but it's kind of kiddish  to tell you the truth, um but it's a lot of fun. We actually, where did we march, Epcot. \n\t                      Todd: Oh, the Epcot Center.\n                          Alex: Yeah, we marched around the Epcot center an hour or a half or so. \n                          Todd: So how long was the trip down there?\n                          Alex: Oh, we actually, we flew so, it wasn't that long. A couple of hours at most. The funny part is, half the band isn't, they hadn't flown before the actual trip so everybody was kind of nervous. It was kind of funny, but yeah I made a lot of friends. It was very interesting. I mean I got made of, made fun of, excuse me, in school, because you know the whole marching band, band geek, whatever but it was a lot of fun. You make a lot of friends and you just get out there and do what you like and it's a lot of fun. \n                          Todd: Oh, that sounds like a fun trip.

        "transcript": "Mari: I'm Mari from Japan and I'm here with Ron from Hawaii. Today we are going to be talking about abilities so let's start with food. Can you cook?\nRon: I can't cook well, but I do cook, so I think the reason why I can't cook well is because I can eat anything, so I don't try very hard to make it take good.\n                              \nMari: What do you like to cook?\nRon: I like to barbecue outside on the grill.\nMari: What do you put on your barbecue?\nRon: When I cook meat, I don't put much, only salt, pepper, and a little bit of seasoning.\nMari: OK. Good. Next, do you think you're a good dancer?\nRon: No, I don't think I'm a good dancer and I don't really try to be a good dancer.\nMari: Do you not like to dance?\nRon: No, I don't like to dance.\nMari: At all?\nRon: Right.\nMari: I heard that you're a good line-dancer.\nRon: I would like to learn how to line dance, and I do like country music but I haven't been officially taught how to line dance.\nMari: So you don't dance at all?\nRon: No.\nMari: Next, are you a good singer?\nRon: No, I'm not a good singer but I do enjoy going to Karaoke.\nMari: What do you like to sing?\nRon: In Hawaii, when I go to Karaoke I enjoy singing Hawaiian music. If I'm in Japan I like to sing other English songs that they have, usually country music or 80's or 90's music.\nMari: Good. That's good. Do you think you're a good student?\nRon: I don't know if I'm a good student. Growing up I was not a good student but now I am trying harder to be a good student.\nMari: How were you not a good student growing up?\nRon: I didn't enjoy going to school and I didn't try very hard in school. Now I try a little harder. I make an effort. \nMari: Can you talk more about your effort? What do you do to try to be a good student?\nRon: I try to listen to the teachers now instead of doing my own thing, and I try to complete everything with good quality.\nMari: That's good. And, last do you think that you're a good athlete?\nRon: Growing up I was a good athlete. I played a few sports. Now I don't play any sports anymore because I'm old, but growing up I think I was a good athlete.\nMari: What sports did you play?\nRon: I played American football, baseball, and soccer.\nMari: Which one is your best sport?\nRon: I would say football. American football is my best sport.\nMari: How long did you play?\nRon: I played since I was eleven until age twenty-two.\nMari: So for eleven years. And you played when you were in university?\nRon: I played at the University of Hawaii.",

Have you heard of the big five? \nAna: I think so but I don't remember what it is. \nMike: So the big five are the animals that foreign tourists like to come and see in South Africa. And there are safaris and trips you can go on to wildlife reserves to see these animals. \nAna: So what are they? \nMike: So would you like to guess? \nAna: I guess lions. \nMike: Yes, that's one of them. \nAna: And elephants. \nMike: Yes. \nAna: And giraffes. \nMike: No. The giraffe is definitely a big animal but it's not one of the big five. The other three are rhinoceros, the – is it the water buffalo, I think. And the final one is – what is the final one? \nAna: Is it the cheetah? \nMike: Yes, the cheetah. Yes. The cheetah can run very, very fast. \nAna: Okay, and have you seen all of these animals? \nMike: Let me think. It's been a while since I visited a wildlife reserve but I've seen elephants before. And let's see; I've seen a lion. I don't think I've ever seen a cheetah. I've seen a rhinoceros from far away. \nAna: I've heard they're quite dangerous. \nMike: I don't think that there are not many of them in the wild. I don't know if there are any in the wild. They're all in wildlife enclosures so that actually I don't think many people are injured or killed by rhinoceroses. But actually, do you know what the most dangerous animal is in Africa? \nAna: Is it the lion? \nMike: No, it's not.  It's the hippopotamus. \nAna: Really? \nMike: I think they killed more people every year in the world than any other animal. \nAna: Wow, that's very surprising. \nMike: Maybe mosquitoes kill more with malaria but in terms of big animals, it's definitely the hippopotamus. \nAna: Wow. \nMike: They have very long teeth as well. \nAna: That's scary. \nMike: Yeah. It is pretty scary. You don't want to be – you know, they can swim as well. So they would – and if you go out on the river in a little bit on a dam and there's a hippopotamus, he can tip your boat over and bite you in half. \nAna: All right. So you should definitely look out for hippos when you go to South Africa. \nMike: Yeah. You should be careful. Crocodiles can also be nasty. \nAna: Okay.",

Me, too. How much does it cost to send a postcard in Hong Kong overseas?\n\t\t\t\t\t          Laura: Well, to Asian countries, it costs about two dollars, two Hong Kong dollars.

I'll give it a try. But the thing is, you know, she – there's one other problem. She eats five small meals a day, so never eats big meals. So we can't go to a restaurant and stuff like that.

        "transcript": "One of my earliest memories involves my granddad and his garden. He had a huge garden when I was growing up. It was, I mean, it was more of a field than a garden really it was so big. He had lots of fruit trees, like fruit bushes, like elder berries, black berries, raspberries. He had strawberries as well, gooseberries, so every berry you could think of. He also had, let me see, apple trees and cooking apple trees, and he had lots of vegetables too as well like rhubarb, onions and lettuce, anything you could think of. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      When I was a little girl I didn't really like vegetables all that much to be honest, but I did love helping him pick his strawberries when they came in the summer. Strawberries always taste better when they are warm and from the sun, and you can pick them and put them straight in your mouth, beautiful. One of my funniest memories, though, well when I look back on it now, it's funny, is of helping my granddad when he was planting his onions one year, so I was staying with him for awhile and he said, \"OK Marion today we're going to go and we're going to plant some onions,\" in the spring.                               \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      So I went out and I was only I think about 5 years old, but I wanted to help so both of us went out and we planted two rows of onions, so he planted one row and I planted the other, or he really planted most of them I think. But I tried to help anyway, even though I was quite small, so then we did our job that day and I didn't really think anymore of it, until the onions started to grow and then suddenly they were ready to be harvested, or whatever, to be picked from the ground, and you could see that the stalks were growing nice and tall. We were out in the garden one day, my granddad and I again so it must have been a good few months later, further towards autumn, and my granddad came over and showed me the onion stalks and he said, \"Look Marion! The ones you planted are way bigger than the ones that I planted.\"                               \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      And I was so happy with myself. So happy that the job that I had done was better than even my granddad, who was a great gardener and now when I look back I realize, you know that wasn't really the case. That he was just saying it to make me feel better, and to make me proud of the work I'd done with him, but at the time it really worked. I was really, really so proud to have helped my granddad, the gardener, and to have done a better job than he did. I still wouldn't eat the onions though.",

I usually do aerobic exercise for awhile and then do some weightlifting for maybe half an hour at the gym, then I'll return home, and as I work from my home, I turn on my computer and start working on what needs to be done. I usually skip breakfast and I'll work until about 12:00 then I'll prepare lunch and have a fairly big lunch because I don't eat breakfast. Then after lunch, I'll go back, continue working on Internet or whatever I have to do for work, until about 6:00 when I usually start getting phone calls from friends of mine who live abroad and then in the evenings if I'm not using my time doing things with the Internet or surfing the web, then I'm speaking to people on the Internet or on my phone and that pretty much sums up my usual daily routine.",

It’s kind of boring, but I have to clean the bathroom and then the kitchen, and then the lounge room because I have lots of cats. And the cats leave hair everywhere. So I always have to clean on Saturday mornings. \nJosh: Yes, cats are messy. \nShirley: Yeah. \nJosh: So after you cleaned, what did you do? \nShirley: Well, in the afternoon, I went for a walk up the mountain. It was a beautiful sunny day. There were no clouds in the sky. \nJosh: Wow. \nShirley: It was gorgeous. So I walked up the mountain and I saw a ferret. \nJosh: A ferret? \nShirley: Yeah. \nJosh: Wow. \nShirley: They’re a little furry animal, four legs, tail—not like a rabbit, but about the same size as a rabbit. \nJosh: Okay. \nShirley: And they’re kind of gold brown color. \nJosh: Wow, did you see any other animals on your walk? \nShirley: No. I didn’t see any other animals on the ground. But I did see a beautiful bird flying in the sky. \nJosh: Wow. Do you know what kind? \nShirley: I think it was an ibis. It’s a big bird that usually walks in the water. It has long legs and it was white with a black head. \nJosh: Great. So after your walk, did you do anything else? \nShirley: I went home and then I watched some TV. \nJosh: Okay. \nShirley: That was about it for my Saturday. \nJosh: Okay. What did you do on Sunday? \nShirley: Sunday, I went to the art museum. \nJosh: Really? \nShirley: Yeah. \nJosh: Great. \nShirley: I really like to go and see new art; pictures or paintings or photographs or sometimes sculptures. \nJosh: Okay. So who’s your favorite artist? \nShirley: I don’t really have a favorite artist but I really like watercolors, so pictures that are painted with just soft—a kind of soft painting style. \nJosh: Do you like paintings of nature? \nShirley: I do like paintings of nature. I especially like paintings of flowers and animals and places that have water like lakes or rivers or the sea. \nJosh: Oh, that sounds like you had a great weekend. \nShirley: Yeah, it was good.

OK, it's the name of a person. Fibonacci was a European mathematician in the Middle Ages.\n\nStudent: Ah, OK. Thanks. So, we know he was a person, but what are the Fibonacci numbers? I don't get it.\n\nProfessor: The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers. They go 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on. Do you see the sequence? Do you see how it works?\n\nStudent: I'm not sure.\n\nProfessor: OK. This is how it works. The first number is 1, then 1 again, then 2. The third number is the first number plus the second number. The fourth number is the second number plus the third number: 1 plus 2 is 3. The fifth number is the third number, 2, plus the fourth number, 3. So the fifth number in a Fibonacci sequence is 5.\n\nStudent: Ah! I think I understand now. But what about their importance? You said these were very important.\n\nProfessor: Yes, let me explain. This sequence of numbers is important because we see it in many things. Fibonacci numbers are common in geometry, they are common in nature, for example in plants. We see the sequence everywhere.\n\nStudent: Could you give us some more examples?\n\nProfessor: OK ... well, we don't have time right now but I can bring more examples in for next class, OK?",

For example, tomorrow, I really have a lot to do. \nTodd: Oh no, really? What? What do you have to do tomorrow?\nMeg: Well first, I have a lot of laundry that I need to do. So I'll need to wash my clothes. After I wash my clothes, I'll need to iron my clothes, of course. And then finally, after I iron my clothes, I need to hang up all the clothes. \nTodd: Oh, yeah. That's terrible. Yeah. Actually, I never iron my clothes. \nMeg: Really? Why not?\nTodd: I always put my clothes in the dryer and they, you know, come out and they're okay. and I just hang them as soon as my clothes get out of the dryer. So I never iron my shirts. And sometimes, I take things to the dry cleaners so I don't have to iron. \nMeg: Yes, that's something I also have to do is drop off a few dresses at the dry cleaners, some formal clothes. I need to take them to the dry cleaner. \nTodd: Oh really? Well, wait. How about this? You helped me clean my house, so I want to help you. So I can take your clothes to the dry cleaners. \nMeg: Really? Is it okay? \nTodd: Yeah. No problem. Actually, it's easy because I need to return some movies. So when I go to return my movies, I can drop off your clothes at the dry cleaners. \nMeg: Hey, while you're going to the dry cleaners, can you mail some letters for me? \nTodd: Yeah. No problem. That's easy because the post office is really close to the dry cleaners. \nMeg: Oh that's great. That will save me time because I need to go buy groceries. \nTodd: Oh yeah? Where do you buy your groceries? \nMeg: I usually buy my groceries at Maxx Value, a grocery store. \nTodd: Okay. Yeah. I like to go there because they have really cheap milk, they have cheap bread; they have lots of good meat. Yeah, I like that store. \nMeg: Yeah. They have a lot of delicious bread also. \nTodd: You like the bakery.\nMeg: I do like the bakery at Maxx Value. \nTodd: That's good because actually I know you bake. You like to bake bread.

I love getting letters too but I don’t know, there’s something special about a parcel, especially when you don’t know what’s going to be inside it. So I opened the parcel this morning and there, just in time for Christmas, and everything is a big huge thing of Toblerone Chocolates, which I love and also, a six-pack of Tayto’s Cheese and Onion Crisps. Now, Tayto’s is an Irish company, and so it’s an Irish brand name and these crisps or potato chips, maybe as other countries call them, these crisps are absolutely the best crisps in the world. There is no competition. I think if you ask any Irish person, they’ll tell you the same thing, so there’re real, quite a strong flavor, I think but really cheesy, em, but it’s funny because I don’t, I don’t usually like crisps. I’m not a big crisp fan, but these cheese and onion Tayto’s, I’ve just finished the first packet and it really makes me feel, makes me feel closer to home, I …my friends, this is the taste of home. They’re so good. You should really try some.",

        "transcript": "Hi, everyone. I know you're all busy so I'll keep this briefing quick. I have some important information about a change in the management team. As you already know, our head of department, James Watson, is leaving his position at the end of this week. His replacement is starting at the end of the next month. In the meantime, we'll continue with our projects as usual.\n\nI have two more quick points. Firstly, there will be some improvements made to the staff car park next month for a few weeks. It will be closed during that time.\n\nDon't worry, we've found a solution. We can use the local church car park until our own one is ready. If you arrive before 8.30 a.m., please use our small car park on Brown Street, and if you arrive after that, you should go directly to the church car park. It's only a five-minute walk away. But they need it in the evenings, so you have to leave before 6 p.m. Sorry about that – I know how much you all love working late!\n\nThe other thing I wanted to tell you about is that the canteen has now introduced a cashless payment system. So, you can't use cash for payments any more. You can pay directly with your smartphone or you can pay using your company ID card. The total amount put on your company ID card comes off your salary at the end of each month.\n\nOK. That's it? Are there any questions?",

Not the 19th, not the 28th, not two days later because your dog was ill or your computer broke – the 18th. If it's late, I won't mark it. I won't even read it – you'll fail the assignment! So, please hand it in on time. You can even hand it in early, if you like!\n\nYou can email me the essays at j.hartshorn@lmu.ac.uk. That's H-A-R-T-S-H-O-R-N. I'll reply to say I've got it. If I don't reply within a day, it might mean I didn't get it, so please email me again to make sure. You can also bring a paper copy of the essay to my office, but let's be kind to the trees, OK? Email is better for the trees and for me.\n\nDon't forget that you must reference every idea or quote you use that isn't your own idea. And the last page of your essay should be a list of all the books you used, in alphabetical order, not in the order you used them!\n\nAnd lastly, make it easy for me to read! That means use a clear font. Arial is best, but Times New Roman is fine too. Not Comic Sans please! Size 12 font for the essay, and size 14 for the titles and subheadings. And use page numbers. Any questions?",

It's very good stuff, and I've got one recipe that comes to mind that has to do with chicken and rice. You can take several pieces of chicken and boil them in water with some salt until the chicken is cooked. You take out the pieces and with a couple of forks, shred the meat. In a pan you put garlic, onions, olive oil, and tomatoes. Fry that up. Put the chicken on top and then put a puree of tomatoes on top of that and just saute that for awhile and you can put it over white rice and you'll have yourself a nice meal \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      Todd: Wow, that sounds pretty good.\n\t\t\t\t\t          Alexandra:  Yeah, it's very good, and for change you can always add green peppers, red peppers and make it very colorful, and serve it with some white plantains and a little Cuban drink and you are good to go.\n\t\t\t\t\t          Todd: Alright, thanks.

So, do you dream a lot?\nHana: Ahm, well yes, I usually remember my dream every day but I forget it so I don't really remember it now.\nDaniel: Oh because, you know, I've been reading a lot about dreams because lately I've been dreaming a lot and people said that you dream every single night but the difference is whether if you remember the dream or not, so do you know that?\nHana: Yeah, I read something similar to that. I heard that you dream seven dreams like seven different stories.\nDaniel: Seven?\nHana: Yeah and you only remember the fourth and fifth dream.\nDaniel: Why is that?\nHana: I don't know, you only can remember the fourth or fifth so that's why sometimes when you have a dream, there are many different stories.\nDaniel: So that means if what we read is true it's like we dream every night and every night we dream seven different stories.\nHana: Yes and I heard it's good if you write your dreams down while you remember it and it's really interesting.\nDaniel: Yeah it is but even if you remember the dreams because that has happened to me, you wake up, you remember the dream but really quickly and really say you forget the dream. Has that happen to you?\nHana: Yeah, that happens to me a lot that's why I think really should keep a diary of my dreams because I heard a lot of things that you dream about can be hints for your life or what you're thinking.\nDaniel: Oh that's really interesting so well, I think I'm going to get a notebook or something and keep it, you know, on my bedside table.\nHana: Yeah, me too.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Okay. So Sarah, I see you eat soup every day at work. Why are you eating soup every day? \nSarah: That’s because I love to cook soup. \nTodd: So you make the soup? \nSarah: Yes, it’s very easy to make. \nTodd: So you cook it and then you just bring it to work everyday? \nSarah: Yeah. I just make a lot on Monday and then I bring it to work everyday of the week. \nTodd: Oh nice. So how do you make the soup? What’s your secret? \nSarah: Well, I like to cook very easy. So I buy meat that’s already cut up, usually, chicken and then some rice, usually brown rice and then I buy some vegetables. So after I bought the ingredients, I chop them up and I put them all together in water until boils and add some seasoning. \nTodd: Okay. So you say the water boils, so as soon as the water boils that’s when you put in all the ingredients? \nSarah: Yes, that’s right. \nTodd: So you don’t put in the ingredients before the water boils. \nSarah: No. I guess, it’s just easier for the water to be hot because then the vegetables and the meat cook a little faster. \nTodd: So how do you give the soup flavoring? \nSarah: I usually add salt and pepper, maybe some garlic. And depending on the type of soup, either maybe some soy sauce or lemon juice. \nTodd: Okay. Do you put in the flavoring after you put in the ingredients or before you put in the ingredients? \nSarah: Maybe after but usually, right about all at the same time. \nTodd: Okay. \nSarah: So I just put everything in at one time. \nTodd: And then after you cook the soup, do you put the soup in the refrigerator? Do you let it sit outside? \nSarah: I usually eat some right then, and I also put it in containers for the week. But I let it sit in the containers out on the counter for a while for it to cool before I put in the refrigerator. \nTodd: All right. And so, you don’t put it in the refrigerator until it is cool? \nSarah: Until it’s about room temperature. \nTodd: Okay, nice. And then how do you heat it up? Do you heat it up in a pot or do you heat it up in the microwave? \nSarah: In the microwave. It’s the easiest. \nTodd: Yeah. Nice. So you make enough for five meals? \nSarah: Maybe, sometimes. If I think I will get tired of eating it during the week then maybe I’ll just make enough for three or four meals. But if it’s some kind that I think is really delicious and I know I want to eat it everyday, then I’ll make a lot. \nTodd: Well, if that happens, when you make the soup, you can make it for six or seven and give me a bowl. \nSarah: Okay. I’ll do that next time. \nTodd: Oh great. Thanks. \n[End of Transcript]",

There was a period of time in my life that I did not ride the train, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.\nAdrienne: How is it different riding the train now then it was back when you were younger?\nVivian: When I was younger they had a different set of train people. Back then, you weren't served meals at your seat. You had, if they had a dining car, if they had a dining car, you could go into the dining car and eat but some trains, especially on short distances, like when I lived in Jaffy, Missouri, it was halfway between Memphis and St. Louis. Those were short routes and they did not have dining cars. On this trip that we just got back from yesterday, we had our, we were in the lower car because it's a handicap car. My sister is handicapped, and they brought us a menu, and they brought us a full dinner, including salad and dessert and coffee or tea, whatever we would like to drink.\nAdrienne: How was the food on the train? Was it better than plain food?\nVivian: Oh, much better. Much better. It was fixed. The chef's did a fantastic job and I understand that it is cooked on the train. It may not be all cooked on the train but it certainly is prepared and the salads are prepared on the train so that you don't get these package food tastes.\nAdrienne: That sounds fun though.\nVivian: Oh, it was great fun!

I was born there. \n                        \nMy folks are British. My dad is from Manchester and my mom is from Scotland. They went out a long time ago. Yeah, growing up in Zimbabwe was \"lacker\" as we say there. That means really cool in Africans. \nIt was like you grow up in a big open free place with animals and sunshine and it's just a really healthy place to be. Well at least it was. Today it's not doing too well because the economy has crashed but growing up there was really slick. \nTodd: Wow! What animals could you see?\nLeath: Just about an hours drive out of any city, you are able to come across just about anything. I've seen leopards often at night about an hour out of the capital where I live. You see monkeys along the road, right up to the city outskirts. In certain areas you'll have to stop for elephants. There's quite a few buck warning signs because they are actully quite dangerous at night. They jump across the road and your cars hit them at windscreen height. It is a bit of a problem. So, there's buck everywhere. Away from residential areas, there's you know your big five, rhino, lion being the most... well interesting and I guess for foreigners. They are never really never around human settlement cause they are very very dangerous. They do take people from time to time. \nTodd: Wow! That's fascinating. Thanks a lot Leath. \nLeath: You're welcome buddy. OK.",

And actually I took the bus into Vietnam.\n                              \nTodd: OK. \nAbidemi: Yes. And in Vietnam, I traveled from the north, from Hanoi, to Ho Chi Minh City. But because my time was so short, I could only spend one or two days in each city.\nTodd: Ah! What city did you like the most?\nAbidemi: I think I prefer Hanoi the most. The food, the street food is amazing. It’s a very lively city, lots of motorcycles and traffic so it reminded me of Nigeria where I was born a little bit.\nTodd: Oh cool!\nAbidemi: Yes. \nTodd: And what did you do in Vietnam?\nAbidemi: I spent time in Hanoi. I also went to visit Sapa, which has a lot of rice terraces. So these are mountains where they’ve planted rice fields. So the scenery, the view is really beautiful. And you also get to meet the native people, the local people there. So I enjoyed it.\nAnd then from there I went to Hoi An, which is a very historical city, very beautiful night scenery by the river. And then I went to Ho Chi Minh City but I could only spend one night there before leaving for Myanmar. \nTodd: OK. And then, how was Myanmar? What did you do there?\nAbidemi: Myanmar was my last stop. And I didn’t have so much time there but I managed to go—but I managed to visit some of the places I really wanted to see like Yangon, Bagan, and Mandalay. \nI would say that Bagan was the highlight. They had many temples from the past and just seeing that many of them, it was very impressive.\nTodd: That’s fantastic. \nAbidemi: Yes. \nTodd: So what country was your favorite? \nAbidemi: It’s hard to say. They each have their own good points but I think I would definitely like to visit Thailand again.\nTodd: Oh OK. Thailand is such a great place. Anyway, thanks Abidemi. \nAbidemi: Thank you, Todd.",

So that's not popular anymore?Mariel: Some people like to wear ripped jeans, yeah, still, but mainly the rips are quite neat, so they're usually ripped a little bit around the pockets or around the cuffs, you know the bottoms, YeahTodd: OK, yeah. That sounds like designer jeans. Maybe then like.... are they specifically made just for that style?Mariel: Well, yeah. Actually, quite often the jeans you buy in the store are already ripped or already worn so they look like they're old but they are brand new.Todd: But designer jeans can be really expensive, right?Mariel: Oh, they can be very expensive but people are willing to pay the money because they're designer jeans. They're cool.Todd: Well, how much do you pay for jeans?Mariel: I can pay up to 120 Euros for jeans. Todd: A hundred and twenty Euros.Mariel: Yeah. Todd: That's a lot of money.Mariel: It's a lot of money, yeah, especially because I'm a student but I'm willing to put the money into it if the jeans fit very well.Todd: Just, lastly about jeans, these days there's many different colors. You have the light blue jeans, or the darker blue jeans. Which colors do you like to wear?Mariel: That depends on the time of the year actually.

        "transcript": "When I was living in Pisa, a few friends and I decided to go to Venice for the carnival, so the carnival in Venice, it's usually, usually about February or March, depending on when Easter is that year cause Easter can change every year, it's a different day, so this time it was, I think about, it was about the middle of February, that's right, so we went there about the 11th or 12th of February, and it was so cold. I remember just being bitterly, bitterly cold. I remember a few of us had to buy extra scarves and gloves and jumpers cause it was just so, so cold, especially at night. During the day wasn't so bad, it was still cold but it was really awful at night if you were walking around, but it was an awful lot of fun to be in Venice for carnival because, em, lots of people dress up in really, really elaborate costumes and masks. One of my friends there, she goes almost every year to the carnival and she does face-painting on the streets so I met up with her, kind of by chance. We knew that we were both going to be there but it's such a busy time we weren't sure if we were going to meet or not, so it was really good that we met up in the huge piazza, Piazza San Marco. She told me roughly which side of the piazza she would be and I found her, so that was really great to see her after such a long time and then the other amazing thing we did that weekend or that few days was that my friends and I went on a gondola. So, a gondola, you've probably seen on television or in a book or something, a gondola is the long, kind of, boat that they have in Venice and there's a man who stands at the back with a big, long pole that he steers the boat with so he drives the boat along by pushing this long stick into the mud on the bottom of the canal, I suppose. It was really amazing because that's one of the, I suppose, the most stereotypical things when you think of Venice and when I'd been there the first time I hadn't gone on a gondola because I thought aw, it's too touristy, I'm not going to do that, but my friends this time, they really wanted to go on one, so we went and we asked some of the guys, the gondoliere as they're called, by piazza san Marco and asked them how much it would cost but we'd forgotten that that day it was the 14th of February so it was Valentine's Day and, as you can imagine, going out in a gondola is, is usually a very romantic occasion for a couple and whatever, to go off and be maybe serenaded by, by another gondoliere, so they sing all sorts of, of songs like you've probably seen on TV or heard in television adverts so they wanted an awful lot of money, I remember, just because it was Valentine's Day, so there were a few of us trying to argue with them in Italian and you know, we were saying that it wasn't fair because it was just a group of us and we just wanted the experience so I think eventually they kind of gave us a more reasonable price so we set off in the gondola and went along the canals, the little canals around Piazza San Marco so it was really, really, really nice. We got to see a lot of the, the backstreets, like I say, and lovely old bridges crossing, crossing the canals. It's a really unique experience as Venice is a pretty unique city really. There was, em, our gondoliere was pretty funny in the end as it turned out. He was very nice, and so there was a few of us from Ireland in the gondola he was asking us all where we were from and so as soon as we told him Ireland he started singing us a song by U2 which is a bit strange, not the usual song that you expect from a gondoliere but, em, it was quite funny, anyway. So, like I say, a really unique experience.",

I like to watch comedies - romantic comedies - and a little bit of drama.\nRon: What is your favorite movie you've watch recently?\nMari: My favorite movie... I don't know if it was my favorite movie, but a movie that I watched recently is called \"27 Dresses\".

Do you like to read books?\nMari: I do like to read books. Right now, I'm really busy with work so I don't have a lot of time to read but when I'm on vacation or whenever I have free time, I like to read books.\nRon: What kind of books?\nMari: I like to read non-fiction usually. Biographies of people, and I also like to read about like teaching practices so that I can become a better teacher and a little bit of fiction.\nRon: And what about concerts? Do you enjoy going to concerts?\nMari: I don't go to music concerts. I don't think I've ever been to one actually but I like to go see musicals and I also like to go to sporting events.\nRon: Nice talking with you Mari.",

I love multitasking.\nMeg: Sounds like you're good at multitasking. \nTodd: Let's talk about outdoor activities. Do you like doing yard work?\nMeg: I don't especially like doing yard work. But right now, I don't have a yard. So, doing yard work isn't something I have to worry about. What about you?\nTodd: I like doing yard work. I think it's very relaxing. It's like cleaning. So, I enjoy it. But like you, I don't have a yard. So, now I don't do yard work very much. Or I can't do yard work.\nMeg: So, you like gardening if you have a yard? \nTodd: Yeah. I grew up on a big house. So, we have lots of yard work, lots of gardening. So, yeah.\nMeg: Right.\nTodd: But what about other things like hiking, do you like hiking?\nMeg: I love hiking. Anything that is in nature, I love doing. I love hiking. I love kayaking. I love canoeing. Any outdoor sports. Do you like hiking?\nTodd: I do. I'm with you. I love hiking. What about things like rock climbing? \nMeg: I have never been rock climbing. Have you gone rock climbing? \nTodd: No. Rock climbing looks dangerous. So, I'm still scared.\nMeg: Yeah,\nTodd: So, I've never done rock climbing either. What about things like singing and dancing? Do you enjoy singing and dancing?\nMeg: I enjoy singing, but I'm not very good at it. So, I like singing when I'm alone or in my car. Are you good at singing?\nTodd: No, I'm terrible at singing. So, I hate singing. I really, really hate singing. But I like going to karaoke and listening to people sing.\nMeg: Yeah, some people are really good at singing. What about dancing?\nTodd: I hate dancing too. Yeah, I'm not good at dancing. So, dancing is very embarrassing for me. I don't like it.\nMeg: I'm not good at dancing either. \nTodd: Are there any other activities you really dislike doing? Like for me, I hate writing letters. For example, I don't like writing thank you letters. I don't like writing anything with my hand. Typing is okay. I don't mind typing things, but I hate writing.\nMeg: So, using your hand to write, you hate writing?\nTodd: Yeah, I like typing. Fingers is okay. Thumb is okay on the phone. I don't mind texting, I don't mind typing. I just don't like physically writing with a pencil or a pen.\nMeg: Yeah. Pen or a pencil, like writing a letter.\nTodd: Right. Because my writing is really bad, and it's hard to read. So, it's embarrassing.\nMeg: I'm sure it's fine.\nTodd: Yeah. How about you? For example, do you like iron in your clothes?\nMeg: I don't like having my clothes, but my clothes usually don't need ironing, so I don't have to worry about it too much. I don't like doing laundry. It's related to ironing clothes. So, it takes a long time. And the clothes, I have to dry the clothes. So, doing laundry is a little bit boring for me.\nTodd: I don't mind doing laundry if I go to the coin laundry, but I hate hanging my laundry out. I hate hanging out my laundry. It takes forever. I don't know why, you put it out, you take it back in, it just takes so much time. \nMeg: That's funny. I'm kind of the opposite. I don't mind hanging out my laundry, because I like saving money, so I don't have to use money at the coin laundry. \nTodd: Plus, you are helping the environment.\nMeg: That's true. I like helping the earth.\nTodd: Yeah, I should change. Okay. Thanks Meg.\nMeg: Yeah.",

Be strong and brave about it. So they were approaching the graveyard and suddenly my granddad saw what he thought was a priest sitting on the wall. So he say a man dressed in black, with a white collar, and he was so frightened, I mean, I can't imagine what he must have said at the time, but he and his friend were really, really scared, and they were talking between themselves, \"Oh, my God! What should we do? What should we do?\" but they were so frightened they couldn't move. So eventually, my granddad decided, OK, I'm just going to run for it. I'm going to make a run for it. So all of a sudden, he decided and he just ran straight past the graveyard, and then suddenly, this big dog came jumping down from the wall of the graveyard, and my granddad was so scared, he was like screaming, and everything, but as it turned out it was just a sheep dog that he'd seen so in the dark of night, in those days of no road lights and street lights or anything what he'd actually seen with his friend was a black sheep dog with a white collar, so not a ghost after all.",

        "transcript": "Michael: So Ana, you're from Portugal, right? \nAna: Yeah, right. \nMichael: Okay, because I'm actually thinking of going to visit Europe this summer, and I thought Portugal would be a great place to visit. \nAna: Oh yeah, Portugal is great especially in the summer. It will be really warm and you can go to lots of places in Portugal. You can go to the North where we have a lot of mountains and you can do all kinds of activities like archery and horse riding. \nMichael: Oh wow, that's interesting. Well, actually, I was thinking of going to the beach. Can you give me some advise for what's the best time of year to go. And perhaps there are not too many tourists are on. \nAna: Oh yeah, if you want to avoid tourists, you should definitely not come in August. August is really crowded and there are just so many people in the South of Portugal. You can try to come in June. \nMichael: All right. \nAna: June is already warm but there are not too many people. So it will be easier for you to find accommodation. There are some really nice hotels and hostels around. So what kind of place were you thinking of staying in? \nMichael: Well, actually, I don't really mind too much. I think I'd like to see what it's like for normal people in Portugal, what it would be like to go on a holiday and have an authentic Portuguese experience. So maybe – I don't really want to stay in a big international hotel. What's a typical Portuguese place to stay and is nice for a summer holiday? \nAna: That's interesting, yeah. In that case, you should definitely avoid the big hotels or any hostels. There are some apartments that you can rent. So you can just live in an apartment by the beach. \nMichael: All right. \nAna: Yeah, they're just in a normal building with other Portuguese people but you can rent it and stay there and it's really close to the beach. It's like a one-minute walk. So it will be really convenient for you. \nMichael: And this is by the Atlantic Ocean. \nAna: Yes. Yes, it is. \nMichael: All right. That sounds like a very good idea staying at an apartment. How much should I budget for that? \nAna: Hmm, I am not really sure. It will probably be a bit more expensive than a hotel. \nMichael: Really? \nAna: Not in the long term. You can pay about EUR 30 per night, I think. \nMichael: Well, that's huge. \nAna: For a nice location, yeah. If you come with friends though, you can also rent a villa. We have some villas also by the beach. \nMichael: Does it have a swimming pool? \nAna: It does have a swimming pool. And they have plenty of room. So if you want to come with a big group, that's definitely a better option. \nMichael: That sounds like a great idea. I can invite my colleagues along. So do you have any final tips for me, for my holiday in Portugal? \nAna: Well, I mean, if you want to stay in the South, in the Algarve, then I definitely recommend you check out the nightlife. I can be really lively in there in night markets where you can buy lots of souvenirs and people just hang around. So I definitely recommend that. \nMichael: Okay, and what was the name again? The Algarve? \nAna: The Algarve, yeah. That's the southern part of Portugal, so you can't miss it. \nMichael: Oh, I got to remember that. Thank you very much.",

The first time I lost my wallet\n                                I was in a taxi cab going home late at night and\n                                my wallet slipped out of my pocket and I\n                                didn't notice. \nThe second time I lost my wallet I went to a\n                                night club with my friends and I drank too much\n                                and I wasn't paying attention and I left my wallet\n                                on the counter of the bar. The third time I lost\n                                my wallet, I was hiking in a mountain region in\n                                Japan and I went into a small convenience store on\n                                the way home and I bought an ice-cream and I left\n                                my wallet on the counter and forgot about it. The\n                                fourth time I lost my wallet, I was in Ueno\n                                station, a really, really busy station in Tokyo\n                                and I left my wallet on the counter at a\n                                supermarket, and the most amazing thing is that I still have the same wallet. \nIn each of these instances I got my\n                                wallet back. In two of the cases, the person at\n                                the store called me and I just had to go back to\n                                the store and get it. In one instance, the person\n                                that ran the convenient store in the\n                                mountains mailed me my wallet, and another time I\n                                had to go to the police station and pick it up, but I think that says a lot about Japanese people.\n                                They're very, very honest and sometimes I think\n                                maybe Japan is the only country in the world where\n                                you could lose your wallet four times and still\n                                get it back.",

I got married in my wife's parents backyard. They have a really beautiful backyard, with a pool and it's nicely landscaped, with lots of nice flowers and bushes and trees. It was a kind of a small wedding we only had about 30 to 50 people there, all close friends of the family, and a few family members who I hadn't seen in a few years who were able to make it, but it was a pretty small affair and we had the food catered, some seafood and some meat, steak, type items, and it was a beautiful outdoor wedding. \n\t\t                  The actual ceremony only lasted about 15, 20 minutes. I cried, when I was supposed to like, deliver my lines. I cried and everyone told me afterwards, they were like, \" I couldn't hear a word you were saying because you were crying, right!\" and I was trying not to talk loud cause the louder I got the louder my crying noises got, so I was like \"Ah, mmm, will you merry me?\", just real quiet. But other than that it went pretty smooth.",

Yeah, I was born there and I lived in the city for many years.\n\nSarah: Cool. What is the most interesting thing about your city?\n\nTodd: Well, San Francisco has many interesting things, but the most interesting thing is probably the architecture. There’s lots of very unique buildings. And the most unique building is probably the Trans-America building. It’s a building like a pyramid. It’s nice.\n\nSarah: Well, that’s really cool.\n\nTodd: Uh-hmm.\n\nSarah: What is the most expensive area in San Francisco?\n\nTodd: Well, it is very, very expensive. The most expensive area is a place called Pacific Heights, and it’s on the highest hill in San Francisco and it overlooks the Bay. It’s a really, really beautiful place.\n\nSarah: Hmm.\n\nTodd: That area by far has the best views of the city.\n\nSarah: Hmm, what is the most beautiful place in San Francisco?\n\nTodd: Well, actually the most beautiful place is outside the city. It’s a place called Muir Woods. And it has the tallest trees in the world, and some of these trees are really old. They are the oldest trees in North America. Some of them are over 2,000 years old.\n\nSarah: Wow. It sounds like some place I would like to see. So it sounds really expensive. Where is the cheapest place to live?\n\nTodd: The cheapest place to live is a place called Sunset. And Sunset is on the west side, and the houses are kind of old and they’re a little bit cheap. But one thing about Sunset is it has nicest view of the ocean, and you could watch the sunset every night. That’s why it’s called the Sunset area.\n\nSarah: Hmm. If I wanted to go there, when is the best time to visit?\n\nTodd: Well, the best time is probably in the fall because that’s when the weather is the nicest. It’s not too cold, and it’s not too hot. And it doesn’t rain that much.\n\nSarah: So when would be the worst time to visit?\n\nTodd: The worst time to visit would be probably February and March, because February and March are the coldest and wettest months. So – well, March isn’t that cold but sometimes it’s wet, so it rains a lot.\n\nSarah: Wow. That sounds really great. I want to go there.\n\nTodd: Yeah, you should. It’s great place.",

I suppose it is quite a poor area. Not many rich people. A lot of people are farmers. And a lot of people are miners. They coal. They mine for coal. But it is a very beautiul land. Lots of mountains.

Yes, I am.Todd: What city are you from?Mariel: I live in a city called Espoo, which is right next to Helsinki, but I was born in the center of Finland in a place called Jyvaskyla.Todd: Right in the middle?Mariel: Yeah, pretty much right in the middle.Todd: So is that way out in nature in the forest, or is it a big city?Mariel: It's a reasonable size city, maybe the fifth largest in Finland, but it is very, a very natural place still. It's surrounded by lakes and forests and lots of cliffs and really beautiful scenery. Yeah.Todd: Well, that sounds nice.Mariel: Yeah. Yeah, I love it there. I go back there every year to visit my hometown.Todd: Now does your family still live in your hometown?Mariel: No, they live down south near Helsinki.Todd: OK, is that common? Everybody moves to the big city.Mariel: Pretty much, yeah. Especially young people. They want to get jobs and go to schools near Helsinki. Yeah.Todd: Now is Finland part of the European Union?Mariel: Yes, it is since 1995.Todd: OK, so because it's part of the European Union do a lot of young people decide to leave Finland and go live in other countries?Mariel: The Finnish young people are actually very outgoing and they're very interested foreign cultures so a lot of people take a year or two just to travel, just to see the world, visit some places, and yeah, a lot of people go out to other countries to study as well. Yep, mainly Europe but also a lot of my friends for example went to India for six months or to South America.Todd: OK. Sounds fun.Mariel: Yeah.Todd: But because you're in the European Union you can go live in France or Germany or Spain if you want, correct?Mariel: Yeah. It's very easy. Just go.Todd: But do most Finnish people prefer to stay in Finland or do a lot of people like to go move to warmer climates?Mariel: Finnish people are very patriotic. We really love our country. We like to visit other places but I think even if we live abroad for a long time most people always some back to Finland. I think especially if they want to have a family because Finland is a very safe place and it's very good to raise your kids in Finland.Todd: Sounds like a nice place.Mariel: Yeah, I think so. You should come and visit.Todd: Oh, I'd love to.",

Yeah, I was born there and I lived in the city for many years. \nSarah: Cool. What is the most interesting thing about your city? \nTodd: Well, San Francisco has many interesting things, but the most interesting thing is probably the architecture. There’s lots of very unique buildings. And the most unique building is probably the Trans-America building. It’s a building like a pyramid. It’s nice. \n \nSarah: Well, that’s really cool. \nTodd: Uh-hmm. \nSarah: What is the most expensive area in San Francisco? \nTodd: Well, it is very, very expensive. The most expensive area is a place called Pacific Heights, and it’s on the highest hill in San Francisco and it overlooks the Bay. It’s a really, really beautiful place. \nSarah: Hmm.\nTodd: That area by far has the best views of the city. \nSarah: Hmm, what is the most beautiful place in San Francisco? \nTodd: Well, actually the most beautiful place is outside the city. It’s a place called Muir Woods. And it has the tallest trees in the world, and some of these trees are really old. They are the oldest trees in North America. Some of them are over 2,000 years old. \nSarah: Wow. It sounds like some place I would like to see. So it sounds really expensive. Where is the cheapest place to live? \nTodd: The cheapest place to live is a place called Sunset. And Sunset is on the west side, and the houses are kind of old and they’re a little bit cheap. But one thing about Sunset is it has nicest view of the ocean, and you could watch the sunset every night. That’s why it’s called the Sunset area. \nSarah: Hmm. If I wanted to go there, when is the best time to visit? \nTodd: Well, the best time is probably in the fall because that’s when the weather is the nicest. It’s not too cold, and it’s not too hot. And it doesn’t rain that much. \nSarah: So when would be the worst time to visit? \nTodd: The worst time to visit would be probably February and March, because February and March are the coldest and wettest months. So – well, March isn’t that cold but sometimes it’s wet, so it rains a lot. \nSarah: Wow. That sounds really great. I want to go there. \nTodd: Yeah, you should. It’s great place.",

For example, Spain, Belize and Indonesia.\nTodd: Wow, three different continents.\nMeg: Yeah, pretty far apart.\nTodd: Wow, that's cool. So Spain, that must be a really nice country. What did you think of Spain?\nMeg: Spain is really beautiful. There's a lot of beautiful nature and also some nice cities. While I was there, I lived in a small city called Caceres.\nTodd: Oh nice. Are the people really friendly in Spain?\nMeg: Yes. Actually, the people are very friendly and very helpful, especially if you're lost.\nTodd: Oh, that's great. I hear Spanish food is really, really good.\nMeg: Spanish food is delicious. I lived with a Spanish family and my Spanish mom cooked delicious meals every day for lunch. In Spain, seafood is really popular. So I ate a lot of fish and shrimp.\nTodd: Oh, I love fish and shrimp. \nMeg: Me too.\nTodd: Now, Spain is really warm, right?\nMeg: Yes. Spain was very hot while I was there during the summer.\nTodd: Oh yeah? How hot? How hot does it get?\nMeg: It got up past 40 Degrees Celsius during the summer.\nTodd: Wow.\nMeg: Yeah. It was pretty hot.\nTodd: Does it rain?\nMeg: It does rain. But when I was there in the summer, it didn't rain very often.\nTodd: So what about Belize? Belize is a really small country.\nMeg: Belize is very small, but it's also hot similar to Spain in the summer.\nTodd: Why did you go to Belize?\nMeg: I went to Belize on a study trip for school, and I stayed there for about two weeks.\nTodd: Okay. Now, does Belize have good food?\nMeg: Belize also has good food. There was a family that cooked for us and we had a lot of delicious almost Mexican type food.\nTodd: Oh really? So for example, what do you eat? Like, what do people eat in Belize?\nMeg: People eat – it's kind of like a taco but flat with a tortilla, and some meat and vegetables on top and some spices that make it really delicious.\nTodd: So the last country is Indonesia. When did you go to Indonesia?\nMeg: I actually went to Indonesia just last year.\nTodd: Oh wow. How long did you stay?\nMeg: I only stayed there for about a week.\nTodd: Oh yeah? Oh, short trip.\nMeg: Yeah, it was a short trip, but I was just visiting some friends there.\nTodd: Where did you go?\nMeg: I went to Jakarta and Bali.\nTodd: Oh, okay. So I hear Bali has really beautiful beaches. Is it true?\nMeg: Yeah, it's true. There are a lot of famous and beautiful beaches in Bali.\nTodd: Oh, did you surf in Bali?\nMeg: I've never surfed before. Usually, when I went to the beach, I just wanted to put my feet in the water. \nTodd: Oh yeah. Now, Bali also has  very famous scenery on the inside like the rice fields. Did you see the rice fields of Bali?\nMeg: No, I didn't see the rice fields. But I did go to some famous historical spots.\nTodd: So of the three countries – Spain, Belize and Indonesia – what country was your favorite?\nMeg: Maybe Spain was my favorite because I love learning language and it was really nice to stay with my Spanish family.\nTodd: Yeah. I could see that. I really want to go to Spain, and I hope to go soon.\nMeg: I hope you can go too. It's beautiful.",

Or, I only shop if I need something, like it's really cold and I need a jacket.\n\nAbidemi: I see.\n\nTodd: And, I'm really bad, so I often only wear clothes people give to me.\n\nAbidemi: That's good!\n\nTodd: Yeah, so I get shirts or ties for Christmas gifts or a birthday gift, and I do that. My mom often asks ... every year, my mom asks, \"What do you want for Christmas?\", \"What do you want for your birthday?\"\n\nAnd I'll say, \"Underwear and socks\" or \"Socks and T-shirts\". And so, she buys them for me and then I don't have to buy them.\n\nAbidemi: Wow. Sounds like you're an easy person to give a present to.\n\nTodd: Yes, for clothes. Yes, for clothes. But, I waste money on computers and electronics and those things are expensive. So, I buy a new computer every year. I have four computers now in my house.\n\nAbidemi: Wow.\n\nTodd: I have five mobile phones.\n\nAbidemi: Wow.\n\nTodd: I have an iPad. I have lots of electronic equipment. So, I spend so much money on those things.\n\nAbidemi: I waste money on traveling.\n\nTodd: Ah, yeah.\n\nAbidemi: Every year, I take about one or two trips to different countries. So, that's where a lot of my money go.\n\nTodd: Yeah, traveling is expensive.\n\nAbidemi: Yes, yes.\n\nTodd: But, when you travel, do you save money? Do you stay at cheap hotels? Or, do you buy cheap plane tickets?\n\nAbidemi: I try to. I try to all the time. But, usually the plane ticket is so expensive that a lot of my savings is already gone.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I know. I buy my tickets online, usually with Expedia. And, it's cheap. It's pretty cheap. I waste money on food. I eat out almost every day.\n\nAbidemi: Wow.\n\nTodd: Or, I buy my dinner at the supermarket almost every day. Do you waste money on food?\n\nAbidemi: No, I don't. I usually get bored if I eat out too much, because even though I am not a very good cook, there are some thing that I cook that I like to eat. So, I would miss those things. So, no, I don't waste money on eating out.\n\nTodd: Ah, that's interesting. So, you save money, I waste money. You have to teach me your tricks. You have to teach me your tips on saving money.\n\nAbidemi: Please teach me how to get cheap travel tickets.\n\nTodd: It's a deal.\n\nAbidemi: Thanks.",

        "transcript": "Marion\nOne of our dogs at home, he used to go walking with my granddad, and it was on these old country roads. So very quite really, not many cars would pass so the dog, Jonathan, used to run off in front of my granddad and my granddad's hearing wasn't too good at that time. He was already quite old, so he wouldn't always hear cars coming, so every time a car was coming, the dog would, Jonathan would come running back to my granddad so that, and he did this every time a car came so my granddad knew that if Jonathan came running back towards him, he knew that he had to stand in closer to the edge of the road so that, you know, he wouldn't be in danger of being knocked down by a car or anything because those old country roads, you know when I was younger, we used to walk in the middle of the road, or you know, not quite by the edge, cause there were so few cars, you didn't really need to keep by the edge and there were no foot paths along the side, so you were just walking along the edge of the road, so he was a really clever dog in he could alert my granddad, you know to whether a car was coming or not.\nI think most dogs are very intelligent. I've met some people who say their dog is a bit stupid but I don't believe that really. I think most dogs are quite intelligent, even if they're not really good guard dogs, you know, some dogs aren't good guard dogs. They don't bark enough when strangers come or something like that, but I still think they're probably very intelligent, and even if they're not, they're probably very affectionate, which is a plus definitely. It's almost as good as having a really intelligent guard dog I think.",

Can you describe it?\nVivian: A poncho is sort of like a shawl, only it is closed. You can wear it like a sweater. You pull it over your head but you don't have any arms. You just have the shawl affect.\nAdrienne: Oh, I've seen those. Those are actually quite popular now. So what colors did you make?\nVivian: I made a mixture of sand colors that's tan and browns and darker browns, sort of a mixture. It's a nice pretty soft yarn in the same colors. It just blends in.\nAdrienne: Oh, sounds great. I'm sure your granddaughter will love that. What else did you start to make?\nVivian: Well, I wanted to make also, I bought some ponchos and I started to put an edging around them but with crocheting, but it didn't look right.\nAdrienne: What's crocheting? \nVivian: Crocheting is another needle, single needle, that you stick into the wool, and use a thread and you pull it through and you can make decoration on anything that you have knitted, only you use a different needle, and a different method of decoration, but it didn't look right so I pulled it all out and it was fun trying out those things.\nAdrienne: So when will you finish the, all of these projects do you think? Do you have a deadline?\nVivian: Yes, I do, very shortly, I'm almost through",

I got a wolf really because I really love animals, and a wolf is my favorite animal.\n\t\t                Todd:So, you drew the tattoo.\n\t                    Jason: I drew the tattoo, yeah.\n\t                    Todd:Did it hurt when it was being sketched in your body?\n                        Jason: Yeah, it did hurt, but tattoos can vary in amounts of pain depending where on your body it was. The chest is probably the worst place, which is where my tattoo is, so it hurt.\n                        Todd:Why is the chest the worst place?\n                        Jason: Because there's not much meat there, kind of, because there is a lot of bone. And, the closer to the bone it is, and the thinner the skin the more painful it's going to be.",

I think, he said something like that there was a really strong smell, so maybe a similar smell to truffles in France or Italy maybe. I'm not to sure, but sounds interesting anyway.",

OK, first of all, I don't think I learned English as a foreign, a foreign language because I loved to listen to music, especially rock n' roll when I was a teenage. So when you love music, you become, like you, you want to sing with it so you memorize the whole lyrics and you know stuff and, so to me it was like, just, you know, a hobby, it was just a fun purely. It was the pure fun for me so, I didn't think I studied. \nTodd: Wow, that's great! So did you listen without reading the words, the lyrics, or did you just listen and read the lyrics at the same time?\nKawabe: Um, both! Both, yeah! Sometimes, I'd see words which I don't understand, so I look up the dictionary and you know check the meaning and, you know, the things was always like this.\nTodd: Um, so did you do anything else besides music?\nKawabe: Ah, what else? Yeah, the movie! The movie! Like, yeah, I loved to, one of my favorite movies, the Blues Brothers, because you know, that movie is interesting, and first of all, that funny, you know the funniest movie and like a great comedy in the history I think and that movie was famous for it's music, right, you know, that movie's soundtrack is great, and I have the CD in my room. And then.. \nTodd: You have it in your room?\nKawabe: Yeah!\nTodd: Really!\nKawabe: Yeah! I do and, so I saw that movie so many times. I don't remember how many times I saw that, and when you , you know, after the repetition, you know watching the same movies so many times you memorize a whole like words and sentence, what John Belushi was saying, what Dan Aykrod was saying, so it was a great study I think, for me! \nTodd: Wow! That's a great..\nKawabe: But at that time I don't think that was studying you know!\nTodd: Yeah, it was fun! So you enjoyed it!",

What does it feel like to be 80?\nVivian: It's a little inconvenient because my mind didn't turn 80 but my body did and I find it sometimes my mind follows my body too! And it's hard to be as quick as I used to be and I always want to do more, now than I able to do. I can't do what I used to do when I was younger.\nAdrienne: Oh, that's disappointing and probably a little frustrating.\nVivian: Very frustrating! Very frustrating! Especially when you have been active all of your life and all of a sudden things are just, have slowed down to where you can't do all those running around, flying around tasks that you used to be able to do in the morning. \n                                Sometimes it takes me two days to get everything accomplished. Well those are definite disadvantages to getting older. Are there any advantages? Can you give us some hope? Yes! Yes! There is hope. You have reached an age where you understand where you have been. I'm very fortunate that I lived in the 1900's. I was born in 1924. I saw the airplane invented. I saw the beginning of penicillin. I saw the medication for polio which stopped it in its track. I saw so many things. World War II. I was married in World War II and my husband went overseas for two years during that time, and my first two years of marriage was by letters, so it was, it's a good time, 80, you look back on all those things and you're glad to be part of it. You begin to understand the changes that are taking place just as they took place when you were young, but you don't come to that realization until you become old. You don't become wiser. \n                                You just become more knowledgeable.\nAdrienne: Well, that doesn't sound so bad.",

You have a very nice fashion sense.\n\nMeg: Oh, thank you.\n\nTodd: So you must go shopping a lot.\n\nMeg: I do go shopping sometimes. It's fun to go shopping and buy new clothes especially when it's a new season.\n\nTodd: Like what do you like to wear per season? For example, what do you like to wear in winter?\n\nMeg: In the winter, it's pretty cold, so I like to wear sweaters. Sometimes, a t-shirt with a sweater over it to stay warm. Lots of long-sleeve shirts. I like to wear long-sleeve shirts, and I still wear skirts in the winter, so sometimes, I wear tights underneath the skirts to stay warm.\n\nTodd: What about dresses? Do you like to wear dresses?\n\nMeg: I do like to wear dresses. In the winter, it's a good time actually to wear sweater-dresses. They're warm and a dress, so it's nice for work.\n\nTodd: Sweater-dresses.\n\nMeg: Have you seen a sweater-dress before?\n\nTodd: I have no idea what a sweater-dress is. What is a sweater-dress?\n\nMeg: It's a dress but made of sweater material.\n\nTodd: Ah.\n\nMeg: So sweater-cloth made into a dress. So it's very warm.\n\nTodd: Okay. I was picturing a sweater with a skirt attached to it.\n\nMeg: [Laughs] You might find that, but I think a sweater-dress is a little different.\n\nTodd: Okay. What about… What about in the summer?\n\nMeg: In the summer, I love to wear flip-flops. It's my favorite thing to wear. So I often wear flip-flops with jeans or shorts, skirts again. I don't wear tights in the summer because it's too hot.\n\nTodd: Right. Do you wear flip-flops to work?\n\nMeg: I can't wear flip-flops to work. So when I go to work, I often wear high heels or flats, some dress shoes.\n\nTodd: Okay. So do you like to wear shorts or skirts. Which do you prefer?\n\nMeg: I prefer shorts because it's more comfortable and easy to move around. But I also can't wear shorts to work. So I have many summer skirts for work.\n\nTodd: Okay. Now, let's talk about shoes. So women often have many types of shoes, high heels, boots, flats, like you just said, sneakers. So what kind of shoes besides flip-flops do you like to wear?\n\nMeg: I do have many pairs of shoes and so I like to wear flats and sandals especially in the summer. In the winter, I like to wear boots and rain shoes when it rains or rain boots. When I'm exercising, I like to wear sneakers or tennis shoes because it's good for your feet.\n\nTodd: Oh right. Now you travel a lot, we both travel a lot. What shoes do you usually take when you travel?\n\nMeg: When I travel, I usually take flats because they're easy to remove at the airport and they're light and convenient for traveling.\n\nTodd: Oh, right.\n\nMeg: What shoes do you usually use?\n\nTodd: Just my sneakers. So my sneakers I wear everywhere. Now, women sometimes have accessories, you know, like earrings, necklaces, scarves, things like that. What do you like to wear?\n\nMeg: I like to wear necklaces especially long necklaces. I don't like necklaces that are too short. It feels uncomfortable. I don't like to wear bracelets or a watch because I don't like anything on my wrist, but I do love to wear rings. I usually wear one ring each hand, just for fashion, not for anything special.\n\nTodd: Oh that's nice. Cool. Well anyway, thanks, Meg.\n\nMeg: Thank you.",

        "transcript": "Adrienne: So, Vivian, you have grandchildren!\nVivian: I have two lovely granddaughters.\nAdrienne: Granddaughters! What's it like being a grandma?\nVivian: It is a second chance on life because of when you are raising children as a young person you get caught up in the daily world, but with grandchildren it's all fun. I don't have to do this, or I don't have to do that, and when I get tired I can send them home to their parents.\nAdrienne: Right, that's the best part, right? So what else is different about being a mother versus being a grandmother?\nVivian: Being a mother you are totally responsible for your child. You are trying to raise them the best you know how to raise them and you're young and everything that you do you know that will be picked up by your child but when you have grandchildren that duty is up to their parents so I don't feel that I have to really teach them anything. I have to continue the teaching of their parents.\nAdrienne: So you get to do all the fun stuff now that you're a grandma?\nVivian: Yes, it really is fun. They take you by the hand, and take you to the store and point out everything in the world that mom and dad will not give them and it really costs you a lot of money sometimes, unless, you do put your foot down and say, ”NO!”\nAdrienne: So being a grandma is more expensive that being a parent?\nVivian: Absolutely, but it's a lot more fun because at this stage of life you have a little bit more money than you had when you were raising your child. \nAdrienne: I see. That's great.",

How about you?\n\nDaniel: Well, I don’t really cook that often. I’m really busy during the week. So, I always just get something at the shop and get that. But, during the weekends, I always cook during the weekends because I really like making food. That’s what I do.\n\nHana: So, do you ever eat out?\n\nDaniel: Only occasionally, because I’m really busy during the week, and I prefer cooking, so not really often. I don’t go out really often to eat. Whenever I’m tired, and I don’t have time to cook during the week, I go and eat out with a friend, so! And you?\n\nHana: Well, I always , so I normally go and eat out during the weekend with my friends or family.\n\nDaniel: So do you ever buy take-away?\n\nHana: No, I never. Normally when I go out to eat, I like to sit and enjoy my food. How about you?\n\nDaniel: Well, that's really nice. Of course, I do like to sit and enjoy my food, but I have to admit that occasionally I have to buy take-away, especially when I'm coming late from work, and I'm driving. I'm so hungry that, most of the time, I don't really make it home, so I have to buy something on my way, and that's a shame, so that's the way it is.\n\nAnd do you usually have people over for dinner?\n\nHana: Yes, I sometimes do. I really like cooking so occasionally I invite my friends over and cook for them or we all cook together. How about you?\n\nDaniel: Not really. I do love cooking, but the problem is my place is really small, so even though I want to invite my friends. I never do it, because my place would only fit one or two people. So unfortunately, I never have my friends over for dinner.",

        "transcript": "Sarah: John, I've never met your family. Do you have a big family?\n\nJohn: Yeah, kind of. There are five people in my family, so it's a medium family. I have two brothers, so there are three boys in my family. And there's my mother and my father.\n\nSarah: How about your father? Do you look like him?\n\nJohn: Yes, I do. I do look like my father. When he was younger. He had blond hair like me and he has glasses. So do I. My mother has glasses, too. I'm the same height as my father. We are both 180 centimeters tall. My older brother is the same height as me and my father. But my younger brother is shorter than us.\n\nSarah: Ah.\n\nJohn: He has blond hair and glasses too, though.\n\nSarah: Oh. How tall is your younger brother?\n\nJohn: He's a bit shorter than us. I am not sure but I think he's around 170 centimeters tall.\n\nSarah: Oh. How about your mom?\n\nJohn: My mom is short, too. She's the same height as my younger brother.\n\nSarah: Oh.\n\nJohn: And my mom has red hair. Her hair is bright red, so my mother has different hair from the rest of my family. There are four people with blond people with blond hair and one person with red hair. But actually, all five of us wear glasses.\n\nSarah: Oh really?\n\nJohn: Yeah.\n\nSarah: So John, you're thin. What about the rest of your family? Are they thin, too?\n\nJohn: Well, my mother is skinny, too, like me. But my brothers are more like my dad in their body type. They are a little bit more muscular than me. They have big muscles and they're very strong. So they are heavier than me. That's my father. He weighs more than I do. And my brothers are also heavier than me.\n\nSarah: Oh, sounds like a good-looking family.\n\nJohn: Thank you.\n\nSarah: So John, you told me about me about your family's appearance. What about their personality?\n\nJohn: Well, all five people in my family have different personalities.\n\nYeah. My younger brother is really fun. It's great to spend time with him. For example, we usually play video games together. He likes to play racing games or sports games, and also, we play card games or just watching TV. He's so funny.\n\nNo matter what we're doing, he tells jokes and I love listening to him tell jokes about whatever we're doing at the time. And he's so cheerful and bright. He's always open to new people and new ideas. So I really like spending time with him. He makes me feel cheerful, too when we talk together.\n\nSarah: That's great. How about your older brother?\n\nJohn: Well, my older brother, he's a really good guy. He's not so entertaining like my younger brother but he's very smart. He's really serious. He likes to study and read. For example, he likes reading the Greek philosophers. He likes reading about Plato and Socrates. And he's always talking about philosophy. I like that stuff, too. I think it's interesting but he's not very funny.\n\nSarah: I see. How about your dad?\n\nJohn: My dad. Let's see, what can I say about my dad's personality? He's a hard worker. He's very devoted to everything he tries. He was raised on a farm so he knows a lot about animals. And now, he has a farm as a hobby. My dad raises horses and chickens. He loves animals and he has so many animals but he doesn't think of them as farm animals, they're his pets and he loves them.\n\nHe spends everyday outside where no matter what the weather, because he has to take care of his family, which is all of his animals. And he's a really smart guy. Maybe a bit serious at times. His sense of humor is maybe like you can imagine from an old man.\n\nSarah: I see. How about your mother? What's she like?\n\nJohn: My mother loves to read horror novels.\n\nSarah: Really?\n\nJohn: Yeah, horror books. So she knows a lot of stuff about crime or mysteries or police dramas and lawyers. She loves that stuff. So my mother is very interested in those kind of books and movies and TV shows, too. So she's kind of like a detective. My mother is very smart and enjoys solving puzzles.\n\nSarah: Wow. It sounds like an interesting family.",
