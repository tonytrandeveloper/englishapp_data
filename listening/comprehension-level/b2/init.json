        "transcript": "Presenter: The internet is full of articles about what makes a good boy band. But many bands appear and disappear without a trace. Alana, it can’t be as easy as following a formula, can it?\nAlana: No, I don’t think so. The traditional formula is that you have four or five good-looking young guys with some musical ability and the ability to dance – the choreographed dancing was very important to boy bands in the past. They tended to wear the same, or very similar clothes when they performed, so you had to decide on a ‘look’ for the group. The most important element, however, was said to be that the band members had different and very distinct personalities.\nPresenter: Right, the cute one, the rebel, the joker, the shy one, mysterious one ...\nAlana: Yeah, although sometimes they all just seem to like the cute one! The idea is that different boys appeal to different girls, so you can have a bigger fan base. There’s someone in the band for everyone.\nPresenter: So, do you think this all still holds true? Or have things changed in the 21st century?\nAlana: Yeah, I guess things have changed for several reasons – partly just because we needed a change – but mainly because of changes in the media and with new technology. Take One Direction …\nPresenter: Ah, I’ve been counting the seconds before you mentioned One Direction!\nAlana: Well, we have to talk about them because they’re the biggest thing at the moment, although who knows how long they will last.\nPresenter: Oh, ages and ages ...\nAlana: We’ll see. Anyway, One Direction, as you know, came to fame through the X Factor, a reality show, and that was a great way to start. You had loads of people watching them every week and wanting them to win. They felt as if they had a personal stake in their story as they voted for them every week.\nPresenter: What age group does One Direction appeal to exactly?\nAlana: That’s another clever thing, they seem very unthreatening, so they appeal to very young girls, they are cute so teenage girls really like them, but they also have a laddish, slightly naughty side to appeal to the mums! The teenage girls and the mums are the ones who will spend money. The lyrics to the songs are calculated to appeal to girls who feel a bit insecure about themselves, like most teenage girls. \"You don't know you're beautiful, that's what makes you beautiful\", that kind of thing. Lots of girls want to feel wanted, but not scared, and that’s traditionally what boy bands do. They present this image of a clean-cut, reliable boyfriend. Actually, One Direction’s clothes also help here: chinos and clean casual shirts and canvas shoes. You’ll have noticed that they don’t wear the same clothes. Their stylists have been instructed to keep them looking individual, but despite that they all have this attractive but unthreatening look. No tattoos, or piercings, or black leather, or make-up or anything.\nPresenter: You make them seem very cold and calculating. Remember that they’ve been nominated for loads of music awards and they’ve won dozens, so they’re regarded as serious musicians.\nAlana: OK, if you don’t want to believe they’re calculating you can blame their management. They’re nice boys who are fantastic musicians.\nPresenter: They are! And they keep proving their critics wrong. A lot of people said they wouldn’t make the leap from the UK to the US market, but they did very quickly.\nAlana: Yes, and that’s all down to their clever use of social media, or rather their management’s clever use of social media. One Direction are all over Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Tumblr. That’s how they made it in the States so quickly. In the past it was a lot more difficult and took a lot longer. Bands had to try and get air-time on local radio stations and that was really hard. But they’ve by-passed all that. Social media has become the new radio, as their manager said.\nPresenter: Their first record, Up All Night, went to number one in the US, didn’t it?\nAlana: Sure did! They achieved a world record as the first British band in history to reach number one in America with a debut album. It sold 176,000 copies in the US in a single week.\nPresenter: Amazing. And the boys are all rich from the merchandising too.\nAlana: Yes, well, the boys and their management company. There are One Direction phones, toys and games. Dolls, even. I think that’s another 21st-century thing – companies are cashing in on success in all possible ways as quickly as possible.\nPresenter: May they all enjoy it while it lasts.",

        "transcript": "Presenter: Next on the programme we have an interview with someone who has been writing a book about high-achieving teenagers. Welcome, Louise Hardy.\nLouise: Hi, it’s lovely to be here.\nPresenter: Louise, many of these teenagers who have achieved success and fame early on, have done so through using new technology, haven’t they? Through blogging or using YouTube or Twitter?\nLouise: Absolutely, and the greatest example of this is Justin Bieber. As I think everyone on the planet knows, he started off by posting videos on YouTube at the age of 14 and was spotted by a talent scout who worked with the R&B singer Usher. After that he very rapidly became a worldwide sensation.\nPresenter: I heard that last year he was said to be more influential than Obama!\nLouise: (laughs) Yes, that was because he is number one on Twitter. He has over 35 million followers. There’s a new one every two seconds. A company that analyses social media called Klout said that he is the most influential person in the world because of that. But whether he’s really more influential than Obama, well …\nPresenter: Mmmm. All this exposure has negative consequences for young people too, doesn’t it?\nLouise: Yes. Although millions adore Justin, a lot of people don’t. One of his videos was the most disliked ever. And he has a big problem with privacy. He’s followed everywhere by the paparazzi, and that’s bad for anyone, never mind a teenager.\nPresenter: OK, let’s turn to a very different teenager. Tavi Gevinson was even younger when she began, wasn’t she?\nLouise: Yes, she was only eleven years old when she started a fashion blog called Style Rookie. By the way, for British listeners, 'Rookie' is an American word used for a person who is new to something.\nPresenter: Thanks.\nLouise: On her blog she posted photos of herself wearing unusual combinations of clothes and wrote about them.\nPresenter: Some of them were quite weird.\nLouise: Well, yes, I suppose a lot of high fashion is weird. Anyway, she quickly built up a huge following, up to 300,000 readers per day, and many of them were adults. Serious fashion magazines interviewed her and sent her to fashion shows in Europe and to meet top designers, like Karl Lagerfeld.\nPresenter: Some people didn’t believe she was as young as she was, did they?\nLouise: No, one magazine printed an article saying the writer didn’t believe Tavi was only 12, and that upset her. But she bounced back and continued blogging. Then, as she grew older, Tavi became interested in other things besides fashion. In 2011, when she was 15, she started Rookie Magazine, an online magazine for teenagers. In less than a week it had one million readers.\nPresenter: I’ve seen it. It’s very impressive, isn’t it? All teenage girls listening, check out Rookie Magazine.\nLouise: Yes, I think it’s fantastic and Lady Gaga called Tavi 'the future of journalism'! She employs about 50 writers and photographers – both adults and teenagers – on Rookie, but she is the editor with overall control.\nPresenter: And all this time she’s continued to lead a normal life, hasn’t she?\nLouise: Oh yes, she lives a very normal life in a small town and goes to school and so on. She’s not even twenty yet. But I think writing and editing are very different from being a performing artist. There’s a lot less pressure from fans and the press. Although some actors, like Emma Watson, seem to manage a private life and getting a normal education.\nPresenter: Yes, Emma Watson is now in her twenties, of course, but …",

        "transcript": "Good morning. Today I’m going to talk about how to study. Now you probably think you know all about that, right? You’ve been studying for years. And I expect some of you are fantastic at studying, really organised and good at concentrating. But there’s always room for improvement, and your exams aren’t far away, so these tips are for all of you.\n\nRight, so, what’s the best way to study? Well, first of all, it’s a good idea to have some kind of plan or timetable. This could be for the week or a longer revision timetable for an exam, from one month to six months. Yes, if you’re studying for an important exam it’s important to think long term. Draw up a timetable, but revise it often. If it’s not going to plan, you may have to rethink it.\n\nNext, think about your environment. Make sure the place where you are going to study is comfortable with enough light, air, etc. Not too hot, not too cold. Make sure there are no distracting noises around, such as television. If you think you concentrate better listening to music, experiment and see if it’s really true. Some people really do seem to work better with music in the background, especially classical music, but for many people it spoils their concentration. However, if you have to work near a TV, you might have to use headphones to play music to drown out the sound of the TV. In this case, find out what kind of music works best for you, maybe something without words. By the way, you might think you work fine with the TV on, but, again, experiment. You might be surprised at how much better you work away from a TV. Oh, and the other thing is the internet, text messages, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Forget about all of that while you’re studying. No, really, you can ignore it for an hour or so; it won’t be the end of the world if you don’t reply to a message immediately.\n\nRight, planning breaks. Plan your study periods in chunks with regular breaks. Many people recommend half an hour of concentrated study, then a ten-minute break. But you can adjust this to suit you. If you study for too long at a stretch your mind will work less effectively, so be careful. In your short break, you can give yourself a treat, such as a cup of green tea. I wouldn’t advise a chocolate bar as a treat – a sugar rush is not great for concentration.\n\nOK, so next let’s think about what you do when you’re studying. Some people just read through their notes or textbooks and underline in pencil or highlight important bits. If this works for you, fine, but I’d suggest that it’s better to write notes of some kind, so your mind is processing the information more. This way you are also producing material which will be useful for last-minute revision. I don’t recommend very last-minute revision, by the way, but we’ll come back to that later.\n\nHave a look at these examples of student notes. Which do you think are best? The first person has written important phrases at random, the next has a table with clear headings and boxes with notes, the next has summaries, and the last one has mind maps: you’ve got the main topic in the circle, then lines coming off the circle attached to subcategories, then more lines to further details. Mind maps are great for showing the connections between different bits of information. They seem to work in the same way the brain works. So what do you think? To me, the first one wouldn’t be very useful to come back to and use in the future. But the others are all fine – it depends on your personal preference. Mine is for mind maps. I would suggest using colours, though, and even little drawings. They can make things much more memorable.\n\nObviously, when you are studying, the first thing to think about is whether you understand the information, and the second thing is how you are going to remember it. Let’s look at some more ways of making information more memorable …",

        "name": "My hero",
        "transcript": "A (Girl 1):\nMy hero isn’t very famous, but she ought to be. She’s Mary Anning, who was only 12 years old and from a poor family when she made an amazing discovery. She found the first dinosaur skeleton, that of an ichthyosaur, on the cliffs of Lyme Regis in the south of England. That was in 1811, and until then people had thought that it was impossible for an animal to become extinct. Because she was a woman and didn’t have enough money for a proper education, she wasn’t able to take part properly in the scientific community of the time. But she read as much scientific literature as she could and continued to search for fossils, often risking her own life to get them by climbing dangerous cliffs. She once nearly died in a landslide which killed her dog. Although she didn’t write famous books about fossils, her contribution to palaeontology, the study of fossils, is said to be enormous. I admire her because she kept on trying to make new discoveries at a time when usually only men, and men with money, were allowed to be scientists. After her death the writer Charles Dickens said that ‘the carpenter’s daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it’.\n\nB (Boy 1): \nMy hero is Kailash Satyarthi, who has been campaigning against child slavery for years. He is from India and first became aware of the problem of children working when he was 6 and noticed that a boy younger than himself had to spend all day polishing shoes and was unable to go to school. When he was 11, he began to collect money to help buy textbooks for other children, and when he was 26 he gave up his job as an electrical engineer to fight child slavery in India, by doing things like raiding factories where children were forced to work, making rugs or glass bottles. He introduced a programme first called RugMark, now known as Goodweave, which puts tags on child-labour-free rugs made in factories. He has saved many thousands of children, over 80,000, from a terrible life of enforced labour in South Asia and helped them to get an education. He has often been physically attacked for helping children, for example for trying to free Nepalese children forced to work in a circus. He regularly risks his life to fight injustice; two of his colleagues have been murdered. I believe that the best thing he has done is to change how people think about child slavery and to make it an international issue.\n\nC (Boy 2):\nI’m really interested in ecology and my hero, or heroine, is Rachel Carson because she first got people thinking about the way we humans are causing permanent damage to the Earth’s ecosystems. She began as a biologist, specialising in writing about the sea, but she gradually became aware of the danger of using pesticides like DDT and the way they can harm the whole of the food chain, from the worm to humans! She wrote her classic book Silent Spring in 1962 to explain this to the general public, to explain how humans and nature are interdependent. The title of Silent Spring refers to the fact that one day all the birds might be dead so they won’t be able to sing in the springtime. The agricultural and chemical industries reacted very badly to the book and said she was unprofessional. But further research by other scientists proved that she was right about the dangers of chemicals used to kill insects. Nowadays there is a growing movement for organic food production, but unfortunately things in general are still getting worse, rather than better. We still need to read Rachel Carson’s book and think about its message.\n\nD (Girl 2):\nMy choice of hero isn’t very original, I’m afraid, but he’s the person I would most like to have met: John Lennon. He died a long time before I was born, and his most famous songs were written long before that, but when I listen to his music I really feel as if he’s speaking to me personally. I love the whole range of the Beatles’ music, from the early pop songs to the very experimental music at the end of their time as a group. John Lennon was the most innovative writer in the Beatles and he continued to create exciting music when he left and went solo. But although I love his music, what I admire about him is his dedication to universal peace. It’s amazing that the song Imagine, written in 1971, is still incredibly popular after all this time. It’s about a world where everyone can be equal, a world with no wars, no divisions between countries, no greed, no hunger, no material possessions ... I’d like to meet him because he was a lifelong rebel, and although he could be a difficult person, he was original, clever and funny. It was awful that he was killed in 1980 when he was only 40. I wonder what he would be doing if he was alive now.",

        "transcript": "Presenter: Welcome to Tech Today! This week it’s National Science and Engineering Week, so to celebrate we asked Jed our science correspondent to give us a round-up of new inventions.\n\nJed: Hi, yes, I’ve got some very interesting things to tell you about today, starting with a fun one: wingsuits, those suits that look like bats and allow people to fly, or glide, at least. They’re the ultimate in cool.\n\nPresenter: But they’re not very new, are they?\n\nJed: Well, no, but the modern ones are better than ever and last October was the first ever world championship in China. The price is coming down, too. Now you can buy one for 600 to 2,000 dollars. It’s still too expensive for me, but I suppose it’ll keep coming down.\n\nPresenter: OK, what about useful new inventions?\n\nJed: There are lots of those. There’s a new solar water distiller created by Gabriele Diamanti aimed at parts of the world where it’s hard to get clean drinking water. You pour in salty water and let the sun do the work for a few hours. Then, hey presto! You have clean water! It’s a very simple device and fairly cheap to produce.\n\nPresenter: Can I hear some doubt in your voice?\n\nJed: Well, they still need help with investment to start producing the distiller properly. So if anyone out there has money to invest in a great product …?\n\nPresenter: Absolutely. Get in touch with the designers.\n\nJed: Another useful invention which it would be good to see in production are ‘enable talk gloves’. These were invented by some Ukrainian students to allow people with speech and hearing impairments to communicate with people who don’t understand sign language. The gloves use sensors to translate sign language into text, then into spoken language using a smartphone. A brilliant invention!\n\nPresenter: Yes, that could benefit thousands of people.\n\nJed: Another useful invention comes from a surprising source, James Cameron, the film director.\n\nPresenter: The Titanic director?\n\nJed: The very same. Cameron was part of a team, headed by engineer Ron Allum, which designed the Deepsea Challenger Submarine, capable of descending to the lowest parts of the sea, 10 km down. Last year Cameron went down to the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the sea in the world. He was the first person to do a solo dive there, and he stayed for three hours, the longest time so far.\n\nPresenter: That sounds impressive!\n\nJed: Yes. We know so little about what’s at the bottom of the ocean, and it’s important to find out more. OK, so now for something useful in a different way. You know that feeling when you’re trying to get tomato ketchup out of a bottle and it won’t come out, but you’re sure there’s lots more in there?\n\nPresenter: Yeah, of course. It’s really annoying.\n\nJed: Well, a team of students at MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have come up with a new product that you use to coat a glass or plastic bottle, and then what’s inside, hair gel or mustard, or whatever, comes out really easily.\n\nPresenter: So, it saves hours of frustration trying to get stuff out of bottles?\n\nJed: Exactly. Right, now for my favourite invention. This is really silly, but I love it. It’s a way of producing clouds indoors.\n\nPresenter: Clouds?\n\nJed: Yes. A Dutch artist has come up with a way of forming perfect, small, white clouds inside. They’re just beautiful. I don’t think you can do it yourself at home yet, though.\n\nPresenter: I don’t think I’d want to.\n\nJed: Oh, you would if you’d seen the photos. They’re amazing.\n\nPresenter: OK, Jed, thanks for that. We’ll leave you with your head in the clouds and see you again next week!",

        "transcript": "Presenter: Now the 2020 Olympics might seem a long way away to you, but people are already talking about what new sports might be included. Today I’m going to talk to two people who are hoping their sport might be included. The first is Jonny Mills whose sport is wakeboarding. Jonny, can you tell us what wakeboarding is? Is it like surfboarding?\nJonny: Well, a bit. It started in California because people wanted to surf but didn’t have waves ... It’s also a bit like waterskiing in that the rider is towed behind a specially-built speed boat.\nPresenter: How fast does the boat go?\nJonny: Usually at about 25 mph, or a bit less. The rider uses the wake the board produces in the water to launch into the air.\nPresenter: And then you do a lot of complicated things in the air?\nJonny: That’s right, spins of up to 1260 degrees, things like that.\nPresenter: 1260 degrees, that’s impossible isn’t it?\nJonny: Oh no, but it’s pretty crazy. You spin round three and a half times in the air.\nPresenter: And then you have to land again without falling over.\nJonny: You’ll have to come and watch some wakeboarding if you haven’t seen any. Come to Wakestock in July if you can.\nPresenter: That’s in Wales, isn’t it?\nJonny: Yep, Abersoch in North Wales. It’s a really popular wakeboarding and music festival. It’s right by the beach. It’s not quite the same as California, but it’s cool. It attracts a lot of great riders.\nPresenter: Who does wakeboarding?\nJonny: They reckon about 3 million people all over the world. More guys do it, but there are increasing numbers of girls too. The people who compete are usually in their teens or twenties, but anyone can do it. There’s a lot of crossover with other board sports like surfing and skateboarding. The tricks people pull are similar and the names for things are often the same.\nPresenter: And looking at you, I’d say the fashion was similar too.\nJonny: Yeah, the clothes and the lifestyle are similar.\nPresenter: Right, now I’d like to ask Jules Russell about her sport. She’s a skater in a roller derby team. Tell us about that, Jules. Is it a popular sport?\nJules: Yes, it’s becoming really popular in the UK. There are about 60 leagues in England and 1,200 throughout the world. In the US and Canada, of course, and places like Scandinavia and Australia, but lots of other countries too.\nPresenter: The sport began in the States, didn’t it?\nJules: Yes, in the 1930s, but it was more for entertainment than sport and it died out by the 1970s. Then there was a revival in Texas in 2001 and from then on it’s just been growing and growing.\nPresenter: So how do you play it?\nJules: Well, you have two teams of five people on roller skates, of course, and they go round an oval track in the same direction. Each team has a \"jammer\" who scores points by passing members of the opposing team. They do whatever they can to stop her, within reason. The team with the most points at the end of the match wins.\nPresenter: It sounds a bit rough!\nJules: Well, it’s a contact sport, so there’s bound to be a lot of pushing and falling over. It’s all good fun, though; people don’t often get hurt. If you try and trip someone up you get penalised. You do try and frighten the other team a bit though.\nPresenter: That’s right. You have frightening clothes and special names.\nJules: People used to have incredible costumes a couple of years ago. Now the sport is changing and becoming more professional. Lots of the teams train three or four times a week, and spend a lot of time in the gym you have to be really dedicated and fit. We still have nicknames, though. I’m “The Julifier”.\nPresenter: And is the sport all female?\nJules: There are a few men who do it, but it’s mostly female and amateur at the moment. Things are changing fast though, so who knows what the future will bring. It would be fantastic to be an Olympic sport.\nPresenter: What do you think about roller derby, Jonny?\nJonny: It’s wild! Those ladies scare me to death! Good luck to them with the Olympics thing though. And good luck to us too.\nPresenter: Good luck to you both.",

        "transcript": "Good morning, everybody. Good morning. Hello. Now, have you ever noticed that when you log on to the internet, you nearly always see adverts for things that you're interested in? Yes? OK. So, let's say you were looking for a new pair of trainers last week. Well, suddenly you'll see adverts for trainers all over the place. Well, believe it or not, this isn't random. The internet browsers, websites and apps that we use know a lot about us because they monitor how we use their site or app. This way they can work out what we like and don't like. Clever! So, you've probably heard of cookies. Am I right? Yes? OK. When you visit some sites for the first time, a cookie is downloaded onto your computer that keeps a track on how you travel around the site and exactly what you do. So, the next time you use the site again, your computer will check the cookies and adapt, depending on the information it stored from your last visit. With me? OK. So, without even thinking about it, we give out a lot of information that can then be used to personalise our online experience.\n\nNow, I saw a great presentation last week by the internet activist Eli Pariser and I want to tell you a little bit about it. He wrote a book a few years ago called The Filter Bubble and I think it's something that we should all know about. Here's the book. We actually have it in the school library if you want to borrow it. In this talk I'm just going to give you a little taster. Now, he likens the 'filter bubble' to an ecosystem and he claims it is something that we should all be worried about. Now, after reading his book and watching his talk, I've got to say I agree with him. I think it's something you should all know about too.\n\nSo, let me try to explain using a simple example. Imagine I support a political party … so, to keep this really simple let's call it the Yellow Party. OK, so let's say I have lots of friends who also support the Yellows but some of my friends support the Reds. Now, on my favourite social media site I want to see the posts from all my friends but I tend to click more on the links that are posted by my friends who support the Yellows, like me, obviously. Even so, I do still want to see what the Reds are posting about. With me? OK. Now, a few months ago, just before the big elections I noticed something quite weird happening on my newsfeed. I noticed that my friends who support the Red Party had almost completely disappeared from the site, and I was only being shown posts from my Yellow friends. Weird. Now, I wondered if all my Red friends had left this social media space and moved somewhere else, but when I clicked on their profiles to check, I could see that they had been busy posting links and talking to people, but their posts were being hidden from me. And it's only now I understand why. I know it's because I hardly ever clicked on their posts and I didn't interact so much with them. So, the social media site itself had decided for me that I wasn't interested in their posts, so they decided not to show them to me. Now, this is an example of what Eli Pariser means by the filter bubble – it's when the websites and apps choose what information we can and can't see. Does that make sense?",

        "transcript": "OK. So, moving on, if the social media sites can personalise the user experience, to block out things they think we don't want to see, well, begs the question, what else is being hidden from us? Well, in his talk Eli Pariser gives another example. Did you know that if two people type the same word into some of the most popular search engines, the results might be totally different?\n\nI know. Crazy, huh? Well, maybe you can try it one time with a friend. The example that Eli gave in his talk was two of his friends who have very different interests. They both typed the word 'Egypt' into a search engine. One got results from news websites about recent events in Egypt and the other got mainly travel guides. The results were totally different and this is because some search engines record information about what we usually look at, what we like and what our interests are.\n\nSome sites are now starting to personalise what an individual user sees. Now, sometimes, of course, it can be really helpful to have information personalised for us. It can save us time searching and often actually we do want to see the information that we're more interested in. It can make online shopping easier and it helps us to connect with like-minded people. But let's stop for a second and think. Do we really want the internet to offer us only what the internet thinks we want to see? Aren't we going to miss out on a lot of really interesting and fresh information?\n\nWell, whatever you think about the filter bubble, I think we all need to be aware that this is happening. By controlling the flow of information each individual receives, these algorithms mean we don't have access to all the information that is out there. So, aren't we missing out on a lot of really useful stuff?\n\nThe question is, what can we do? Well, I have to say, I agree with Eli Pariser. I think we need to try and step outside of our filter bubbles from time to time to try and get our information from other sources, as well as the internet. And actually you can look for alternative search engines that don't filter the content in the same way. They exist too. There are also ways to depersonalise searches, but I will tell you more about that another day. For now, just try to make sure that you keep your eyes and ears open and learn as much as you can about how the internet actually works. Things change very quickly, but we should all try and keep up to date and learn more about how the wonderful worldwide web works. Thank you very much.",

        "transcript": "For thousands of years the Maasai people in Kenya had no doubts about their relationship with the lions who shared the land with them. They were enemies. The lions wanted to kill the tribe’s livestock and the Maasai had to protect the animals. It was even part of the coming-of-age ritual of young warriors to kill a lion.\n\nBut now things have changed and the Maasai are part of a new East African scheme to protect lions, called the Lion Guardians. The aim is for local people to be trained to manage and protect the lions without involvement from outsiders after the period of initial training. The Lion Guardians are taught basic literacy, how to manage data, how to deal with conflict between humans and lions, GPS and telemetry tracking of radio-collared lions. Some of them also learn how to speak in public and how to blog.\n\nThe Lion Guardians monitor the lions and other carnivores and inform cattle herders when to avoid the areas where there are lions. They also help improve the livestock enclosures and educate people about wildlife. Helping find lost livestock is another important job. In the past these would often have been killed by carnivores.\n\nIf anyone is about to carry out a lion hunt, the Lion Guardians try and persuade them not to. Since many of the Guardians have killed lions in the past and are very experienced, they are highly respected in the community and are listened to by their age-mates, or peers, and often by their elders. They explain the importance of the lions to culture and tourism and how they can now be arrested for killing protected animals.\n\nOne such Lion Guardian is Olubi Lairumbe. He has killed seven lions in his lifetime. The last one was a lioness who was pregnant with five cubs. He regretted killing her very much, had a massive change of heart and volunteered to become a Lion Guardian. Olubi’s father used to hate lions and encouraged his sons to hunt them, but since Olubi became a Guardian, he has been advising them not to kill carnivores. Olubi was recently interviewed by Sir David Attenborough and appeared on the Africa documentary series.\n\nAnother Guardian, Mingati Makarot, is very good at tracking lions using his traditional skills and has a great knowledge of the area that acts as a refuge to many wildlife species. Mingati is a past lion killer but has completely converted to being one of its ardent protectors. His name, Mingati, is a ‘lion name’ given to him meaning one who is fast and doesn’t lag behind.\n\nIn the past, a moran (a Maasai warrior) received a lion name after spearing a lion. In Maasai culture the name represents the characteristics of both the warrior and the lion he has killed. A warrior with a lion name feels that he has achieved something great. When the successful warrior brings the lion’s mane and tail back to his manyatta (his home in the community) to be put on display, he is treated as a hero. Other young men who don’t yet have their lion names are called by the general name of ‘moran’. They long to have recognition and dream about the day that it will be their turn to bring home the lion trophy.\n\nNow, this naming tradition is changing. The Lion Guardians experimented by giving lion names to boys who had not killed lions and it worked. Other young people called them by the lion names, then the older people did so too. There were still some boys who wanted to do something to prove their bravery, and they were assigned conservation tasks to do. Now young men can earn respect by protecting lions, rather than killing them.\n\nAnother change is that the lions are now given Maasai names and each has a card explaining who the lion is related to and which lions they keep company with. Personalising the lions helps them to be seen as individuals by the community.\n\nSince the programme began in 2007, no lions have been killed in the area patrolled by Lion Guardians. Compare that to a similar neighbouring area without Guardians, where 63 have been killed, and you can see just how successful the scheme is. The Maasai have managed to successfully adapt their culture to changing times without giving up their identity.",

        "name": "Unusual British festivals",
        "transcript": "Hello. I’m going to talk about British festivals. I’m sure you’ve heard about the Notting Hill Carnival in London and the Edinburgh Festival, but today we’re going to look at a lot more that you might not know about. Actually, a lot of these are not exactly festivals, but strange races or competitions. Some of them are ancient and some are modern.\n\nSo, let’s start in January in the north of Scotland with the Burning of the Clavie. This is a whisky barrel which is set alight then carried through the streets as a bonfire. It’s an ancient tradition which always takes place on 11th of January, the first day of the year, according to an older form of the calendar. The bonfire brings good luck for the coming year and people used to keep bits of burnt wood as protection against evil spirits. At the end of January, even further north, in the Shetland Islands, there’s another fire festival, the Up Helly Aa. This seems like an ancient festival, but has actually only been going for about 130 years – well, it is fairly old, I suppose. People carry fire-lit torches and a Viking boat through the streets, then set fire to the boat. There’s lots of dancing; it’s good fun.\n\nNow to the north of England. On Shrove Tuesday in February, otherwise known as Pancake Day, a special Pancake Bell is rung in Scarborough. Everyone goes down to the road next to the beach where they skip – yep, they jump over long ropes, up to fifteen people to one rope. And they have pancake races. This is quite common in the UK – running with a frying pan and tossing a pancake at the same time.\n\nAnother kind of race takes place in spring – cheese rolling. In Gloucestershire, in the south-west of England, round cheeses in round boxes are sent rolling down a hill and people run after them and try and catch them. The hill is very steep, so people often fall over – if you take part in this you need to be very fit and wear your oldest jeans. Nowadays this strange custom attracts visitors from all over the world, but the people from the local village are usually the ones who catch the cheese.\n\nFrom people-racing, to animals, very tiny animals. World Championship Snail Racing takes place in a village in Norfolk. The snails have to race from an inner circle to an outer circle and the winner gets a lot of lettuce. There’s a party and barbecue for the snail owners and observers. This custom began in the 1960s after a local man saw something similar in France. In the UK we don’t eat snails, by the way.\n\nMore fun, in my opinion, are the onion-eating contest, also in Gloucestershire – a race to finish eating a raw onion – and the Black Pudding Throwing Championship, in Lancashire. Black puddings are like big sausages made mainly from dried blood. Contestants bowl three black puddings each at 21 Yorkshire puddings set on a six-metre platform; the winner is the one who knocks down the most. Another fun contest takes place in September at the Egremont Crab Fair in Cumbria in the north of England. The World Gurning Championship is a competition to pull the ugliest face. It sounds ridiculous but this is an ancient British tradition and the Crab Fair itself dates back to 1267. The man who won the title of best gurner the most in recent years had all his teeth taken out so he could make terrible faces more easily.\n\nFinally, let’s go back to the south of England. In Brighton there’s a Burning the Clocks Festival to celebrate the winter solstice on December 21st. This custom started twenty years ago and is very popular. People make clock lanterns and time-themed figures of paper and wood, then walk through the town to the beach where the sculptures are set on fire and there’s a massive firework display.\n\nSo, that’s just a taste of a few of our old and more modern traditions. Would you like to take part in any of them?",

Then I want you to write your answers in your notebook. Please be sincere! Nobody is going to look at your answers. When we complete the quiz I’ll read out the results and you can think about them carefully for a few minutes in private. You need a pen and a blank page in your notebook. OK, pay attention, please.\n\nOne. When do you usually get to school?\na) Early, you like to have extra time ‘just in case’ something crops up.\nb) You always turn up just in time, as the bell rings.\nc) You often get to school late, out of breath from rushing.\n\nTwo. When do you usually do your homework?\na) As soon as you get it. The same evening.\nb) A day or two before you have to hand it in.\nc) The same day you hand it in. Sometimes it’s late.\n\nThree. What is your average mark in tests?\na) You usually do well and get seventy-five per cent or higher.\nb) You usually pass tests but your marks are near to fifty or sixty per cent.\nc) Your marks are often below fifty per cent.\n\nFour. What kind of a relationship do you have with the staff at school?\na) Great! You get on well with most of the academic staff.\nb) Not bad. You have a good relationship with some members of staff.\nc) Dreadful. In general you don’t get on with teachers.\n\nFive. Where do you usually sit in class?\na) Usually at the front so you can see the board easily.\nb) Somewhere in the middle so you can daydream unnoticed.\nc) Near the back so you can turn on your mobile without being seen.\n\nSix. What do you want to do when you finish school?\na) Carry on studying at university or college.\nb) You don’t know yet. It depends on your exam results.\nc) Look for a job and start earning your own money. You’ll be fed up with studying by then.\n\nOK. Now look at your answers and count the number of As, Bs and Cs. Then I’ll read out the results. Are you ready?\n\nIf you have mostly As, you are an exceptional student. You are mature and you have a superb attitude towards your studies. You definitely grasp the importance of a good education.\nIf you have mostly Bs, you are an average student, but you are capable of much more and it isn’t too late to improve and become an excellent student. You just need to make a few changes to your habits.\nIf you have mostly Cs, you really need to adjust your outlook. You waste your time and you are at risk of finishing school without any qualifications. Think about your behaviour and consider making some changes before it’s too late.",

        "transcript": "Presenter 1: Today we are going to talk about names, particularly fashions in names, you know, the kind of names famous people use for their children. You’ve been looking into this recently, haven’t you Finn?\nPresenter 2: I have indeed and it’s a fascinating topic. The US leads here with new names and we in Britain follow sometimes, but we tend to go for the more traditional names. So, the big trend is using nouns as names.\nPresenter 1: Nouns, what sort of nouns?\nPresenter 2: Well they can be abstract qualities like Honor or Passion. There’s a long tradition of this kind of name, like Faith or Charity, which used to be common names. A new name is Haven, that’s growing in popularity. And similar names like Shelter, Harbor and Bay also convey feelings of safety and warmth.\nPresenter 1: Mmm. I suppose Passion is used to mean ‘extreme enthusiasm’ nowadays, and people use the word a lot, so maybe it’s a good choice for a modern name. Haven has a nice, safe feel to it.\nPresenter 2: OK, then there are names which come from nature or animals, although with some of these it’s hard to know whether they come from nature or a surname – that’s another trend. Here we have Frost, Wolf, Fox, Bear, for boys, of course. And a new name: Ridge.\nPresenter 1: Ridge, like a mountain ridge? The top of a mountain range?\nPresenter 2: Yes, weird, huh? It’s seen as a tough, outdoorsy name for a boy. OK, then there are musical names. Harmony and Melody have been around for ages, but Lyric is a new one.\nPresenter 1: Lyric, wow!\nPresenter 2: Yes, it came in at number 325 in the US a couple of years ago. That doesn’t sound very popular, but there are so many different names being used at the moment that it means it isn’t so unusual. Other noun categories are months – May, June and April are common, but January is uncommon and November very unusual. And then you have colours. Beyoncé and Jay-Z called their daughter Blue Ivy – a very distinctive name, a colour plus the name of a plant. Blue is very popular for girls right now, and Red or Grey for boys.\nPresenter 1: I’ve just thought of another category. Food names, like Olive or Clementine.\nPresenter 2: Yes, that’s another one. Flower names are pretty common, but food names are unusual. Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin named their daughter Apple, of course.\nPresenter 1: Yes, poor child.\nPresenter 2: Actually, Apple is becoming more and more popular, although people think that’s because of the technology connection, not the fruit. New names always seem strange at first, but you quickly get used to them, like all the names from places or jobs. Chelsea and Brooklyn seem like normal names now; they were strange when they were first used. Taylor, Mason, Cooper are all first names from jobs.\nPresenter 1: And they are also surnames, I think that’s how they started.\nPresenter 2: You’re probably right there.\nPresenter 1: What about the Beckhams’ daughter, Harper?\nPresenter 2: She was named after Harper Lee, the American novelist who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. That’s another trend, naming children after famous writers, musicians – the British band One Direction have had an effect on names – or fictional characters, like Bella or Edward from the Twilight series, or Hermione from Harry Potter.\nPresenter 1: Sorry, can I just interrupt there. I’ve just has a message passed on by the producer. A listener has just phoned in with a very strange story about a family in Holland with six children. Their names are all anagrams of the letters: A, E, L and X.\nPresenter 2: Ah yes, I’ve heard about this. This family are famous in the world of bloggers on names. Let me see if I remember the names … Alex and Axel … and Lexa – they’re the easy ones – Xela ('Zela') and Xael ('Zay-el') and the last one is Xeal ('Zeal') – I’m guessing about the pronunciations, by the way.\nPresenter 1: You mean there are names X-E-L-A and X-A-E-L?\nPresenter 2: Yes, but they are very unusual. I think the Dutch family are stopping at six children, but there are about eighteen more possible anagrams they could use.\nPresenter 1: Nooo, you’re kidding!\nPresenter 2: All seem horrible to me, but all are possible names. This is similar to another trend of giving children names all starting with the same letter, like the Kardashian family, all beginning with K, Kim, Kourtney and so on.\nPresenter 1: The Kardashians have had enough publicity, let’s not talk about them. What about your name? Finn, that sounds like a good Irish name …",

        "transcript": "Presenter: Welcome to today's show. We're very happy to have Anna Oliveira as our guest today. Anna is the creator and founder of HomeworX – spelled with an 'x' we should note – an app which helps teenagers with their homework. Thanks for coming in, Anna.\n\nAnna: Thanks for having me.\n\nPresenter: So, tell us about your app. How does it work?\n\nAnna: Well, teenagers and their parents have numerous challenges when it comes to homework these days. In many families both parents work and don't have much available time to help their kids with their homework. And even if they do have time to help, they may not be able to offer support with the content. What I mean is, they may not know, or at least remember, enough in any given subject to support.\n\nPresenter: You mean they might not be able to remember complex maths or might have never studied certain subjects, such as biology or economics, themselves?\n\nAnna: Exactly. So they might want to support their children with their homework, but have neither the time nor the knowledge to do so.\n\nPresenter: I see. So the app helps solve this problem?\n\nAnna: Yes, and more. The next issue is that tutors can be expensive, and there may be long waiting lists for specialist tutors in the town or region you live in. Our HomeworX app brings students and tutors together online. Students can search a database of pre-approved tutors and sign up for live online support. They don't need to be in the same town or city.\n\nPresenter: That sounds really great.\n\nAnna: It is. And this approach also enables us to offer the tutoring services at lower prices because there's no travelling time involved for the tutor to get to the student's home. And tutors who live in remote areas are happy to get access to more students, and be able to work from home, even at lower rates.\n\nPresenter: This all sounds great. So, how did you come up with the idea?\n\nAnna: Well, as you might guess, I was one of those parents I described earlier. I really wanted to help my son with his homework, but I was either too busy with work or I didn't actually know anything about the subjects he was having difficulty with. Also, we live in an area where there aren't many tutors and the ones that are there are either very expensive or have long waiting lists.\n\nPresenter: Yes. I can understand your predicament. Well, it sounds like a very useful app that is clearly meeting a need. And its popularity obviously speaks for itself.\n\nAnna: Thank you.\n\nPresenter: So, do you have plans for the future?\n\nAnna: We've just secured some funding and hope to expand the range of services we offer using the app.\n\nPresenter: We wish you the best of luck. Thanks again for coming in. That was Anna Oliveira, founder of the tutoring app HomeworX (with an 'x', don't forget!), which is available for both Apple and Android devices. Join us again next week for another business interview. Have a great week, everyone.",

        "transcript": "Hi, everyone. Thanks for coming to this short presentation on our new product design. As you know, we've already redeveloped our 'Adventure' shampoo to make it more modern and appealing. And we've renamed it 'Adventure Tech'. Our market research established the target market as men in the 18–40 age range who like to be outdoors and also like technical gadgets, such as smartwatches, drones and things like that. We needed to create a bottle which appeals to that market.\n\nSo, today, I'm happy to unveil our new bottle design. As you can see, it's designed to look like a black metal drinking flask, with some digital features printed on it.\n\nI'd like to talk you through the following three points: the key features, sizing and our timeline for production.\n\nFirstly, you'll notice it has an ergonomic design. That means it fits smoothly into your hand and can be easily opened and squeezed using one hand. And, it looks like a flask you might use when hiking outdoors. The imitation digital displays are designed to remind the user of other tech devices they may have, such as a smartwatch or smart displays in their home.\n\nI'd now like to tell you about the sizes. It comes in two sizes: the regular size and a small travel size. The travel size is the same type of design – a flask, also with imitation digital displays on the bottle. We were thinking of starting with one and following with the travel-size in a few months, but we've worked hard and both are ready now.\n\nFinally, I'm going to talk to you about our timeline for production. You've probably heard that we're launching in two months. In preparation for that, we're starting the marketing campaign next month. You can see the complete overview of all phases in this Gantt chart.\n\nIn summary, the bottle's been designed for men who like adventure and technology, and it comes in two sizes. The marketing campaign is starting next month and we're launching the product in two months.\n\nOK. So, any questions? Feel free to also email me for further information in case we run out of time.",

        "transcript": "Presenter: So, we're back in the studio. Welcome back, everyone. My name's Rick Walker. From our laptops to our televisions, from the displays on our smartphones to those on our satnavs, we are in front of screens all the time. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to disconnect completely? To choose not to have access to the internet? If you have, you may be in need of a digital detox – a total switch-off from all things digital. The idea of people taking a digital detox is becoming more and more popular, especially amongst young people – and today we're joined by someone who's tried a number of digital detox activities and is here to give us some advice about it. Amanda Vince, welcome to the studio.\n\nAmanda: Thank you very much.\n\nPresenter: So, Amanda, you work for a fashion magazine in London, right? I guess your work means you need to be online a lot.\n\nAmanda: Oh, yes. Apart from the hundreds of emails I get every day, I'm always browsing fashion websites, as well as online videos. I also need to be very active online, especially on Twitter and Instagram – sharing what we're doing in the magazine, interacting with designers, photographers, influencers … it never stops, literally. Then of course there's my friends and family to keep in touch with online too, and for me, my work grew out of my passion, so friends and work colleagues aren't two totally separate groups of people and it all gets a bit messy online sometimes. I think I'm online for at least 12 hours a day.\n\nPresenter: So, how did you get the idea for a digital detox?\n\nAmanda: I read a book about it, called Log Off: How to Stay Connected after Disconnecting. The author's name is Blake Snow. That book gave me some really good advice and made me think about trying to change some of my digital habits. I started with removing distraction.\n\nPresenter: What do you mean by that?\n\nAmanda: That means turning off alerts, buzzes, alarms or notifications of any kind. I had notifications set up for everything, and it meant I was always being forced to look at my phone. Removing all of them except for important contacts helped me focus immediately. The book also made a really good point, that we should ask ourselves 'Why?' every time we take out our phone. I realised that most of the times I looked at my phone were because I was trying to avoid or ignore something else happening right in front of me. It was an automatic habit.\n\nPresenter: I have to confess, that happens to me too. But what else are you going to do when you're standing in line at the bank or waiting for your train?\n\nAmanda: OK, yes, I'm the first to admit that it's great for helping time go by. But speaking personally, I found I wasn't just checking my phone to kill time when I was alone. I was also doing it with friends or family around.\n\nPresenter: Hmmm … right. Well, so far, this doesn't sound too drastic. Turning off notifications and becoming aware of when we use our devices. That sounds easy.\n\nAmanda: Yes, it's the first step. Once we begin to realise just how much of a grip our devices have on us, then we're ready to really take the next step. First, my partner and I did a weekend with absolutely no screens. She found it easier than I did. For me, it was a little bit scary at first but it turned out to be a pretty rewarding experience.\n\nPresenter: A whole weekend, huh? I don't know if I could ...\n\nAmanda: I think everyone has to do this at their own pace. If a weekend feels too much, maybe just try for an evening. Then work your way up to more. I guarantee, once you've tried it, you'll want to try it again. We're going to try for a whole week in the summer.\n\nPresenter: OK, let's pause there then and see what our listeners have to say. You can call us here directly, or send us a message on any of our social media channels ... oops, should I be saying that? Anyway, more after the break.",

        "transcript": "In today's lecture we're going to be talking about experiments, and I thought it might be interesting for you all to learn about the world's oldest continuously running laboratory experiment that is still going today. In fact, it holds the Guinness World Record for being the longest-running experiment. This experiment began in 1927 and has been going ever since.\n\nIt's called the 'pitch drop' experiment and it was created by Professor Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, Australia. Parnell was the university's first physics professor, and he wanted to show in this experiment that everyday materials, such as pitch, can have quite surprising properties.\n\nYou see, when pitch is at room temperature, it feels solid. You can easily break it with a hammer. However, it isn't in fact solid. At room temperature, pitch is many billions of times more viscous than water, but it's actually fluid.\n\nIn 1927, Professor Parnell took a sample of pitch. He heated it and poured it into a glass funnel. He allowed the pitch to cool and settle – for three years. He then turned the funnel upside down and cut the top off it.\n\nSince then, the pitch has slowly dropped out of the funnel. How slowly? Well, the first drop took eight years to fall. It took another forty years for another five drops to fall. Today it's been almost 90 years since the experiment started. Only nine drops have fallen from the funnel. The last drop fell in April 2014 and the next one is expected to fall in the 2020s.\n\nThe experiment has a tragic story associated with it. Professor Parnell died without seeing a pitch drop. His replacement, Professor John Mainstone, became responsible for the pitch drop experiment from 1961. He held the job for 52 years, and missed seeing the drop fall three times – by a day in 1977, by just five minutes in 1988 and finally in 2000, when the webcam that was recording the experiment suffered a power outage for 20 minutes, during which time the pitch dropped.\n\nThe pitch drop experiment is something we can all participate in now. There's a live web stream that allows anyone to watch the glass funnel and wait for the fateful moment. A similar experiment to the Queensland pitch drop was set up in Dublin, and the video of the moment the pitch actually dropped went viral on the internet. It's interesting to see how a very slow event can spread news so quickly.",

        "transcript": "So, we think we know how to motivate people, right? Offer them a reward. Do this and you'll get this. Do this faster, earn more money. Do this better than everyone else, here's a promotion. We offer incentives when we want people to do things. We do it at work, at school, even at home with our kids. Tidy your room and you can watch TV.\n\nBut when social psychologists test whether incentives work, they get surprising results. Sam Glucksberg, from Princeton University, America, set people a problem to solve and told them he was going to time them to see how long they took. Then he put them in two groups. He offered one group a reward for finishing fast. Five dollars for anyone finishing in the top 25 per cent and 20 dollars for the person who finished the fastest of all. To the other group he offered no incentive, but he told them he was going to use their times to calculate an average time.\n\nThe first group, the ones with the reward, solved the problem faster, you'd think, right? Well, no, they actually took three and a half minutes longer than the group who just thought they were being timed. Incentive didn't work. In fact, it made them slower. This experiment has been repeated, with the same results, many times. But in business we still offer bonuses, promotions and rewards to staff.\n\nThat's fine if we want them to do something simple, like chop wood. We'll pay you more if you chop the wood faster. An incentive works then. But if we want someone to do something complex, something creative, something where they have to think, rewards don't work. They might even have the opposite result, and make people perform worse. Another study, by Dan Ariely, showed that the bigger the reward, the worse the subjects performed on a complex task. The reward made them focus so hard on the result that they couldn't think creatively any more.\n\nAnd this all matters because more and more simple jobs will become automated. We'll be left with creative, problem-solving jobs that computers will never do. And we need to find a way to motivate people to do those jobs when we've proved the traditional incentives don't work.\n\nSo what does work? Giving your workers freedom; freedom to work on the things they want to work on, freedom to choose when, where and how they work. Want to work from home three days a week, get up late and work into the night instead? Fine. Just do the job well. And evidence shows people who choose the way they work get results. Companies that give employees time during the week to work on things that interest them and are not part of their regular job achieve amazing things. Some of the big tech companies are good examples of this, with ping-pong tables and areas to relax in …",

        "transcript": "The first item in the news today is the recent elections that took place across the country. This was a crucial vote, which may see a dramatic change in how the country develops over the coming years. Overall, a 54.5 per cent voter turnout was registered. This represents an increase of 11 per cent over the previous election and six per cent above the average for the past 50 years. There has also been a slight change in demographics, with an increase in youth turnout in the 18- to 24- and 24- to 29-year-old brackets. Despite this increase, young people are still less likely to vote than older people; 84 per cent of voters in the 70 plus age group came to the polling stations.\n\nMoving on, the global digital powerhouse ONK today posted quarterly results which were above forecast. Back in March, Tim Bolling, CEO, issued a profit warning over fears that there would be losses following the recall of their leading product, the 40d device. In fact, the company posted quarterly revenue of US$14.8 billion which represents an increase of 11 per cent from the same quarter a year ago. They also announced that they had sold 21 million 40d devices over the quarter. The company has provided the information that with this level of revenue, there will be a gross margin of 34 to 35 per cent, ultimately leading to a US$1.20 per share cash dividend awarded to shareholders.\n\nAnd in our final news item we ask, will we soon be saying goodbye to coins and notes forever? The nationwide trend of using cashless payment options is increasing. There are a number of reasons for this development. A key reason for this is a growing interest in reducing the number of items people need to leave their homes with. As almost everyone carries a smartphone with them, and many people also have smartwatches, the ability to pay for things using one of these two technologies is particularly appealing. More and more retailers are accepting cashless payments and in some cases they've stopped accepting cash altogether.",

I need a study group, in a big way.\n\nBea: Me too.\n\nAli: Do you think we have enough people here for a study group? I mean, there are only four of us …\n\nBea: Sorry. Three of us. Chris can't do study group. Right, Chris?\n\nChris: Yeah, there's no way I can do a study group. I have an assignment and then I'm too busy. But I'll stay for this first meeting.\n\nAli: Should we try and get another group together with us for this?\n\nBea: No, I don't think so. I think three is fine. Ideal size, really.\n\nDina: Me too.\n\nAli: OK, three people then. Four people for the first meeting. What next?\n\nBea: What about a meeting place? We can't meet here in the library …\n\nAli: It's not too bad, especially if those other people would go away.\n\nBea: But we can't exactly ask them to leave, and people might get annoyed with us talking.\n\nDina: Can I say something here?\n\nAli: Sure, go ahead.\n\nDina: There's a study hall next to the cafeteria. It's almost always empty. Could we meet there?\n\nAli: A study hall?! Who knew? Well, it sounds good to me.\n\nBea: Yeah. I've never been there but …\n\nAli: So, we ought to decide how long for and how often.\n\nDina: I read somewhere that you should make the meeting at the same time each week. Like a seminar. That way we'd take it more seriously.\n\nBea: We may as well make it for this time since we're all here. Is this time OK?\n\nDina: Works for me.\n\nAli: Me too.\n\nChris: Hang on just a minute. I know I'm not going to be in this group, but aren't we supposed to have a seminar at this time every other week?\n\nDina: Umm, no.\n\nBea: Thursday, no? \n\nAli: No, that's on Thursday. \n\nChris: Sorry. Forget I said anything.\n\nAli: Don't worry about it.\n\nBea: So everyone agrees that this time is fine? Every week?\n\nAli: How long should we make it?\n\nBea: An hour?\n\nDina: Could we find a way of making it two hours?\n\nAli: Two hours seems a bit like … too much. To start with then?\n\nBea: Ninety minutes? Compromise?\n\nAli: Is that OK with you, Dina?\n\nDina: Fine by me.\n\nAli: OK, so I guess all we have left to decide is exactly what we'll do when we meet. The final exam is a way off. I guess we could review our notes, or practise learning things by heart.\n\nDina: I have a list of dos and don'ts actually that I got online. I could be a moderator, and we could use the ideas as a starting point …",

        "transcript": "Obviously, this is the sequel to Fun in the City, which is a film I didn't like so it's fair to say my expectations were low. So, you could say I wasn't disappointed, as it met my expectations. It was awful! It was so awful, I'd rather not spend any more time on it by talking about it. But, that wouldn't be a film review and I think I owe you all a review to save you wasting your money going to see it.\n\nSo, it starts off with this big wedding scene. And, I won't go into why, but the whole scene is just there so they can make this one joke. It's not even a funny joke ... it's just, ah, it's just terrible. It's got nothing to do with the rest of the film. Anyway, it starts there. Then, instead of the characters and the plot staying in New York where the original film was set, one of them wins a ticket to India and decides to take all her friends. It's what directors do when they've run out of ideas … let's take our characters on tour!\n\nAnyway, they gossip, cry and shop, and they repeat this until the end. No real people would ever act like this. I didn't have any sympathy for their problems or even care what happened to them. Don't go and see it, you'll only encourage them to make another sequel. The world doesn't need three of these films. Please save your money and go and see the other big film this week: Twilight Mirror.\n\nSo, if you're a fan of the book it's based on, you're probably as excited as I was about this. For everyone else, this is a film fans have been waiting ten years to see. I have to confess, I was a bit nervous. I'd seen the posters and they didn't look right. I didn't love them at all. And I wasn't sure about the actors they cast either. So I went in not sure what to expect. But … I loved it.\n\nOne thing I really liked about it was the pace. They went backwards and forwards between the real world and the computer world and it worked really well. The special effects brought the computer world to life and I totally believed in it. But, more than that, I felt emotionally connected to the story and the characters. The whole film worked on so many levels. It reminded me of going to the cinema as a child – how much fun that was. I can't recommend it enough.",

You? \n\nClara: Great, as long as I don't think too hard about all the essays I have to write this term!\n\nBen: Yeah … \n\nClara: Hey, are you OK?\n\nBen: I have to admit, I'm struggling a bit. Maybe even a lot. I've not been sleeping well at all and then I can't concentrate. And all these things are just going around and around in my head.\n\nClara: Mmm … that doesn't sound good. So, you're sleeping badly and you can't concentrate. Is that all it is, do you think?\n\nBen: Well, if I'm honest, it's more than that. I'm starting to dread going outside. I find myself worrying about stupid things like what if I forget the way home. Or, what if I go to class thinking it's Monday but actually it's Friday and I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time. It sounds even more stupid when I say it out loud. It took me two hours to leave the house today.\n\nClara: It doesn't sound stupid at all. It actually sounds a lot like me last year.\n\nBen: Really? But you're so together!\n\nClara: I've learned to be, but even I still have bad days. I used to have panic attacks and everything. When you were trying to leave the house today, how did you feel?\n\nBen: Like I couldn't breathe. And my heart was going way too fast.\n\nClara: Hmm … that sounds like a panic attack to me.\n\nBen: I thought I was going to die.\n\nClara: You'd be surprised how common they are. Loads of people have them, they just don't talk about it.\n\nBen: How did you get over them?\n\nClara: I actually talked to a doctor about it, and you should too. But I learned some practical things as well. Though they're easier said than done, and they're going to sound weird, so hear me out, OK?\n\nBen: OK …\n\nClara: So, one thing I did was to try to reduce the power of the anxiety and the panic attacks when they came. So – and this may sound strange – at a time when you're feeling safe and OK, you literally do things that make your heart start racing faster and your breathing speed up. Like spinning around on a chair until you're dizzy or hyperventilating so you're short of breath.\n\nBen: That sounds awful!\n\nClara: It is, but it means you get used to the symptoms, so they feel less scary. \n\nBen: Right. \n\nClara: Then you have to deliberately do the things that usually make you feel panic. So, if it's going to class on Monday and being scared you've got the wrong day, on Monday you go to class. If you let the anxiety control you by making you stay at home, it just makes it worse the next time you really do have to go out.\n\nBen: And what did you do if a panic attack came anyway?\n\nClara: I had a distraction plan. So, I walked everywhere instead of taking the bus because the exercise helped, but also I did things like count trees or red cars or something. Whatever it was didn't matter, as long as I had something else to focus on.\n\nBen: I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I thought …",

I've been meaning to come in and find some information about here for some time. I was wondering if you could help me?\n\nReceptionist: Sure, of course. What would you like to know?\n\nCustomer: I saw on the sign outside that you have the best budget membership in the city. Is that right?\n\nReceptionist: You've got that right, yes. If you find a better rate, then we'll match it. Also, we don't have any sign-up fees or cancellation fees.\n\nCustomer: Sorry, what was that last bit?\n\nReceptionist: Cancellation fees. Some gyms charge you money if you leave before a minimum number of months or something like that. We don't do that.\n\nCustomer: That's useful to know. Ummm, what times do you have?\n\nReceptionist: We open at 5 a.m. and close at midnight.\n\nCustomer: Not 24 hours then, I see.\n\nReceptionist: No. Almost, though! We tried doing the 24-hour thing, but there really weren't a lot of people who wanted to do exercise at 2 in the morning.\n\nCustomer: Makes sense. Another question: do you have trainers? Like, will you do a personalised evaluation of me?\n\nReceptionist: Sure we do. As we say on our brochure, we can show you what to do, how to do it and why you're doing it. Have you worked with a personal trainer before?\n\nCustomer: Err, no. No, I haven't. No.\n\nReceptionist: So, it's very easy. For your first visits we'll assign you one of our expert personal trainers. He or she will design an exercise plan that's just right for you and show you exactly what to do. We even include nutrition advice in the plan.\n\nCustomer: Let me get this straight. All of this is included in the price?\n\nReceptionist: Yes, it is. If you want to continue with your trainer after the first few classes, we can talk about that. It does cost extra though. OK?\n\nCustomer: Yeah. Sounds ... great.\n\nReceptionist: Do you have any other questions?\n\nCustomer: Hmmm, yeah. Um, OK. Why should I choose here instead of any of the other gyms in the city?\n\nReceptionist: What, you mean apart from our competitive rates and personalised attention?\n\nCustomer: Yeah, I guess.\n\nReceptionist: Listen, here's a free day pass. Why don't you drop by and see for yourself? That way you can talk to other members, see the facilities and our staff.\n\nCustomer: OK, I'll do that. Thanks very much!",

        "transcript": "Ayako: Hello, sales department. This is Ayako speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSam: Hi, Ayako, this is Sam from Events-4-U. I'm calling about the piano you want at your Christmas party next month.\n\nAyako: Oh, good. It would be a great surprise to have one there for our boss for the night. He can play and it would be a great addition for the party. Have you been able to source one?\n\nSam: Well, yes, I have, but …\n\nAyako: But what?\n\nSam: Well, we're going to either have an issue with the logistics or the budget, or possibly both.\n\nAyako: Oh dear.\n\nSam: Well, we've found a baby grand piano, as you requested, and it's available for the date you want.\n\nAyako: OK, great. So what's the issue? Is it too expensive?\n\nSam: No, it's within the budget you gave me, so everything there is OK. But it's too wide for the entrance doorway into the building.\n\nAyako: Oh, I see. So what are our options? Could we dismantle it outside and reassemble it inside?\n\nSam: Er, no. Unfortunately, you can't really do that with pianos. But don't worry, I'm sure we can find some inventive solution.\n\nAyako: Do you have any ideas?\n\nSam: Well, we could hoist it up to the first-floor balcony. The door there would be large enough to fit it through.\n\nAyako: Great. That sounds like a good plan.\n\nSam: That would work, though it would increase the cost considerably as we'd need a crane, an extension on the insurance policy and probably two to three additional people to manage getting it successfully into the building.\n\nAyako: Oh, I see. Well, we can definitely stretch the budget by about ten per cent, but we shouldn't go over that. If we exceed the budget by more than ten per cent, then other areas of the party budget will have to be cut. And we don't really want that.\n\nSam: OK, so this idea won't work then. Sorry if I wasn't being clear. The considerable budget increase I was referring to would add a further fifty per cent. You know, cranes are expensive.\n\nAyako: Oh … um … OK. So what other options do we have?\n\nSam: Well, how fixed are you on the piano being a baby grand? Would an upright piano be an option?\n\nAyako: Hmm. I don't know.\n\nSam: It would fit through the door on the ground floor and cause fewer problems. I've also got the option on a really nice white vintage upright piano, with black design work.\n\nAyako: OK. That sounds like it might work. Could you send me over some photos of it?\n\nSam: I'll do it now, together with the rental and delivery information and costs.\n\nAyako: Great. Thanks, Sam. Let me think about it and I'll call you back later today.\n\nSam: Sure, no problem. I'll wait for your call.",

        "transcript": "Will: Kiera, have you heard John isn't coming back and they might even fire him?\n\nKiera: No! I knew he was away but I thought it was for personal reasons?\n\nWill: I'm pretty sure that's not the full story. Have you ever worked with him?\n\nKiera: A long time ago, but … well, I've heard stories about him for years.\n\nWill: I've never worked with him directly but I know people that have and they say he was always shouting and screaming, threatening to fire people. And Susanne told me he took credit for one of her ideas. She had this idea for a project and she brought it up at the monthly creative workshop and he liked it – everybody did. But she saw the notes from the meeting and there was no mention of her name anywhere. John had agreed with her and repeated some of the things she said and the notes made it look like they were his ideas in the first place. He made her do all the work planning it, then when the project actually got started – it was that cars one – Susanne was moved to something else.\n\nKiera: It won an award, didn't it?\n\nWill: Yeah, but Susanne didn't get to share it – there was zero recognition of her contribution. She was furious but she couldn't do anything about it. Not if she wanted to keep her job.\n\nKiera: Yeah, it's almost impossible to report people who are as high up as John is, or was.\n\nWill: How did you find working with him, then?\n\nKiera: Well, you know what you said about him shouting at people? I've been in meetings with him and we all learned to keep our mouths shut. It was horrible. People were genuinely afraid of him.\n\nWill: Did you ever see him stealing people's ideas?\n\nKiera: It was never that obvious. He was a genius. He had incredible vision but, you know, there was a whole team of people working with him. Not every single idea came from him and after a while it's not easy to say, 'Oh, this idea was mine and this idea was yours.' For me, the bigger problem was that you could be in his good books and then suddenly, with no explanation, you were out. And if you were out, life got very difficult.\n\nWill: I heard women in particular had a hard time working with him.\n\nKiera: Yeah, well, like I said, you had to stay in his good books. So, if there was a comment that made you feel uncomfortable, you didn't say anything.\n\nWill: Did that happen to you?\n\nKiera: Not to me, no, but we all knew … and no one said anything. And I was lucky I didn't have that much contact with him myself.\n\nWill: They're doing a full investigation so I suppose a lot of these stories are going to come to light.\n\nKiera: I hope so. I really hope he's not coming back.",

So you're into history.\nTenn: Oh, yes!\nTodd: OK. What kind of history?\nTenn: That's a kind of a difficult question. I would say I'm interested-- primarily, I'm interested in ancient and medieval but I also like studying the history of the countries that I visit it makes it more interesting when I go sight-seeing.\nTodd: OK. What countries have you visited?\nTenn: I've been to 26 countries.\nTodd: Really?\nTenn: Yeah.\nTodd: Oh, OK. Yeah, you can't name them all.\nTenn: The big ones I would say, I've been over a good bit of Europe,  Mexico, Peru.. I spent almost a year in Egypt and I went to Isreal, Jordan and now I'm here in Japan. I've been here in Japan  a year and a half. And while I have been here, I visited Korea for about a week. \nTodd: OK. Wow! That's a lot so did you do the Pyramids in Egypt?\nTenn: Oh, yes. Actually, I climbed the pyramids.\nTodd: Oh, really? Nice. What's it like on the top?\nTenn: Very, very interesting. You can see-- it was during the summer so the visibility was rather low. \nTodd: Oh, OK.\nTenn: But, to see we were on The Great Pyramid and the second Pyramid Kefron was right nearby and it is a very different perspective to see it from. Very interesting to be eye-level, to be on the same level as the top of that second pyramid.\nTodd: OK. Wow! So you were in Peru, right?\nTenn: Yes.\nTodd: OK. What's the big thing people see in Peru?\nTenn: Machu Pichu.\nTodd: Machu Pichu. OK. What is Machu Pichu?\nTenn: Machu Pichu is the ruins of a city that was built by the Inca People.\nTodd: OK.\nTenn: Maybe over six hundred years ago and was lost, no one knew what happened to it until it was recently discovered about a hundred years ago. \nTodd: OK.

How are you? \nTodd: Doing pretty good. \nKevin: Good.\nTodd: Kevin we're gonna talk about nature. \nKevin: OK. \nTodd: First of all could you tell the listener where we are?\nKevin: Well, let's see. We are on, kind of on the side of a hill in the forest but we have a spectacular view of Mount Fuji on the other side of the valley. \nTodd: Yeah. It's really nice here. Why are you in this forest right now?\nKevin: Well, I'm currently working and I'm teaching an intensive English course up here at the campus.. up here in the forest.\nTodd: Oh, nice. Do you take any walks in the woods?\nKevin: Yes, I enjoy taking walks in the woods. And sometimes I even go for a jog in the woods, there's a few trails around here and there's a nice golf course as well that you can run around.\nTodd: OK, great! What's the best thing about being in nature? In the forest? \nKevin: Well, for me it's the stress relief that it provides especially living in Tokyo which is of course one of the world's largest and most chaotic cities. It's also nice to get back out into nature sometimes and just hear the insects which obviously we can hear very clearly right now, as well as some birds and you know it's just nice to get back out into nature. \nTodd: I agree. OK. Thanks a lot Kevin. \nKevin: You're welcome.",

But it's difficult, it's not easy-- It's not an easy thing to do. At first I did sort of thinking, anyone could do it almost if you put the time into it but now I think it's very difficult. You have to be creative and it's a lot harder than I think it seems. To pick up a finished product, a book. A physical book or to take a book from the library, I think it's-- you underestimate the work and the time that has gone into it. It's a long, lot of effort behind it.

One time when I was living in Wyoming, in one weekend we drove from Wyoming through Colorado, New Mexico and Mexico and back in the same weekend.\nTodd: Wow! Well, actually for people who are not familiar with the United States how far is that?\nTim: It's a long way. I don't know. It took.. I don't know, it took probably about 15 hours one way.\nTodd: Wow! \nTim: So, thirty hours all together. But it was fun. We drove down to Mexico \n                          had a good night a good meal, a little bit of drinks\n                          and drove back the next day. \nTodd: So you went to Tijuana? \nTim: No, we went to Ciudad Juarez. \nTodd: OK. Nice. \nTim: That was really fun and a lot of other trips we took when I lived in Oregon, when we'd go down to California and we'd surf.\nTodd: Oh, really?\nTim: Yeah!\nTodd: Oh, you're a surfer? \nTim: A little bit, a little bit of surfer.\nTodd: OK. What kind of car do you drive? What do you use for this road trip?\nTim: Well, typical American a four-wheel drive vehicle. Big vehicle, lots of gas but a lot of fun.\nTodd: Oh man, you're from Oregon you're supposed to be a tree-hugger!\nTim: I know. I know. But they're good. One rule we had on our road trips was any lake or big body of water we had to stop and swim in. It was a good thing to do. \nTodd: Well, you live in Japan now. Do you ever do road trips in Japan?\nTim: I took a road trip from Niigata up around Hokkaido and back, so it was a long road trip actually.\nTodd: OK. Wow! What's the difference between a road trip in Japan and a road trip in America?\nTim: Well, a road trip in Japan..it's a little bit more dificult to get around, it's a little bit more expensive. In America road tripping is sort of.. something a lot of people do.\nTodd: Yeah.\nTim: And in Japan, when we do that it is a little bit strange, a little bit different, not  very normal.\nTodd: Yeah, that's true.

Yeah.\nTodd: Oh, my gosh.\nKerys: So it was quite a strange environment to be in for somebody who didn't get pregnant and..\nTodd: Wow!

When I first started I did an introductory course which was just maybe like two days. \nAnd so they just sent you out with all of the equipment, put you in the sea and guided you, but then when I did the real course we started in the swimming pool which was fine and it was all great fun. \nAlthough, there were two men on my course who completely freaked out and had to leave. \nTodd: Oh..\nNicola: Yeah, so that was fine but then they took us out to sea which was a bit different. Yeah,  they made us set up our own equipment, I mean they still checked us and everything so we didn't die but we had to put on our own equipment. We had a diving buddy who I was with and I was with my friend Graham, who I was traveling with anyway and we went down into the sea. We went down maybe fifteen meters. And they always say like 'Don't Panic' just keep breathing normally and everything. But I did kind of panic a bit.\nTodd: Oh, no!\nNicola: So then I rose to the surface really quickly which you know, you're not supposed to do in diving. So I went up really quickly. Luckily we weren't deep enough to do any damage but my diving buddy Graham was having a great time down there looking at shipwrecks and didn't even notice that I was missing.\nTodd: What a terrible guy.\nNicola: Yeah, I know. so, then...\nTodd: Wow! Did they fail him? I hope he failed the course?\nNicola: No, he passed. He paid enough money. He passed. But it meant that I couldn't go diving for the rest of the day cause I had gone down quite deep so that was a shame, but..\nTodd: That's terrible. But you didn't hurt yourself, you didn't come up too fast?\nNicola: No, I was fine in the end but it was a shame because that was the end of my diving day. But we had a few more days to do it. \nTodd: So now you are comfortable diving. You don't freak out anymore?\nNicola: I don't freak out anymore but I couldn't go diving now on my own because it has been so long. Yeah.",

Yeah, this was about-- I'd say a year and a half ago and it was in Harare the capital, where my mom lives. \nI was on holiday back home seeing my mom and anyway it's a Sunday morning and I was in the shower. \nGot up pretty late, it must have been about half ten and all of a sudden my mom burst into the shower and she says,\" Leath, Leath, there's a snake, there's a snake in the kitchen.\" \nAnd so I thought, \"Ah, what kind of snake would this be?\" because we live in the capital, residential area almost high-rise. Well, not high rise but residential area. \nAnd so I put a towel around my waist and walked bad-temperedly throught to the kitchen. Attached to the kitchen we've got this little courtyard where we set out to have morning coffee and breakfast. It's tiled and leads onto a small garden. And so I walked out onto the courtyard and there was a seven foot Egyptian cobra. Wow! I was really, really blown away because I know a bit about snakes and I know that a bite from an Egyptian cobra in a country where antidote isn't readily available is almost certainly fatal. And there we were, my mom and I, with a seven foot Egyptian cobra slithering between the courtyard and our kitchen. And, eventually, we trapped it in the courtyard and I went to fetch guys who work for national parks. National parks are the guys who kind of look after animal problems\n                          within the city and brought them around. And we were hoping that they were going to catch it because Zimbabwe isn't so rich at the moment and stuff like that. They don't have the facilities to keep caught animals so unless it's endangered they just shoot it, so the guy shot our seven foot cobra. \nTodd: Oh, they shot it huh?\nLeath: Yeah, and we had to bury it out back. \nTodd: Really? Well, still I'm glad you just didn't want to be bitten or anything.\nLeath: No, no. No way.\nTodd: What a story. Thanks!",

I went to live with couple in their seventies whose children had moved away from home. \nThey started treating me like a second daughter. At first it was really fun because they'd encourage me to speak and they'd act everything out for me, including my landlord's experiences during the Second World War in Poland. \nWhere he'd stand up and perform but after awhile it got a bit wearing because when I was out the house he would go into my bedroom and start picking up my dirty underwear from the floor, all he used to leave on the bookshelf for me. \nHe would also go into the bathroom, take my underwear off the line and hang it outside so it would smell fresher. Sometimes he would cook for me which is great up to a point, because I got to taste some real Polish home cooked food.                But when he decided that I really was his long-lost daughter and started chopping my egg for me and then trying to feed it to me I began to feel that maybe it was starting to get time to move out. He would also invite me into the living room so that I could watch the Polish TV and improve my language and then spend half the television show prodding me and getting me to speak to him in very fast Polish. He was very kind to my friend Kathy when she came over to stay but unfortunately, he wanted me to translate his thoughts on the Polish economy from very fast Polish into English and the same time she was asking me to translate her ideas on English Cricket to Polish. None the less, it was an experience I would not have missed.",

Obviously, I grew up and my father was a baseball player so I was always around baseball.\nTodd: Wow.\nKevin: My whole life. \nTodd: You mean your father was a player in the Major Leagues?\nKevin: Yeah, exactly. Not only was he a player in the Major Leagues, he was fortunate enough to play in the World Series twice with the New York Mets. \nTodd: Wow! That's amazing. \nKevin: Yeah, The Amazing Met's. 1969. \nTodd: Wow, that's great. Did you play baseball yourself?\nKevin: Yeah, I played baseball pretty much my whole life up through college and university. \nTodd: OK. Why did you stop? \nKevin: Well, it wasn't exactly by choice. I wasn't drafted high enough in professional baseball to.. in order for me to sign, so I ended up retiring from baseball and pursuing other things.\nTodd: OK. Great. Do you like any others sports? \nKevin: Yeah. I actually, I enjoy all competition. You know I enjoy  the other typical American sports of basketball and American football and so on, but I also try to learn about and enjoy the national sport of the countries that I'm in. For example now I'm in Japan and I've actually gotten quite into Sumo wrestling. \nTodd: Oh, really?\nKevin: Yeah.\nTodd: Nice. Have you ever seen a sumo match live?\nKevin: Yes, I have. I've been to two sumo bashos as they call them, or matches in Tokyo.\nTodd: Nice. Yeah, I wanna go. I wanna go myself.\nKevin: Yeah, let's go sometime.\nTodd: OK. Let's do it.",

Generally, I like all types of music apart from country music. \nTodd: I'm the same way. I hate country except for Johny Cash.\nMatt: Yeah. The older country is good but the newer, I don't like the newer stuff.\nTodd: Yeah. How expensive are CDs in your country?\nMatt: Well, a brand new CD is probably between about 15 and 20 dollars. Yeah, but you can find used CDs from anything to a dollar to.. you know, 20 dollars I guess,  depending on the CD. So you can find cheap CDs. \nTodd: Wow, that's pretty cheap. Do you play a musical instrument?\nMatt: No, I don't. Although, when I was a kid I played the piano and a little bit of the guitar but I've long since forgotten all of that.\nTodd: Usually, you pick up the guitar and you don't \n                          stop playing it.\nMatt: There was no talent.\nTodd: Do you go to concerts?\nMatt: I go. I really enjoy going to concerts but I like to go to small venues. Small shows. I don't like those big stadium shows where you need binoculars just to see the stage. \nTodd: Yeah, I agree. And the last question, most importantly, do you sing in the shower?\nMatt: Of course I do. Yeah, every chance I get. \nTodd: Wow, what kind of songs do you sing?\nMatt: Oh, wow! I guess anything that's in my head, the last thing I heard I guess. \nTodd: Can you sing something right now? \nMatt: I don't think so. This isn't a shower.",

That's a long way.\nDevon: Yes, it was. It took three weeks. I did it as part of a tour with 10 other people. \nTodd: Man, that's a cool trip. That must of cost a lot of money. \nDevon: It did cost a lot of money but not a lot of people can say they have done that.  I looked in, I researched the trip several months before I actually took it. A friend and I did it together and there was one other American and the rest of the people were from Switzerland.\nTodd: OK. Cool! What was the landscape like?\nDevon: A lot of it was flat and for miles around you could see absolutely nothing and as you got into Siberia there was scattered trees. When we got into Mongolia you could see some Camels every once in awhile but besides that there was a whole lot of nothing.\nTodd: Wow! Just wild camels.\nDevon: Wild Camels around the drinking hole. Yes, saw that more than once. \nTodd: So how did you eat on this train?\nDevon: We stopped several times along the way and upon every platform you could buy food that local people were selling. A lot of it consisted of dried fish and other types of Russian delicacies and a lot of noodles that you heat it up with hot water. Every train had hot water on it on every carriage so you were always able to make noodles if you were desperate. \nTodd: So was this a luxurious train or was it a pretty basic...?\nDevon: It was pretty much the most basic you could get. There were no animals on board but sometimes they were coal-heated so it was very basic. \nTodd: Wow! Would you do it agian?\nDevon: Great question. Would I do it again? Yes, I would do it again but I would wait several years to do it. One because it does cost a lot of money and two because there are many other things to do, to see.\nTodd: OK. Thanks a lot Devon.\nDevon: You're very welcome.",

I was Cinderella and the guy who played the prince and I started to date. \nWe got pretty serious. He was trying to get rid of an ex who kept bothering him and so he decided to come to Japan to teach English. All during the summer we had plans you know, I would come and visit and that kind of stuff. \nWe were really excited about it and he was a model at the agency. At the same agency where I was an actor and... so we had the same agent. He went to Japan and was teaching and we were writing \n                          back and forth, \"looking forward to seeing you\" all that kind of stuff.\n I was having lunch with my agent one day and telling her that I had started taking Japanese and I had been planning out my trip. I was very excited about this whole thing and she says, \"JJ, I don't know how to tell you this.\"\n I'm thinking,\"Oh, my God! What?\" \nAnd she says, \"Yeah, Richard's ex-girlfriend flew out to Japan and they got married.\" \nJessica: Oh, my God! \nJJ: Married!\nJessica: Oh, no!\nJJ: Yeah! Yeah!\nJessica: How did you feel?\nJJ: Like I needed a ladder to get on a piece of paper. Really, I mean it was a devastating. You know that first broken-love kind of thing, but..\nJessica: Did you hear from him afterwards?\nJJ: Yeah, we were always just friends apparently. Yeah, so not only adding the \"insult to the indus..\". What I meant to say \"insult to injury\" was him just saying that we were always just friends.",

Great!\nTodd:  What is your favorite movie?\nJamie: My favorite movie is kind of a heavy movie. It's a called Sophie's Choice with Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline.\nTodd: OK.\nJamie: It's a movie, it's set in World War II. Meryl Streep plays a Polish woman who has come to America and she's met a man, Kevin Kline. Who has a series of problems of his own, mostly psychological which she is not 100 percent aware of and she does a bunch of scenes where she thinks of the past and the very difficult decision she had while during the war living in Poland. She had to decide between two children which one would be murdered by the Nazis and which one wouldn't. It's an ethical delimma that she faced at that time. She made and immediate decision on and it affected her the rest of her life. \nTodd: OK.\nJamie: It's a fantastic movie. Not the story in itself, of course the story was brilliant but the acting, the fact that she speaks Polish, she speaks German, she speaks English with a Polish accent which is amazing. A writer who is actually a narrator to the movie as well, his character is great. Kevin Kline's basically a psycho character. He is a little bit deranged in itself is pretty neat. All in all, the characters, the plot line, the movie it's fanatasic.\nTodd: OK. Great. Sophie's Choice.\nJamie: Sophie's Choice. I think it actually won an academy award in 1985 or '84.\nTodd: OK. Great. Thanks a lot.\nJamie: My pleasure",

Nice. \nKevin: In the United States.\nTodd: Wow, were you born in Phoenix?\nKevin: Actually, no. I was actually born in New York because my parents happened to be living in New York at that time . My father was a Major League baseball player and the year I was born, 1971, he was playing with the Mets in New York City. My birthday is in May, May 25th to be precise, and so my mother happened to be with my father in New York because it was baseball season. So I was actually born in New York but I grew up in Phoenix. Phoenix is what I consider to be my home town. \nTodd: Wow! That's amazing. Do you remember anything about New York?\nKevin: Yes. Actually, I do have a few memories because we spent probably three years there from the time I was born. Obviously, until I was about two and a half or three years, we spent the summers or the baseball season in New York. We rented a condominium on the second floor and I remember it was right across the street from La Guardia Airport. Of course, when I was a little kid, one and two years old, I used to love sitting by the kitchen windows.  I even remember it was a bay window, the kind where you can roll the window open. I used to roll the window open and just watch the airplanes take off and land all day. \nTodd: Wow! That's cool.\nKevin: Another memory I have is the people, the couple that lived below us was an elderly couple and they acted pretty much like our grandparents.  I actually called them Grandma and Grandpa. Grandma Stevenson used to give me a bath in her kitchen sink because I was so small.\nTodd: Wow!\nKevin: That she would actually give me a bath in her kitchen sink and I remember that as well.\nTodd: Wow, those are good memories.",

I was promised that I wasn't going to have to teach any beginners or any little children because it was my first job. I was promptly given the beginner infants. \nMy first day of teaching I was given a book which said, 'Ah! Go into the classroom and say \"Hello\" to the children and they'll all say \"Hello\" back to you and wave. I walked into a class of five four-year olds, followed by all their mothers and grandmothers and I said, \"Hello\" and they all burst into tears. \nI spent half the lesson trying to get them to say,\"Hello\" to each other and stop them from crying while all the grandmothers stood around and stared at me. I finally finished off my singing the whatever Happy Princess Song, all on my own, with crying infants to accompany me. It was one of the worst days of my life. I could identify with all the children though, because I wanted to sit on the floor and cry with them by the end of it. I think that that was when I realized that teaching kids was never going to be my vocation. I had some other classes as well but quick soon after that and moved onto adults who cry slightly less. Yeah, that was my first teaching experience. Not the best.",

What can you cook?\n\t                    Hisa: I can cook most of the Japanese dishes. And I also like baking.\n\t                    Todd: Oh, really. OK. Since you're Japanese can you tell us what things you cook in Japanese cuisine.\n                        Hisa: OK. I use a lot of vegetables in my cuisine, in cookery, and then I prepare lots of Japanese type of salad, which is sometimes we call it suno-mono.\n                        Todd: Suna-mono. OK\n                        Hisa: Yes, with vinegar w hich is especially good for spring? And the summer time, and then also pickles, is one type of thing and then I use vegetables, even cooked kind of salad I use, that is, we call it O-shi-tashi, green leaves, throughout the year, I use a different kind of green vegetables for salad.\n                        Todd: Can you talk about one kind of salad that you can make? (Yes) And how do you make it?\n                        Hisa: OK. For example, this is spring, I tell you one kind of salad, Udo.\n                        Todd: Udo.\n                        Hisa: That is a white stick, kind of vegetable. Just you peel them very thick because outside is quite bitter, so inside you slice up and then put them in the water with vinegar because that is how you can keep this white color. It lasts long, yes, and then, usually I put some wakame, sea vegetables, and then two ingredients I use, and then add some ginger, which I love very much. Chop up some ginger, and then those three things I mix with vinegar, a little bit soy sauce and then salt and then just sometimes you can even marinate if you like.\n                        Todd: Wow, sounds good.\n                        Hisa: Very light.\n                        Todd: And I can buy these ingredients at the Japanese supermarket?\n                        Hisa: Yes, green grocer's, and it is only for spring time. Udo! Sounds like Udon. Just you remove \"n\"\n                        Todd: Udo. Good luck.\n                        Hisa: Alright, I'll try and make it.",

There's many different people in Dublin, different types of people.\n\t\t\t             I do not think that Dublin has the mental stimuli, or does not have the hardcore atmosphere that somewhere like Tokyo could possibly have, so you have many types of people who are happy living in Dublin, going to the same places, the same bars, same restaurants, yet I feel that Tokyo has a lot more to offer because it's more hardcore. \n\t\t                There's so much stuff to do. Simple things like Karaoke, non-drink related activites that you can do over here which is great, so I wanted to get away from Ireland. See a differnt country, a different type of atmosphere, and have some fun as well at the same time and make some money.",

No!\n\t\t                Sandra: Not really!\n\t\t                Todd: Not really?\n\t                    Sandra: A wine connoisseur. No, that's sort of a snobby.\n\t                    Todd: Oh, really?\n                        Sandra: Yes.\n                        Todd: Oh, OK. So, how would you describe what you do?\n                        Sandra: A wine professional. \n                        Todd: A wine professional. OK, so what does a wine professional do?\n                        Sandra: Try to make money from wine.\n                        Todd: OK.\n                        Sandra: So, I'm a wine writer, a wine columnist. I teach wine.\n                        Todd: OK, so let's say if I'm going to have friends over, and I'm making let's say steak. I'm having a grilling steak. Can I serve wine with steak?\n                        Sandra: Yes. Steak goes with almost any red wine.\n                        Todd: Oh, really. OK. So, red. How about if I want to mix wines. Is it OK to go red wine, white wine?\n                        Sandra: You always start out with white wines going towards red wines.\n                        Todd: OK, always go white wine first, then the red wine. (Yes) OK, and how about for dessert. Is there a special dessert wine?\n                        Sandra: There are many great dessert wines, so it depends on what you like, how sweet you like and what you're making for dessert.\n                        Todd: OK, so how about I'm making terimisu.\n                        Sandra: Terimisu, then I would probably have a tawny port, either from Portugal or from Australia, which makes great ports, or you might even go for a fruity and oaky zinfandel, which is dry wine from California.\n                        Todd: OK, nice. How much will that cost me?\n                        Sandra: Depends on how much you want to spend. For a port, a tawny port, anywhere in between 3,500 to 10,000 (OK) And for a California Zinfandel, a good one probably about 3,000 (yen).\n                        Todd: 3,000. I think I can maybe afford that. Not much. And, how about what would be a good wine to start off for like appetizers or with a salad or something like that.\n                        Sandra: I always start off with a sparkling wine.\n                        Todd: A sparkling wine.\n                        Sandra: Yes. I prefer champagne but if you can't afford it, even though champagne is the lowest price anywhere in the world is in Japan\n                        Todd: Oh, really.\n                        Sandra: And many of my students load up on cases of champagne and have it sent home by their companies container.\n                        Todd: Oh, wow.\n                        Sandra: Yes.

So, I think in Fall we have lots of kind of festivals, but it depends on the places.\n\t\t                Todd: What are some things that most festivals have, like, what can you see if you go to a Japanese festival?\n\t                    Yoko: Omikoshi.\n\t                    Todd: Omikoshi. \n                        Yoko: Yes.

What is Omikoshi?\n                        Yoko: Ah, it's really difficult for me to explain in English, but Omokishi looks like a bigbox, lots of people, adult people try to carry together, and they usually go to temples, and they kind of celebrate a harvest or our happiness or those kind of things\n                        Todd: OK. Do you ever carry the Omikoshi?\n                        Yoko: Ah, you know, I'm not a strong guy so, I've never tried it.\n                        Todd: OK. What about foods? What kind of foods do people like to eat?\n                        Yoko: We can see lots of small shops along the street and we can buy really Japanese food, like watagashi, it's a really sweet candy but it looks like, how do you say that?\n                        Todd: I don't know.\n                        Yoko: I don't know.

It's really popular food in matsuri, and we can see okonomiyaki. Yeah, it's, somepeople say Japanese pancake, or something, but tastes different.\n                        Yoko: It's not sweet.\n                        Todd: It's not sweet.\n                        Yoko: It's not sweet.

So a modest person doesn't say he rips or he is good\n                        Roe: You got the point, no I was just kidding, I can't rip.\n                        Todd: OK, who is the best surfer in the world?\n                        Roe: Robbie Naish.\n                        Todd: Robbie Naish. What country does he come from?\n                        Roe: Hawaii. \nTodd:  Oh, so he's hawaiian. He's American. \n                        Roe: Yeah, fom Ohahu!\n                        Todd: From Ohahu, so he surfs on waves. -- How big are the waves that Robbie Naish surfs on? \n                        Roe: OK like Jaws, there is a specific point in Maui, Hawaii Maui, and it's called Jaws, cause people say that there are a lot of sharks at the point, but anyway, at Jaws 25 meters or 30 meters in winter.\n                        Todd: Man, that's high. 25 to 30 meters. That's what? Three stories? Maybe! \n                        Roe: That's like from here to the basement.\n                        Todd: Wow! And were on the second floor so that's three stories.\n                        Roe: Oh, right, right, right, right.\n                        Todd: Man, that's high. That's really high. What's the highest wave you've ever surfed on? So you're standing up here. The ceiling!\n                        Roe: Yeah! Probably the ceiling.\n                        Todd: So that's what, maybe 10 feet.\n                        Roe: I don't know the feet stuff.\n                        Todd: So that would be, 3, 4 meters.\n                        Roe: Yeah, 3, 4 meters probably. \n                        Todd: Wow, that's still pretty high.\n                        Roe: Yeah, if you are in the ocean you are like lying down right, so it's quite high actually, yeah, if you're standing up it doesn't seem that high but.\n                        Todd: But, when you're on the ground, you're right, when you're lying flat on your stomach, you're right it would seem very high. So Robbie Naish, does he make a lot of money surfing?\n                        Roe: Yep.\n                        Todd: He's a rich man.\n                        Roe: He's a billionaire.\n                        Todd: Wow, has he ever come to Japan?\n                        Roe: Many times.\n                        Todd: Really!\n                        Roe: Yep.\n                        Todd: Wow.\n                        Roe: For promotion.\n                        Todd: For promotion.\n                        Roe: He owns a boarding, sailing, and what have you. He owns a lot of companies. Yeah, he's smart too. Nice guy.\n                        Todd: Nice guy and he's a nice guy because he rips.",

At school I was\n                                always in the top classes getting A's and he was\n                                always failing in the bottom classes, but\n                                he was really sporty and I wasn't so people said\n                                we were very different.",

Now in England you\n                                have something called \"Boxing day\". \nNicola: Yes, we do. \nTodd: So, we don't have that in\n                                America. What is Boxing day? \nNicola: Well, boxing day is\n                                always on the 26th of December, the day after Christmas day. And it was originally called boxing\n                                day because it was the day in England when the\n                                very rich people in Victorian times gave\n                                presents to their servants, the day after\n                                Christmas. And usually it would be something like\n                                money, or food but they would give it to them in a\n                                small box, and so on December the 26th, servants would receive their boxes,the Christmas boxes, and\n                                that's why it was called Boxing day. \nTodd: OK \nNicola: Today, people don't\n                                really receive money or food so much, sometimes\n                                you give extra tips at Christmas, but\n                                Boxing day has stuck. So that's the name. \nTodd: What do people do on\n                                Boxing day? \nNicola: Nothing really. Uh, eat\n                                the leftover turkey, turkey sandwiches, watch TV,\n                                and in my family we usually go and watch dog\n                                racing, grey hound racing. \n\nTodd:Oh, really?\n\nNicola:Yeah, and lose some money...\nTodd: Lose money! \nNicola: Yeah always. At least I\n                                do. \nTodd: Wow, cool. Dog track. Is\n                                there a dog track near your house? \nNicola: Yeah, there is, where I\n                                live, yeah. \nTodd:Oh,\n                                \n                                cool!

Then you got the middle of the range, things like the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, and then you got the British tabloids, which were quite famous for, and the tabloids are quite interesting. Basically, the tabloids are just gossip, and they will report anything and everything in great detail. Um, a lot of people kind of disapprove of the tabloids but personally I find them quite interesting and entertaining. In our house, we have a tabloid newspaper, The Daily Mirror and we have the Daily Mail as well. And in the Mirror you'll get all the gossip, and things like horoscopes, and real celebrity news like recently you've had the David Beckham thing that he's been having an affair, and that was interesting. It went into real detail all the text messages that they sent and everything, uh, and it is kind of, it is just gossip, but then many people get the tabloids because it reports the sport in a lot of detail, so a lot of men get the, for the football scores and horse racing and everything.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Alexandra, you're going to be a lawyer. \nAlex: Yes, I am.\nTodd: Now laywers, unfortunately, often have a bad reputation. Why don't you talk about how lawyers are good for society: Why we need lawyers?\nAlex: Well, first we need lawyers because most of the time a lawyer will try to settle disputes between parties before it gets to a courtroom. Usually you have one side that has a problem and the other side is also aurgueing another point. So usually a lawyer will try to bring the two sides into their offices and to mediate a dispute before it gets to a courtroom. Another way a lawyer can help a society is usually lawyers can be very expensive, but there are programs out there that help people with less money, not necessarily to get free advice, but they can do it on a sliding scale, or a lawyer can do pro bono work which is free, and can help someone just, sometimes all they need is a letter written to resolve a problem or they just need somebody to go with them to court to explain what is going on, or just explain a lease or some other document for them that doesn't take much time and makes the client feel a lot better and a lot of times lawyers will take up the cause of children. If there is a custody dispute or some sort of bad thing that's happening to a child that needs a visit to a courtroom, the lawyer is there to be the lawyer for the child and no one else can influence the decisions that can be made for the child. It's almost like a protection and many other communitites or other sections of society that don't have a voice can get a voice through a lawyer.\nTodd: OK, great and what kind of lawyer are you going to be?\nAlex: An aviation lawyer.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Okay, Christian, you were just telling me that you lived in New Zealand as an exchange student. \nChristian: That's right, in high school. Yeah. \nTodd: What was that like? \nChristian: I mean, I was 17 years at the time and I was leaving home for the first time and going abroad for a year without going home. And it was the first time to actually move out of my family and it was an intimidating experience, but at the same time, it was extremely enjoyable. I had a great time, traveled around, met a lot of great people, got introduced to the Maori culture and yeah, it was fascinating, really fascinating. Yeah. \nTodd: What did you like the most about New Zealand? \nChristian: The country itself, probably the nature and the wildlife. It's just so pure, so green. You've got the big mountains. You've got the fjords, the rivers. It's a great ecosystem. You can tell that it's non-polluted and it's just really nice. And if you appreciate - call it nature - you can walk around and just soak up the atmosphere. It's really good. \nTodd: Yeah. What was the hardest thing about living so far from home? \nChristian: The fact that I could only communicate with my family through faxes in the beginning because calling was a bit expensive and the circumstances didn't allow me to use a phone where I was living. So I had to use faxes and that is a bit strange. \nTodd: Wow. So there was no email or internet? \nChristian: Well, actually at the time email wasn't that much used in New Zealand. There was one computer in my school that had internet connection and I was allowed to use that because I was an exchange student. I was the only exchange student at my school. So they said, \"Well, you can come in every now and then and use it.\" But I used it maybe once a week because I had never used email before, because this was back in '97. So it's like eight, seven, eight years ago. And I guess, well, in New Zealand they didn't really have that many connections. So yeah. \nTodd: Great story. \nChristian: It was truly great. Yeah.",

I've been giving blood since I was 18 and that's the legal age to be able to do it in Britain and I've done it about 10 times now and it's quite painless and it doesn't really take much of my time and I've taken along a few friends as well but mainly people just don't seem interested in doing it, but I think it's important.

You said you worked in Aviation.\n\t\t                  Alexandra: Yes, my previous job was write contracts for an aviation company and we bought and sold airplanes and aircraft engines, so we did a lot of marketing and leasing and speaking to people from different countries, and airlines wanting to buy \n\t\t\t                  equipment, so a lot of negotiations.\n\t\t                  Todd: Can you explain what leasing is?\n\t                      Alexandra: Leasing is when our company owns a piece of equipment, either an airplane or an engine and a customer has a need, for example, if their airplane has to do some maintenance, and they need a replacement, then we will let them use our airplane for a certain amount of months, like you rent a car, same thing, same idea.\n\t                      Todd: Oh, wow. And you lease not only the plane but engines as well?\n                          Alexandra: Sometimes you have an airplane that's delayed at the airport because of some reason and they need to swap an engine out, or whatever.\n                          Todd: Right before the plane takes off, they sometimes switch engines?\n                          Alexandra: They'll take the passengers off and put them on another plane cause it takes a lot longer than the 10 or 15 minute turnaround, but, you will have, it's more an emergency type of situation, so they'll take the engine off, and it might be and overnight deal so we go ahead and furnish a replacement engine until they can move that plane back to where it belongs or have the engine repaired. \n                          Todd: So can you lease a pilot?\n                          Todd: You can, yes, you can lease a crew. Yes! It's called a wet lease, and we used to do dry leases meaning we only provided the equipment but a wet lease includes a full crew that will fly the airplane, flight attendants, etc.",

I studied Spanish.\n\t\t                Todd: Wow, so what was it like being a student in Mexico?\n\t                    Adrienne: Ah, it was interesting. The weather was really hot the entire time I was there. Um, and it was very confusing, cause I didn't know the language very well when I first arrived but I learned quickly because I was living in the situation every day where I had to use language so that was really helpful in the end.\n\t                    Todd: So, what were the people like? What was the city like?\n                        Adrienne: The city was small. 1 million people, and that's pretty small. The architecture is very colonial style. It's interesting. Very beautiful, old, a lot of wood and stone and the food was great. Very spicy.\n                        Todd: Mexican food's the best.\n                        Adrienne: I think so too\n                        Todd: Yeah, and the people?\n                        Adrienne: The people are really friendly, really, really friendly. Big families and they're always inviting you over for dinner, lunch and breakfast, and tea and coffee and chocolate and it's really, it's really a very familial environment.\n                        Todd: What was your favorite place in Mexico?\n                        Adrienne: My favorite place, still, is a town called Cholula. It's a very small town. That has a pyramid, and Aztec pyramid with a cathedral on top of it and it has views of the mountains, the volcano and, um, just beautiful landscape all around. It's a great place to watch the sunset. \n                        Todd: What volcano?\n                        Adrienne: Po! They call it Popo, but the full name I think is Popocatepetl. It's an Aztec name.\n                        Todd: Oh, sounds like a nice place. \n                        Adrienne: It's beautiful.\n                        Todd: Any plans to go back to Mexico soon?\n                      Adrienne: Of course.

        "transcript": "Todd: So Norm, you said you have a pretty good story about going hiking and you almost got dehydrated.\n\t\t\t            Norm: Yes, it was, we were on our first day of, it was a six day hiking trip in a national park in Quebec, Canada, and I had not done the itinerary, but my friend had figured out that the first day we could walk 19 1/2 kilometers in the wilderness. \n\t\t\t            I mentioned that, I would have gone for 10 kilometers, do the first stop at the first campsite, but I didn't realize that he was more optimistic than I was, and so we started out on our first day and very heavy backpack, about 24 kilograms, and very hot day, 30, 32 degrees with hot humid day, and the first day was up and down, up and down, all the time, so at the end of the day, mistake number 1 was we passed sort of a small river and we didn't refill our bottles because we thought we were almost at our destination, the lake, but it was further than we thought so we ran out of water and darkness set upon us and we were up on a huge rock, and what had happened was, we were at the lookout and because we were tired, we were supposed to go left. We went right, so we backtracked, and I, after about five minutes, I mentioned to my other three colleagues I said, we've been here before, I said we're backtracking.                         \n\t\t\t            All three of then said, how can you tell, I said, I remember these particular trees. I said I noticed them all, and they \"There are thousands of trees here. You must be mistaken. I said well I'm sure. So they say \"No, no. no. It can't be. We're going in the right direction and so we back tracked, and by this time we never got to our camp ground and so we had to stop and we had no water. We hadn't had any water for about two hours, three hours, and so they were kinda, didn't know what to do, but I saw that there was a swamp at the bottom, and I said, \"there's water!\" Well!, so two of our colleagues stayed up with the tents and I went went down with a friend of mine and it took up an hour just to go down to the swamp, because it was not a path, just there we boulders and big rocks, and we had to go around many obstacles, and then by the time we got to the swamp, it was really dark, so I tied the bottle to a rope and I just threw it in the middle of the swamp to try and get as least dirt as possible and then use my shirt to filter it into a pot we had brought with us, to the swamp a pot and a heater, so that we could boil the water. We would ... we were very dehydrated, if we hadn't drank at that time, we wouldn't have been able to go back up, so I said we need to replenish our bodies with water, then we'll come back up.                         \n\t\t\t            So by this time is was pitch dark and my friend had this little hand flashlight that is, didn't last 45 minutes, but luckily I had my headlamp and I had just replaced my batteries and that can work 24 hours non stop so we used my single head lamp to go back up but it took up two hours to get back up so we had gone down about 8:30. We left the camp and it was close to midnight by the time we got up. Yeah, total darkness, and because we were on, just on, we could set up tent was a rock, that was like a round, rounded rock, and they set up their big tent, but I couldn't sleep in the tent, because it was just no room, so I just put my sleeping bag on the rock and just slept the whole evening. Luckily for me it didn't rain and and I managed to spend, had a fairly good night sleep.                         \n\t\t\t            So then the next day you just hiked back to your home? No the next day we had, I had brought some re-hydrating salts and that night when we came back with all the water I told everyone that we should put this in the water and then the next morning we felt much better, but then, this time we had light, proper light, sunlight and we looked at the topological map and then we figured out that where we had gone wrong. We were just barely forty minutes away from where we should have been before we made the wrong turn. We were actually very close, but when we backtracked that was our mistake, so 45 minutes later we were at the next lake where there were facilities for setting up our tents, and we were so exhausted that we spent the whole day sleeping before continuing on our trip.",

I had two contracts in Germany. The first one in the seventies, for three years. I was an immersion teacher, which means that they're English students at the elementary level who take all their courses in French, so with a particular second language approach I would teach them not only French, but I would teach them mathematics in French, science in French, visual arts in French, physical education in French \n\t\t                Todd: Wow, in Germany.\n\t                    Norman: In Germany, yes! This was for the Canadian Armed forces. The, usually it's the man the father, who's there as a soldier, but sometimes it's the woman. But they have, they do have children and there was a need for some Canadian schooling. They hire teachers to teach the children of military personnel. \n\t                    Todd: Wow! What a cool job! What did you think about Germany? \n                        Norman: Germany is very interesting in that it's a very lively country, I find. I enjoyed certainly the nature part. Every weekend, Susan and I tried to go on what they call volksmarch, which means, it's, \"volks\" means popular, popular walk. You have a choice of five kilometers, ten kilometers, or fifteen kilometers walk and at the end, once you complete the walk, you get a metal, and the walk is always in some nice\n\t\t\t\t                        village. You go up the hills, up the mountains, you have beautiful sights, and every now and then they have some kind of a food stand with a Bavarian band playing, and then you have those Bavarian sausages and it's just a whole lot of fun so we would take our children along with us and it would be quite an event. \n                        Todd: That's nice. How long did you live in Germany?\n                        Norman: I lived there five years total. 75 to 78,for a three year contract, and then 85 to 87, a two year contract. \n                        Todd: Wow, so you speak German as well. \n                        Norman: I do, I do, but now I have not spoken it for quite a long time so it would take a little bit of, let's say, review. \n                        Todd: Wow! tri-lingual. That's cool!",

Took a boat around Manhattan and went to a show on Broadway.\n\t\t                Marion: That must of have been exciting. \n\t                    Mauve: Oh, it was great. It was brilliant.

It was called, it was called \"Wonderful Town!\" I had never heard of it before but we just cued and got tickets during the day and whatever we could get we just went to see it. Yeah, but it was really, it was a comedy as well. It was really funny, and there was dance. It was very good.\n                        Marion: Mm, yeah, so would you go back to New York?\n                        Mauve: Yeah, I would, definitely. Um, it's funny though, like after I spent a week there, and after the week I feel I really know it very well, you know, we did a lot of walking, went to all the different districts, Chinatown, So-Ho, Grenich Village, and Central Park kind of, it's very easy to find your way around as well. \n                        Marion: All right. Yeah, that's good. With the grid system, which Dublin doesn't have. You know Dublin for a tourists it's probably harder to find their way around. It's not as sign posted or well signaled. Not as well laid out kind of thing.\n                        Marion: Yeah! Which of the kind of the areas did you prefer in New York. Did you have, like,one favorite?\n                        Mauve: Um, I really liked Chinatown. Chinatown was lovely. We went into lots of little small shops and it was lovely, like, you know, really quaint little places. We ate in a few, we ate in one place there as well. It was nice \n                        Marion: Yeah, real Chinese food.\n                        Mauve: Yeah, exactly and like all Chinese people walking around. It's funny. You walk around chinatown and you just see Chinese people and you walk into the Italian district, you know, Little Italy, and you just, people are speaking Italian. It's fun, you know, when you're in one city \n                        Marion: And the kind of change from one to the other, obvious as well. \n                        Mauve: Yeah, exactly, yeah! See you kind of forget you're in New York, almost. \n                        Marion: Cool. Thanks Mauve.",

I came in April. \n\t\t\t            Todd: Again, when did you come to Japan?\n\t\t                Sarah: Two months ago. \n\t\t                Todd: OK, and what do you think about Japan?\n\t                    Sarah: It's a very interesting country. I expected a very big culture shock when I first came here because I've never been to Asia. I've always taught in Europe and I've been to America but they were all places that weren't particularly different from England, like Japan, but I didn't have any culture shock and I don't know if it's just because I was in an environment with other English speaking people and I was in a company where it's very secure and safe so there was not need to have that kind of shock but I think the differences here are just unbelievable. It's very difficult to explain it to somebody who's never been to Japan before, so talking on the phone about being here, talking to someone back in England is very difficult to explain to them how different it is here.\n\t                    Todd: Yeah, what do you think about the food? \n                        Sarah: I like the food because I like fish so I was lucky, so the food, I've tried some different things, tried to be adventurous.\n                        Todd: And the people?\n                        Sarah: Ah, the people are nice, very nice, first quite difficult to, when teaching, very very different than teaching Europeans, particularly the Austrian people from my experience are very loud and forthcoming, and at first they were very, very quite, and we've seen quite a difference now that they've got to know us, and they've opened up quite a lot and it's easier, but generally I find the people very kind in the streets. When we meet people they're always very helpful, very kind.\n                        Todd: Yeah, I think Japanese people are, that's one of their best traits. Yeah, they're very, very sweet. OK, what do you think about the weather?\n                        Sarah: Yeah, very changeable. I was quite surprised. Most people think that in England the weather is very, very bad but here it's, the rain is just unbelievable. I've never seen rain like this before. It's just very, very changeable and it can be hot for a minute and then the next day it's quite cold.\n                        Todd: And now, it's very loud. You live by the train tracks. What do you think of the trains? \n                        Sarah: The service, or?\n                        Todd: Or just overall? Do you like the trains? Do you like living by the train? \n                        Sarah: I'm not, I don't think about living by the trains, but I think the trains are very, they're always on time, always very frequent, very good service but I have never seen so many people get on a train before.\n                        Todd: Yeah, they are very crowded.",

It was just starting in the eighties, it was like pioneering in the school. \n\t\t                Todd: Oh, OK, well was it pretty easy to do? \n\t                    Norman: Ah, it was kind of difficult because being in the gym, when the students would play basketball, the basketballs would bounce against the, it was just a wooden door, and the students wouldn't be able to hear me and it was kind of difficult as well to see the whole class as there was a wall that was separating my class, so I could see only half the class at a time. \n\t                    Todd: You could only see half the class and you were teaching computers!\n                        Norman: That's right! That's right, and so I would have two boards. One board at one end where I would teach the lesson to half the half the class, and then I'd walk over to the other end and do the same thing.\n                        Todd: Oh, man that must have been a nightmare!\n                        Norman: It was. It was, because I could never see what the other half was doing in my absence.\n                        Todd: So did they ever doing anything bad to get in trouble!\n                        Norman: Oh, yes, they were, they were. I can remember one instance when one student calls me over and he said, \"Mr. Groussier, I have water in my external drive. At the time you used floppy disks and put them in the external drive. I said, \"Water, oh no. There's no water!\" So, I went over and I tried to insert the floppy disk, and it just wouldn't, there seemed to be something blocking the floppy disk from going in so I peak in and sure enough I see that it's stuffed with watermelon. So, hence, that external disk drive was useless from then on. \n                        Todd: Wow, so how many years did you teach computers. \n                        Norman: Well, in that particular lab only one year and after that we moved to a full-fledged lab and I taught computer to my own class which meant once a week, a formal computer teaching and then we would go to the lab for other reasons like doing some research projects.\n                        Todd: Oh, Wow. Did you like it, teaching computers?\n                        Norman: In the computer lab, yes, because it was really well equipped with apple computers and printers and we had so many programs that students could use and do some really nice projects or nice cover pages, we had color printers and very efficient printers as well, so it was wonderful.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Lois have you ever been to a professional football match in England? \n\t\t\t            Lois: Yes, I have. I support a team called Leicester city, and when I used to be at university I used to live in Leicester. I used to go to quite a few of their matches. \n\t\t\t            Todd: OK, so what's it like when you go to a professional game?\n\t\t                Lois: So first of all, the fans are all separated, because in England there's sometimes violence at football, so they like to keep the fans away from each other, and there's always a lot of police there, but I've never been at a match where there's been any trouble, so that's been OK. Um, the atmosphere is normally amazing because the smallest grounds hold about 20,000 people, so you get quite a good crowd, and because their stadiums are quite small, you're quite close to the pitch, so my team weren't very good though, so often my team would lose, so it wasn't so good, but when they one it was fantastic. Really, really good atmosphere and lots of fun. \n\t\t                Todd: That's cool. So how much does it cost to get it?\n\t                    Lois: See again, it's quite expensive so maybe now for the lower teams it probably, cheapest ticket is 25 pounds, but for example if you wanted to go and see Manchester United play, play then maybe 50 pounds or more, but it's really really difficult to get tickets for Manchester United because everybody has a season ticket, so if you want to go and watch them you have to know somebody who can get you a ticket. It's difficult to just buy a ticket for those games. \n\t                    Todd: Do you like Manchester United?\n                        Lois: I think there a good team. I think that the reason a lot of people don't like them is because they used to win all the time, so now they don't win so much, because now Arsenal win most of the time. So I think they're a good team, but I don't think you can like them if you're not from Manchester. \n                        Todd: So Leicester is a very hard word to spell. I take it it's not L-E-S-T-E-R, no?\n                        Lois: No. If you were an American you would probably pronounce it Lie-Se-Ster, so it's spelled L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R.\n                        Todd: Well, again! One more time!\n                        Lois: L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R\n                        Todd: Wow, that's quite a handful. Alright, thanks, Lois.",

It's because, well we buy it in the supermarket and bring it home cause it's cheaper than eating in a restaurant. \n\t                    Todd: Yeah, it is a lot cheaper.\n                        Yeah\nTodd: OK, what sushi do you eat?\n                        Jessica: Well, we always buy the box, which has a little bit of everything. And I'm never quite sure what any of it is. I know there's a piece of salmon in there. Some octopus, or squid. Um, and then from that point on I'm not quite sure what anything else is, but it's all delicious, so I eat it all, and then we also have rolls, so we buy just different rolls.

It's, the ball's about the size of an American football, but the game, in American football you pass forward, but in rugby you pass backwards. Games are a bit shorter. Their 80 minutes long. Less stopages than American football, but like soccer it's continuous play, how-should-I-say, it's a physically demanding sport, probably the one of the most physically demanding sports in the world.\n\t                    Todd: OK, so you say it's physically demanding. How is it physically demanding?\n                        Shawn: You have to be extremely strong, but at the same time, you have to have, wha-chu-call, an extreme line on stamina to play this sport. Without stamina, you can not continue in this sport.\n                        Todd: OK, just some people may not know, what is stamina?\n                        Shawn: You have to be able to run for 80 minutes in the game. Besides the game rugby has a bit of it's own culture. A bit of a cult in the world. It's a very small following but people do follow it, follow it very devoutly, very seriously, and it, how-should-I-say, I can honsestly say rugby has been a big part in changing me into the person that I am presently.\n                        Todd: Uh-huh. How so?\n                      Shawn: Sort of, how I can develop my leadership skills, my social skills, and how to work as a team player, in such a, how-should-I-say, in that time when you do play rugby, it's so aggressive, and it teaches you how to be a leader in tight situations, and it shows how you can truly push yourself to the limit, and not go, how-should-I-say, not go over the limit.",

Could you explain to me how the Canadian political system works?\n\t\t\t            Steve: Sure. Basically in Canada there are 10 provences and three territories. We call the three territories, territories because they have less than 50,000 people living in them. They're really far north, where it is cold and obviously not so comfortable to live. \n\t\t\t            The other ten provences are British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Foundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Each Provence has their provincial government but as far as federal government the capital is in Ottawa, and there's actually an election coming up, probably sometime this year. Each province is given seats in the federal cabinet and seats are given based on population so Ontario and Quebec which have the largest populations have the most seats in Federal Parliament and so wherever you live you basically vote for the politician who is running in your particular geographical area, and the political party which wins the most seats forms the government that rules the country.\n\t\t                Todd: OK, and the leader of the country comes from that party?\n\t\t                Steve: Yeah, the leader of the country is elected within the party. They elect the leader (OK) So each party, when they want a leader, they have a leadership convention, and they elect a leader to lead that party, but the leader of the party must also run in their own constituency or riding, so if they don't win they can't be the Prime Minister, so, yeah, the main political parties, right now the government is Liberal Government. Other prominent parties are the New Democratic Party, sometimes called the NDP, and the New Conservative Party. Also a powerful party is Bloc Quebecois, which has most of its seats obviously in Quebec, so there are four main political parties.",

No, 1-all because at the last minute England scored to make it 2-1, but that goal was disallowed so then it went to extra time and then I think Portugal scored first, then England scored again to make it 2-all and then it went to penalties, and David Beckham missed, uh a terrible terrible goal, missed a penalty, and then I think Portugal missed one and then England missed again and then Portugal's goalkeeper scored and then it was all over. \n\t                    Todd: Ah, well, maybe next time. \n                        Lois: Maybe, maybe World Cup in Germany in 2006.\n                        Todd: So who do you think is going to win it all?\n                        Lois: So in the first match, it was Portugal against Greece and Greece won 2-1, so although Greece are the underdogs, I think maybe they can win, but it is in Portugal, so maybe Portugal will win with the home crowd.\n                        Todd: Are you going to watch it?\n                        Lois: I would love to watch it, but in Japan it's on at 3:45 in the morning, and so I don't think I'm going to miss my sleep to watch it.",

Are you going to watch the Olympics on TV?\n\t\t\t            Travis: I will probably get suckered into watching the olympics I'm sure. It will be on every channel. It will only be on one channel but it will be on the whole day I'm sure. \n\t\t\t            Todd: Yeah, they kind of go overboard. It's on too much. \n\t\t                Travis: Well, I think it was the last winter Olympics, where, I don't know which channel in the Unites States was covering it but whatever channel was covering it most of the olympics was just people's background and personal stories and profiles and a lot of America got really fed up with it, and I don't know if you were still here in Japan or if you were in the Unites States at the time of the last olympics, but \n\t\t\t\t                people didn't watch he last olympics in the states. They just tuned out completely. The reason that they tuned out is because the coverage was so poor. The station that was covering it was basically just doing profile after profile of athletes, about how they had to overcome hardship, how they had to eat one meal every two weeks , and you know run five hundred miles back and forth, you know, some school in Russia and those sort of profiles, stories drown out the actual events, and it was covered very poorly, but maybe this year will be different, maybe there will be a backlash against that sort of poor coverage, and we'll get to see more of the actual olympics this time. This is the summer olympics right. (Yeah, exactly) It shows how little I know about the olympics. I'm not sure if it's the winter of the summer. \n\t\t                Todd: Well, of the Olympics, what's your favorite event? \n\t                    Travis: Running. \n\t                    Todd: Running\n                        Travis: Just straight running. It seems like a very pure athletic event. There's no guess work in it. There's not five judge panel trying to decide who won, and then the Canadian judge and the France judge get in a fight and they have to decide. Nothing like that happens. It's just run, clock, stop and whoever got through the finish line the fastest wins. It seems very pure athleticism, so I like running: 100 meter dash,\n\t\t\t\t                        200 meter dash, all of that, and long runs too. I used to run when I was in high school so that helps a little bit. Not short distances. I used to run cross country, three and five miles. \n                        Todd: Ooh, that's a long ways. Are you still a runner?\n                        Travis: Well I went running tonight but I don't consider myself to be much of a runner. No, I only say that some day I am going to train and run a marathon but I have yet to train and run a marathon. Maybe someday. Yeah, I did it when I was in Bangkok and it about killed me. Yeah, running in Bangkok, running a marathon in Bangkok was not the smartest thing. It was terrible because they had, they have pollution right, Bangkok's a great city but they have a lot of pollution right. They have to have marathon at 4 o'clock in the morning before the cars start running, and then when you're running the marathon some of the policeman that are officiating have to wear like masks because of the pollution in the air, so when you're running a marathon through that it's not that fun. But anyway, you should do it. You should run a marathon. \n\t\t\t\t                            I think maybe I will but perhaps after I finish school this year.",

I did at the elementary school back in Canada. \n\t\t\t            Todd: And what was that like? Like how did you actually teach computers.\n\t\t                Norman: Actually, I initiated a computer project. We were placed behind the gym, in the storage area. At the time we didn't have the state of the art computer labs. It was just starting in the eighties, it was like pioneering in the school. \n\t\t                Todd: Oh, OK, well was it pretty easy to do? \n\t                    Norman: Ah, it was kind of difficult because being in the gym, when the students would play basketball, the basketballs would bounce against the, it was just a wooden door, and the students wouldn't be able to hear me and it was kind of difficult as well to see the whole class as there was a wall that was separating my class, so I could see only half the class at a time. \n\t                    Todd: You could only see half the class and you were teaching computers!\n                        Norman: That's right! That's right, and so I would have two boards. One board at one end where I would teach the lesson to half the half the class, and then I'd walk over to the other end and do the same thing.\n                        Todd: Oh, man that must have been a nightmare!\n                        Norman: It was. It was, because I could never see what the other half was doing in my absence.\n                        Todd: So did they ever doing anything bad to get in trouble!\n                        Norman: Oh, yes, they were, they were. I can remember one instance when one student calls me over and he said, \"Mr. Groussier, I have water in my external drive. At the time you used floppy disks and put them in the external drive. I said, \"Water, oh no. There's no water!\" So, I went over and I tried to insert the floppy disk, and it just wouldn't, there seemed to be something blocking the floppy disk from going in so I peak in and sure enough I see that it's stuffed with watermelon. So, hence, that external disk drive was useless from then on. \n                        Todd: Wow, so how many years did you teach computers. \n                        Norman: Well, in that particular lab only one year and after that we moved to a full-fledged lab and I taught computer to my own class which meant once a week, a formal computer teaching and then we would go to the lab for other reasons like doing some research projects.\n                        Todd: Oh, Wow. Did you like it, teaching computers?\n                        Norman: In the computer lab, yes, because it was really well equipped with apple computers and printers and we had so many programs that students could use and do some really nice projects or nice cover pages, we had color printers and very efficient printers as well, so it was wonderful.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Lois have you ever been to a professional football match in England? \n\t\t\t            Lois: Yes, I have. I support a team called Leicester city, and when I used to be at university I used to live in Leicester. I used to go to quite a few of their matches. \n\t\t\t            Todd: OK, so what's it like when you go to a professional game?\n\t\t                Lois: So first of all, the fans are all separated, because in England there's sometimes violence at football, so they like to keep the fans away from each other, and there's always a lot of police there, but I've never been at a match where there's been any trouble, so that's been OK. Um, the atmosphere is normally amazing because the smallest grounds hold about 20,000 people, so you get quite a good crowd, and because their stadiums are quite small, you're quite close to the pitch, so my team weren't very good though, so often my team would lose, so it wasn't so good, but when they one it was fantastic. Really, really good atmosphere and lots of fun. \n\t\t                Todd: That's cool. So how much does it cost to get it?\n\t                    Lois: See again, it's quite expensive so maybe now for the lower teams it probably, cheapest ticket is 25 pounds, but for example if you wanted to go and see Manchester United play, play then maybe 50 pounds or more, but it's really really difficult to get tickets for Manchester United because everybody has a season ticket, so if you want to go and watch them you have to know somebody who can get you a ticket. It's difficult to just buy a ticket for those games. \n\t                    Todd: Do you like Manchester United?\n                        Lois: I think there a good team. I think that the reason a lot of people don't like them is because they used to win all the time, so now they don't win so much, because now Arsenal win most of the time. So I think they're a good team, but I don't think you can like them if you're not from Manchester. \n                        Todd: So Leicester is a very hard word to spell. I take it it's not L-E-S-T-E-R, no?\n                        Lois: No. If you were an American you would probably pronounce it Lie-Se-Ster, so it's spelled L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R.\n                        Todd: Well, again! One more time!\n                        Lois: L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R\n                        Todd: Wow, that's quite a handful. Alright, thanks, Lois.",

And I'm never quite sure what any of it is. I know there's a piece of salmon in there. Some octopus, or squid. Um, and then from that point on I'm not quite sure what anything else is, but it's all delicious, so I eat it all, and then we also have rolls, so we buy just different rolls.

Here he is! This is Lucky's picture.\nTodd: Wow! That's big. So tell us about Lucky. How's lucky been the last two years?\nRichard: Lucky, the last two year! Yeah! Lucky is almost two years old. His birthday is November the 11th! One-One-One-One, so he'll be 2 years old. He's doing well. He's developed some unique, sort of characteristics, personality traits. One is that late at night he doesn't like walking just with me, it has to be with me and my wife together. So he has two big bodyguards. It's true. It's an unusual thing but he will not walk by the river where it's very dark with just one person. He needs two people to walk him. Which is unusual for a dog. He's a golden retriever so he's a big dog, but he's just, he needs two people and he gets very lonely, you know he likes to follow people around the house the whole time, you know he's a really, he's a very sort of sociable dog. \nTodd: What a lovely dog?\nRichard: Yes, lovely dog! \nTodd: I want to meet him!\nRichard: Yeah, well, anytime!\nTodd: So, I think you were saying something earlier about how he gets cold.\nRichard: Yeah, that's the other thing. One of the other unique things about Lucky is that I think he's a but spoiled. I mean, you know, a lot of dogs live outdoors but this dog lives indoors, and you know the kotatsu, in the winter my obaachan, my wife's mother has the kotatsu.\nTodd: Yeah, like the kotatsu is like a big blanket.\nRichard: Ah, yeah, like a little low table.\nTodd: Oh, the kotatsu, oh, yeah, yeah, sorry\nRichard: An electric heater underneath it \nTodd: Yeah, that's right, sorry!\nRichard: And cat in Japan, cats are famous for going under the kotatsu in winter but my dog goes under the Kotatsu, so and he's quite big right, so you just see his legs poking out of the kotatsu. I mean that's a very unusual behavior for a golden retriever. Yeah, yeah, he's and unusual dog. \nTodd: So how much does he eat?\nRichard: I see, what about my son. I want to talk about my son. \nTodd: Well, no but like, first I'm just curious, how much does you dog eat?\nRichard: How much does he eat? Well, it's three times a day. \nTodd: Yeah, I mean, how much does it cost?\nRichard: Oh, the cost!\nTodd: Yeah, to feed a dog in Japan!\nRichard: Well, that's a good, that's a tough question. I buy a big bag of food. It costs me 18,000 yen and that lasts about three months, so about 6,000 yen. \nTodd: Man, that is expensive! So you're dog, that's at least 6,000 yen a month on food.\nRichard: And then Vet's bills are pretty high.\nTodd: Wow! But he's worth it! It seems like you love your dog.\nRichard: I love my dog. I carry his picture everywhere.\nTodd: That's my favorite dog too! Golden Retrievers. They're so kind. \nRichard: I also love my son!

I wasn't when I first arrived, because of all the excitement about being here, and everything, but since actually about a month and a half ago, my boyfriend came here for three weeks, three and a half weeks, and we went traveling around the rest of Japan, which I think is very important, if you're here, you got to do it and he was the perfect person to do it and we had loads and loads of fun, and since he's left, yeah, I've started to think about home a bit more, now living here is kind of just normal way of life and after the big excitement of having him here, you know traveling around everywhere, it's, I'm starting to think about him, my family, my friends and just you know when I ring him up they're all doing stuff that we used to do together, and it sort of makes you think about what it would be like to get home. I think I'm quite looking forward to going home now.\nTodd: OK, could you, this is very interesting. Could you describe your boyfriend? Like what kind of person is he? How did you meet?\nEli: We actually met in a club which he runs. He has two jobs. He runs a club in Bristol and he edits magazines for recycling in Bristol and Wales and writes articles about environmental recycling issues. Actually when he came to Japan, he managed to interview a few people here about it, and Japanese recycling isn't as strict as you think it is, um, yeah, but we met in his club and he is a friend of my brothers and we knew a lot of the same people, but it's cheesy to say but almost it was love at first site. I t took about half a year for us to get together, but we were sort of good friends before that and we've been together for two and a half years now. (That's a long time.) It's not really though. It's just zoomed by so quickly. Yeah, we live together now in England and sort of very happy. We never, we're one of these couples that never argue. We obviously have disagreements but there's never any sort of shouting involved. We like a lot of the same things. We like lots of different things as well. I think it's very important. You can't only be into the same things. I'm slowly turning his mind towards anime and computer games. I'm twisting, twisting him, but I do have to make it clear when any Final Fantasy games are out, that I have two boyfriends and he is only one of them.\n\nTodd: Wow. He sounds like a really interesting guy.",

        "transcript": "Michael: OK, so then. Hi! I'm Michael. I'm from Toronto.\n\nSimon: Yeah, Hi! I'm Simon from Vancouver.\n\nMichael: Simon!\n\nSimon: That's right!\n\nMichael: So, are you francophone?\n\nSimon: No, I'm not Francophone. That's a common mistake that other Canadians make. My parents were German so they use the German pronunciation of Simon, which is Simon\nMichael: Oh, really\nSimon: Yeah! \n\nMichael: OK, so the German and the French are.\n                                  .\nSimon: Pretty similar. Ah, similar! Ah, yeah, Spanish, French, German. Pretty much only English has the Simon pronunciation of that, that name.\n\nMichael: OK, so you're from Vancouver.\n\n    Simon: Yeah, that's right.\n\nMichael: I'm from Toronto but some of my favorite music came from Vancouver. Ah, I'm not quite sure, you look quite young, you may not have ever seen DOA play.\n\nSimon: I'm very familiar with DOA. Actually, I'm older than I look. I'm 33, so I come from the DOA generation.\n\nMichael: Excellent, so did you go to the Commodore Ballroom?\n\nSimon: That's right, and I've actually seen DOA at the Commodore and almost got hit in the head by a beer can that they throw out during their concerts. They like to throw beer cans into the crowd.\n\nMichael: Well, I saw DOA at the university of Windsor where I went to do my undergraduate degree, and it was one of the best shows I have ever been to. It was great.\n\nSimon: Yeah! I mean when I was in high school, they were already old, so but uh, they kept rocking'.\n\nMichael: So how bout the, do you know, how long have you been in Japan? Do you go back and have you seen\n                                any new bands in Vancouver.\n\nSimon: Ah, well, I've been in Japan just over a year so not that long. I did go back one time but we didn't see any concerts and the commodore has changed since those days of DOA.\n\nMichael: OK, just to show you how out of it I've become, but I've just recently discovered Nickel Back which is from Vancouver as well and also a band that I don't think die hard DOA fans would like cause it's pretty conventional rock I guess, but I like them.\n\nSimon: Yeah, I don't. I mean, they've got catchy tunes that many people like, for example my girlfriend who's Japanese loves Nickle Back, but I didn't even know they were from Vancouver. You know, they're just I thought there were from the Prairies or something like that. Yeah, there not cool enough.\n\nMichael: They're not cool enough. \n\nSimon: I think their music is crap. \n\nMichael: Do you really?\n\nSimon: Yeah, it's, I mean they sound the same as any number of bands, you know.\n\nMichael: OK, can you think of any group from Vancouver that is cool? A new band! \n\nSimon: A new band. Well, you've caught me at a time because I'm in Japan and so new music doesn't really resonate here. Is that the correct word to say?\n\nMichael: Well, what's your definition of new then? Is it like a minute old?\n\nSimon: I can't say, you know, you stumped me on new music. Yeah, how bout you? Do you want to tell me about some music that you're listening to now?\n\nMichael: Oh, you see, once you become middle-aged you start listening to a lot of stuff that you listened to when you were in high school or you actually find yourself nauseatingly wanting to hear things that you hated when you were in high school and it brings back memories, like I can actually say that I enjoy doing a lesson where I have to play ABBA for my students, whereas I hated it when I was a kid. When I was in high school if you put an ABBA record on I probably would have punched you.\n\nSimon: Oh, sure as and ESL teacher, we both have to play, you know, cheesy ballads and things like that for our students because that's what they like. Yeah. OK, let's get back to the music. You know, they're probably already old, yeah, if you want good solid Rock, I mean, the next best thing was The White Stripes a few years ago and their still quite good. \n\nMichael: And they're from Vancouver?\n\nSimon: No, they're from somewhere in the states. But they play, you know, really edgy sort of classical style rock for the modern age. I don't know, for the 2000, yeah.\n\nMichael: I'm reading this book now about the so called Cam-Rock Renaissance, during the period 1985 to 1995. Bands like DOA of course, we've already mentioned, also from Vancouver, Skinny Puppy, would probably.\n\nSimon: Skinny puppy! There's a name I haven't heard in awhile.\n\nMichael: Yep, and The Tragically Hip.\n\nSimon: Overplayed group.\n\nMichael: Overplayed! Tragically Hip is probably the most popular group in Canada, though.\n\nSimon: Yeah, I lived with a techno DJ in university, so we often had parties at our house and he would play his new stuff that he was very proud of, you know, acid jazz, hip-hop beats, and all kind of weird stuff, but good, and he had a rule because people kept on coming up to him and saying, \"Can you play 'The Hip' man?\" and he always said, \"They'll be no 'Hip' played at this house!\"\n\nMichael: That sounds like something I did when I was DJing in bar. Everyone would ask me to play Guns n' Roses and I absolutely despised them. I even went to the extent of buying one of the waitresses their album so that she would never request them again, but unfortunately I didn't have enough money to buy everyone the album and I found myself playing them sometimes two or three times, and the same song two or three times. It wasn't my place. I couldn't make the rule your friend made.\n\nSimon: Yeah, I could hear the recurring theme. Play GNR man!\n\nMichael: Yeah!\n\nSimon: Well, let's wrap up that, this conversation.",

Like how late do you normally sleep?\n\nAdrienne: Um, probably until 10 or 11 o'clock. \n\nTodd: Ooh, that's pretty late.\n\nAdrienne: I know. That's the best part.\n\nTodd: That's terrible actually.\n\nAdrienne: It's not terrible. It's good for you. You can catch up on your sleep, from a busy week.\n\nTodd: Yeah, but don't you think you're giving away the best time of the day. Like that's, if you sleep, you give away that time. You're never going to have it back. \n\nAdrienne: But, it's also relaxing which is something that you don't get to do during the week.\n\nTodd: Mm, that's true. That's true. But for me, it's, I like to get up early. I mean, do you ever get up early on Saturday or Sunday?\n\nAdrienne: Ah, sometimes, if I have an activity planned for the day - errands, shopping, hiking - that kind of thing.\n\nTodd: OK, well, what about food. What do you normally eat?\n\nAdrienne: On Sundays? I like to make an omelet for breakfast, ah, cheese omelet usually. \n\nTodd: What do you put inside the omelet besides cheese?\n\nAdrienne: Mushrooms (Ooh, that's good) and sometimes avocado, if I can find it. It's delicious. \n\nTodd: Do you do this every Sunday?\n\nAdrienne: No, it's not a habit but when I can, when I think of it, when I'm up early enough. \n\nTodd: OK, well, let's talk about last sunday? What did you do last Sunday? Do you remember?\n\nAdrienne: Mm, last Sunday? I was packing.\n\nTodd: Packing for what?\n\nAdrienne: To come to Japan. \n\nTodd: Oh, yeah!

We had a lot of turbulence.\n\nTodd: Ooh, what's turbulence?\n\nAdrienne: Turbulence is when the plane hits some kind of air pockets and bounces around. You have to put your seatbelt on so you don't get knocked over.\n\nTodd: Yeah, they go \"bong!\"\n\nAdrienne: Exactly!",

        "transcript": "Todd: OK, Raphael, you were saying you lived in Paris.\nRapheal: Yes, I made my studies there.\nTodd: Paris is just an amazing city. Can you talk about Paris?\nRapheal:Yes! Well, the biggest difference I noticed with Tokyo is the size. Like Paris is nice in that way, you can go anywhere by walking. It might take at maximum an hour and a half if you want to go to a very far place, but basically it's a city like made for walkers and you can really go anywhere just by walking, I mean it's quite pleasant cause you can see many, you know, nice buildings and places and things, just by walking.\nTodd: Wow, that's nice. How many people live in Paris?\nRapheal:Including the suburbs it's 8 million now. Maybe getting increasing, but the inner city is only one million, so it's not overcrowded at all. Yeah!\nTodd: So, what else would you say is different about Tokyo and Paris?\nRapheal:Well, specially, Paris you mean? The Transport is less expensive. This is important. \nTodd: Yeah\nRapheal:Yeah, Yeah.\nTodd: It's more expensive?\nRapheal:No, it's less, sorry, it's less expensive. Anyway, the, I was surprised because Tokyo is not that expensive finally, I mean you can, you can live in a very expensive way if you want but you can save a lot as well. It's really up to you. But in Paris is quite hard to save. I mean, the food is very expensive, and if you want to go out, just, a restaurant or anything, it's really more expensive than in Japan. A restaurant for example, like prices in Japan start from a thousand yen, maybe less, like 600 yen, and in France like the cheapest restaurant you can find is 15 Euro which is around 2000 Yen \nTodd: Whoa! That is expensive.\nRapheal:Yeah, it's more expensive, wherever you go it's more expensive if you want to go out but on the contrary the cinema is really cheap, so so many people go to the cinema, I mean, the cinema is really, it's a part of Paris nightlife, like, people used to go to cinema once a week at least, almost everyone. Yeah, cause it's really cheap. A ticket is 1000 yen, maybe less.\nTodd: So, what about sports, like what kind of sports do you like to do?\nRapheal:Yeah, anything. Anything, yeah! You have a lot of facilities, like gymnasium, swimming pools, clubs, yeah, you can practice a lot. Especially, I was a student so, I had this very easy student life because France has a lot of students, whatever it is, so they give you a bit of money, and you get discount on almost anything, so sport is specially favorized in Paris when you are a student, you canalmost like do whatever you want, as a sport almost free, sometimes, so, it's, you can do a lot of things. Actually, I did Aikido. I did swimming pool, squash, tennis, yeah, uh, basketball, yeah, a lot of things actually.\nTodd: Active guy. And what about the traffic if you want to drive in Paris?\nRapheal:I never tested, because as I told you it's so nice to just walk, that, and I didn't own a car but it's quite tough for people living in the suburbs cause they need a car to come, the train system is not really good. It's not like, there's a lot of delay, trains and things like that, so if you live in the suburbs you need a car, and driving through Paris in the mornings or evening is really difficult, so I just didn't want to test, you know.",

It's from the middle ages. \nTodd: OK\nRaphael: Yeah, yeah, yeah!\nTodd: Wow, Where are you from in France?\nRaphael: I just finished my studies in Paris, but I was born in the South. Actually, it's the place they make foie gras. If you know about foie gras. \nTodd: Yeah, yeah, yeah\nRaphael: We used to eat on Christmas and..\nTodd: What exactly is foie gras? Sorry, it's hard for me to say.\nRaphael: It's from the duck. It's um, how do you call it?\nTodd: The liver?\nRaphael: Yeah, the liver! That's it. The liver, and it's cooked an official way and you can have it both like cold or hot, I mean, any kind, but the point is, the duck has to be fed in nature, right! It's not working if it's in a, industrial feeding duck \nTodd: Oh, really!\nRaphael: It doesn't produce really good foie gras, yeah!\nTodd: So the duck must come from nature?\nRaphael: Yeah, actually, that's why this place is famous for because it's countryside. There's no really big cities and most of the people are farmers so they actually produce some really good foie gras, like I heard the competition comes from East Europe now but they make more like industrial foie gras. It's a little different, but anyway, that's the place I'm born.\nTodd: Wow! Is that the eastern side or the western side?\nRaphael: It's the southwest.\nTodd: OK, towards Spain.\nRaphael: Yeah, that's it. Exactly! Like below Bordeaux, a city called Bordeaux, it's a bit below this city.\nTodd: OK, so Bordeaux is known for wine.\nRaphael: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nTodd: So, is it near the mountains or?\nRaphael: It's not that close to Spain. It's, how can I say, yeah, it's not the extremity of France, it's more like center-south, you know.\nTodd: Oh, OK. Sounds like a pretty place though. \nRaphael: What?\nTodd: It sounds like a pretty place.\nRaphael: Yeah, yeah, it's quite nice. It's quite nice. I mean, it's countryside right. You have to like it. There's not a lot of things to do, but, I spend like my, from fifteen years old, I live there and then I moved to another city called La Rochelle, which is close to the sea, just in front of the sea actually, and that's a better place.

How bout you?\nMichael: Oh, I liked it as well, and I read the book when I was in high school. I like the movies a lot but it still doesn't compare to the first time reading the book. The book was fantastic but of all the adaptations of that book this movie is probably the one, or those three movies are probably the one that I enjoyed the most. \nSimon: Yeah! That's true! A lot of adaptions are really quite terrible aren't they?\nMichael: Which of the three did you like the most?\nSimon: I liked the first one. The first one. It has story and it had, you know, what-will-happen-next anticipation and yeah, but all three were good. \nMichael: Well, it's interesting, you're favorite is a trilogy, and my favorite is a trilogy too, and that's the Godfather trilogy, and my favorite is the second one.\nSimon: Oh, you like the second one. That's surprising! Most people like the first one the best. \nMichael: I like the first one a lot but I like the second one because DeNiro is in it and I like the story of Don Corleone in Sicily as well. \nSimon: Ah, yeah, flashbacks!\nMichael: Yeah, and I think that the real conflict in the story comes out in the second one. More so than in the first. I see the Godfather trilogy to be very similar to a Shakespearean kind of trilogy, tragic, I think that Michael Corleone is a tragic hero and I like Shakespearean trilogies to so perhaps that's why I like it. \nSimon: Oh, that's a really good explanation.",

I think my friends get quite worried about me sometimes, the amount I play, but yeah I've always since I've been little liked computer games. I think my dad on his old macintosh forced us into it originally, so I blame it all on him, but that sort of developed into obviously in my field that I do which is animation. It's very close connected to it, and I'd like to maybe work making computer games one day, uh.\nTodd: What's a really good game? What do you think is the best game?\nEli: My favorite games are I think a split between two, the Final Fantasy series, which is a spread of lots of different games which are RPG which are role playing games, where you are, you're a character, or party of characters and you run around talking to people, discovering things, fighting battles, lots and lots of puzzles, lots of secrets. That's what I like.\nTodd: Is the setting now or the future or the past?\nEli: The setting's always in some fantasy world, but you don't know about. That's kind of, that's one of the nice things about computer games, it's almost escapism. You can escape the reality of the real world and go and run around in some fantastical world I mean, now that the graphics and computer games are getting so advanced it really does feel like your going into a new world of your own actually,and that you're there running around, so yeah, that's great and I think my other favorite game would have to be the SIMS series, which is,\n                                started with SIM city, which is a little city building game, where you're the mayor of the city.\nTodd: You're the mayor!\nEli: You're the mayor of the city and you have to build up your city over hundreds of years and advance it, and then from that they made the SIMs which actually goes into the houses and you control the lives of the little SIM people in the houses. It's almost like playing dolls houses, but very, very advanced and they have their own wants and needs and they fall in love and they go to work and it's basically just determining the destinies of your little character and furnishing their houses at the same time, which is always fun.\nTodd: Wow, what a game! So actually, shows how old I am, you said, \"computer games!\" So you don't say video games anymore?\nEli: Well, the SIMS and SIM City, I mean the first SIM City series I played on, probably the Mac had only just got a hard drive, um, really old when I was about, sort of seven or eight, even younger than that, so yeah, those PC games, mac games, and also video games, video games are Play Station, the ones that you play on the TV.\nTodd: Which to you prefer a play station or an actual arcade game to play on?\nEli: Uh, I never actually got into arcade games, cause you got to put money in to play them so, and I don't\n                                think my, our parents ever wanted us to sort of waste money like that so.\nTodd: What kind of player do you have: a play station?\nEli: I have a play station, and a Dreamcast, and an X box, and a Game Cube, and an N64 and a Gameboy\nTodd: Wow, I don't even know what those are.\nEli: And a PC!",

        "transcript": "Todd: OK, guys we're going to talk about Halloween. So, what do you think about Halloween?\nAdrienne: I actually like it. It's a fun holiday for kids especially because you get to dress up in costumes and you get lots of candy if you go trick-or-treating. I have a lot of good memories. of Halloween growing up.\nTodd: OK, what is trick-or-treating? Why do you trick-or-treat?\nAdrienne: Trick-or-treat is when you go, you dress up in your costume on Halloween and you go door-to-door ringing doorbells, knocking on doors. One person comes to the door, you say, \"Trick-or-treat\" and usually these days they give you a treat which is candy or apples or something like that but in the older days, you could, if they didn't give you a treat, then you could play a trick on them or they could play a trick on you, instead of giving you a treat, something like that.\nMike: I always thought that it was they performed, the person at the door performed some kind of trick for the kids because they didn't have candy to give, but I could be wrong. \nAdrienne: Yeah, I don't know exactly. It's one of those three options.\nTodd: Yeah, I think it's you play a trick on them.\nMike: Oh, really\nTodd: You throw trash against their house.\nAdrienne: Toilet paper their.\nTodd: Toilet paper, eggs, \nMike: Egg their window.\nTodd: Dog pooh in the paper bag on fire. On fire!\nAdrienne: Yuck. \nTodd: Yeah, that's gross. So, Mike, you're from Canada, so do you have Halloween American-style in Canada? Do you celebrate trick-or-treating? Do you do trick-or-treating?\nMike: Oh, yeah, I think it is the same as in the U.S. I believe it is a little bit different in Europe, maybe. They don't have the same kind of traditions but, yeah, exactly the same as in the U.S. We watched all the Snoopy, Charlie Brown Halloween kind of things, just like everybody....\nTodd: OK. That's good. I'm glad because now we can diverge. What was, what were your costumes when you were younger?\nAdrienne: Ah, I had so many. My mom was a seamstress so she used to make a lot of my costumes. I designed them and she would make them for me and my sister so one year I was bat girl, another year I was Wonder Woman. Another year I was Princess Lea from Star Wars, I was a rainbow and a clown and a cat, and a witch and everything, basically that you're supposed to be for Halloween I was.\nTodd: A lot of heroines in there.\nAdrienne: Of course. Strong women!\nTodd: Mike, how about you?\nMike: I was goat boy.\nTodd: Goat boy!\nMike: I was always goat boy because there...\nTodd: Every year?\nMike: Yeah, we, I couldn't afford to get a decent costume every year. \nTodd: So how were you goat boy? What did you look like?\nAdrienne: Where did you get goat boy from?\nMike: They just put some sort of, they put a lot of trash on me, and forced me to eat a can. It's OK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t        I got lots of candy but then the other kids would beat me up and steal it from me. That's OK.\nAdrienne: That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.\nMike: Well, you know. That's all right. It toughened me up when I got older.",

Most hooligans are very proud of their home city and their home team, and what usually happens, are when the away team come to the city their hooligans try to actually take over the other teams actual bars, pubs so it's a race to get in the bar for first.\nTodd: Oh, wow!\nMark: Yeah and when that happens, when the actual away team is actually, if their supporters are drinking in your bar, then obviously you want to take your bar back, so there's usually a lot of violence.\nTodd: So you've actually seen fights?\nMark: Oh, lots of fights, yeah, sure, sure. If you go to most games in England on a Saturday you can usually see the odd fight or maybe, I've been to some games where there has actually been full scale riots but usually not in the stadium, usually outside.\nTodd: What happens when there's a riot?\nMark: So, one, the biggest riot I've seen, was actually at a stadium and it was two local rivals: it was my team and the local team called Leeds and basically the guys were all fighting in a field near the stadium so what all that happened was the police actually surrounded them with horses, and police dogs, and they just let the police dogs go off the leads, and then the horses charged in and basically the police where just hitting the supporters with the batons.\nTodd: Wow! Pretty intense.\nMark: Yeah, yeah, lots, usually a few arrests. So usually when there's a big riot the papers will report how many arrests there were. Sometimes a 100, 150.",

When you are in India you see many things that are very shocking and very strange to your culture. For example, the cow is a very holy animal there. It's part of the religion so you don't eat meat in India, and the cows are allowed to go free and go wherever they want, so maybe when you are driving down the street there will be a cow standing in the middle of the road and you have to drive around him, so this is very, very strange sight.

It's the good and the bad, and the rich and the poor, and the happy and the struggling, all together in one country, and when you go to India, you feel a lot of emotion, you feel a lot of sadness and happiness and joy and that's why India is my favorite country\n\n                                India is a very interesting culture, and it's a very old culture. It takes a little bit of time for you to get used to India when you go there. They go things differently from other countries. I was eating with my hands in India. You eat with your hand and your left hand acts as toilet paper, because they don't have toilet paper in India, and they are mostly Hindu and they believe in the Hindi, Hindu religion, and it's a very old religion. A very beautiful religion, they have many gods and many deities, and it's very colorful and they do lots, lots of religions ceremonies with fire and with bells, and with holy priests, and it's very visually, for your eyes, it's an interesting place, a very interesting thing to see",

I still can't get used to all the rain. \nTodd: So, Houston is pretty close to Mexico, right?\nIvan: Yeah, actually, it's a nine hour drive, well not nine, maybe six. I used to go down there back in high school. Me and my buddies would go. There's no drinking age in Mexico. Beer is about 25 cents or 30 yen over there.\nTodd: Yeah, what do you remember about your trips to Mexico?\nIvan: Not much, which is why we went. We just went. It was called a border town.

I used to live in what's called a \"Gaijin house\" which is just a shared apartment. I had a 6 mat room and a shared bathroom. Now I have two 8 mat rooms and my own bathroom and a kitchen with 4 burners, instead of 2.. yeah. \nTodd: Oh wow, so you're in your new place now?\nIvan: Yeah, I'm in my new place now. Actually, the old place was owned by a company, they owned the land and this really, really, awful woman owned the building, so I rented a room from the woman. I woke up one morning and the manager was putting stuff in.. was putting flyers in people's mailboxes. I took a look at the flyer. The flyer was saying that the company was going to destroy the building within a month period so they were warning us to get out. Well, the manager was busy taking these flyers so that the people inside the apartment wouldn't see it and move out. She wanted to get one more month of rent from us. So I took my flyer and I went down to the company that owned the land and said, \"Where can I live now? You're making us leave in a month.\" He said, \" Oh, I feel really bad about what you told me happened, so he gave me this 2DK which is normally 120,000 a month for 60,000 with no key money and no deposit.\nTodd: Wow!

Each place has it's own good points, for example the country is quiet and relaxed and you're calm in the country and your head is clear, your mind is clear and you listen to the birds and look at the clouds and watch the sunrise and it's very peaceful but in the city it's.. there is a lot of energy, there's a lot of people and there's a lot of commotion, a lot of lights and a lot of action. So the quiet country side gives you energy and makes you strong but the city and all the action and all the sites and the sounds and the smells also gives you energy so I think they both have their good points.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Ivan, in America.. in California we have earthquakes. Do you have any natural disasters in Houston?\nIvan: It floods a lot and we get hurricanes. Houston's called a bayou city. Bayou is kind of like a dirty river. Sometimes it rains a lot, that thing fills up over and the next thing you know you got water in your house. Hurricanes are really, really angry typhoons I think. The first hurricane I ever remember.. we name our hurricanes, you give them names, usually girl names and the first hurricane I remember was back in 1984 named \"Hurricane Alice\" I believe.  I was in a soccer camp. It starts raining, \"oh my god, it's raining\". Trees are falling down and cars are kind of being pushed away from the water and stuff and I'm scared to death that my parents are dead right? I was only seven years old. So I remember.. I couldn't remember my phone number and the camp counselors were trying to look it up. Call up: ring, ring, ring. My mom answers the phone, \"Are you OK? Are you OK?\" \"Yes, Ivan, we're OK. Don't worry about it. It's just a rain storm.\" But it was an absolute mess. The next day, the soccer field is completely wiped out. It was.. yeah, they're big angry storms. \nTodd: How long does a hurricane usually last?\nIvan: Usually, about two or three days. \nTodd: Oh, really?\nIvan: Yeah, they just kind of stay in Houston. They like Houston. Something about the weather pattern. They just float to Houston and stay there. \nTodd: Man, that's pretty intense. So afterward everything is just kind of wiped out?\nIvan: A lot of windows are broken. I said a lot of cars are upside down sometimes because the wind is really, really high, plus you got the water that floats the cars but it's fun when it stops cause the streets are flooded  and you can go swimming.\nTodd: You swim in the water?\nIvan: Sure. Sure. It's just rain water.\nTodd: Wow! Cool, thanks",

        "transcript": "Adrienne: So Rob, tell me why you don't like elephants?\nRob: Why don't I like elephants? It's a long story. I was traveling in India with a friend of mine and one night we decided to spend the night in a national park, looking at wildlife and we were staying in a small hut. And to get to the hut we had to walk across a swamp and we had to take a boat, then we had to walk across another swamp. And after walking for about half an hour we reached the hut, all upon big lakes about 20 meters up into the air and I climbed the steps and when I got to the top of the steps, on the other side of the hut there was a huge snake about 3 or 4 meters long, a cobra. \nAdrienne: Wow!\nRob: I hate snakes. I absolutely hate snakes. So I ran down the steps and said to my friend, \"I am not staying here. I can not sleep in this place\" And we thought about what to do and there was a village maybe two kilometers away. So my friend walked to the village to find out whether someone could come and scare away the snake and she came back and said, \"The people said there is no way, we can not scare the snake off. Do you think we're crazy? We are not fighting the snake but you can stay in our huts. You can stay in the village\", so we started walking back to the village and this was about half past six, seven o'clock in the evening and the sun was going down and as we were walking through the jungle we heard all sorts of noises from other parts of the forest and there was lots of rustling noises. And \"Oh I wonder what that is, there must be some  animals. Wow. Cool, some animals\" and then after a little while a big pig appeared in the middle of the path and we thought, \"Oh, it's a pig\". Pigs are not very exciting but it seemed exciting at the time and then the pig went walking off in the opposite directions and after about 2 minutes the same pig \"bang\" came running back in front us. We didn't know what had happened but we could still hear the noises coming slowly and slowly towards us. And after a little while the noises started getting louder and louder and louder and then we stopped. And at the side of the path in front of us we saw a trunk appear, just one trunk appear, only the trunk, off to the side of the path and then another trunk and then another trunk, so there were three trunks and I was like \"Wow, elephants, great!\" And then one of the elephants came out onto the path and looked right at us and then we were not so happy but we thought we're unyielding, we're tourist. So we took photos of the elephants but unfortunately my camera flashed and the elephant was very unhappy, \"RRRR\" but he did nothing. He just stood but we knew he was angry so we ran and hid behind a tree and after about ten minutes we thought, \"OK, the elephants will have gone\" so we started walking down the path again and all the bushes and the grass was above our heads and then we suddenly came to an area where the grass was only two or three feet high. So we could see a big area again and we looked over to our left and there were three elephants staring right at us, waiting for us. Maybe about 30 meters away and unfortunately at school in England they don't tell you what to do if you see an elephant. So we didn't know, should we walk past? Should we run? Should we make lots of noise? So we decided to walk. Do nothing, don't do anything suddenly. Just walk and we walked about two or three steps and there was this sudden \"RRRRRRRRRRR\" Boom, boom, boom, boom.\nAdrienne: Oh, my god!\nRob: In one second we looked at each other, \"Run\" I was carrying a rucksack so I was running very slowly. My friend ran very fast. I was running with the rucksack and then I dropped the rucksack and I jumped into a bush. Unfortunately it was a thorn bush so I cut myself lots and three elephants decided I looked, maybe they thought I looked more delicious than my friend. So they came after me and the three elephants came charging over on top of me and I was underneath one of the elephants and it kicked me on the left leg and then I just.. and then went past making lots of noise trying to scare us off.\nAdrienne: Were you OK?\nRob: I was OK that night but my leg was completely black the next day cause I had a huge bruise from where the elephant had kicked me and I have lots of cuts and bruises from the bushes and they broke my rucksack which I was very unhappy about and then we continued walking to the village which was only about 50 meters away and there was a large group of other tourists watching the elephants playing in the lane, and \"How wonderful! Aren't they sweet? Aren't they lovely?\" No!\nAdrienne: Sounds very frightening.\nRob: I don't like elephants.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So you're in law school, Travis.\nTravis: Yes, I'm in law school. \nTodd: Normally, how do you get a job after you finish law school?\nTravis: Well, the law school that I'm at is considered to be a top-tier law school and so my law school has a lot o power to get companies to actually come to my law school and interview with students at the school. And the way my law school does it is every year in the summer, the last week of summer before school starts, they get about 700 firms to come for about one week and interview students on campus and it's called early interview week. So during this early interview week, basically the school rents out an entire hotel and every firm will be there for about one day and so, it's like every day you have about 150-200 firms on any particular day. Each with their own room in the hotel and so the students will wait in a common area and when it's their time to interview they'll go to a hotel room and knock on the door and go inside and interview with that firm and they'll get maybe 20 or 30 minutes with that firm. And then afterwards if the firm likes them the firm might actually invite them to go to lunch or to go to a dinner that night and they'll be selected so maybe every day, a firm will interview as many as 50 candidates but only invite maybe 5 or 6 of them to go out to dinner with them that night. So this lasts about 4 or 5 days and at the end of that, other than being really tired. Hopefully, you've gotten a couple of job offers, well not job offers but basically an offer to come back to a second interview which will hopefully, eventually lead to a job offer. So, for the students it's quite difficult. Over the course of a week some students will interview with as many as 25 firms, over a four or five day period so they can be interviewing anywhere from five to as many as ten firms in a single day. So if you're interviewing 10 firms in a singe day, each 30 minutes long, you're going to be there a long time. At least 5 or 6 hours of straight interviewing, going from one room to the next room to the next room, to the next room to interview with a firm.\nTodd: Sounds pretty exhausting.\nTravis: It's really exhausting and I'm not looking forward to it at all.",

It's a really, really, nice time.., when are you going? \nTodd: I should get there mid August. \nJessica: OK, then stay away from Madrid because it's too hot. It's about like 40, 45 degrees Celsius so it's really, really hot. So, the south is really extremely warm as well but the north and the east coast is really nice, cause they have a lot of really nice beaches and Barcelona is really beautiful. It's a really great place. They have this cathedral there by Gaudi which is incredible, it's incredible. Ah, Valencia is really cool. It's a very nice place to go. They have a really nice beach. A really nice downtown city. The southern coast is really nice. They.. but it's incredibly hot like I said so.. so you definitely have to take advantage of the siesta and sleep through the majority of the day and then stay up late at night, so you wouldn't burn outside basically, so sleep away the warmest part of the day but..\nTodd: OK, now if I can go to one country around Spain - Morocco, Portugal or France, which one would you recommend?\nJessica:  I would say that Morocco is definitely the most different. It's definitely the most unique. Portugal is very similar to Spain and France is of course France. Personally, I would probably go to France but if you want something very exotic and different, Morocco is definitely, definitely the place to go. \nTodd: OK, thanks Jessica.\nJessica: Thank you.",

        "transcript": "Todd: OK, Mark you said that you want to own your own home.Mark: That would be nice, yes.Todd: So let's say you can have any home in the world. You can make your dream home, reasonable dream home. OK, what kind of house would you have?Mark: Well, I don't normally dream of like an enormous mansion, or anything. Just a nice, you know, medium to large size home. I guess almost more importantly for me is to have some land with the house, like I don't like, I wouldn't want my neighbor to be, you know, just three feet away from my house. I'd like to have a little bit of space.Todd: OK, so assuming you have a big yard and you have this space, you have land, what kind of landscape would you have?Mark: Well, I grew up in Alabama and I really like the landscape there. It's kind of hilly and lots of trees and lots of pine trees, you know, it’s a deciduous area of America, and lots of lakes so I guess, you know, that kind of setting, like a deciduous you know, lots of trees, lots of lakes, you know, or some water nearby and hills: things like that.Todd: OK, but actually, what would you want your yard to look like?Mark: Oh, I see.Todd: You don't want a lake, right?Mark: No, no, but, yeah, I don't know, I would want it to be taken care of, but not overly manicured, like I don't want it to be, you know, too much pruning, just, but I wouldn't want it to be completely wild either, so green but not like a just completely perfect square, or anything. I'd like for it to be a little bit, chaotic.Todd: OK, so what do you want: a big bathroom, small bathroom, big kitchen, small kitchen?Mark: Big bathrooms, big kitchen. Yeah. The bigger, the better!Todd: The bigger, the better.Mark: Yeah.Todd: Two car garage?Mark: Sure. That'll be fine. And actually the way the house is decorated, you know, if I'm married, my wife can decorate most of the house but I'd like to have one room that was my room, like that, you know, maybe I could put a small library and lots of books, maybe a pool table but one room that I got to do, you know, my own thing with.Todd: Yeah, man. You need your territory.Mark: Yeah, just that one room.",

        "transcript": "Mark: So, Todd, you run and operate this site, elllo.org, yeah? Todd: Yes.Mark: How long have you been doing that?Todd: I've been doing it now for about two years.Mark: Two years. OK, and I've been on the site and there's a place where I can send a comment to you, right?  Do people ever send, send you comments, or?Todd: Yeah, actually, I get, I do, I get about five letters a day, usually, from people all over the world, some days more, some days less, and usually people are very sweet and they say, oh you know, \"Nice Job\" and sometimes they give me suggestions for how to improve the site.Mark: Really! Do they ever, is anyone ever critical or say any negative things?Todd: Well, the one, the main critical thing I get a lot, often is, \"Why don't you have real authentic speech?\" Like, why don't you have people talking natural. And actually, there's quite a few reasons why?Mark: OK, well, I don't understand exactly because right now, you and I are talking (right) and this is not scripted, we're basically talking (right) we're talking off the top of our head, so how is this not natural?Todd: Well, this conversation actually probably is more natural because I'm really explaining why I don't have natural conversations. It's kind of ironic, but I think because a lot of the conversations are staged. They're unscripted, but I do just sit down and ask two people to talk about something, and because I tell them to talk about it, it's not as natural as it would be in real life.Mark: Ah, I see, because they're not, they didn't think of that topic on their own. They're given the topic and then, sort of, they must say something about that topic.Todd: Right. And also there's a problem with just the recordings. You know when you record audio, you have to have the mic equal distance to both speakers, and so that means both people have to sit down and put on the headsets to get good quality audio, so in order to get people speaking naturally in real life, I would have to follow them around with a microphone, and it's, technically it's just too hard to do.Mark: So what do you do to try to, is that, well let me ask you, actually, is that the only criticism that you get?Todd: Ah, no, there's, well, there's quite a bit. The other criticism is that, this is the funny part, it's either too easy, or it's too difficult, so usuallyMark: So you need more intermediate.Todd: Well, I guess that's what they say, they say that there's not enough stuff for low level listeners, and there's not enough stuff for the advanced listeners.Mark: So what do you think your gonna do in the future to address those needs?Todd: Well, hopefully by next year, Ill be able to have enough that I can do both. For the people who really want high listening, or more advanced listening I think they should just go to the links page and listen to authentic stuff, because if you're listening is that good then, that's probably the best thing to do, but I do need to start working on stuff for beginners soon.",
