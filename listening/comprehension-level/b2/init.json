        "transcript": "Katie: So what do you think is a good age for girls to start wearing makeup? \nAimee: I think it depends on the kind of makeup that they're wearing and the purpose, you know, because to me, it seems like there are two different kinds. You know, there are young children, young girls, young children, who wear play makeup, you know. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: It's a toy. It washes off easily, garish colors, very mild on the skin, and you know, it's literally just coloring in their face. It's not, you know, enhancing their features or trying to look as society thinks beautiful, you know. They're not covering up any pimples or spots, you know. It's not like that. It's just coloring in their face, trying to look more like a princess. \nAnd I have a six-year old daughter and she loves makeup. She has her own, like, young like toy makeup and she asks permission to wear it, and I let her wear it. I bought some for her. I make sure that she can only do it if she has a clean face and clean hands and that she washes off properly at the end. And that she tidies it away afterwards.\nKatie: That's good. \nAimee: She's actually on her final warning because she used to leave it out – and I've warned her I will throw it in the bin. Because I have a toddler and she wants to see what her big sister is doing and she wants to play with it, so she grabs it and makes a mess everywhere. So yeah, six-year old is on her final warning. \nSo I guess to answer your question, my six-year old is wearing her play make-up already. So it doesn't, yeah, it doesn't bother me. Young is –\nKatie: How old were you when you started wearing makeup? \nAimee: Well, I love makeup, and that's probably where my daughter got it from. I wanted to wear makeup from a young age, the way my daughter does. I wasn't allowed. It was forbidden. And I first actually managed to buy a secret lipstick when I was about 9 or 10. \nKatie: Secret lipstick. \nAimee: Yeah. I had to hide it from my mom, and she would only let me wear lip gloss when I was that age, and I wasn't allowed to wear any lip sticks, soI had to buy a secret one. And I was always so interested in my grandmother's makeup and my mom's makeup as well. But she never really wore much. She has a very simple sort of beauty routine. \nI'm much more interested in it than she is – she ever was. So I don't know where I inherited that from, but my daughter has definitely inherited that from me. So maybe because it was forbidden for me that's why I was drawn to it more. \nKatie: Makes it more tantalizing. \nAimee: I think so. That could be it, but yeah, it's a real hobby for me. I really, really love it. I wish I had more money to purchase more. You can never have enough. \nKatie: You can never have too many lipsticks.\nAimee: I know. It's true.\nKatie: What do you think about boys wearing makeup? \nAimee: If they want to wear makeup, then they should. Like it annoys me this horrible idea and concept of like men and boys have to be manly, like what is manly? \nFor me, makeup is an art. It really is. It's artistry. And, you know, if they want it, if they're feeling bad about their skin the way I feel bad about my skin, right. If I have pimples or spots, I'm lucky. I get to just cover up with like foundation and concealer, a bit of blusher. It makes me feel better. \nBut, you know, if there's like a boy who has, you know, going through teenage years and he's got bad skin and he wants to cover up, and his macho friends catch him wearing it or whatever people in school catch him wearing it and it can be a really bad situation for him. And I think that is awful. It is really, really terrible. I think boys should wear makeup as they like. \nI actually follow quite a lot of makeup artists on social media. And I look at many, many pictures of different products and the art that they produce, and I follow male makeup artists as well. And the skills they have are unbelievable, honestly. The blending skills. \nKatie: Their contouring. \nAimee: Yeah. \nKatie: Oh my goodness.\nAimee: The blending skills and like covering up, you know, basically just like covering up their whole face and putting a new face on top of it. \nKatie: It's pretty impressive. \nAimee: It's really impressive. It's so amazing. I would really enjoy a makeup lesson from some of the artists that I follow on different social media sites. \nKatie: Absolutely.",

Think of like a cyclone. Now there's all types of activity except for in the dead center where it's really still and quiet. I feel that meditation is a way to get back to that quiet inner self and it's something you need just to keep you settled in everyday life. For me, I'm very used to either bursts of activity or just being still so when I meditate I just like to absolutley sit still. I don't worry about sitting in a lotus position or anything like that. I sit more in a comfortable position and one that's not going to distract me from what I'm trying to do. If I can, I just don't think about anything but if I've got too much on my mind then I'll concetrate on my breathing. I'll pay attention to the rise and fall of my stomach and just count each breath one to five just over and over again and usually it can get me to my center pretty well.Todd: Um, wow, sounds good. When do you meditate and how often do you meditate?Jeanie: I usually meditate in the mornings if I have time. On weekends I usually meditate in the morning. Weekdays I don't usually have time so I meditate at night on those days. I try to find a time that everything around me is very quiet. If there's too much activity going on with other people then well I get easily distracted, and so I try to find a really quiet time and a quiet place to do it.",

Okay.\nTodd: Because I remember when I was younger, back in the day like there were certain foods I hated, certain things I hated to do. As you get older, you know, you kind of learn to adapt and you don’t hate them so much. So for example, you know what is a food that you just really dislike?\nJosh: Yeah. That’s an easy one. I really don’t like pickled plums.\nTodd: Pickled plums, yeah? Why, is it the taste or the texture?\nJosh: Something about just how sour they are and I guess it’s really pickled anything except pickles. So I like pickles but I don’t really like anything else pickled.\nTodd: So like you don’t like pickled carrots? You don’t like pickled...\nJosh: Yeah, pickled herring.\nTodd: Pickled cucumber.\nJosh: Pickled cucumbers, picked artichoke, anything like that.\nTodd: Right. I guess though, pickle is a cucumber, isn’t it?\nJosh: Yeah, a pickle is a cucumber, that’s right.\nTodd: Right. So they do it sometimes, they do it a different way with other cucumbers.\nJosh: Yeah. So I don’t mind pickles, but other kinds of pickling.Todd: Right.  Okay. Is there any other food that you don’t like, like any cooked dish you don’t like, any meat or anything like that?\nJosh: Not really, I basically like all food. That might be a part of being a teenager.\nTodd: Wow! When I was ... even to this day, I still cannot stand liver. I never eat liver. Yeah. Can you eat it?\nJosh: I can eat it. I don’t ... I wouldn’t say I like it but I don’t hate it.\nTodd: Oh man, it tastes like metal. Josh: Yeah. Todd: You know. So, both of us we lived in Asia and they have lots of different meat here than our home country which is America. So for example, tongue, can you eat tongue?\nJosh: Can I eat tongue? I can force it down but I guess I would say I hate tongue, yeah.\nTodd: Yeah. Because like if you go to a Korean barbecue they always have the tongue.\nJosh: Yeah, that’s true. I guess I kind of feel bad because, you know, it’s not actually that bad but just the idea of it being tongue is like, man, I can’t eat that.Todd: It’s actually not the visual for me, I don’t mind that it’s a cow’s tongue, it just, I don't know, it's pretty chewy, it doesn’t taste that good.\nJosh: It’s true, it’s chewy. Yeah.\nTodd: Yeah. Okay, what about if you buy chicken? Lots of cultures like to eat chicken heart.\nJosh: Chicken heart, yeah, not a fan of chicken heart, definitely hate that.\nTodd: Yeah. That’s really chewy, that’s hard to chew.\nJosh: Really chewy, yeah, not good.\nTodd: Yeah. Yeah, okay. What about the cartilage? Sometimes, you ever had like the fried cartilage, like chicken cartilage?\nJosh: I actually have a short story about that sort of, I went to a restaurant and I ordered what I thought was chicken. I asked whether it was chicken and they said, “Oh yeah, it’s chicken.” And when I got it, I took a big bite of one and it was chicken cartilage. And I’ve never had that before and it was like kind of crunchy, it tasted like fried chicken bone or something. I'm not into it. And I called the waitress and asked her what it was and she pointed to her elbow and said, “Chicken elbow.\" And I said “Oh, thank you.” You know, I muscled down a few more and left the rest on the plate but...\nTodd: Yeah, I’m with you, man. I've made that same mistake, yeah. There’s just some stuff. What about pig’s feet?\nJosh: Pig’s feet, yeah. My grandma really loves pig’s feet and she’ll always try to get me to eat pickled pig’s feet and bean pickled and just pig’s feet, not into it.\nTodd: Right. So that was a double whammy, right?\nJosh: Yeah, absolutely.\nTodd: So actually, it’s a triple whammy I guess. Disgusting part of the animal, doesn’t sound, you know, it doesn’t sound good or look good. Yeah, and it’s pickled.Josh: And it's pickled, yeah.",

Anja: Yes, I am.Fred: Oh, I was wondering because I was reading recently and I was wondering what were the traditions of Santa Claus in Switzerland?Anja: Yes, they are quite different I guess from the rest of like America or Canada, because in fact we don't have Santa Claus bringing the Christmas, the presents, on Christmas.Fred: You don't have a Santa Claus bringing presents?Anja: Yeah, that's right. Like, we do have Santa Claus but he's coming on the sixth of December.Fred: The Sixth of December! But us it's the 25th of December.Anja: Yes, that's right.Fred: Oh, wow, that's really different.Anja: Yeah, indeed. Like Santa Claus will bring you presents but it's more like little like presents of nuts or mandarins, or little chocolates.Fred: So he's bringing fruits for Christmas?Anja: Yes, that's right.Fred: Oh, OK.Anja: Because, you know, Santa Claus, he's living in the forest so he....Fred: Wait, wait, wait! Santa Claus lives in the forest. He doesn't live in the North Pole?Anja: Yes, that's right. He lives in the forest.Fred: Wow. OK.Anja: With his little fellow that helps him, you know, collect all the fruits and nuts.Fred: Are they elves?Anja: No, no. It's just one guy, his friend, and it's a little bit difficult to say the name. You won't understand it. With him as his donkey. There's a donkey too. It helps him carry all the presents for the kids, so he will just come to the people's houses and ring a bell, and so, \"I'm here.\"Fred: He rings the bell?Anja: That's right.Fred: And he enters from the front door and then gives the gifts...Anja: That's right.Fred: Oh, he doesn't go through the chimney.Anja: No, oh, yeah, that's right. He just enters the door like, the parents open the door, like, \"Please come in\" and the kids are usually hiding because they are really scared of Santa Claus. Oh, and one more thing, it's quite different, but like the Santa Claus, it's kind of a scary person because if you're actually bad, it's not only that you won't get presents, but he will also put you in a bag and take you away to the forest. Fred: Santa Claus will put the in kids the bag?Anja: Yes.Fred: And then take them away?Anja: Yes, if you were a bad boy or a bad girl he will do that.Fred: Wow, that is something very different from our tradition in Canada. So who is the person that brings the presents on Christmas day?Anja: Yes, that's a good point. Like we have an angel coming down from the heaven and bringing all the presents, actually, someone during the... at one point during the night.Fred: An angel brings the presents on Christmas day and not Santa Claus, wow!Anja: Yes.Fred: I'm very surprised.Anja: That's right.",

Lindsay: No way!Chris: Yeah.Lindsay: You're getting married?Chris: Yep. I'm actually getting married before you, probably in March.Lindsay: Oh, wow. Have you started planning?Chris: Yes, and it's one of those things that once you start, you just can't stop. There's too many decisions.Lindsay: Yeah, I bet, so do you want to have a big wedding like me or do you want a smaller wedding?Chris: No, we think maybe only fifty people, so we're probably only going to keep it quite small. We might just have it in a restaurant somewhere, and we're kind of planning just to have it in front of people and friends, and just people that we really know.Lindsay: Do you think you'll have it in the daytime or at night?Chris: I think probably in the daytime would be nice because a lot of her family are quite old so we're gonna have to keep it before it gets too dark and they all fall asleep.Lindsay: Are you going to hire a photographer or a band?Chris: We'll definitely have a photographer, but we don't really want a band. We would like it a little bit smaller so maybe just a couple of violin players, or maybe a piano.Lindsay: Oh, that sounds nice. And then are you going to hire a florist?Chris: Well, actually we don't have to hire a florist because my fiance is a professionally trained horticulturalist and florist herself so she makes wedding bouquets as part of her job. Lindsay: Oh, so she'll make the flowers for your wedding?Chris: She wants to do some of it and also a lot of her friends will be able to chip in and help out as well.Lindsay: Are you going to choose some wedding colors?Chris: Wedding colors? I don't even know what that means.Lindsay: So for my wedding my colors are red and fuchsia because I like bright colors. Are you gonna choose a shade of colors for your flowers to be and what you'll wear?Chris: I guess that's probably a question you wanna ask my fiance. She's more interested in things like that. I'll know when I see the flowers if they're some kind of theme, but we've not talked about that.Lindsay: Well, one question that I have that I'm confused about: are you going to get someone to video tape it or do you think that it's just enough to have the photographer?Chris: Actually, that's not something that we talked about, but I've been to weddings before where they've had it with someone video taping it, and it always seems a little bit too intrusive. Like someone was having to come up and they're saying, \"Oh, do you want to have a message? Do you want to give a message?\" and suddenly you're on the spot and you don't know what to say, so I think it'll be enough for the photographer and also, we'll have our memories as well so we don't need the video.Lindsay: Right. That's good. Good idea. I do think that afterwards it might be nice to show my kids when they grow up, \"This is when mommy and daddy got married\" on the video camera, but I'm still grappling with that idea if I want to video, someone to video it or not.Chris: Well, I always worry that something embarrassing might happen and then forever that's gonna be up on Youtube or something like that.Lindsay: That's true. That could happen.Chris: If we keep it to photographs, we can just delete it or kind of get rid of that film so, I don't know. We'll talk about that beforehand, but I'm really excited about it.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Hey Jenn, how are you today?\n                              Jen: Hi Todd, I'm fine thank you. How are you?\nTodd: I am doing pretty good. It's kind of getting colder, so I like that, I don't like super hot weather. \nJen: Really, it's kind of opposite for me because I really hate that it's getting colder day by day. \nTodd: Oh you don't like the cooler weather?\nJen: No, my fingers start swelling and it's really tough because you cannot really go outside. You just want to stay in your bed all day, you become very unproductive I guess. \nTodd: Yeah, I guess I can kind of ... Yeah, I know what you mean by that. But, at least in the winter, at least in the fall you can wear warmer clothes so I enjoy that. Although I don't like having to do so much laundry because you wear so many more clothes. In summer, it's just so easy to do your laundry I think. \nJen: Yeah, you're talking about warmer clothes. But the thing is, if it was summer you wouldn't really feel like wearing any warm clothes at all because that would be unnecessary. That's why I would rather go for summer than winter. \nTodd: Well I know, but what I'm saying is that in the summer you don't have to wear so many clothes. You just have a tee shirt, shorts, that's about it, pants. \nJen: Yeah, and your laundry problem would also not exist. \nTodd: Exactly. Although, I don't have that many clothes anyway. I have the same three pairs of pants that I wear, so that's the benefit of being much older. How about you, do you have lots of clothes?\nJen: Yeah, but I think even if I was older I would still have a lot of clothes. Maybe it has to do with me always shopping all the time. \nTodd: Actually, what do you do with your clothes for the season? Do you pack away your clothes for the season? Do you pack away your winter clothes or your summer clothes?\nJen: Yes, actually during winter I pack all my summer clothes and tuck it away somewhere. And during summer, I do the opposite yeah. \nTodd: Yeah, I now am regretting it so much because in the summer it was so hot this summer and I had these big sweatpants and sweaters and they were taking up space in my closet and I just threw them away. And I knew winter was coming and I would regret it, and now I regret it because I have to go buy all new sweatshirts. \nJen: Why would you do that?\nTodd: I just hate clutter and yeah, it was really short sighted wasn't it?\nJen: Yeah, it was. I'm so sorry, but yeah I'm being blunt but you should have just packed it and put it somewhere you couldn't see so it didn't bother you that much. \nTodd: I know. About clothing, how often do you keep clothes? So, you're young but you've reached, you're not going to grow too much anymore, right? You can keep your clothes a long time. Unlike me, unless I get fatter, I'm not going to grow any taller because I'm so much older. I keep my clothes sometimes for like ten years. \nJen: Ten years?\nTodd: Yeah. What about your parents? I bet your dad has shirts and pants that he's had for ten years. \nJen: Yeah, that's true actually my dad does use old clothes. But sometimes I also use his clothes because I think it's kind of cool. \nTodd: It is cool. \nJen: It's like recycling. \nTodd: That's sweet, like so what is a piece of clothing that your dad has that you wear sometimes?\nJen: Actually the jacket that I was wearing yesterday, I got it from my dad and I wear it so much because I love it. \nTodd: But so , it's a woman's jacket?\nJen: No, it's a guy's jacket but I wear it. \nTodd: Oh really, it was his jacket?\nJen: Yes. \nTodd: Oh really? Okay, that is cool. \nJen: And I miss him a lot so that just reminds me of him and that's why I like to wear it a lot. \nTodd: That's really nice. How about your mom, do you share clothes with your mother?\nJen: I'm very thin and she's not so thin, so we cannot share the same clothes. \nTodd: Yeah. My stepfather and I used to always be the same size, and now I'm a little bit bigger than him. And he says that his pants are only 34 inches, which is quite small in America, and I'm like there's no way. It looks like we're the same size, but we're not I guess. \nJen: I mean I could wear my moms clothes, like I did my dad's, because, but then you cannot really do that because if you wear your mom's clothes it will just look like you borrowed clothes from someone. But if you wear your dad's clothes it will look cooler I guess. \nTodd: Right, yeah. I know what you mean. That's cool, how about your friends, do you share clothes with your friends?\nJen: No, not with my friends but with my cousins, sisters, yeah. \nTodd: Oh really, oh nice.",

We're going to see lions and tigers and bears.Lindsay: Oh, my? Actually, I don't really like the zoo.Jake: Why not. I thought everyone liked the zoo.Lindsay: I don't think it's natural for the animals to be in a cage.Jake: Yeah, I can see your point but on the other hand, zoos often rescue the animals in the wild that couldn't survive on their own, and I hear that zoos often take very good care of the animals and they have an even longer life expectancy than they would have in the wild.Lindsay: Yeah, I agree with you. I think the animals do live longer in the zoo, but my problem is more the fact that it's just not natural. For example, I once saw a polar bear in California. A polar bear should not be in a warm climate. It should be in a cold climate where there's snow.Jake: OK, you got me there.Lindsay: Yes, I think I did. But I understand your point that zoos could be good, especially for the animals and the fact that they rescue the animals. I mean, that's nice. But, I think that you know, animals should die in the wild.Jake: Well, I think it's better that they're alive so that people can enjoy them.Lindsay: So you think the purpose of animals is for them to be enjoyed?Jake: No, no, but it's really interesting for us to be able to learn about the animals and see them in person instead of just on TV.Lindsay: I guess I agree with you, but I don't know, I don't really think the purpose of the animals are for our pleasure. I think animals should be out in the wild living freely.Jake: OK, are you opposed to circuses too?Lindsay: Oh, absolutely. I think they're very cruel to animals. Animals should not be there performing and living in close quarters and not being able to move around freely.Jake: Well, I can see your point but I still think zoos and circuses are a lot of fun and I like to go to them a lot.Lindsay: OK, I guess we'll just have to disagree a lot of this one.

        "transcript": "Todd: Jeff, I thought we would talk about healthy lifestyles. Now, you are one of the healthiest people I know. You are very lean. You are very fit, so what is it that keeps you healthy? Jeff: Many things, but I think discipline is one of the most important things. You need to be a disciplined person. A little-bit disciplined person, but saying that, it's not hard to be disciplined because you do things that you like to do, for example I do yoga, and I enjoy yoga so every day I get up in the morning and I do an hour of yoga and this is very good for your body. It's easy to do because I do it in my house, so I don't have to pay expensive gym fees and I don't have to get on a bus and travel thirty minutes to a gymnasium or a fitness center. I can do it right in my house, the front room of my house on a little mat, and I also get up with my girlfriend every morning a five a.m. and we go for a walk for an hour, a nice brisk walk and that's easy to do as well. Just a pair of sneakers and you can walk anywhere.Todd: And now you actually live in a city area, correct?Jeff: Yeah, I live in the city. Yep, in Tokyo, a big, big city, so when I say you've got to be disciplined, you can't use that an excuse. \"Oh, I live in the city so I can't walk.\" It's not true. We walk every day in the world's biggest city, Tokyo.Todd: Well, so basically, one of the pillars of your way of staying healthy is to have discipline to exercise regularly but it doesn't have to be strenuous, just little things.Jeff: A little bit of exercise every day. Something simple. Something easy. Something you like to do, whether it's walking or whether it's riding your bicycle to work instead of taking the subway, or yeah, doing some yoga. Just a little bit of exercise a few days a week and it will help you stay fit and healthy.",

How bout you?\nMichael: Oh, I liked it as well, and I read the book when I was in high school. I like the movies a lot but it still doesn't compare to the first time reading the book. The book was fantastic but of all the adaptations of that book this movie is probably the one, or those three movies are probably the one that I enjoyed the most. \nSimon: Yeah! That's true! A lot of adaptions are really quite terrible aren't they?\nMichael: Which of the three did you like the most?\nSimon: I liked the first one. The first one. It has story and it had, you know, what-will-happen-next anticipation and yeah, but all three were good. \nMichael: Well, it's interesting, you're favorite is a trilogy, and my favorite is a trilogy too, and that's the Godfather trilogy, and my favorite is the second one.\nSimon: Oh, you like the second one. That's surprising! Most people like the first one the best. \nMichael: I like the first one a lot but I like the second one because DeNiro is in it and I like the story of Don Corleone in Sicily as well. \nSimon: Ah, yeah, flashbacks!\nMichael: Yeah, and I think that the real conflict in the story comes out in the second one. More so than in the first. I see the Godfather trilogy to be very similar to a Shakespearean kind of trilogy, tragic, I think that Michael Corleone is a tragic hero and I like Shakespearean trilogies to so perhaps that's why I like it. \nSimon: Oh, that's a really good explanation.",

When I first started I did an introductory course which was just maybe like two days. \nAnd so they just sent you out with all of the equipment, put you in the sea and guided you, but then when I did the real course we started in the swimming pool which was fine and it was all great fun. \nAlthough, there were two men on my course who completely freaked out and had to leave. \nTodd: Oh..\nNicola: Yeah, so that was fine but then they took us out to sea which was a bit different. Yeah,  they made us set up our own equipment, I mean they still checked us and everything so we didn't die but we had to put on our own equipment. We had a diving buddy who I was with and I was with my friend Graham, who I was traveling with anyway and we went down into the sea. We went down maybe fifteen meters. And they always say like 'Don't Panic' just keep breathing normally and everything. But I did kind of panic a bit.\nTodd: Oh, no!\nNicola: So then I rose to the surface really quickly which you know, you're not supposed to do in diving. So I went up really quickly. Luckily we weren't deep enough to do any damage but my diving buddy Graham was having a great time down there looking at shipwrecks and didn't even notice that I was missing.\nTodd: What a terrible guy.\nNicola: Yeah, I know. so, then...\nTodd: Wow! Did they fail him? I hope he failed the course?\nNicola: No, he passed. He paid enough money. He passed. But it meant that I couldn't go diving for the rest of the day cause I had gone down quite deep so that was a shame, but..\nTodd: That's terrible. But you didn't hurt yourself, you didn't come up too fast?\nNicola: No, I was fine in the end but it was a shame because that was the end of my diving day. But we had a few more days to do it. \nTodd: So now you are comfortable diving. You don't freak out anymore?\nNicola: I don't freak out anymore but I couldn't go diving now on my own because it has been so long. Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Okay Monica, we're going to debate winning and sports, especially for young people. So do you think that winning should be stressed with sports, with, let's say high school athletes?\nMonica: Well, it depends on the situation and what they're training for, but generally I think that winning is overemphasized in sport. I think that participation is more important. Yeah.\nTodd: Why would you say that?Monica: Well, I think if you concentrate too much on winning, then the problem is, if you don't win, you don't enjoy the sport, so the emphasis is shifted from enjoyment to basically results, so I think it can be quite damaging.Todd: Right. I kind of agree with what you're saying. And actually, I played high school sports, and I was never very good. And I always wish I participated more than I did, but I actually think that the focus on winning in some ways is quite important, and that it does serve a good purpose to have a focus on winning rather than on participation.I think the main reason is because when you focus on winning, that drives everybody to be better. So if you want to win, if you want to be on the team, etc., you have to force yourself to be better, and it's the carrot on the end of the stick. And it makes people train harder, work harder, it sets a goal for them, and it kind of prepares them for life that sometimes you fail, and sometimes you don't get what you want. And so that's why sports and the whole focus on winning is good because it's exactly how life is in the real world.Monica: I would tend to argue the other way and say that actually sport doesn't reflect life in terms of winning and losing. I mean, let's take a work situation. It's not about winning or losing, it's about cooperating with people that you work with, and so, if you have had an upbringing where you've been in a sports team that has been overly competitive, you could transfer that competitiveness into a workplace and it can be counterproductive because it may mean that you... you're just not very good at being a team player in a work environment.Todd: That's actually a really good point. But you can also argue that actually, you know, even a work environment is like sport in that you have teamwork, and you have to work together, and if you don't work together in a very productive way, maybe you'll be out of a job, or your company won't be productive, so you need to have that instinct to continually drive to be better; to be better than other people. And it sounds really brutal, but I think that's just how business works.Monica: Well you're talking about work being business, but I mean, I'm a teacher, and... it brings me to quite an interesting discussion that's taking place now in teaching, which is two different, kind of political views really, in terms of teachers because people want high standards in terms of their teachers. And one idea is to rate teachers in comparison to other teachers, and basically give the top teachers incentives so that they get paid more than teachers who aren't as good as them. But the counter-argument to that is that it creates a really hostile environment in the workplace, and in a school where you really need teachers to work together, I'm not sure that that's the best way to go.Todd: Yeah, well that's another debate for another day.Monica: Is that a cop out or what?",

And next step is \"If you are free\" oh, you always have to check if she's either married, or if she's a lesbian, or if she is single.George: OK.Crystal: So, number three is what you're looking for.George: OK, number three.Crystal: So, if she is single, just say, hey, how about we go out for a cup of coffee or something.George: OK, coffee.Crystal: And, yeah, that's how you get her.George: So, yeah, what if she doesn't like coffee though? I mean, what else could we do we on a date? Assuming she will say yes. What's fun to do on a date anyway?Crystal: Fun to do on a date! It's just the fact that you're being with her and just try to get to know her more.George: Wait, wait, wait one second. Do I need to pay for this?Crystal: I don't think you should pay on the first date. I think sometimes that can be offensive to women.George: Oh, that's great because I'm totally broke.Crystal: I think you should just ask her casually, not like a date-date, just say, \"Hey, I would like to know you a little bit more, and just go out for a small little drink, like go to that new cafe that's open, like a lot of girls think that place is so cute. I think you should take her there.George: But I think cafe's are boring.Crystal: Cafe's are boring. Men! Women don't think so. This is the point. Write it down.",

        "transcript": "Gyri: What are some talents you\n                wish you had?\n                    Viyasan: I would say this talent\n                      spreads a long time back and it's always something\n                      I'm very envious about. I don't have the best memory and so I\n                      really wish that my talent was to remember a lot\n                      easier or even have photographic\n                        memory. I think that would be very\n                      useful, especially as a student during exams where\n                      we're able to read quite a bit and remember all of\n                      it. I think that talent would be interesting to\n                      have because I wouldn't always be forgetting daily\n                      things, like my keys to my apartment. \nGyri: Right. \nViyasan: Or for example, my\n                      water bottle every single time I leave for class.\n                      I think memory is very important and it's very\n                      good to remember certain conversations with\n                      people. For example, sometimes I might have a\n                      conversation with someone and completely forget\n                      that I talked about that topic and then just be\n                      reminded of it when I talk to that person the next\n                      time. \nGyri: Yeah. \nViyasan: I think having a better\n                      memory or photographic memory would be great for\n                      those situations. \nGyri: Yeah, definitely. \nViyasan: And yourself? What are\n                      some talents that you wish you had? \nGyri: I wish that I could dance.\n                      I have no rhythm at all. \nViyasan: Yeah. \nGyri: I feel so stupid when like\n                      if we go out or we listen to music, I just look\n                      really goofy when\n                      I try to dance, but I feel like dancing so I still\n                      try, but it just looks horrible. Yeah, I wish I\n                      had more rhythm and the ability to learn dance\n                      moves, I guess. \nViyasan: Yeah, I would say that\n                      dancing is definitely a talent that some people\n                      have. Likewise, I do not have any rhythm so I'll\n                      join you on that same dance floor. \nGyri: Yeah. \nViyasan: Even though I like to\n                      dance, I don't dance very well. \nGyri: Yeah. Yeah, I wish that I\n                      was better at sports as well. I really like\n                      downhill skiing, for example, but I never skied a\n                      lot, like my dad, he skied professionally when he\n                      was young, and I'm kind of bitter that he didn't\n                      take me up to the hills more than he did because\n                      if I had started at a young age I could be really\n                      good right now, but I didn't, so I'm a casual\n                      skier but I really wish that I could be like\n                      better than average in something, especially a\n                      sport. \nViyasan: Got it, got it. \nGyri: Do you play any sports\n                      besides basketball? \nViyasan: Basketball is my main\n                      sport. I used to play a little bit of volleyball\n                      when I was in high school and so I played the\n                      position of setter and so that was very fun. It\n                      took a lot of accuracy. I think if I had to be a\n                      little bit more talented, it would be at jumping\n                      because if I was able to jump a lot more, I would\n                      be able to fake my sets and just hit the ball down\n                      on the opponent's\n                      side. That would be a cool talent to have if I was\n                      able to jump maybe five to ten more inches higher\n                      than I usually did. I still remember that my\n                      vertical was 26 inches when I was in grade nine or\n                      grade ten and so maybe if I added a couple more\n                      inches onto that I would've been able to perform\n                      in more creative ways. \nGyri: Yeah. \nViyasan: Yeah. \nGyri: Can you dunk a basketball? \nViyasan: That depends on how\n                      high the rim is. If it's five feet or six feet,\n                      definitely, but on a standard regulation net,\n                      which is probably nine or 9.5 feet, I cannot. \nGyri: Okay. \nViyasan: But maybe if I had the\n                      talent of jumping extremely high, I would be able\n                      to dunk a basketball but no. \nGyri: Can you dribble with your\n                      left hand? \nViyasan: Of course. I can dribble with my let\n                      hand, I can dribble with my right hand, I can\n                      dribble between my legs. I've done a lot of\n                      different types of basketball drills when I was on\n                      the high school team and so yeah, I'm pretty good\n                      at handling the basketball. Shooting, driving to\n                      the net, and passing it a lot quite a bit, so\n                      yeah, pretty efficient with the basketball. \nGyri: Yeah, that's impressive. \nViyasan: I just can't dunk. \nGyri: Okay, yeah. Can you shoot\n                      with your left hand? \nViyasan: Mm, no, I cannot. I\n                      can't shoot with my left hand. I can do a lay up\n                      with my left hand, but I can't shoot the ball\n                      naturally like a free throw or three point shot\n                      with my left hand. \nGyri: Okay. What exactly is a\n                      lay up? \nViyasan: A lay up is when you\n                      drive towards the net, you're allowed to take two\n                      steps while holding the basketball and so that's\n                      usually how people when they're very close to the\n                      net, they do a lay up or they're also able to\n                      convert a lay up into a dunk so they're able to\n                      take two steps and dunk towards the basketball\n                      net. \nGyri: Okay. \nViyasan: Yeah, that's a little\n                      bit of basketball knowledge for you. \nGyri: Yeah, got it.",

Anja: Oh, yeah, you know Fred, I think it depends on the person, right? But usually in Switzerland people like to give gifts that have, like, some personal meaning, you know? It doesn't really matter how much they cost, you know, maybe if you buy a really expensive present, you feel a little bit like, \"Ah, this is too expensive,\" you know? So it's really nice to give maybe a picture in a frame or something like that. Mothers like that a lot.Fred: Yeah, I think gifts to mothers are really important. So, how much money would you say you spend on your gifts in general for Christmas?Anja: Oh, I'm sure it's maybe like 200 Swiss Francs. It's maybe like a 100 US dollars.Fred: 100 US dollars. Anja: Yes, but I really think it depends on the person, you know. But one thing that I really dislike about Christmas is the shopping, you know.Fred: You dislike the shopping?Anja: Yes. I love shopping, you know, but usually, but during Christmas I really don't like it because I always tell myself, I will start in November because no one will go shopping in November for Christmas presents.Fred: I see.Anja: But usually I end up going shopping on the 24th of December.Fred: The 24th of December! That's a bit late, isn't it?Anja: It is. That's why it's such a hassle. Yes, indeed. One thing that is interesting in Switzerland maybe is at one point you kind of, you don't receive presents anymore from your family members, like when you are a kid, you know.Fred: Really, your grandparents and your parents don't give you gifts anymore.Anja: Yeah, not really, you know, because you start being a grown-up, you know, and you know, it costs a lot of money. They bought you so much during your childhood, so maybe when you turn 18, 19, 20, they're like, \"Ah, it's OK\" you know. You don't expect a present anymore. That's one thing in Switzerland.",

        "transcript": "Mike: Hey, Mari. So, we're comparing places this week and you've lived in two great cities: Tokyo and New York and you speak both English and Japanese so you must know them very well, so can you tell me about the people in the places? Mari: In New York City, the people are friendly. If you're lost in the subway or you're not sure which bus to take, if you ask someone, even though they look pretty busy or absorbed they'll be willing to tell you which way you are supposed to go, and they'll be very blunt and tell you if they don't know which one you're supposed to take. When you go into the stores, the people in the stores are... they like to make small talk with you. They're interested in you as a person in terms of where you're from or you know, what you are looking for that day and why you are looking for that item. I think in Tokyo, if you are in the subway station, or the train station, the JR people or the subway people are very helpful in terms of which subway you're supposed to go on, or to help you get to that destination, but when you go into the stores, the clerks are very helpful in terms of finding whatever you're looking for, but I think because of the culture, they're not... they don't delve into your personal life as much as the shop attendants in New York.Mike: So in terms of food, how does it differ between New York and Tokyo?Mari: I think New York and Tokyo both have very international foods. In both cities, you can find foods from all over the world. I think that because New York City is a city of immigrants, you get very... the people who cook the foods are from that country, while in Japan I feel like if you go to a Mexican restaurant and you see like a Japanese person cooking the Mexican food, so I think that the cuisine, the international cuisine in New York City is more real versus the one in Japan.Mike: So, if you had to eat one thing in New York and one thing in Tokyo, what would it be?Mari: Oh, my gosh, that's a very difficult question. In New York City I would eat pizza. I think that they have the best pizza in the world. If you like greasy, cheesy pizza. In Japan, I really like the Italian food in Japan. I know that it's not very authentic Italian food but I think they do a really good job with Italian food here.Mike: Oh, that's interesting. So, in terms of shopping, where would you like to shop more?Mari: I feel like I'm going to be biased towards New York City but I think that the shopping in New York City is a lot better. The primary reason being that it's just cheaper.",

So how did you do it?\n\nAl: I just, I went out and I had the best New Year's Eve I've ever had in my life, where I went to a music party, a club, and I smoked and drank as much as I wanted for about 12 hours. I finally left at 9 in the morning on New Year's Day, my lungs dry and and then decided I'm never going to do this and stopped.\nTodd: Wow, I mean, you must have had, you know, addictions, you must have wanted to have a cigarette a couple days later.\n\nAl:You know, I've stopped smoking several times and had very bad cravings before, and this time it was, a couple of times I felt like I might like one, but no, I didn't have any nicotine cravings. I was ready this time I think.\n\nTodd:So you just think where your body reaches a point where you can take no more.\n\nAl: Yeah definitely, and your mind reaches a point where you're sickened by your own disgusting behavior\nTodd: Right, so what do you think about smoking now?\n\nAl: I hate it. I'm completely, I'm totally anti-smoking, and I used to be very liberal about people's rights to smoke and now I think it should be completely . It should be illegal to buy tobacco.\n\nTodd: Wow, they should just make it illegal.\n\nAl: Make it illegal. It kills people.\nTodd: So what is your message to smoker? If someone out there is smoking today, they're a smoker, they want to quit, what's your message to them?\n\nAl:I read a really good, I'm reading a really cool book at the moment about therapy and in one of these stories in this book one guy says, imagine you have a pet dog, and you love this pet dog, and the pet dog is you body, now would you give poisoned, say you went to the pet store and you saw these cans of dog food with a poison mark on them, poisoned flavored dog food containing poison, would you buy that poison dog food and feed it to your dog? No, you wouldn't. That's exactly what you're doing to your body when you smoke. You're deliberately poisoning yourself so stop it.\n\nTodd: Well, good message and so for all of you people out there who are smoking, STOP!",

Fred: Well, Anja, the routine in Canada for Christmas is quite simple. The kids get very excited on the 25th because early in the morning, at around seven o'clock, that's when we open the gifts.Anja: Oh, you open the gifts in the morning?Fred: That's right.Anja: Oh, wow.Fred: At around seven o'clock in the morning, we... well, as I kid I remember being so unbelievably excited, so at night, I don't think I could sleep. I was too excited about waking up early in the morning and then opening my gifts. So what we do is that the parents put the gifts under the Christmas tree, and then early on the 25th, in the morning we all gather around the Christmas tree and then, one-by-one, we open the gifts.Anja: So you open the gifts in your pajamas, and then you...Fred: That's right. But that's not the most exciting part of the day.Anja: Oh, it's not? What is then?Fred: No, the food is.Anja: The food.Fred: The food is the most exciting part of the day. Well, in Canada we eat lots of, as you may know, we have maple syrup.Anja: Oh, yes, that's right. You are really famous for that, right?Fred: For maple syrup. Maple syrup is something that Canadian people love eating during the Christmas holidays and so all of the time through the week of the 25th until New Year's Eve, the first of January, we cook many kind of different dishes and we just put maple syrup on it.Anja: Oh, really. For instance, what do you eat? Is there some traditional food you have for Christmas in Canada?Fred: Of course. We have traditional food. As you may know, pancakes.Anja: Of course.Fred: Yes.Anja: I love my pancakes.Fred: You do, you do, yeah. Yeah, I love pancakes, too. We put maple syrup on it. Oh, it's so good, you know, and you know what else is really good?Anja: What is?Fred: We fry pig's ears.Anja: Oh my god, you do?Fred: Yeah, it's delicious, and the tongue of the pig as well. We fry it. And then we put maple syrup on it.Anja: Oh, wow, I didn't know that. That's quite interesting.Fred: Yeah, it's delicious. You should try it one day.Anja: Oh, I will definitely.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Lois have you ever been to a professional football match in England? \n\t\t\t            Lois: Yes, I have. I support a team called Leicester city, and when I used to be at university I used to live in Leicester. I used to go to quite a few of their matches. \n\t\t\t            Todd: OK, so what's it like when you go to a professional game?\n\t\t                Lois: So first of all, the fans are all separated, because in England there's sometimes violence at football, so they like to keep the fans away from each other, and there's always a lot of police there, but I've never been at a match where there's been any trouble, so that's been OK. Um, the atmosphere is normally amazing because the smallest grounds hold about 20,000 people, so you get quite a good crowd, and because their stadiums are quite small, you're quite close to the pitch, so my team weren't very good though, so often my team would lose, so it wasn't so good, but when they one it was fantastic. Really, really good atmosphere and lots of fun. \n\t\t                Todd: That's cool. So how much does it cost to get it?\n\t                    Lois: See again, it's quite expensive so maybe now for the lower teams it probably, cheapest ticket is 25 pounds, but for example if you wanted to go and see Manchester United play, play then maybe 50 pounds or more, but it's really really difficult to get tickets for Manchester United because everybody has a season ticket, so if you want to go and watch them you have to know somebody who can get you a ticket. It's difficult to just buy a ticket for those games. \n\t                    Todd: Do you like Manchester United?\n                        Lois: I think there a good team. I think that the reason a lot of people don't like them is because they used to win all the time, so now they don't win so much, because now Arsenal win most of the time. So I think they're a good team, but I don't think you can like them if you're not from Manchester. \n                        Todd: So Leicester is a very hard word to spell. I take it it's not L-E-S-T-E-R, no?\n                        Lois: No. If you were an American you would probably pronounce it Lie-Se-Ster, so it's spelled L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R.\n                        Todd: Well, again! One more time!\n                        Lois: L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R\n                        Todd: Wow, that's quite a handful. Alright, thanks, Lois.",

We have our fish, our meat, our wines, our fruits, our veggies, we eat all kinds of food.\nAde: Yeah, I know.  But I mean what is popular about Belgium food?\nChris: Well if you talk about gastronomy, it’s a bit different in Belgium as I think it is in Spain.  I mean in Belgium we really enjoy the tables.  We don’t go out for dinner that often but when we go out we stay on a table for four hours.  I mean it starts with little entrants, then it’s maybe a soup, then it’s the main dish, then it’s still an ice-cream or something.  I mean it takes long so we really enjoy [0:01:00.4] and it goes slow.  For example, at Christmas, for Christmas we meet at maybe 5:30, 6 o’clock and then we start already with aperitifs and it goes all night long, I think we eat from 6 o’clock in the afternoon till 12 o’clock at night.\nAde: Wow!  So you must be fat people there in Belgium if you eat that much.\nChris: Well that’s why I just said, we don’t do it that often, but if we do it we really enjoy it and then of course next day or next few days you see people just don’t eat anything.",

There's many different people in Dublin, different types of people.\n\t\t\t             I do not think that Dublin has the mental stimuli, or does not have the hardcore atmosphere that somewhere like Tokyo could possibly have, so you have many types of people who are happy living in Dublin, going to the same places, the same bars, same restaurants, yet I feel that Tokyo has a lot more to offer because it's more hardcore. \n\t\t                There's so much stuff to do. Simple things like Karaoke, non-drink related activites that you can do over here which is great, so I wanted to get away from Ireland.

        "transcript": "Todd: Jen, we're talking about gifts. We were talking about giving gifts before. Now let's talk about receiving gifts. What is the best and worst gift you have received?\nJen: Why don't you go first.\nTodd: Sure. Mine is easy. My step-father made a basketball hoop for me in our driveway. He made it for my birthday. It was pretty cool because, he put it up in one day. I had a car at that time, so I would have seen him making it, but I just came home one day, and there was a big basketball hoop with a big bow around it. It was on my birthday, and it was great. I used it every day and I had nieces and nephews. They used it. I had all my friends in the neighborhood come over. We had basketball tournaments. It was a really good gift.\nJen: That's really cool. It's so nice of him that he would go through all that, and give you such a special gift. \nTodd: Yeah. The funny thing about it is, I think he really regretted it because, he wasn't thinking how loud a basketball would be when you bounce it. So when you would bounce the basketball, it made this really loud noise, echoing sound down the street. My dad was great. He was really cool.\nJen: That's really nice.\nTodd: Yeah. It was nice. So how about you? Do you have a really special gift?\nJen: For me, my special gift would be, my mom once made a suit. A pair of socks for me. They were really cute with little flowers on the right side of the socks. I would wear them every day when I was a kid. I though that was really special. I still have them in my bag.\nTodd: Oh really? Wow.\nJen: Yeah. Winter is coming. I'm going to use it again.\nTodd: Socks wear out pretty easily. You've really kept them in good condition.\nJen: Yeah. She probably used really good wool because, it's still there, and I still wear it a lot.\nTodd: That's great. What about a bad gift? Or a gift that you were not so crazy about.\nJen: I don't know if it's okay to say I have a bad gift or something. But, yeah, once I did get a very big teddy bear from a friend who loved toys, by the way. She thought that I would love it as much as she did. She gave me this big toy, and I didn't know what to do with it. I was so embarrassed by it that I would actually hide it in my closet so that other friends cannot see it. Yeah. Every time she came to my house I would take it out and put it on my bed, but I hated that teddy.\nTodd: Oh no. Wow.\nJen: What about your worst gift?\nTodd: Yeah. For me, a very close person to me, a good friend, bought me a shirt. It was lime green. It was so ugly. The texture also was really kind of rough. It had this ribbed texture. I knew the minute I saw it I would never wear it, ever. I felt bad because, this person would come over to my house, and you could see where I kept my clothes in my closet. It was a very small room. That lime green shirt was just always there.\nJen: That's so funny. What did you do with it? Did you wear it?\nTodd: I was thinking of a million ways to get rid of it. I would wear it occasionally, if I knew my friend was going to come around and I wasn't going outside. I knew I had to wear it one or two times. Then, I used it to mop up some coffee once, and then I threw it out.\nJen: What?\nTodd: I know. \nJen: That's so crazy.\nTodd: I know. But, it wasn't quite so bad because, there was actually two shirts. My friend bought the shirts, two for one, I guess. I still have the white shirt. But the lime green one, I got rid of. Yeah.\nJen: You know what? You could have actually worn it during winter and put on a sweater on top of it, and then a coat or something. You didn't really have to do that. That's kind of mean.\nTodd: It is actually. It is mean. I don't know why, but for some reason, I really did not like the color. I just don't like lime green. I don't like neon colors, and I would see that bright, neon color all the time. \nJen: I understand what you feel, but I do feel bad for your friend, though.\nTodd: I know. So am I a bad person?\nJen: I don't know.\nTodd: No comment?\nJen: No, you're not a bad person. Everyone has some problem with colors and stuff. I guess it's fine.\nTodd: Have you ever had something that just rubbed you the wrong way? For some reason, you look at it and it was an eyesore. You just hated looking at it. Like a piece of clothing, or maybe something in your house.\nJen: Besides that toy I got, which I actually kind of like nowadays just because, it's with me and when I own something, after some time, I end up liking them because, they're mine, you know?\nTodd: Yeah. It grows on you.\nJen: Exactly.\nTodd: Actually, just thinking about that lime shirt, it is growing on me now, and now I really regret it. I with I had kept it.\nJen: Too bad. You already spilled some coffee on it.",

        "transcript": "Presenter 1: Today we are going to talk about names, particularly fashions in names, you know, the kind of names famous people use for their children. You’ve been looking into this recently, haven’t you Finn?\nPresenter 2: I have indeed and it’s a fascinating topic. The US leads here with new names and we in Britain follow sometimes, but we tend to go for the more traditional names. So, the big trend is using nouns as names.\nPresenter 1: Nouns, what sort of nouns?\nPresenter 2: Well they can be abstract qualities like Honor or Passion. There’s a long tradition of this kind of name, like Faith or Charity, which used to be common names. A new name is Haven, that’s growing in popularity. And similar names like Shelter, Harbor and Bay also convey feelings of safety and warmth.\nPresenter 1: Mmm. I suppose Passion is used to mean ‘extreme enthusiasm’ nowadays, and people use the word a lot, so maybe it’s a good choice for a modern name. Haven has a nice, safe feel to it.\nPresenter 2: OK, then there are names which come from nature or animals, although with some of these it’s hard to know whether they come from nature or a surname – that’s another trend. Here we have Frost, Wolf, Fox, Bear, for boys, of course. And a new name: Ridge.\nPresenter 1: Ridge, like a mountain ridge? The top of a mountain range?\nPresenter 2: Yes, weird, huh? It’s seen as a tough, outdoorsy name for a boy. OK, then there are musical names. Harmony and Melody have been around for ages, but Lyric is a new one.\nPresenter 1: Lyric, wow!\nPresenter 2: Yes, it came in at number 325 in the US a couple of years ago. That doesn’t sound very popular, but there are so many different names being used at the moment that it means it isn’t so unusual. Other noun categories are months – May, June and April are common, but January is uncommon and November very unusual. And then you have colours. Beyoncé and Jay-Z called their daughter Blue Ivy – a very distinctive name, a colour plus the name of a plant. Blue is very popular for girls right now, and Red or Grey for boys.\nPresenter 1: I’ve just thought of another category. Food names, like Olive or Clementine.\nPresenter 2: Yes, that’s another one. Flower names are pretty common, but food names are unusual. Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin named their daughter Apple, of course.\nPresenter 1: Yes, poor child.\nPresenter 2: Actually, Apple is becoming more and more popular, although people think that’s because of the technology connection, not the fruit. New names always seem strange at first, but you quickly get used to them, like all the names from places or jobs. Chelsea and Brooklyn seem like normal names now; they were strange when they were first used. Taylor, Mason, Cooper are all first names from jobs.\nPresenter 1: And they are also surnames, I think that’s how they started.\nPresenter 2: You’re probably right there.\nPresenter 1: What about the Beckhams’ daughter, Harper?\nPresenter 2: She was named after Harper Lee, the American novelist who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. That’s another trend, naming children after famous writers, musicians – the British band One Direction have had an effect on names – or fictional characters, like Bella or Edward from the Twilight series, or Hermione from Harry Potter.\nPresenter 1: Sorry, can I just interrupt there. I’ve just has a message passed on by the producer. A listener has just phoned in with a very strange story about a family in Holland with six children. Their names are all anagrams of the letters: A, E, L and X.\nPresenter 2: Ah yes, I’ve heard about this. This family are famous in the world of bloggers on names. Let me see if I remember the names … Alex and Axel … and Lexa – they’re the easy ones – Xela ('Zela') and Xael ('Zay-el') and the last one is Xeal ('Zeal') – I’m guessing about the pronunciations, by the way.\nPresenter 1: You mean there are names X-E-L-A and X-A-E-L?\nPresenter 2: Yes, but they are very unusual. I think the Dutch family are stopping at six children, but there are about eighteen more possible anagrams they could use.\nPresenter 1: Nooo, you’re kidding!\nPresenter 2: All seem horrible to me, but all are possible names. This is similar to another trend of giving children names all starting with the same letter, like the Kardashian family, all beginning with K, Kim, Kourtney and so on.\nPresenter 1: The Kardashians have had enough publicity, let’s not talk about them. What about your name? Finn, that sounds like a good Irish name …",

Ok, the first one: coffee, tea or water in the morning?Eucharia: Water.Todd: Water!Eucharia: Yeah, when I wake up I usually have 2 glasses of water and then at the moment I’m trying not to drink coffee and not to drink caffeine so at the moment it’s water but if I were given a choice normally it would be coffee.Todd: Ok how about at night time. You’re at a party, which would you rather have: beer, wine or a cocktail?Eucharia: It depends on the party. If I’m going dancing, cocktail. If I’m going out eating, wine and if it’s just friends getting together, beer.Todd: You’re on an aeroplane and you’re flying across the ocean. What would you prefer to read: newspaper, a magazine or a book?Eucharia: A book, definitely.Todd: A book, why a book? That was a very strong answer!Eucharia: I love reading. I have to read every night before I go to sleep for maybe 30 minutes so I really enjoy reading and I find that I emotionally engage with the book and what’s happening in the book and I forget the fact that I’m on a 12 hour inter-continent flight.Todd: Ok you have to choose between 3 seasons: summer, fall or winter.Eucharia: Summer.Todd: Summer?Eucharia: I love sunshine, I love heat, I can’t stand rain, which is why I don’t live in my home country and I don’t like snow.Todd: Ok I’m with you on that. Ok next one. To pass the time at night you can watch TV, you can check the internet or you can watch a movie, a dvd. What would you prefer?Eucharia: Probably watching a dvd because, yeah if I’m on the internet I’m on the internet at work and so I don’t want to go on the internet late at night because I start thinking too much and I can’t sleep.Todd: Ok last one. You’re at the beach. Would you prefer to: play a sport on the beach, on the sand; go in the water and swim or surf; or lie on the beach and get a tan?Eucharia: Lie on the beach and get a tan! Yep, I’m from a country we don’t see a lot of sunshine so I still get very excited when I see sunshine. Maybe I’ll go to the beach and maybe I’ll go to the water and swim a bit but my favourite thing is to lie on the beach and get a tan.Todd: Thanks Eucharia.Eucharia: You’re welcome.",

Do you prefer working in a group or do you prefer working alone? \nJeff: That's a tough question. \nTim:  It definitely is because there is good things about both.\nJeff: That's right. That's right, so I guess I'm good at working by myself because I am self-motivated so if I am doing something I like and I can get it done quickly I like to do it by myself, but if I'm working with a good team, a fun team, people who work hard and they all want to do a good job and get the job done well, then I think a team is fun, but you need guys, you need people, men and women, who work hard to do a good job so I prefer working in a team. \nTim: Yeah, well, that's understandable. How about, do you prefer working and having a uniform or do you prefer putting on whatever you want to put on? \nJeff: I think uniforms are pretty cool \nTim:  Oh, really. \nJeff:  I think if you have a uniform too, sometimes you get respect. If you are are fireman or a policeman, you tend to get a bit of respect from the public but I wouldn't want a cheesy uniform with, you know, sort of like a strange hat or a funny looking bowtie. I wouldn't be into that, so. \nTim: Have you had any jobs with uniforms? \nJeff: Any jobs with uniforms? No, I don't think I ever had. If you call a shirt and tie a uniform, then yeah, but no, no funny hats or bow ties or anything. \nTim: So, how about a working schedule? Would you prefer working a flexible schedule with like flex time, or would you prefer set hours: come at this time, finish at this time. \nJeff: Definitely, definitely flex hours. \nTim: Yeah, why is that? \nJeff:  I think that a nine-to-five job is difficult to do. If you want to take some holidays, be with your family, or go on a vacation, or if the surfs up and it's a nice day you can go and just grab your board and go for surf but if you're on a nine-to-five job, you have no flexibility so definitely flex hours. \nTim:  So we are talking a little bit about hours. Do you prefer being paid by the hour or do you prefer a salary? \nJeff:  I think salary maybe is a better way to go because then if take holidays you get paid and if you're working paid by the hour, that style of work, you can't take anytime off because you know when you're not working, you're not getting paid so I think salary is a good way to go but as long as I'm getting paid, I don't really mind which way it is. \nTim: Yeah, that's understandable.",

        "transcript": "Presenter: Next on the programme we have an interview with someone who has been writing a book about high-achieving teenagers. Welcome, Louise Hardy.\nLouise: Hi, it’s lovely to be here.\nPresenter: Louise, many of these teenagers who have achieved success and fame early on, have done so through using new technology, haven’t they? Through blogging or using YouTube or Twitter?\nLouise: Absolutely, and the greatest example of this is Justin Bieber. As I think everyone on the planet knows, he started off by posting videos on YouTube at the age of 14 and was spotted by a talent scout who worked with the R&B singer Usher. After that he very rapidly became a worldwide sensation.\nPresenter: I heard that last year he was said to be more influential than Obama!\nLouise: (laughs) Yes, that was because he is number one on Twitter. He has over 35 million followers. There’s a new one every two seconds. A company that analyses social media called Klout said that he is the most influential person in the world because of that. But whether he’s really more influential than Obama, well …\nPresenter: Mmmm. All this exposure has negative consequences for young people too, doesn’t it?\nLouise: Yes. Although millions adore Justin, a lot of people don’t. One of his videos was the most disliked ever. And he has a big problem with privacy. He’s followed everywhere by the paparazzi, and that’s bad for anyone, never mind a teenager.\nPresenter: OK, let’s turn to a very different teenager. Tavi Gevinson was even younger when she began, wasn’t she?\nLouise: Yes, she was only eleven years old when she started a fashion blog called Style Rookie. By the way, for British listeners, 'Rookie' is an American word used for a person who is new to something.\nPresenter: Thanks.\nLouise: On her blog she posted photos of herself wearing unusual combinations of clothes and wrote about them.\nPresenter: Some of them were quite weird.\nLouise: Well, yes, I suppose a lot of high fashion is weird. Anyway, she quickly built up a huge following, up to 300,000 readers per day, and many of them were adults. Serious fashion magazines interviewed her and sent her to fashion shows in Europe and to meet top designers, like Karl Lagerfeld.\nPresenter: Some people didn’t believe she was as young as she was, did they?\nLouise: No, one magazine printed an article saying the writer didn’t believe Tavi was only 12, and that upset her. But she bounced back and continued blogging. Then, as she grew older, Tavi became interested in other things besides fashion. In 2011, when she was 15, she started Rookie Magazine, an online magazine for teenagers. In less than a week it had one million readers.\nPresenter: I’ve seen it. It’s very impressive, isn’t it? All teenage girls listening, check out Rookie Magazine.\nLouise: Yes, I think it’s fantastic and Lady Gaga called Tavi 'the future of journalism'! She employs about 50 writers and photographers – both adults and teenagers – on Rookie, but she is the editor with overall control.\nPresenter: And all this time she’s continued to lead a normal life, hasn’t she?\nLouise: Oh yes, she lives a very normal life in a small town and goes to school and so on. She’s not even twenty yet. But I think writing and editing are very different from being a performing artist. There’s a lot less pressure from fans and the press. Although some actors, like Emma Watson, seem to manage a private life and getting a normal education.\nPresenter: Yes, Emma Watson is now in her twenties, of course, but …",

And that stresses me out for her safety. \nSo there are times where I wish I could phone her or text her, but she doesn't have a phone. And I do believe that six is far too young to have a phone. \nKatie: A little bit too young. \nAimee: Yes. So purely for security reasons, I think probably around 11 or 12. \nKatie: How old were you when you first got your phone. \nAimee: Well, I'm an old person so, you know, people didn't have mobile phones. I was reaching the end of high school. I was, I think, 17 when I got my first mobile phone. And it was a big brick. But again, that was for, you know, I guess security reasons. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: My parents got it for me. I was going out, you know, I started going out at night, going to concerts. And I was beginning to be allowed going into bars and things at 17, 18. So yeah, it was a good security thing. My parents were appreciative of being able to contact me. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: How about you? How old were you when you first got your mobile phone? \nKatie: Oh goodness. I was about 12 or 13. I was really young. \nAimee: Okay. \nKatie: And I only got my first mobile phone or my first cellphone because my best friend who got the same one and I wanted to send like picture messages to her. It was back in the old days where you can send a photo, you can take photos. \nAimee: Picture messages. \nKatie: Picture messages. \nAimee: I couldn't even send picture messages. Mine was just texts, like pressing the same button over and over again. \nKatie: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So I never really used it as like a way of security. I just used it to send really overpriced picture messages to my friend for absolutely no reason. It was such a waste. And to play Snake. Do you remember Snake?\nAimee: Oh yeah, Snake. \nKatie: Like the little game that you could play on your phone.\nAimee: Yup, yup. \nKatie: Yeah. I didn't use it for a good use, I think. I just used it to waste time.\nAimee: Fair enough. Well, you're 12, you said, right? \nKatie: Twelve, thirteen, yeah. \nAimee: That sounds age appropriate, I think, age appropriate use.\nKatie: Yeah. It's a good time to start wasting your time. \nAimee: Yeah. \nKatie: Get ahead to start wasting time. \nAimee: Yeah. \n[End of Transcript]",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Rebecca, let's talk about things we wish could do that we can't do. What is something you wish you could do, that you can't do now? Rebecca: I think it would be definitely playing music, like playing a guitar. Some of my friends can just pull out a guitar and start singing and then you have everybody around and it's such a great night. I just wish I could join them and actually, yeah, have fun with that as well, but no, I can't play guitar.Todd: So, if you could play any instrument, it would be the guitar?Rebecca: Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I have played piano and saxophone before but not overly that well.Todd: Oh, really so you actually had musical training?Rebecca: Yeah, when I was in high school.Todd: In the piano and the saxophone?Rebecca: Yep. Yeah. The saxophone was maybe for one or two years and I would love to get back into playing that as well, but they're quite expensive little instruments actually.Todd: Yeah. Slightly.Rebecca: And then the piano is very large so, you can't really transport that around with you wherever you go.Todd: So do you think that if had learned music at a younger age, you would still be with it? Was the problem just that you waited to late in life to start?Rebecca: I don't think so. I think it's more the friends circle that I was with. We weren't really a musical group and the people that I've met now are really musical so you sort of wish maybe if I had kept going I could have joined them now, but I do enjoy listening to them.Todd: Well, what about singing? Are you a good singer?Rebecca: No. Not at all. I don't think I want to be a good singer either cause then everybody would expect you to sing all the time so I just do backup vocals. Really badly.Todd: Well, I'm the same way. I can't sing at all. OK, so basically you wish you could play the guitar, but you have played the piano and the saxophone before.Rebecca: Yes.Todd: OK, is there anything else that you wish you could do?Rebecca: To be able to speak maybe a couple languages would be nice.Todd: Yeah, that's a good one. So if you could speak any two languages, what two would you want to speak?Rebecca: I think Japanese and Spanish.Todd: Japanese and Spanish.Rebecca: Yeah. Yeah. They both sound really interesting and they're both the countries that I would like to go and visit and maybe attempt to work there but you need to be able to speak the language before you can work.Todd: Right. That's true. I think if I could choose any two languages I would choose Chinese and Arabic just because both those languages when I hear them they sound so completely impossible to speak, so if you could speak those, that would be pretty amazing.Rebecca: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, Chinese sounds like a hard language.Todd: All those tones.",

        "transcript": "Michael: OK, so then. Hi! I'm Michael. I'm from Toronto.\n\nSimon: Yeah, Hi! I'm Simon from Vancouver.\n\nMichael: Simon!\n\nSimon: That's right!\n\nMichael: So, are you francophone?\n\nSimon: No, I'm not Francophone. That's a common mistake that other Canadians make. My parents were German so they use the German pronunciation of Simon, which is Simon\nMichael: Oh, really\nSimon: Yeah! \n\nMichael: OK, so the German and the French are.\n                                  .\nSimon: Pretty similar. Ah, similar! Ah, yeah, Spanish, French, German. Pretty much only English has the Simon pronunciation of that, that name.\n\nMichael: OK, so you're from Vancouver.\n\n    Simon: Yeah, that's right.\n\nMichael: I'm from Toronto but some of my favorite music came from Vancouver. Ah, I'm not quite sure, you look quite young, you may not have ever seen DOA play.\n\nSimon: I'm very familiar with DOA. Actually, I'm older than I look. I'm 33, so I come from the DOA generation.\n\nMichael: Excellent, so did you go to the Commodore Ballroom?\n\nSimon: That's right, and I've actually seen DOA at the Commodore and almost got hit in the head by a beer can that they throw out during their concerts. They like to throw beer cans into the crowd.\n\nMichael: Well, I saw DOA at the university of Windsor where I went to do my undergraduate degree, and it was one of the best shows I have ever been to. It was great.\n\nSimon: Yeah! I mean when I was in high school, they were already old, so but uh, they kept rocking'.\n\nMichael: So how bout the, do you know, how long have you been in Japan? Do you go back and have you seen\n                                any new bands in Vancouver.\n\nSimon: Ah, well, I've been in Japan just over a year so not that long. I did go back one time but we didn't see any concerts and the commodore has changed since those days of DOA.\n\nMichael: OK, just to show you how out of it I've become, but I've just recently discovered Nickel Back which is from Vancouver as well and also a band that I don't think die hard DOA fans would like cause it's pretty conventional rock I guess, but I like them.\n\nSimon: Yeah, I don't. I mean, they've got catchy tunes that many people like, for example my girlfriend who's Japanese loves Nickle Back, but I didn't even know they were from Vancouver. You know, they're just I thought there were from the Prairies or something like that. Yeah, there not cool enough.\n\nMichael: They're not cool enough. \n\nSimon: I think their music is crap. \n\nMichael: Do you really?\n\nSimon: Yeah, it's, I mean they sound the same as any number of bands, you know.\n\nMichael: OK, can you think of any group from Vancouver that is cool? A new band! \n\nSimon: A new band. Well, you've caught me at a time because I'm in Japan and so new music doesn't really resonate here. Is that the correct word to say?\n\nMichael: Well, what's your definition of new then? Is it like a minute old?\n\nSimon: I can't say, you know, you stumped me on new music. Yeah, how bout you? Do you want to tell me about some music that you're listening to now?\n\nMichael: Oh, you see, once you become middle-aged you start listening to a lot of stuff that you listened to when you were in high school or you actually find yourself nauseatingly wanting to hear things that you hated when you were in high school and it brings back memories, like I can actually say that I enjoy doing a lesson where I have to play ABBA for my students, whereas I hated it when I was a kid. When I was in high school if you put an ABBA record on I probably would have punched you.\n\nSimon: Oh, sure as and ESL teacher, we both have to play, you know, cheesy ballads and things like that for our students because that's what they like. Yeah. OK, let's get back to the music. You know, they're probably already old, yeah, if you want good solid Rock, I mean, the next best thing was The White Stripes a few years ago and their still quite good. \n\nMichael: And they're from Vancouver?\n\nSimon: No, they're from somewhere in the states. But they play, you know, really edgy sort of classical style rock for the modern age. I don't know, for the 2000, yeah.\n\nMichael: I'm reading this book now about the so called Cam-Rock Renaissance, during the period 1985 to 1995. Bands like DOA of course, we've already mentioned, also from Vancouver, Skinny Puppy, would probably.\n\nSimon: Skinny puppy! There's a name I haven't heard in awhile.\n\nMichael: Yep, and The Tragically Hip.\n\nSimon: Overplayed group.\n\nMichael: Overplayed! Tragically Hip is probably the most popular group in Canada, though.\n\nSimon: Yeah, I lived with a techno DJ in university, so we often had parties at our house and he would play his new stuff that he was very proud of, you know, acid jazz, hip-hop beats, and all kind of weird stuff, but good, and he had a rule because people kept on coming up to him and saying, \"Can you play 'The Hip' man?\" and he always said, \"They'll be no 'Hip' played at this house!\"\n\nMichael: That sounds like something I did when I was DJing in bar. Everyone would ask me to play Guns n' Roses and I absolutely despised them. I even went to the extent of buying one of the waitresses their album so that she would never request them again, but unfortunately I didn't have enough money to buy everyone the album and I found myself playing them sometimes two or three times, and the same song two or three times. It wasn't my place. I couldn't make the rule your friend made.\n\nSimon: Yeah, I could hear the recurring theme. Play GNR man!\n\nMichael: Yeah!\n\nSimon: Well, let's wrap up that, this conversation.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Anita, we're talking about money.\nAnita: OK.\nTodd: I have some questions for you.\nAnita: Fire away.\nTodd: First question: are you good at saving money?\nAnita: You know now that I got married, I think I'm much better at saving money, than I was before.\nTodd: Yeah, I think it's definitely one thing that comes with age. The older you get, the better you get at saving money.\nAnita: Definitely.\nTodd: But we all waste money, so what is something you waste money on?\nAnita: Oh, what do I waste money on? Probably movie rentals.\nTodd: Movie rentals, right.\nAnita: I love watching movies, and I am capable of renting five movies a week, so that's one thing.\nTodd: You know, actually, not that you mention it, I have a huge problem with movie rentals, not so much the movie rental but the late fee. I'm terrible. Like, I'll have a movie for two weeks, and I could have bought the movie for the price I have to pay for the rental, for the late fee. Oh, it drives me nuts.\nAnita: You should do what I did. I moved to a new apartment last month and that apartment is right in front of  a movie rental place.\nTodd: That's it. That's the solution. Always live by the movie rental place.\nAnita: That's my way of saving money.\nTodd: Well, these days you can actually download movies on the internet which is really convenient.\nAnita: If you're American, yes. Usually many of these websites where you can legally download movies are only for American or people with American credit cards.\nTodd: That's true.\nAnita: Unfortunately, it's not available to the rest of the world yet, but I know in my country we have a website where you can rent movies. You download them from the internet and you get a special password, so the movie, you can only access the movie within those 24 hours that you rent it for. I've never tried it but the system is there and I think it's a great system.\nTodd: That's a cool technology.\nAnita: Yeah, very.\nTodd: What about other things like music and books? Do you spend a lot of money on that? \nAnita: Books, yes. Books yes. Music not as much. But one thing I definitely spend a lot of money on is my phone bill.\nTodd: Oh, really.\nAnita: Yes.\nTodd: Talking on the phone.\nAnita: Yes, talking on the phone.\nTodd: Well, actually it's funny because those are two things I never waste money on. 1) I hate talking on the phone, so I'm never on the phone. I always have extra  minutes, and 2) for books, go to the library. It's free.\nAnita: But then you can't keep the book at home and the whole beauty of reading a book it to... after you've read it, put it in your own personal library and feel good about yourself when you look at your library and think. \"Ah, I've read so many books\" but I like having books at home because you can reread them anytime you feel like it.\nTodd: Oh, that's interesting. I don't think I've ever reread a book, ever.\nAnita: Really.\nTodd: Yeah, one time and that's it.\nAnita: Really.\nTodd: Maybe I just don't have the same love of reading as you do.\nAnita: Could be.",

Like, to be completely honest, in the beginning I was really upset and I was like, you know, \"Why does this have to happen to me?\" you know. That is like immediately what you feel, what anybody would feel. But then when after, you know, recovering and after... while I was going through the whole thing, I basically realized that these things, they don't happen for a reason. My friend, he did not want to bang the car, you know, he didn't have anything against me. He really regretted it.Fred: Yeah, it wasn't his fault.Shibika: Exactly. It's nobodies fault, so it happens. It happens to teach you something, I guess, so basically I learned that such things happen. It made me a stronger person, you know, I was like, no more scared of car accidents or stuff like that because I'm like, OK, they're a part of your life and they go on, so. Yeah, and then I was taken care of. I had all the time, these people, surrounded by people, yeah, who used to come: my relatives, my friends, they came to visit me. All of them got really worried so you feel kind of special. You feel that, OK, you know, like it really matters for other people when something happens to you.Fred: Wow, that's really nice to hear. So yeah, so when something like this happens, you always have people around you to help you.Shibika: True, yeah.Fred: So that must be a really good feeling.Shibika: Exactly, and like, out of all the people, my mom had helped me the most, like because I couldn't even move because of the plaster. I couldn't move my hand. I couldn't do anything on my own. I couldn't eat by myself, so she had to feed me. She had to and I felt like a kid again, and she had to do everything. for me.",

Katia, if a friend came to you asking to borrow some money, what would your reaction be? Katia: If I have a good friend that really needs the money then, of course, if I have the money, I would probably lend it.Paul: So, in what situation would you lend your friend money?Katia: Well, for example, it's a person that is really trying their best to have money and it's in a situation that it's an emergency and needs the money then I would lend it. What about you Paul?Paul: Yeah, I would lend... I would be a little bit nervous to lend a close friend money because I think that money can sometimes affect a friendship.Katia: I guess that's true. Do you have a bad experience with it?Paul: Actually, I do. Yeah. I've had a bad experience of a very close friend of mine. He was asking for money from me and at first just once and then twice and then he started asking for more money and it actually had a big effect on our friendship.Katia: Are you still friends?Paul: Oh, we're not. We're not friends anymore, but he did buy his car.Katia: Oh, wow! This was for a car.Paul: Yeah, he kind of cheated me out of a lot of money, so he was working as well and he was trying to save some money and in the end he bought his car but he lost his friend. Katia: Yeah, I guess that's very difficult to say, but what about... would you ask for money if you need it?Paul: Personally, I think before I asked a friend for money I would prefer to either ask my parents or my sister. How about you if you were in that situation?Katia: Well, if I had no choice, and not asked my family, I could ask my friend. Of course, he has to be a very good friend and for a very good reason for me to ask for money.Paul: So could you lend me some money, cause I'd like to go to Hawaii next week?Katia: Well, Paul let me think about that one.Paul: OK.

I used to live in what's called a \"Gaijin house\" which is just a shared apartment. I had a 6 mat room and a shared bathroom. Now I have two 8 mat rooms and my own bathroom and a kitchen with 4 burners, instead of 2.. yeah. \nTodd: Oh wow, so you're in your new place now?\nIvan: Yeah, I'm in my new place now. Actually, the old place was owned by a company, they owned the land and this really, really, awful woman owned the building, so I rented a room from the woman. I woke up one morning and the manager was putting stuff in.. was putting flyers in people's mailboxes. I took a look at the flyer. The flyer was saying that the company was going to destroy the building within a month period so they were warning us to get out. Well, the manager was busy taking these flyers so that the people inside the apartment wouldn't see it and move out. She wanted to get one more month of rent from us. So I took my flyer and I went down to the company that owned the land and said, \"Where can I live now? You're making us leave in a month.\" He said, \" Oh, I feel really bad about what you told me happened, so he gave me this 2DK which is normally 120,000 a month for 60,000 with no key money and no deposit.\nTodd: Wow! That's nice. \nIvan: Yeah, I got lucky.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So I'm here with Shantel, and we both are from the United States. And we both are teachers in Japan. So I thought we would talk a little bit about some of the stereotypes that people might have in other countries, for example Japan, or other countries about Americans. So first, we're going to talk about hamburgers.\n                              Shantel: Okay.\nTodd: Okay, so hamburgers. How often do you actually eat a hamburger?\nShantel: Uh, hamburgers. I would say, it's actually not that often, although I love hamburgers. I love them very much, but maybe only a couple times a month or so. \nTodd: Yeah, I agree. I think hamburgers is the one thing that does not meet the stereotype, that we don't eat them that often. Like, I never have hamburgers in America. \nShantel: Ah, okay. \nTodd: Pretty much never. Like, I'll have them if somebody's barbecuing it, maybe for a picnic, or something. Um, yeah. And if I do eat fast food it's usually not a hamburger.\nShantel: Oh. \nTodd: I eat something else. Like, I eat tacos or burritos, right.\nShantel: Yeah.\nTodd: I don't eat hamburgers. So that's one. I think hamburgers don't really match the stereotype myth.\nShantel: Yeah. I agree.\nTodd: Do you agree?\nShantel: I agree, especially because I know many, many of my students here in Japan, they will ask me often, what I eat for lunch. And before I respond, cause they're playing a joke on me, they'll say like, \"Oh, hamburger? Hamburger?\"\nTodd: (laughs), yeah.\nShantel: And I have to tell them that, you know, now I do live in Japan, but in the United States I don't typically eat hamburgers every day. \nTodd: Yeah. \nShantel: But that is a lot of what they think. They think that I eat hamburgers regularly or, at least, fast food but their image of fast food is only hamburgers. \nTodd: So true. And actually,the funny side story to that, or contrary story would be you know, sushi. So we both teach in Japan, and I think most people think that you eat sushi all the time in Japan. And that's almost the equivalent of the hamburger. You don't eat it that much. \nShantel: That is so true. \nTodd: Right?\nShantel: So true. I cannot say how true that is.\nTodd: Or uh, another one, we're talking about um, stereotypes would be sumo. So Japanese people are not that into sumo, really, right, but it's an iconic thing. So that brings us to the point of baseball. \nShantel: Ah, yes.\nTodd: So do you actually like baseball?\nShantel: I do. I love baseball. I do, and I used to go to some games in the United States, in San Francisco. I went to several Giants games growing up, yeah. So I do enjoy baseball. Do you enjoy baseball?\nTodd: I do. I have to admit, like I played you know, baseball when I was younger. I loved baseball, but I do think it's not as popular as people think it is.\nShantel: Ah.\nTodd: You know what I mean?\nShantel: Yes.\nTodd: I think that like, a lot of people like it. You like it, I like it. But a lot of people could care less. \nShantel: Yes.\nTodd: About baseball. \nShantel: Most of the time I think I hear people say it's, it's a slow sport, it's boring. No one wants to watch it. \nTodd: Right.\nShantel: They're much more inclined to watch basketball or football instead of baseball.\nTodd: So true.",

Each Provence has their provincial government but as far as federal government the capital is in Ottawa, and there's actually an election coming up, probably sometime this year. Each province is given seats in the federal cabinet and seats are given based on population so Ontario and Quebec which have the largest populations have the most seats in Federal Parliament and so wherever you live you basically vote for the politician who is running in your particular geographical area, and the political party which wins the most seats forms the government that rules the country.\n\t\t                Todd: OK, and the leader of the country comes from that party?\n\t\t                Steve: Yeah, the leader of the country is elected within the party. They elect the leader (OK) So each party, when they want a leader, they have a leadership convention, and they elect a leader to lead that party, but the leader of the party must also run in their own constituency or riding, so if they don't win they can't be the Prime Minister, so, yeah, the main political parties, right now the government is Liberal Government. Other prominent parties are the New Democratic Party, sometimes called the NDP, and the New Conservative Party. Also a powerful party is Bloc Quebecois, which has most of its seats obviously in Quebec, so there are four main political parties.",

        "transcript": "Todd: OK, Terry, now when you take your bike trips, when you bicycle across America or down the West Coast, what is a typical day? Like how would you start your day and how would you finish your day on the bicycle?\nTerry: Well, a typical day, I'm camping usually, so I usually get up at or near sunrise, sometimes I get up slightly before sunrise, and I have to pack up all of my camping gear, stuff the sleeping bag in a stuffed sack, roll up my air mattress, pack up the tent, and then eat breakfast and then I usually try and, you know, do the daily essentials and then hit the road. I usually try to be on the road on the road sometime around 7, 7:30 in the morning, depending on when the sun comes up. But I like to go cycling early in the morning because it's cooler and there's, you tend to see more wildlife and I just think it's a nicer time of day, especially if you're riding in the summer, it tends to get warmer, as the day goes on, so, and then I usually try and hit, find a campground sometime in the afternoon and then the process starts again in setting up camp, setting up a tent and whatnot. Um, during the day, I'm usually cycling, actually cycling for 5 to 6 hours a day and then taking two or three hours off, various breaks, and eating lunch and what not, and then usually in the afternoon, I stop and buy some food, that I can cook, so I can cook dinner in camp and have breakfast the next morning. Oh, that's pretty cool.\nTodd: So you just pay for everything with a credit card, or you bring cash, or?\nTerry: Oh, both. Especially in the Unites States, with debit cards you can get cash back when you're buying food at a grocery store or so. It's always nice to have cash to pay for incidentals and .\nTodd: Well, that's interesting. You said that you see wildlife. What wildlife would you see?\nTerry: Oh, on this trip, as an example: elk and deer and raccoon and possums and turtles and snakes and all kinds of wildlife.\nTodd: You know, have you almost ever hit an animal?\nTerry: I haven't. I don't think I've ever come close to hitting an animal, no.\nTodd: Well, speaking of being hit, have you had any close calls with cars?\nTerry: Um, well, that's kind of, I think goes with the territory, so to speak. I've never come close to getting hit but I certainly feel like on occasion, I've been, I've had vehicles come closer to me that I wanted them to close, and, kind of, the real bug-a-boo for cyclists is logging trucks, and back east, coal trucks, they're just, they can be really terrifying when they are going by and you're cycling down the road.\nTodd: I bet. Wow. OK, thanks Terry.",

What is Omikoshi?\n                        Yoko: Ah, it's really difficult for me to explain in English, but Omokishi looks like a bigbox, lots of people, adult people try to carry together, and they usually go to temples, and they kind of celebrate a harvest or our happiness or those kind of things\n                        Todd: OK. Do you ever carry the Omikoshi?\n                        Yoko: Ah, you know, I'm not a strong guy so, I've never tried it.\n                        Todd: OK. What about foods? What kind of foods do people like to eat?\n                        Yoko: We can see lots of small shops along the street and we can buy really Japanese food, like watagashi, it's a really sweet candy but it looks like, how do you say that?\n                        Todd: I don't know.\n                        Yoko: I don't know.

It's really popular food in matsuri, and we can see okonomiyaki. Yeah, it's, somepeople say Japanese pancake, or something, but tastes different.\n                        Yoko: It's not sweet.\n                        Todd: It's not sweet.\n                        Yoko: It's not sweet.

        "transcript": "Todd: So Megen, we are both teachers, English teachers in Japan, and we both come from countries that have Christmas, but Christmas is so different in Japan than in our home countries, so I though we would talk about that.\nMegen: Yeah, absolutely. It's particularly different to Australia because we have ... we have it in summer.\nTodd: Oh, that's right. So it's a beautiful summer holiday, right?\nMegen: It is, though when it get hotter here in Japan, I start to feel that it's getting into Christmas season.\nTodd: Oh, right! So summer is Christmas.\nMegen: Yes, yeah.\nTodd: That's so cool. Do you still do the Christmas tree and the gifts under the tree?\nMegen: We do and we have a lot of the same Christmas traditions, but the food is pretty different. We eat a lot of fresh fruits, and we have like fresh prawns. I guess you might call them shrimps.\nTodd: Right, no we call them prawns too. Prawns or shrimp. Wow! That's interesting. You know, it's cool that you brought up food because we're both in Japan and I think it's very interesting that in Japan the Christmas dinner is fried chicken.\nMegen: Yeah! I can't imagine eating KFC or any kind of chicken for Christmas.\nTodd: Now did you know about this before you came to Japan?\nMegen: I didn't actually. I was shocked when I heard about it.\nTodd: Yeah, I didn't believe it at first, and then when I came to Japan, I saw the long lines outside KFC, and I thought, wow, this really is a thing. And now in Japan, not only do they have KFC chicken, but everywhere. So the supermarkets make fried chicken. The convenience stores have fried chicken. Other hamburger stores have fried chicken, all just for Christmas.\nMegen: Yeah, yes, I don't think we usually eat chicken. Maybe some families would eat roast chicken, but usually we eat cold meats.\nTodd: Oh, right, so Australia is fresh fruit, shrimp, and cold meats.\nMegen: Yeah, we have a few Australian desserts that I haven't seen in any other coutries, but I think in Australia there's a lot of variety though, so my family in particular, that's what we eat, but I think every family is different. How about in America?\nTodd: Ah, in America it's very close to Thanksgiving, so usually you have a big bird, so you have turkey or chicken or ham. Ham is a big one. So you might have baked ham. But you have lots of sweets, lots of cakes, Christmas cakes, pies, cookies. Things like that. So everybody gains a lot of weight. Do you eat a lot of sweets for Christmas in Australia?\nMegen: Well, I imagine they eat more baked goods in America, but we eat a lot of cold, like parfait, kind of desserts. With a mix of like sponge cake and jelly and cream, and we do eat cookies and different like chocolate sweets, and yeah, I think we do some baking but, yeah, not so much pies.\nTodd: So in Australia because it's so warm, do you spend the day at the beach? \nMegen: We do! Yeah, a lot of people have pools. Their own pools, so they will go swimming in their backyard, or they'll go to the beach, or play cricket outside. \nTodd: That's great! So do you barbecue? Is Barbecue a common way?\nMegen: Yeah! Especially for Christmas. It's really great to be outside. And there are barbecues you can use near the beach or in the parks, so a lot of people go outside and mingle with the locals. It's great.\nTodd: Oh, that's fantastic. So in the Northern Hemisphere, Christmas is often associated with snow, so you have the snowman and thinks like that. Do you have those types of decorations in Australia?\nMegen: We do! Although we don't have any snow, we still have the snow decoration. And usually Santa Claus still wears the long sleeve winter clothing, although we do have our own version of Santa Claus, that wears singlets and shorts.\nTodd: That's nice. So you've lived in a country with a warm Christmas, and a country with a cold Christmas. Which do you prefer?\nMegen: Well, I think because I've spend so many Christmases in Australia, that I still feel like it's Christmas when it gets warmer, and when I see things like peaches and watermelon in season I want to celebrate Christmas.\nTodd: That's so cool.\nMegen: Do you want to experience a Christmas in Australia?\nTodd: I do. I do! That is definitely on my bucket list now, to have a warm weather Christmas.\nMegen: It would be so strange for you!",

Jake: That would have to be video games. I have pretty much every video game console that was releases since the late 80's.Lindsay: Are you serious?Jake: Yes. Every one of them.Lindsay: Wow. I actually don't really like video games.Jake: Why not? They're fun.Lindsay: I don't know. I used to when I was a kid, but recently they just don't appeal to me... to sit in front and like, use my thumb to press this thing to make it jump and I guess I'm just not very good at them.Jake: Well, they're getting more and more involving now, it's kind of like having an interactive movie except you get to be the main character in the movie.Lindsay: Yeah, I guess. I need to get used to it. I'm really bad at them right now, so I'm just not comfortable with them.Jake: Yeah, I know what you mean. One thing I've noticed a lot with games lately is that they're so complicated to control that you have to be like a hard core gamer to even begin to understand how to play the game.Lindsay: Do you think you're a hard core gamer?Jake: I would have to say I am though I'm not exactly proud of it.Lindsay: Oh, really. What constitutes a hard core gamer? How often to you play?Jake: Pretty much, well, probably for most hard core gamers, it would be every day.Lindsay: Every day. How many hours?Jake: An hour or two, at the least.Lindsay: OK, what about you? How often do you play every day?Jake: Well, since, I'm working, there are lots of days when I don't play at all, and I would like to be able to play more.Lindsay: OK, so one of your goals in life is to play more video games?Jake: No, I wouldn't say that but it's a good way to relax and sometimes it's more fun than just watching TV when you have nothing better to do.Lindsay: OK, so you play... try to play every day but sometimes you don't and then, are there any tips you can give me to become a good video gamer?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJake: Well, just the more you can play, the better you'll get. I don't necessarily want to play more because as you know there isn't really any reward for playing games more.",

I was in education. I was a high school teacher. \nTodd: Where did you go? What country?\nMike: I was in Togo.\nTodd: Togo?\nMike: It's a little country between Ghana and Dahome, and the time Benan, Nigeria, West Africa.\nTodd: West Africa, yeah.\nMike: And I was a high school teacher. I was an education major at the University of Michigan, and trained as a high school teacher there, but I had to get a complete different training, skills, to work in West African high schools. I mean for one thing, the classes were huge, like a hundred students in a class, and we didn't have textbooks. We just had a blackboard in front of the class and students had notebooks, so you had to really manage the class so that the students always had something to write down, or practive from their notebooks, and you know I had like four or five classes like that every day, and it was a very grueling job, but very, very exciting work, I mean, I loved it. I just loved it. It was the best thing a college grad could do in my opinion.\nTodd: What type of experiences do you remember about living in Togo?\nMike: Ah, living in Togo, well, I was a foreigner, right, I was white, I am white, and everybody was African, black, so there was this feeling of always being an outsider and occasionally, not occasionally, often, you know kids would make fun of you for being different, and you know, so it was sort of hard to get used to that. That was one thing I remember.\n\nMike: I mean, I remember the beauty of it all, and how in the tropical area, how things grow (right) like it would rain almost every day and then when the rain stopped and the sun came out you could just literally see flowers growing, plants blossoming, you know, that's one thing I really remember.\nTodd: Man, it must have been really, really beautiful.\nMike: It is.\nTodd: Have you ever gone back?\nMike: You know, I was just thinking about that the other day, that why, no I haven't gone back. I haven't gone back. I would love to. If I have the opportunity I will, or I have to make the opportunity to go back. It's a very volatile country, though, you know. It's not an easy country to go to just as a visitor. I think you need to have something to do there, (right) like I did, you know, I had a regular routine, and place to live. I don't think I would want to go there as a tourist, but I'd love to go back if I have an inviation to do something again.\nTodd: Alright, thanks Mike.\nMike: Sure.",

It must be really difficult. Katia: Well, I wouldn't say difficult, difficult. I think it's great, but it comes with some difficult things I guess. Maybe I can think of make-up and it takes us so long to get ready and it's something that we really need to do, so maybe that's one thing that we have to get used to it.Paul: Come on. It can't be so difficult: make-up. Putting on make-up on every day.Katia: Well, you get used to it, but just imagine, we need to look for the right colors, the right brand, the right price. It really gets tough.Paul: Sounds tough. Anything else difficult about being a woman?Katia: Well, some people say that it might not be so difficult but maybe giving birth might be something that woman have to face that is difficult, but perhaps for some women it's not so difficult but I think that's one other thing.Paul: Yeah, for sure. I'll never know about that. How about good things, positive things about being a women?Katia: Well, there are many positive things. I actually can say I'm happy being a woman. Maybe one thing is, well we have in a sense... we're able to choose if we... once we marry, if we go to work or not, in general. I think that's one good thing. Don't you agree?Paul: Yeah, I would agree with that. For sure. Anything else that's positive for you?Katia: Well, since I'm not married yet, going on dates I think it's great the man has to pay. So that's a positive thing of being a woman.Paul: Great. Yeah. I definitely agree with that. OK, and finally is there one last thing. What's your favorite thing about being a woman?Katia: My favorite thing? Maybe having a sixth sense.Paul: Could you tell me more?Katia: Well, as a woman we sense certain things that men are not able to sense, so I think that's a very positive thing.Paul: For example?Katia: Well, for example, Paul, as a woman we sense people's feelings even though, for example, a man will not say anything. We can see, or we can feel what the person is feeling. The same with children, or the same with other women.Paul: I would agree with that. Women have to be more sensitive to these issues I think.Katia: Yeah, sensitive. You can call it sensitive. I call it a sixth sense.Paul: OK, it was nice talking to you.Katia: Thank you, Paul.",

Sometimes I prefer to just call someone on the phone if I'm in a hurry.Lindsay: Yeah, I go both ways. Sometimes I know I don't really want to talk to the person. I just want to ask them one question, so it's so much easier for me just to text them and say, \"Are you going to the party tonight\" for example instead of calling them, because I know if I call them, I'm gonna have to have a long conversation.Jake: Yeah, I can see what you mean. Well, usually I get off the phone pretty quickly when I call someone. I'm not a big talker.Lindsay: Yeah, that's true, Jake. You don't talk a lot. But, in general, I like to call people because I think it adds a more personal touch.Jake: So are you fast at writing the messages with your thumb?Lindsay: Well, when I first got a cell phone, which was actually only five years ago, I was so slow, I thought I would never text message, and I always called people, but then people kept text messaging me so I felt obligated to try to learn how to text message, so now, I'm pretty fast actually. What about you?Jake: Actually, I have the opposite problem, where when I first got my cell phone, I thought it was so cool and I had to text message all my friends who had one, and I was pretty fast with my thumb then, but it seems like now I don't use it so much, and I've gotten slower actually.Lindsay: Yeah, I think the text message actually is sort of has to do with your age, for example, I text message a lot and I know people younger than me, for example people in high school, they text message a lot, but I asked my father if he text messages, and guess what he said?Jake: What?Lindsay: Well, of course, he said he never text messages. He thinks it's very juevenile and unprofessional to text message someone.Jake: Yeah, I can see what he means. It's usually associated with young people and considered pretty informal to text message someone.Lindsay: Yeah, it is really informal, I think, because you're just using your thumb and you're trying to write fast. Rarely do you ever write 'dear' or 'from' or use polite language, right?Jake: Yeah, because you're using your thumb, you have to write the messages as short as you possibly can.Lindsay: Right, I mean, it sort of makes sense, when I think that I would never text message someone I didn't know very well. I only text message people I'm good friends with and comfortable with.Jake: Well, it serves it purpose then, doesn't it.Lindsay: Yeah, I guess, I mean it is cheaper than calling someone, but, you know, other times it's better to call someone, don't you think.Jake: Yeah, definitely.",

We are on, kind of on the side of a hill in the forest but we have a spectacular view of Mount Fuji on the other side of the valley. \nTodd: Yeah. It's really nice here. Why are you in this forest right now?\nKevin: Well, I'm currently working and I'm teaching an intensive English course up here at the campus.. up here in the forest.\nTodd: Oh, nice. Do you take any walks in the woods?\nKevin: Yes, I enjoy taking walks in the woods. And sometimes I even go for a jog in the woods, there's a few trails around here and there's a nice golf course as well that you can run around.\nTodd: OK, great! What's the best thing about being in nature? In the forest? \nKevin: Well, for me it's the stress relief that it provides especially living in Tokyo which is of course one of the world's largest and most chaotic cities. It's also nice to get back out into nature sometimes and just hear the insects which obviously we can hear very clearly right now, as well as some birds and you know it's just nice to get back out into nature. \nTodd: I agree. OK. Thanks a lot Kevin. \nKevin: You're welcome.",

        "transcript": "Katia: So, Enam, we're talking about arranged marriages, but what about the rate of divorce of arranged marriages? Is it high?\nEnam: Well, actually, the rate is incredibly low. Actually, it's below ten percent and it's changing but still it's really low and the reason I think because the culture in Bangladesh ... in that kind of culture, boys and girls are like grown up in different ways, and they don't really see each other that closely, and that's why when you are married with a person, you start to know that person after different ... opposite gender ... quite well and that helps develop and understanding and they both ... both of them try to understand each other - their values - and in the cultural background it's normally decided that they have to be together normally without an exception for the rest of their lives, so they just try to work in that way. Do you have a higher divorce rate in your country?\nKatia: Actually, unfortunately it is increasing. I really don't know the percentage but when I was young, if somebody of my friends parents would get a divorce that would be very shocking to hear. It was uncommon. But now, a lot of my friends actually are going though divorce or their parents have divorced, which it wasn't common but now it seems a little bit more common, so unfortunately things are changing in Mexico.Enam: Why do you think that the divorce rate is going up? What could be the reason behind this?Katia: I think it's very hard to say but I think they're various reasons. For example, women didn't used to work. They used to stay home and take care of the house, the husband, the children, but now women have become more independent. They have been able to make different decisions that before they didn't have to, so I think the independence of the women has changed things and perhaps the culture itself, the culture of marriage and divorce, it has changed also so I think possibly those two reasons.",

        "transcript": "Gyri:               Okay. So Viyasan, what do you think is the most important, hard work or talent? Or what is more useful?\nViyasan:            Hm. That's an interesting question, because I think they both play a role in whatever task that you're doing, but personally, I think that hard work is more important than talent. And I'll give you a couple examples of why I feel hard work is more important. \nI think in order to master any skill, whether it's singing, whether it's dancing, whether it's performing well at a task, you need to stay focused on the task at hand. And some people are naturally good at that task. For example, if I'm really quick at typing on the computer, I'll be able to print out multiple spread sheets, complete a lot of work and finish my assignments faster.\nHowever, I believe to really go above and beyond and master that skill, with that talent, hard work needs to be attributed as well. Without hard work, even if you're at typing on the computer, you might not want to feel like typing on a computer, you might be lazy and you just might not want to do that task.\n But hard work trains you to become good at a task, and do it very well, master it, and become efficient with your time. And so that's why I think hard work outweighs talent, because I think there's more dedication in hard work, there's regimen in the hard work, and once you've mastered hard work in a specific skill, I think you can master it a lot more easier than someone who is naturally talented at that task.\nGyri: Yeah. I definitely agree. I think you pretty much summed it up though.\nViyasan: Yeah.\nGyri: But yeah, I agree that hard work is more important than talent, and you could be very talented, but if you don't have the work ethic, then it doesn't really matter. Or especially if we're thinking about getting jobs. So, yeah, hard work definitely is more important.\nViyasan: Is there a task that you've spent a lot of time at and given that hard work to master?\nGyri: I started playing guitar three years ago, and I never played an instrument before. And usually I can be very lazy when learning new things. I get unmotivated very quickly. But one day I was just like, \"Okay, I have a guitar lying around. I just really want to learn how to play now.\" \nAnd I just put in a lot of work and hours and now I play the guitar and I am very proud of myself because I put that work into. And like maybe ... If I was born with a talent to just play guitar, that would be cool, but I wouldn't have the same satisfaction of putting my mind to it and getting good. Yeah, so ... I don't know what I was going to say.\nViyasan: Yeah, well that's a good example of using hard work and something that you like to do. That's amazing, yeah. So do you think there's any exceptions where talent is more important than hard work?\nGyri: I think so. Like, maybe especially in the entertainment business. You could put in a lot of hours, but if you want to be really good, like a really famous actor or a really famous singer, they'll choose the more-talented ones and often the most-talented ones are the ones with the predisposed talent. If that makes sense. Like ... Oh, I don't know what I was going to say. Sorry.\nViyasan: Here's an example I have. So one of my interests is basketball and usually the highest level of basketball is, I would say, the NBA, the National Basketball Association, which is run in America and Canada. And usually, lots of basketball players are very tall.\nGyri: Right, right.\nViyasan: For that reason, they're able to have longer limbs, they're able to do a lot more things with the basketball. For example, jump, shoot, run with the basketball and play the sport at a more higher level than someone who didn't have those natural, physical traits. \nAnd so, I would say that, in that case, talent, if someone who's talented at basketball, would be at a slightly more advantageous position than someone who, for example, myself, I'm five, six, who puts a lot of hard work into basketball, but just can't beat someone who's six, four, and just runs extremely quick because they're talented. \nGyri: Right.\nViyasan: So that might be one example of where talent, in some cases, beats hard work.\nGyri: Yeah. And I think the same goes for singing, for example. Like, you could practice singing, but if you're just born with a very beautiful voice, then maybe you're better off performing, for example.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Talking about kids and school, what do you think about failure? Like it seems like we're moving to where we're not allowed to tell kids that they're not doing well, that everybody has to be a winner. You know, everybody gets a good grade. What do you think about that especially as a teacher and a parent?\nJulia: As a teacher, I think, I read something recently that the chastising a student, telling them they did bad, has no motivational value whatsoever but praise does. So definitely I think it's important to always praise. If you have a really bad student and you can't find anything to praise them on then I don't know what the answer is really. But I'm sure you can always find something to praise someone on.\nTodd: Yeah.Julia: So I think it's important to focus on the positives all the time.Todd: See actually I kind of disagree.Julia: Do you?Todd: Yeah. I think that, you know, that your score is or your progress is absolute. Like either you pass or you fail, either you get high marks or low marks but that's the motivation. Like if you get, if you don't do well, then you want to try harder. You know, like if you're a fat kid and you don't want to be fat then you, you know, you're motivated to lose weight or if you aren't a star in the baseball team you need to practice harder so you move up. But if you tell kids that they're doing great when actually they're not exceptional then maybe that actually does harm.Julia: OK, well maybe I misexplained that. I don't mean give a false, I don't mean say they're doing well when they're not doing well but what I mean is focus more on the successes than the failures.Todd: Oh, I see. Like confidence building?Julia: Yeah, I guess that's what I mean more. But I guess we're talking about motivation rather than an end result like, of course, yeah, you're going to fail some things. I don't know. I never failed that many things at school and later on in life when I did encounter failure, I took it pretty bad so perhaps it would have been healthier for me to have failed a few things. I don't know.Todd: Well that's the question, isn't it? Like when you fail or you do bad I think that maybe that's the eye-opening moment you need to see. Like you need to see the truth rather than just tell somebody that they're doing well when actually maybe they're not or that they're exceptional and talented when maybe they're not.Julia: When they're not, that's true. Yeah, there was another thing that I read as well about telling, praising children for their intellgence, you should never, you should never tell a child they're smart because they get a false image of what intelligence is. You should always praise effort.Todd: Ah, right.Julia: As opposed to some sort of innate, what we believe to be an innate quality that you can never have if you don't have it. So telling a child yeah you're really smart, when the child faces a problem that requires them to apply themselves and maybe fail they're afraid.Todd: Mmm.Julia: Because then they may think no I'm not intelligent after all. So it should always be about praising effort and actually the result is not so important.",

I've always wanted to go to Thailand.Akane: Yes, it's a really nice place. I really enjoyed it.Ruth: So what did you do there?Akane: Well, one of the things I did there was to take a Thai cooking course and I learned how to make Thai food.Ruth: Oh, wow. So how do you make Thai food?Akane: Well, I don't know if I remember but I really enjoyed the cooking course. What was the course like?Ruth: Well, it was really interesting actually. They picked me up first thing in the morning and drove me to an outdoor market where they sold all kinds of fruits and vegetables and meats and spices and it was a kind of market where only the local people would go and they introduced me to a lot of different kinds of herbs and spices and fruits and vegetables that I've never even seen before so that was really interesting, and then they took me to the kitchen which was actually an outdoor kitchen right by a beach so I got to do cooking right in front of a beach it was very beautiful.Akane: Wow.Ruth: I was really lucky that day because I was the only student. It was still a new company that just opened up so I was the only student and so I got a lot of attention. There were two teachers that taught me how to do all these things and there was a lot of extra time at the end so they even taught me how to do fruit carving. I made leaves out of cucumber and flowers out of papaya fruit and things like that.Akane: That sounds fantastic.Ruth: It really was.Akane: And do you ever cook Thai at home now?Ruth: Ah, unfortunately I don't, but maybe if I have some time I might try itAkane:Good.",

I have a snake story. Todd: Ok Carla: We had a snake that lived in the bookcase. And you can never tell where he was except that that book was, except that that book was sticking out of the bookcase so you always knew where he was. And if you knocked on the book, you could pull it out and he would just lie there. But if you pulled the book out without knocking first, he would be frightened so he'd rear his head up and hiss at you and stick his tongue out and wiggle it around. He was a python, a baby python. Maybe two metres long. Todd: And you just let him live in the house? You didn't make the snake leave? Carla: When he was growing a little bit bigger, and he started leaving his skin around, we got fed up with that. I said to him “I'm fed up of clearing your skins away so you're out fella”. Todd: Wow, well who made the snake leave. How did you get him out of the house? Carla: Oh we just put him outside in the garden. Todd: Did you ever see him again? Carla: Oh I have scorpion stories too. Never mind scorpion stories. Todd: No no no, tell. Ya what's the scorpion story? Carla: Well, the scorpions were about… what ten, fifteen centimetres long. Great big black things. And a friend of mine had… We didn't have any running water in that village either. And so we had a man who would come in every morning with a big head load of water. A big huge bucket on his head carrying water, and he'd tip it into our huge barrel in the back garden. And then we would have to move it out bucket full by bucket full. Anyway, so our bathroom was always dry. There was never any water, the taps didn't work. And we kept our bath sponge on the edge of the bath. And one day, I went to take a shower to have a bath, and I picked up the sponge and I put it against myself and I got this terrible pain. Because there had been a scorpion hiding underneath the sponge. And it stung me. But luckily it stung me in a place where it didn't hurt so much. On my stomach. Todd: Wow. Carla: If you get it on your foot or you hand where you've got lots of nerves, it's really excruciating.  Todd: Oh man. I'm glad you're ok.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Anita, we were talking about your city, Prague. Now, your city now is really popular for tourists. How do you feel? Do you think that maybe your city has too many tourists? Or do you think, it's good and this brings a lot of money into your country? Anita: It definitely brings money into the economy. There's no doubt about that. That's why tourism is a very big... an important, you know, aspect for us. There are different kinds of tourists. There are tourists who come to Prague and to the Czech Republic to experience the history, you know, to look at the historical sites and to enjoy those and then are tourists who go there for the -- I would say -- the bad parts of society, you know the bad aspects of society, for example we have, what they call beer tours from the U.K.Todd: Beer tours.Anita: Yes. Where tourists, usually men, come in groups of, I don't know, ten, twenty, thirty just to drink beer in my country and unfortunately, in most cases, they don't come to nicely enjoy their tour, they usually come and, you know, get drunk and do other things, and that part of it, I really don't like because it sort of cheapens itI think.Todd: Sure, sure. Anita: Yeah, but other tourists, for example Japanese tourists are, you know, very orderly so those are nice to have there.Todd: Right, and I think in The States we have something similar. Many young people go to Tijuana Mexico, across the border just to drink, and I think it's a similar situation.Anita: I guess.Todd: But, overall you would say that it's a good thing, that, you know, the tourism brings money into Prague?Anita: I think any form of good tourism is good for a country as long as the tourists don't destroy the places they go to.Todd: Sure.Anita: For example, if you go to historical sites and you start scribbling your name on the walls or things like that, those are the bad parts of it, but as long as tourists are respectful to the culture, to the country, to the people, I guess tourism is good for any country, and we definitely depend on it.",

So we buy a small gift, 45 dollars, and then we play a small game where we exchange that gift amongst each other, so we don't have to buy gifts to everybody.Anja: Oh, that's quite nice, so it won't get too expensive, right?Fred: It won't but, personally, I like to buy gifts for my mother or my father and especially my grandmother and grandfather. It's very important, and so I enjoy doing the shopping for it.Anja: Oh, you do like shopping? Fred: For Christmas it's something different.Anja: It's really difficult on Christmas, right?

The first trip I ever did to South America I had the most massive backpack you could imagine. I mean I had to get it from a sort of military surplus store because I needed to have the kind of volume that a World War Two soldier would have had to carry things, all of his survival gear. When I travelled to Africa in my early twenties, I brought along things like, for example, a jungle hammock, you know because I was convinced that I was going to be stringing up the ropes of this, and sleeping above the ground because I was worried about some sort of dangerous animals that might come after me. When, then later, you find out the reality is, that you're always able to find some sort of accommodation even if it's very budget type and wasn't a problem.Jeff: Do you think... would you recommend this type of lifestyle to someone else?Jonathan: I don't know if my lifestyles very suitable for other people because they have more roots than I do. They've settled down in some way. They have a regular job that they have to go to. Myself, usually only working perhaps four months a year, I don't have the same responsibilities that other people do and I'm not married. I don't have kids. I have no need to decorate a room in any way.Jeff: Well, tomorrow, I'm getting rid of my house, all my possessions and saying goodbye to my girlfriend and buying suitcase.Jonathan: OK. As long as you don't try to live out of mine. There isn't enough room for you as well.",

And there’ll be hockey again starting in October. Todd: Ok now as a fan of hockey or just a sports fan in general, do you think that the athletes are making too much money, that it’s ok for them to strike and ask for more money?Alan: Yes I do think the athletes are making too much money. And I actually agree with the idea of having a salary cap, because I think it makes it more fair for all the teams in the league. Not just the big market teams that make a lot of money, but all the teams have a fair chance at the best players. Todd: Ok, can you just explain exactly what is a salary cap? Alan: Salary cap is the amount of money that a team is allowed to spend for their players. So, if you have a salary cap of 35 million dollars, the team is only allowed to spend that much total for all their players’ salaries. Todd: Oh I see. Alan: They cannot go over that. Todd: What is the reason that you would have a salary cap? What’s the argument behind it?Alan: So teams that have more money than other teams can’t just buy all the good players and leave the less talented players for the smaller market teams. So there’s more chance for the smaller market teams to compete with the large market teams for the good players.Todd: So do you think that hockey now is doing well, and that you will not have a strike for a long time to come?Alan: Yes I think after this one there won’t be another strike or lock-out for many years. Actually I think this deal is a 10-year deal. I think I read it’s a 10-year deal, so there won’t be one for at least 10 years, or longer hopefully.Todd: Well I’m glad you have hockey again.Alan: Thank you.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Shantel, you were saying that you grew up in a small town and had a very rustic life, but then you moved overseas to Italy, correct?\nShantel: Yes. I moved to Bologna. Bologna, Italy. \nTodd: Wow that's such a huge transition, what was that like? Why did you move to Italy? \nShantel: Oh wow. So I moved to Italy because I was studying abroad during my junior year at university. And so, I was to do an immersion program at the University of Bologna, which means all of my classes were in Italian. All of my homework, all of my exams, everything was completely in Italian. And I also had to find my own housing, which was also the first time I found housing on my own 'cause I had always lived in the university dorms at my university in the United States. And so, yeah. To navigate one a new city, a city in general and then finding my first apartment, and learning how to survive a new university system. It was exhilarating and very exciting. Yeah, I loved it. \nTodd: That's so cool. So, what was it like when you first got to Italy? Did you have culture shock? You came from a small town environment and now you're living in a big city in Europe. \nShantel: I think my friends would probably say that I was very quick to trust everyone. As I mentioned before growing up in a small town, I knew all my neighbors and I was very trusting of strangers and very welcoming, and I still am. But in hindsight, when I moved to Italy I think I was maybe a little too naïve sometimes and especially not knowing the language, it was easy to sort of put my trust or my faith in someone when I needed help because I needed help often, whether for translating or even just grocery shopping. And so, sometimes I think I look back I'm like, \"Oh, maybe I should have walked away a little bit sooner,\" or something like that.\nTodd: Right. Yeah. Compare life in Italy to life in the states. What was it like? How was it different?\nShantel: Life in Italy feels so much slower. People are still very productive and they're very passionate and they go to their jobs and they go to work, but there's just this sense of how important it is to enjoy your time, and to enjoy your time with family and with friends. So for example, I feel like in the United States people ... and this is very general, but I feel like people have their jobs and they work really hard to the point where maybe they're so tired they go home and they just want to watch Netflix or watch TV and relax, and that's their way of relaxing is being at home. And in Italy it feels like the way people recharge and the way that they relax and get their energy back is being in the company of their friends, and being in the company of their family. So they'll finish work and everyone will meet up for a drink in the center of town. And it's not to drink a lot it's really just to have a glass of wine, eat some delicious food, and just sit and talk, but about nothing really. Just enjoy the time and eventually people decide to go home, but it'll be hours later even though they're exhausted from work. But that's how they relax and that's how they get their energy back. And they go to work the next day and are productive. I really enjoyed that the most. \nTodd: I can relate to that. I was in Spain for about two months just traveling around and the one thing that I still remember the most is that I would go into a little pub, or a bar late at night, 10:00 a night and there would be old people. And I'm not talking like 50 or 60, I'm talking like 75 years old maybe. And they're well-dressed, and they're sitting at a table with their friends, and I can never imagine that happening in the United States. And it was so impressive. I was so impressed by that. That people really in the later years of their life still had that social spirit. They go out, they socialize, they have a good time. And we're talking late at night, like 10:00. You would never see that in America, ever. \nShantel: Yeah. I completely agree. And it's very similar in Italy too. \nTodd: So, what about the food? I hear the food is fantastic. Everyone raves about Italian food. \nShantel: Yes. It is so good. And I probably, wow, where to begin with food? I love the cheeses. There's just so many different kinds of cheese. I'm a huge cheese, meat, jam person. So the combination of having all of that available in Italy, especially the different regions are known for different foods. So sometimes you can't even eat a specific type of food unless you're in that city, otherwise you'd have to pay a lot to get it at a different part of the country. So, yeah I mean pizzas were delicious too. I know it's stereotypical but the pizzas were awesome and they're so different than the U.S. they're so thin, super, super thin there's no like deep dish pizza in Italy or double crust or cheese filled crust, that doesn't exist. \nTodd: Exactly. Like it melts in your mouth, right?\nShantel: Yeah. It's so delicious. And pastas of course are great. Their wines are delicious too. Yeah, I miss Italian food a lot. A lot. \nTodd: Well, I am thinking of going there so you'll have to give me some tips.\nShantel: I would love to. \nTodd: Cool.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So I’m here with Angela and\n                                we’re talking about families, differences in family\n                                culture and structure. We both have experience with the\n                                West. Actually, we’re both Westerners and we also have\n                                worked and lived in Thailand. \nHave you noticed the\n                                difference in the flow of money? Which I think is quite\n                                interesting. So in a lot of Asian cultures, especially\n                                Thailand, the flow of money goes from the\n                                children up. \nAngela: Yes. \nTodd: Whereas in the West, the flow of\n                                money goes from… \nAngela: Parents down. \nTodd: … the parents down or the older\n                                the family member down. \nAngela: Yes. \nTodd: It’s a completely different\n                                flow, which is quite interesting when you think about\n                                it. \nAngela: Isn’t it? Because, you know, a\n                                lot of the people that work in Bangkok and some of the\n                                tourist places in Thailand, they send money home. They\n                                don’t earn money for their own keep and their\n                                own life. They actually send money home to the villages\n                                to pay for their children, to pay for their mothers, and\n                                I think it affects the way the people respect people\n                                within the family. There’s huge respect for older people\n                                in Thailand that I didn’t notice in the West, and I\n                                think it may be something to do with the fact that they\n                                are still giving to their parents?\nTodd: Yeah, you know, that’s so true.\n                                I think also the fact that the family is almost like a\n                                bank. \nAngela: Yes. \nTodd: And they have a pool of wealth\n                                that they use together as a unit, which I think is just\n                                a great concept. \nAngela: Yeah. \nTodd: Although when I say this, I\n                                don’t give money up to my mother so… But I’m always\n                                thinking I wish my family did this. Our family in the\n                                West, we should adopt this practice. You know, everybody\n                                gives 10% to the pool, to the family pool. \nAngela: Yes. \nTodd: But I don’t know if it would\n                                ever work.\nAngela: I don’t know if it would work,\n                                no. \nTodd: I mean, so you have kids. \nAngela: Yes. \nTodd: How would you feel if suddenly\n                                your children started giving you 10% of everything they\n                                made?\nAngela: Great. Wouldn’t that be\n                                wonderful? But it’s not going to happen. \nTodd: Right. \nAngela: It’s just not in our society. \nTodd: Yeah. But you wouldn’t spend it\n                                though, right? Like the whole idea is like they just\n                                give it to the – like you would be the guardian, you\n                                would be the safe keeper of the money.\nAngela: Yeah, I’d probably have the\n                                money and then put the money away for them. \nTodd: Right. \nAngela: Because I think that the\n                                pressures in the West are different, as well. You know,\n                                it’s very hard for people to become house owners. So for\n                                my kids, it’s going to be very, very difficult for them\n                                to go on the property ladder. So if they gave me\n                                any money, I would give it back to them as a deposit. \nTodd: Yeah. You know, although there\n                                is one other thing that goes the other way, which is in\n                                Japan… I hope I say this right. I think it’s called otoshidama. Basically, you\n                                get money from your relatives. If you’re a child or a\n                                kid, you get money from your relatives on January 1st.\n                                They give you an envelope and sometimes kids might get\n                                $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 dollars on New Year’s, depending\n                                how wealthy your family is. And I think there’s Chinese\n                                New Year, maybe they do something similar. The kids get\n                                money, I’m not sure. So there is the other flow where\n                                families do give kids money, I think. \n\nAnd also, I remember years ago, when I first came to\n                                Thailand I was talking with a guy and I said, “Yeah, you\n                                know one thing that shocked me about kids in Thailand is\n                                they don’t… Nobody works. They don’t have part-time\n                                jobs. Not that many have part-time jobs.” Although it’s\n                                changed. I said, “In America, you work and it’s a good\n                                thing, like you build values.” And he said,\n                                “Yeah, well, you know, in Thailand they can’t do that\n                                because if a child works, especially for a middle class\n                                family, it’s an embarrassment to the family. Like the\n                                father can’t provide for his children. His children have\n                                to work when they should be studying.” So it’s really\n                                interesting the different dynamics in money across\n                                cultures.",

In Bangladesh, what is an environmental problem?\nEnam: Actually, we have a lot of environmental problems in Bangladesh but mainly I'd say the soil contamination is quite bad, and also the air pollution and nowadays we also have water pollution because of tanneries in the cities.\nKatia: So, tell me a little bit more about soil contamination?Enam: Actually, we used to use a lot of polythene bags while shopping for the last ten or fifteen years, but the government has banned polythene two years ago I think but still, we still have a lot of polythene bags in our soil and the polythene bags, it doesn't go away, or it stays in the ground for more than a hundred years, and for that reason the soil loses its fertility and also even if you want to ... if you try to build buildings, you cannot build more than a certain level.Katia: Alright, what about the air pollution? Is it a big problem?Enam: Actually, yes, it is a big problem in the capital city in Dhaka because there are a lot of transports, like cars there, and some of them are very old, and it pollutes a lot and there's dust everywhere in Dhaka, so if you go out in Dhaka in the moring, you must have to take a shower at night.Katia: Wow! That must be something else. In regards to air pollution, is there something being done to help the problem?Enam: Yeah, actually, the government is taking a lot of steps like nowadays if you want to import second hand cars from other countries, it couldn't be older than six years, and they always check the transports that are being driven in Dhaka, and if it it is like bad to the environment, they just ban those transportation and tranports from Dhaka.Katia: And you also mentioned water pollution. What is the situation with water pollution? Enam: Actually, the situation is really bad, like the water we have supplied by the government as a infrastructure in Dhaka, it's really bad. The quality is really bad. You cannot drink that water, and if you want to use that water, you have to like bottle that water, and you have to add all this purification process to use the water. And also, we had some tanneries in the city, around the city, and the waste from those tanneries went into the river and it was quite a bad situation, then the government decided transfer these tanneries out of the city in another place, and it was mandatory for the tanneries to use some more technology to reduce the amount of waste they produce.Katia: OK, that sounds good. I hope it will benefit the city.Enam: Yes, I hope so.",

No, 1-all because at the last minute England scored to make it 2-1, but that goal was disallowed so then it went to extra time and then I think Portugal scored first, then England scored again to make it 2-all and then it went to penalties, and David Beckham missed, uh a terrible terrible goal, missed a penalty, and then I think Portugal missed one and then England missed again and then Portugal's goalkeeper scored and then it was all over. \n\t                    Todd: Ah, well, maybe next time. \n                        Lois: Maybe, maybe World Cup in Germany in 2006.\n                        Todd: So who do you think is going to win it all?\n                        Lois: So in the first match, it was Portugal against Greece and Greece won 2-1, so although Greece are the underdogs, I think maybe they can win, but it is in Portugal, so maybe Portugal will win with the home crowd.\n                        Todd: Are you going to watch it?\n                        Lois: I would love to watch it, but in Japan it's on at 3:45 in the morning, and so I don't think I'm going to miss my sleep to watch it.",

        "transcript": "Presenter: Now the 2020 Olympics might seem a long way away to you, but people are already talking about what new sports might be included. Today I’m going to talk to two people who are hoping their sport might be included. The first is Jonny Mills whose sport is wakeboarding. Jonny, can you tell us what wakeboarding is? Is it like surfboarding?\nJonny: Well, a bit. It started in California because people wanted to surf but didn’t have waves ... It’s also a bit like waterskiing in that the rider is towed behind a specially-built speed boat.\nPresenter: How fast does the boat go?\nJonny: Usually at about 25 mph, or a bit less. The rider uses the wake the board produces in the water to launch into the air.\nPresenter: And then you do a lot of complicated things in the air?\nJonny: That’s right, spins of up to 1260 degrees, things like that.\nPresenter: 1260 degrees, that’s impossible isn’t it?\nJonny: Oh no, but it’s pretty crazy. You spin round three and a half times in the air.\nPresenter: And then you have to land again without falling over.\nJonny: You’ll have to come and watch some wakeboarding if you haven’t seen any. Come to Wakestock in July if you can.\nPresenter: That’s in Wales, isn’t it?\nJonny: Yep, Abersoch in North Wales. It’s a really popular wakeboarding and music festival. It’s right by the beach. It’s not quite the same as California, but it’s cool. It attracts a lot of great riders.\nPresenter: Who does wakeboarding?\nJonny: They reckon about 3 million people all over the world. More guys do it, but there are increasing numbers of girls too. The people who compete are usually in their teens or twenties, but anyone can do it. There’s a lot of crossover with other board sports like surfing and skateboarding. The tricks people pull are similar and the names for things are often the same.\nPresenter: And looking at you, I’d say the fashion was similar too.\nJonny: Yeah, the clothes and the lifestyle are similar.\nPresenter: Right, now I’d like to ask Jules Russell about her sport. She’s a skater in a roller derby team. Tell us about that, Jules. Is it a popular sport?\nJules: Yes, it’s becoming really popular in the UK. There are about 60 leagues in England and 1,200 throughout the world. In the US and Canada, of course, and places like Scandinavia and Australia, but lots of other countries too.\nPresenter: The sport began in the States, didn’t it?\nJules: Yes, in the 1930s, but it was more for entertainment than sport and it died out by the 1970s. Then there was a revival in Texas in 2001 and from then on it’s just been growing and growing.\nPresenter: So how do you play it?\nJules: Well, you have two teams of five people on roller skates, of course, and they go round an oval track in the same direction. Each team has a \"jammer\" who scores points by passing members of the opposing team. They do whatever they can to stop her, within reason. The team with the most points at the end of the match wins.\nPresenter: It sounds a bit rough!\nJules: Well, it’s a contact sport, so there’s bound to be a lot of pushing and falling over. It’s all good fun, though; people don’t often get hurt. If you try and trip someone up you get penalised. You do try and frighten the other team a bit though.\nPresenter: That’s right. You have frightening clothes and special names.\nJules: People used to have incredible costumes a couple of years ago. Now the sport is changing and becoming more professional. Lots of the teams train three or four times a week, and spend a lot of time in the gym you have to be really dedicated and fit. We still have nicknames, though. I’m “The Julifier”.\nPresenter: And is the sport all female?\nJules: There are a few men who do it, but it’s mostly female and amateur at the moment. Things are changing fast though, so who knows what the future will bring. It would be fantastic to be an Olympic sport.\nPresenter: What do you think about roller derby, Jonny?\nJonny: It’s wild! Those ladies scare me to death! Good luck to them with the Olympics thing though. And good luck to us too.\nPresenter: Good luck to you both.",

Good to see you. \n                              \nTodd: Good to see you.\nRichard: Long time no see.\nTodd: Yeah, it's been awhile.\nRichard: It's been awhile.\nTodd: Richard, you helped me out when I first started the website. \nRichard: My pleasure. \nTodd: Yeah, you're very kind and you talked about your dog!\nRichard: Lucky! Here he is! This is Lucky's picture.\nTodd: Wow! That's big. So tell us about Lucky. How's lucky been the last two years?\nRichard: Lucky, the last two year! Yeah! Lucky is almost two years old. His birthday is November the 11th! One-One-One-One, so he'll be 2 years old. He's doing well. He's developed some unique, sort of characteristics, personality traits. One is that late at night he doesn't like walking just with me, it has to be with me and my wife together. So he has two big bodyguards. It's true. It's an unusual thing but he will not walk by the river where it's very dark with just one person. He needs two people to walk him. Which is unusual for a dog. He's a golden retriever so he's a big dog, but he's just, he needs two people and he gets very lonely, you know he likes to follow people around the house the whole time, you know he's a really, he's a very sort of sociable dog. \nTodd: What a lovely dog?\nRichard: Yes, lovely dog! \nTodd: I want to meet him!\nRichard: Yeah, well, anytime!\nTodd: So, I think you were saying something earlier about how he gets cold.\nRichard: Yeah, that's the other thing. One of the other unique things about Lucky is that I think he's a but spoiled. I mean, you know, a lot of dogs live outdoors but this dog lives indoors, and you know the kotatsu, in the winter my obaachan, my wife's mother has the kotatsu.\nTodd: Yeah, like the kotatsu is like a big blanket.\nRichard: Ah, yeah, like a little low table.\nTodd: Oh, the kotatsu, oh, yeah, yeah, sorry\nRichard: An electric heater underneath it \nTodd: Yeah, that's right, sorry!\nRichard: And cat in Japan, cats are famous for going under the kotatsu in winter but my dog goes under the Kotatsu, so and he's quite big right, so you just see his legs poking out of the kotatsu. I mean that's a very unusual behavior for a golden retriever. Yeah, yeah, he's and unusual dog. \nTodd: So how much does he eat?\nRichard: I see, what about my son. I want to talk about my son. \nTodd: Well, no but like, first I'm just curious, how much does you dog eat?\nRichard: How much does he eat? Well, it's three times a day. \nTodd: Yeah, I mean, how much does it cost?\nRichard: Oh, the cost!\nTodd: Yeah, to feed a dog in Japan!\nRichard: Well, that's a good, that's a tough question. I buy a big bag of food. It costs me 18,000 yen and that lasts about three months, so about 6,000 yen. \nTodd: Man, that is expensive! So you're dog, that's at least 6,000 yen a month on food.\nRichard: And then Vet's bills are pretty high.\nTodd: Wow! But he's worth it! It seems like you love your dog.\nRichard: I love my dog. I carry his picture everywhere.\nTodd: That's my favorite dog too! Golden Retrievers. They're so kind. \nRichard: I also love my son! Can I talk about my son!\nTodd: OK, we'll do your son in the next interview.",

And for all that negative baggage that comes with that term, yes I am a drummer.Todd: Wait wait, so you say that there’s negative terms that go with being a drummer?Tres: Well sometimes when people hear “oh they’re a musician” you know, “oh you better watch out for them”. Yeah, it’s true. Todd: OK. Well, what kind of drums do you play?Tres: I grew up playing in punk bands, mostly because those were the only bands scouting for drummers at the time. However, what I enjoy playing is funk, jazz, blues and salsa, specifically Cuban salsa. Todd: OK. Now, so for the different types of music that you play, do you always use the drum sticks, or do you sometimes just use your hands? Tres: When I play on a drum set, I either use drum sticks or a bundle of sticks that are really small called hot rods, or brushes. Usually if I’m doing a jazz piece or a very soft acoustic set, I’ll use brushes. If I’m using other percussion instruments, for example a jimbei, then of course I use my hands. Todd: What’s a jimbei? Tres: Jimbei is a large drum that comes from West Africa. And you play with your hands using various African poly-rhythms. And lately, a lot of Western drummers have picked up the drum, and have fused Western rhythms along with African and Latin poly-rhythms. So it’s a very fun, but very difficult instrument to play. Todd: What do you prefer, using the sticks, or the hot rods or using your hands.Tres: Again it depends on the music that I’m playing. I enjoy playing in general. My preference would be playing the drum set with the sticks, just because I really love the more rocky-fusion-type-jazz, the more avant guard type stuff. And I also like salsa, which usually, you know you have your clave, which is a little wooden-like block. And your calmo, and you also have timbales, which are two drums that you hit on. Sorry for the bad description. Todd: That’s OK. When you’re playing the drums, do you ever lose a drum stick?Tres: I have in the past, yeah. Those question you’re asking are very very embarrassing for a drummer to answer. But yes, sometimes I’ve thrown them into the audience, usually on purpose. But occasionally, a drummer will lose a drum stick. So you usually have a pouch that you’ll put either next to your high hat, which are two symbols that you open and close with your foot, or next to a fore tomb which is the large drum that sits on the ground. So you have extra sticks that you can grab when you need them. Todd: Sounds cool. Tres: Very cool.",

        "transcript": "Jeff: So, Jonathan, I'd like to meet a nice girl. I'm looking to meet a nice girl but I'm not quite sure where we should go to meet women. What do you think? Where's a good place to meet some women?\nJonathan: You know, that's hard to say, I mean, there are all kinds of things that work for other people that they haven't necessarily worked for me. I mean, I talk to people who say that met girls in libraries, but I don't really want to go to a library. Usually they've got a silence rule. I don't want to go up and try to talk to a girl and have the librarian say, SHHH!\n                              \nJeff: Actually, one of my friends told me that he met a girl in the grocery store once in one of the aisles. He was looking at milk and she came up beside him, so maybe we should go get some groceries.\nJonathan: That seems to be a really unnatural kind of way to meet women in a grocery store. Maybe is a woman sees that you're buying individual portions of something and you're buying like little TV dinners that are only put in the microwave oven, she knows that you don't have someone at home cooking for you, but if I go out and I see a woman filling a basket with lots of tomatoes and cucumbers and so on, then I imagine she's probably cooking for a family.\nJeff: Well, why don't we go do something like bowling. Bowling! Women love to bowl. I'm sure we can meet some nice ladies at the bowling alley.\nJonathan: Oh, but women don't like putting on those ugly shoes.\nJeff: Well, then...\nJonathan: It's unfashionable when they go to the bowling alleys.\nJeff: Well, then, shopping! Let's go shopping. Girls love shopping. We can meet them at a store.\nJonathan: Girls love shopping but then they're gonna make you hold their bags for two hours while they go and try on different things. That's no fun.\nJeff: OK.\nJonathan: How about a concert?\nJeff: Ah, no, Too noisy.\nJonathan: Yeah, I guess you can't talk to women there.\nJeff: Well, I think actually, another one of my friends once met a lady at a bank - the bank teller.\nJonathan: Bank teller.\nJeff: Yeah.\nJonathan: That would seem like a little bit of a strange thing, and there I think the woman would be judging you by how much money you have in your account. She'd be able to see all of your information.\nJeff: Well, actually, I think let's just go to the pub.\nJonathan: OK.",

We do have some land in the Preseli Mountains and the Gwynne Valley which is a beautiful wooded area, but mainly it’s the coastal area and the coastal path is one of the big things we push with the tourists. ‘\nDai: So is it a protected area or...?\nSharron: Yeah, it’s protected and we help maintain it by cutting back the paths and maintaining the right of way for people so that they can walk the whole of the coastal path which is from St. Dogmaels in the north right around the coast, 186 miles ‘round to Amroth in the south. \nDai: So you get a lot of visitors who want to do that kind of outdoor activity?\nSharron: Yeah, we get lots of inquiries in my job from people who ask about how they go about planning a trip. Mainly, people will take, say, two weeks off work to come and walk, say, ten miles or so everyday, staying in youth hostels, bed and breakfast places, hotels, or camping every night and then carry on walking the next day. \nDai: So I guess there is a lot of activities and things for them to do in that area?\nSharron: Yeah, there is some lovely things to do and some great things to see. I mean, you can do all sorts of water sports in the area.\nDai: Oh really? What kind of water sports?\nSharron: Surfing, sailing, there’s lots of places 'cause it’s all mainly on the coast that most visitors come to see. Places like St. David’s, Tembe, most of those areas will have great outlets for, and organizations that will run courses for things like coasteering which is a great activity to do. \nDai: So if it’s a, I guess, if it’s a protected area, is there a lot of wildlife and...?\nSharron: Yeah, there’s a huge amount of wildlife and one of the main activities that a lot of people like to do is to come and go on the boat trips to some of the islands such as Ramsey, Skockholm, Skomer. You can take boat trips especially to somewhere like Skomer and between the end of May to about the middle of July, you can go over to Skomer for the day and watch the Puffins landing with beaks full of fish and running into their little burrows underground to feed their chicks. \nDai: Oh wow.\nSharron: But they're only there for sort of a couple of months, but there’s plenty of other wildlife to see. There’s rabbits, owls, all sorts of voles and unusual animals you can see on the island as well. It’s a really good day out. \nDai: Yeah, sounds like an interesting place.\nSharron: Yeah, excellent.",

Like how late do you normally sleep?\n\nAdrienne: Um, probably until 10 or 11 o'clock. \n\nTodd: Ooh, that's pretty late.\n\nAdrienne: I know. That's the best part.\n\nTodd: That's terrible actually.\n\nAdrienne: It's not terrible. It's good for you. You can catch up on your sleep, from a busy week.\n\nTodd: Yeah, but don't you think you're giving away the best time of the day. Like that's, if you sleep, you give away that time. You're never going to have it back. \n\nAdrienne: But, it's also relaxing which is something that you don't get to do during the week.\n\nTodd: Mm, that's true. That's true. But for me, it's, I like to get up early. I mean, do you ever get up early on Saturday or Sunday?\n\nAdrienne: Ah, sometimes, if I have an activity planned for the day - errands, shopping, hiking - that kind of thing.\n\nTodd: OK, well, what about food. What do you normally eat?\n\nAdrienne: On Sundays? I like to make an omelet for breakfast, ah, cheese omelet usually. \n\nTodd: What do you put inside the omelet besides cheese?\n\nAdrienne: Mushrooms (Ooh, that's good) and sometimes avocado, if I can find it. It's delicious. \n\nTodd: Do you do this every Sunday?\n\nAdrienne: No, it's not a habit but when I can, when I think of it, when I'm up early enough. \n\nTodd: OK, well, let's talk about last sunday? What did you do last Sunday? Do you remember?\n\nAdrienne: Mm, last Sunday? I was packing.\n\nTodd: Packing for what?\n\nAdrienne: To come to Japan. \n\nTodd: Oh, yeah!

We had a lot of turbulence.\n\nTodd: Ooh, what's turbulence?\n\nAdrienne: Turbulence is when the plane hits some kind of air pockets and bounces around. You have to put your seatbelt on so you don't get knocked over.\n\nTodd: Yeah, they go \"bong!\"\n\nAdrienne: Exactly!",

Did you enjoy it?\nJade: Yeah being in the army, I enjoyed it. Maybe some other Koreans will really surprised when I say I really enjoyed the military right? But ... because you know we have to go there for compulsory business and compulsory service for two years. Two years is very long but to me it was a very significant time and very precious time to me. For saying the truth, I am sort of ashamed to say this but I was 117 kilogram before entering the army.\nTodd: 117! I can't believe that! You're tiny. How much do you weigh now?\nJade: Now I am 68 kilogram.\nTodd: Oh my gosh, that's half.\nJade: Yes, it's almost half. When I finished the army just a year ago I was almost 62. I gained 6 more kilograms when I finished the army, now I'm... I get a little bit fat, but I'm still 68 kilograms.\nTodd: Wait a minute, you lost what is that 50 kilograms, 55 kilograms in one year?\nJade: Yeah, in a year, in the army.\nTodd: Oh my gosh, 55 kilograms in one year? How did you do it? ... Was it the food, was it the exercise?\nJade: In the army, every day, about the amount of food we ate it doesn't matter I think I ate more but everyday we ate regularly, like three meals on the exact time and everyday we had to do lots of training(s) like, you know, maybe somebody knows about the martial arts TaeKwonDo, a Korean traditional thing. Everyday we practice that and we ... everyday we practice lots of martial arts and lots of training things for health, so it helps me to lose weight. You know that ??? life is the best way to lose your weight.\nTodd: When you came out of the army and you went back home, people must have been shocked?\nJade: Yeah, everyone was shocked, everyone but ... they understood because most of Korean boys when they finish the army, they get changed.",

Eoin is talking about what happens after one of his performances with is band.Todd: So, usually, do people come up and talk to you after the show, or are people usually kind of shy and they don't know how to approach you?Eoin: Yeah, so that's another thing. I mean we have a CD stall and some people are very forward and they'll come and instantly like rush up and buy a CD but I think in Japan, especially it seems like people are kind of shyer about approaching you so giving out a questionnaire and asking people write it, it gives them an excuse to come up and talk to you anyway if they're interested later. So yeah, whenever we've given out questionnaires, it seems like we sell more CDs on those days.Todd: Then you just actually pass this out to the audience?Eoin: Yeah. Normally there's not that huge a number of people there, maybe forty or fifty people.Todd: Yeah.Eoin: Maybe a few more. It depends on the night. So this is... what I'm describing here is for a gig that's sort of away from home, you know. We played a concert just recently in Oita where we live and that was more of an event that we organized so we pretty much knew most of the people who had come anyway. In that case we played for longer, didn't do the questionnaire thing and just went out drinking after the gig. It was a more relaxed event on the night and afterwards but of course preparing for it in advance required a lot more effort - making sure people came and calling other bands to come and play with us and that sort of side of things.Todd: So do you have a fan base? A big fan base?Eoin: I wouldn't say it's massive but, yeah I guess when we play in Oita normally somewhere between, on a good day maybe 35, 40. On a bad day 15 to 20 people will come and see us.Todd: Still, that's good.Eoin: But, I mean, that's more, you know, we have to pro-actively contact them and say \"Hey, you wanna come and see the band?\" It's not like we just put an advert in the paper and everyone turns up, unfortunately.Todd: Well, hey, you know. Give it time.",

Mini: The basic difference of shopping in Sri Lanka is that you can bargain, like most of the places you can bargain, so if you and talk to the seller like very friendly and saying that you don't have that much money, you only have this much money, and then he will of course reduce the price for you.Todd: That's pretty cool. So, does this only apply to shopping for food or shopping for clothing or is it for everything?Mini: I think it's for everything, even for jewelry, furniture, everything you can bargain.Todd: OK, now are things, most things in Sri Lanka much cheaper than they are in Japan or the United States?Mini: Of course, it's very much cheaper.When I come here and see and it's like half the price. Todd: Wow, half the price.Mini: Yeah, most of it. For example, if it's like a 100 yen here, the thing in Sri Lanka will be like maybe ten yen, twenty yen, so it's like very cheap.Todd: Wow. That is a big difference. Only twenty percent of the original cost.Mini: But on the other hand, the salary that we receive is quite lower than the salary that you receive in Japan, so maybe in terms of Sri Lankan people it's expensive but for me, when I see from this perspective it's very cheap.Todd: Right, so if you buy a shirt, like a nice cotton shirt in Sri Lanka, how much would that cost?Mini: Around a 100 rupees in terms of yen, and it will be around 150 yen, 200 yen.Todd: That is cheap.Mini: It's very cheap.Todd: OK, and how about if you want to buy a nice suit, you want to buy slacks and a jacket and a tie and a dress shirt, how much would that cost?Mini: If you want to order it order-made, it will be around 5,000 yen, around 4,000 rupees, but if it's just like the suit in the shop, it's more cheaper than that.Todd: Even cheaper.Mini: Yeah, around 4,000 yen.Todd: So, 4,000 yen. Now, 4,000 yen is how much in rupees?Mini: 3,500, 3,200 rupees around.Todd: Yeah, I think in dollars that would be about 35 dollars.Mini: That's very cheap.Todd: That's really cheap.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Lois have you ever been to a professional football match in England? \n\t\t\t            Lois: Yes, I have. I support a team called Leicester city, and when I used to be at university I used to live in Leicester. I used to go to quite a few of their matches. \n\t\t\t            Todd: OK, so what's it like when you go to a professional game?\n\t\t                Lois: So first of all, the fans are all separated, because in England there's sometimes violence at football, so they like to keep the fans away from each other, and there's always a lot of police there, but I've never been at a match where there's been any trouble, so that's been OK. Um, the atmosphere is normally amazing because the smallest grounds hold about 20,000 people, so you get quite a good crowd, and because their stadiums are quite small, you're quite close to the pitch, so my team weren't very good though, so often my team would lose, so it wasn't so good, but when they one it was fantastic. Really, really good atmosphere and lots of fun. \n\t\t                Todd: That's cool. So how much does it cost to get it?\n\t                    Lois: See again, it's quite expensive so maybe now for the lower teams it probably, cheapest ticket is 25 pounds, but for example if you wanted to go and see Manchester United play, play then maybe 50 pounds or more, but it's really really difficult to get tickets for Manchester United because everybody has a season ticket, so if you want to go and watch them you have to know somebody who can get you a ticket. It's difficult to just buy a ticket for those games. \n\t                    Todd: Do you like Manchester United?\n                        Lois: I think there a good team. I think that the reason a lot of people don't like them is because they used to win all the time, so now they don't win so much, because now Arsenal win most of the time. So I think they're a good team, but I don't think you can like them if you're not from Manchester. \n                        Todd: So Leicester is a very hard word to spell. I take it it's not L-E-S-T-E-R, no?\n                        Lois: No. If you were an American you would probably pronounce it Lie-Se-Ster, so it's spelled L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R.\n                        Todd: Well, again! One more time!\n                        Lois: L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R\n                        Todd: Wow, that's quite a handful. Alright, thanks, Lois.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Monica, you are actually a trained physical education teacher.\nMonica: Yes, that's right.\nTodd: So, we often hear about how kids today are not fit, and they don't exercise enough. Do you think that's true?Monica: I think it is true, yes. I think kids these days spend a lot more time on the computer than they used to, so of course that means less time outside and getting fit.Todd: Now, in some countries there's a big debate about how much fitness kids actually do in school, so in your country, in New Zealand, do kids still do a lot of fitness actually in school?Monica: Well, recently the P.E. curriculum got amalgamated with the health curriculum, so P.E. and health were considered to be important in school, and the health side of the curriculum is often taught in the classroom, and of course the P.E. side often taught outside the classroom, and there's always debate about how much kids should be doing inside school. In fact very recently, now that it has become quite a big problem in New Zealand for teenagers, there has been talk about increasing the number of P.E. lessons that students have, but the current Prime Minister I think believes that the emphasis should be put on out-of-school activities like clubs and encouraging students to become more involved in that side of things.Todd: What do you feel? Do you think it should be?Monica: I actually agree to be honest, because I think if you increase the number of P.E. lessons that students have in a week, it doesn't actually necessarily increase their motivation to be involved in physical activity, but if like he's suggesting, you increase the opportunities outside of school, students maybe become involved in a sport that they choose, that they'd like to do and they hopefully can take it on as a lifetime sport. Yeah, which is important.Todd: Butt wouldn't the counter argument be that only kids that have a natural inclination to play sports would want to join those clubs and if the kids that are more sedentary or don't enjoy physical activity won't join a club, so you need to actually make them do fitness at school?Monica: Yeah, that's true. That is a counter argument, and a very good one … to argue on some other occasion. Of course I can talk about that side of the argument as well if you want me to.Todd: No, it's Okay. Basically, you saw there's … both sides make a good point.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Michael, this is a beautiful home.\nMike: Yeah, we've lived here for about twelve years and it's too big for us now.\nTodd: Really. It's pretty big.\nMike: Well yeah, I mean, it's got four bedrooms and it's got this big living room area and dining room area, and I've got two kids and both of them are in college now, so they don't live here anymore. So my wife and I are thinking about, you know, moving to a smaller house.\nTodd: Oh, that makes sense. Well, so where are you going to move?\nMike: Well, this area is called Walnut Creek, it's in the East Bay of San Francisco, and we want to move into an area that's in the Berkeley Hills. It's called Orinda.\nTodd: Oh, yeah. That's nice.\nMike: Oh, it's very nice. I mean it's a little more inconvenient, and it's not as convenient as here but it's a little more, there's more privacy, and there's more nature, you know more like old established trees and hills, and a little quieter, and so all those things appeal to us, so we're looking. It's not easy to find a right place but we're, actually today we're gonna meet a realtor, and we're going to be looking at some houses that are available and see if you like any of them.\nTodd: You know, actually, I've been thinking about getting a house. I'm kind of getting up there in age. What is the process of buying a house? Like how do you go about it?\nMike: Well the first step to find a place is you, generally you have to work with a realtor, somebody who has access to homes that are for sale, and then you sort of look through the listings and you find ones that you like, that you can afford, and then you visit with the realtor, and say you find a house that you like, like there is one that we're going to visit today that we think we like and we're going to check it out again. After we visit we make an offer sheet, we draw an offer sheet, that says how much we're willing to pay for the house, and the owner looks over the offer sheet. They never meet us directly, they meet only through their (the realtor) the realtors talk to each other. The buyer and the seller never actually talk to each other directly, and in this case, the house is going to have multiple offers. Many people will want this house. \nTodd: OK\nMike: So they're not going to look at the offers until next week, and say five or ten people bid on it, they're probably going to take the one, the person who offers the most money for it, so it's competitive.\nTodd: That is a tough situation.\nMike: Yeah, so sometimes you'll find a house that you love, and you can afford, but somebody outbids you. Somebody bids more for the house than you do and you lose it, and you have to keep looking so it can take weeks of months.\nTodd: Wow, well\nMike: To find the house you want.\nTodd: Sounds tough. Good luck.\nMike: Thanks a lot",

As I told you before, we got married in Ghana, and we moved to Nigeria. And our kids were born in Nigeria. But I wanna tell you a little bit about before our kids were born, because we lived in a place, a small small village that had no running water, no electricity, we could buy fresh food once a week. That means there were no toilettes, so the people used the rocks and the bushes around the village. Maybe that's too graphic, is that too graphic? Todd: No no no no. Carla: And, we had to pump our water out of a well. And at night we would pump one bucket full of water, and it would be half full of silt by the next morning the kind of muddy silt would have sunk to the bottom. And then we would pour off the clear water off the top. And it was a bad drought year in 1976. And we had to, we would cook our vegetables and then drain off the water and then use the water, reuse the water to wash the dishes and even to wash our clothes. And we had just enough water to. Fresh water we kept for drinking. Washing ourselves, washing our vegetables, cooking, washing the dishes, we used, reused vegetable water. And I had, we had no electricity so I cooked a stew once a week. And twice or three times a day I had to, we had to heat the stew up again, boil it to kill all the germs. Otherwise, it would've poisoned us. Todd: Man. Carla: But in that year that we lived there, I think we were healthier than we had ever been before, or since.",

        "transcript": "Presenter: So, we're back in the studio. Welcome back, everyone. My name's Rick Walker. From our laptops to our televisions, from the displays on our smartphones to those on our satnavs, we are in front of screens all the time. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to disconnect completely? To choose not to have access to the internet? If you have, you may be in need of a digital detox – a total switch-off from all things digital. The idea of people taking a digital detox is becoming more and more popular, especially amongst young people – and today we're joined by someone who's tried a number of digital detox activities and is here to give us some advice about it. Amanda Vince, welcome to the studio.\n\nAmanda: Thank you very much.\n\nPresenter: So, Amanda, you work for a fashion magazine in London, right? I guess your work means you need to be online a lot.\n\nAmanda: Oh, yes. Apart from the hundreds of emails I get every day, I'm always browsing fashion websites, as well as online videos. I also need to be very active online, especially on Twitter and Instagram – sharing what we're doing in the magazine, interacting with designers, photographers, influencers … it never stops, literally. Then of course there's my friends and family to keep in touch with online too, and for me, my work grew out of my passion, so friends and work colleagues aren't two totally separate groups of people and it all gets a bit messy online sometimes. I think I'm online for at least 12 hours a day.\n\nPresenter: So, how did you get the idea for a digital detox?\n\nAmanda: I read a book about it, called Log Off: How to Stay Connected after Disconnecting. The author's name is Blake Snow. That book gave me some really good advice and made me think about trying to change some of my digital habits. I started with removing distraction.\n\nPresenter: What do you mean by that?\n\nAmanda: That means turning off alerts, buzzes, alarms or notifications of any kind. I had notifications set up for everything, and it meant I was always being forced to look at my phone. Removing all of them except for important contacts helped me focus immediately. The book also made a really good point, that we should ask ourselves 'Why?' every time we take out our phone. I realised that most of the times I looked at my phone were because I was trying to avoid or ignore something else happening right in front of me. It was an automatic habit.\n\nPresenter: I have to confess, that happens to me too. But what else are you going to do when you're standing in line at the bank or waiting for your train?\n\nAmanda: OK, yes, I'm the first to admit that it's great for helping time go by. But speaking personally, I found I wasn't just checking my phone to kill time when I was alone. I was also doing it with friends or family around.\n\nPresenter: Hmmm … right. Well, so far, this doesn't sound too drastic. Turning off notifications and becoming aware of when we use our devices. That sounds easy.\n\nAmanda: Yes, it's the first step. Once we begin to realise just how much of a grip our devices have on us, then we're ready to really take the next step. First, my partner and I did a weekend with absolutely no screens. She found it easier than I did. For me, it was a little bit scary at first but it turned out to be a pretty rewarding experience.\n\nPresenter: A whole weekend, huh? I don't know if I could ...\n\nAmanda: I think everyone has to do this at their own pace. If a weekend feels too much, maybe just try for an evening. Then work your way up to more. I guarantee, once you've tried it, you'll want to try it again. We're going to try for a whole week in the summer.\n\nPresenter: OK, let's pause there then and see what our listeners have to say. You can call us here directly, or send us a message on any of our social media channels ... oops, should I be saying that? Anyway, more after the break.",

So, I'm gonna give you a quiz.Rebecca: Oh,God, I'll probably fail.Todd: OK, the first one is, do you procrastinate? Are you a procrastinator?Rebecca: Yes. For certain things. And also for study.Todd: Oh, really.Rebecca: Yeah.Todd: Cause you're a student?Rebecca: Yes. Yes. So. When I have study to do, it just more ahhhhh, there's other things that I could be doing.Todd: Right, so if you have a paper or something, you wait till the night before?Rebecca: Yeah. It's always last minute. I've heard that if you were a last minute person in high school, you will always be a last minute person throughout your life, so it doesn't leave much hope for me.Todd: You're set for life.Rebecca: Yep.Todd: Next is, are you somebody who worries a lot?Rebecca: Sometimes. Yes. Probably when I need to plan things. Yeah. Then I'll worry about if everything is OK, but other times it's just... I'll just go with the flow.Todd: Go with the flow. Do you worry about things like money or do you worry about things like like the future or stuff like that? Or are you pretty much easy going and...?Rebecca: I sort of do think about the future a bit and worry a little bit of you know, what's gonna happen, but other than that, no, I just see what happens. Money-wise, not really worry about it too much. I can't budget, so I don't worry about money.Todd: OK, that last one is, what about details? Are you somebody who's really picky about detail?Rebecca: Yes.Todd: Yes.Rebecca: Yes. I'm with paperwork. When something's written, or advertising things like that. At work, yeah, I was always very picky about the grammar or making sure that everything was in same font and lined up squarely so, yeah, but other than that, no.Todd: Well, then, just lastly, are you good at planning? Do you like to plan things?Rebecca: I do. Yeah, I've planned a holiday for my family over Christmas and New Years and that worked out really well, so yeah, I can plan things. Sometimes I plan like the future a bit too much, but yeah. Apart from that.Todd: That's interesting. So in your real life, you're very organized and you plan, but in your student life, you procrastinate.Rebecca: Yeah. Yeah. Completely two different lives I think.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Megen we are talking about Holidays and Christmas and in the last interview we talked the difference between Christmases in a cold country and a warm country, so now I thought we would talk about Christmas in countries that aren't really Christian countries. They don't really celebrate it for religuous reasons. So we're in Japan and it's interesting that in Japan it's a romantic day, right?\nMegen: Yes. Yeah it is.\nTodd: It's like Valentine's Day\nMegen: Yes, you have to spend Christmas with your partner.\nTodd: Right, and everybody looks forward to it - to go out on a date and give each other gifts, and yeah.\nMegen: Yeah, yeah, I think the fireworks are for the boyfriend and girlfriend and I think, and I think there are a lot of decorations that are similar to like Valentine's actually.\nTodd: Yeah, it's interesting because they have the Christmas decoration everywhere, but nobody gets the day off. No families celebrate it really.\nMegen: Yeah, it's a regular day.\nTodd: Except eating the chicken dinner, which we talked about -- the fried chicken dinner. Yeah, so it's kind of like one of those, like I call it a soft holiday. Like in America a soft holiday would be St Patrick's Day. Like everybody has to go to work but you do something that day related to the holiday even though you have no historical connection to it at all.\nMegen: Ah, I see. \nTodd: So for example on St Patrick's Day you drink green beer and you wear green. Like, do you do that in Australia?\nMegen: Ah, that started to become a thing in Australia that the bars do tend to have green beer, and you have green clothing that you might wear and people go out. It's definitely a drinking holiday. Not a holiday though.\nTodd: Right, are there any other holidays that you've absorbed into Australia?\nMegen: Well, people are starting to celebrate Halloween more these days and people take their kids trick or treating.\nTodd: Oh, really?\nMegen: Yeah! Not everyone does it, though I think that some people like to put a sign on their front door to say that trick-or-treaters are welcome, because generally we don't do that kind of thing in Australia, but the departments, the department stores are having more decorations and it's definitely infiltrating from America I think.\nTodd: Oh, that's interesting. So, in America Halloween is a big time to have parties. Do you have parties?\nMegen: I think more and more people are having parties. They have their own party in their house with decorations and costumes, but it's hard to say how many people celebrate Halloween really.\nTodd: Well, what about costumes? Did you wear a costume?\nMegen: I never wore a costume in Australia. I had never celebrated Halloween, but I noticed that some of my friends, and friends with children, they are celebrating it more, and it's becoming just a chance to have a party and dress up.\nTodd: As an English teacher did you dress up here in Japan? \nMegen: Yes, I did actually. Twice.\nTodd: Oh, you did. Did you like it?\nMegen: I did. It was fun to dress up. I dressed up as a character from a Jubilee movie, and it was really good to get together with my friends and to go out. Have you ever dressed up before?\nTodd: Oh, countless times. Countless. Yeah, so as a kid it was a big thing definitely in America.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Tres, lots of people might want to know when is the best time to visit the United States season-wise. What would you recommend to somebody that might go to America? Tres: Definitely the best time is in the fall part of the year: end of August through end of November, beginning of December. The reason why is because the weather is beautiful. You have blue skies almost every day. There’s not too much rain, no tornadoes or hurricanes that come through, and the weather is just generally cool and pleasant. On top of that you have the amazing food that’s associated with the fall months and the holidays also take place then. For example, Halloween, we go door to door trick-or-treating, receive a lot of candy. There’s also Thanks Giving, where many families cook the traditional turkey. Some other families have chop-suey, what have you, and there’s also the tofu-turkey. Todd: Tofu turkey.Tres: Yeah, tofu-turkey.Todd: Have you had tofu-turkey?Tres: I’ve never had a tofu-turkey but I’ve only heard about it. I went to a little arts college where there were only a few meat-eaters. Todd: OhTres: I always heard about it.  Also in the fall it’s a great time to visit the out doors in the United States. You have fall foliage. Especially if you’re in the New England States, where the mountains are just “on fire” with the oranges and yellows.Todd: Yeah, it’s nice. Nice time of year. OK, and any other season you think is a good time to visit? So the fall’s really good. Tres: I think the fall’s great. It also depends on personal preference. If one really likes the summer atmosphere, then of course going to New York or the West Coast in the summer time is great. You can visit the beaches. If you like skiing, of course winter is great, if you go to any of the Rocky Mountain States. Colorado for example, you can really take advantage of the snow out there. Great powder.Todd: Have you traveled much in the United States?Tres: Ever since I was a child, I’d get in the car and travel with my parents. We’d drive from OKlahoma to New York, or down south to the Pacific Northwest. Almost every single state. Maybe five, six states that I haven’t visited.Todd: OK sounds good. Thanks Tres. Tres: Thank you.",

Was it similar in your house?\nBuddhi: Well, dad used to do stuff like that and my brother and I didn't do much work.Todd: You were spoiled.Buddhi: Very, very, very, very .... yeah. Did you ever decide to shift work with your sisters?Todd: No, of course, it never even occured to me. I mean, when you're young, you just do they tell you to do, and to be honest I was very happy. I think I loved doing yardwork. I loved mowing the grass and pruning the trees and, you know, taking about the trash - anything that was physical I enjoyed. I didnt enjoy cleaning. But you never had to do that?Buddhi: Well, I cleaned my own room and my brother cleaned his own, and I mean, it's obvious and it's ... I mean... it's something we really should do, like at home. When we eat, you clean your dish, and maybe we ... when I grew up, I'd wash ... I'll do the dishes, and even if I didn't do my mom wouldn't expect me to do it, and make sure I do it somehow. If it's not done, she'd do it. If I do it, well, she'll be thankful.Todd: So, in your household, who mops the floor?Buddhi: My dad would.Todd: Your dad would. Who washes the windows?Buddhi: My dad, yeah.Todd: Oh, your dad! He's hardworking. OK, who does the laundry?Buddhi: My mom or myself.Todd: Or yourself? Really! OK. What does your brother do?Buddhi: Most of the time, like, he's about eight years older than me, so as soon as he graduated from high school he went abroad for high studies, so when he was doing the usual stuff, I was a kid, so I was not doing anything, so soon after he went I took over or something like that.Todd: Well you did some stuff.Buddhi: I did.

It's because, well we buy it in the supermarket and bring it home cause it's cheaper than eating in a restaurant. \n\t                    Todd: Yeah, it is a lot cheaper.\n                        Yeah\nTodd: OK, what sushi do you eat?\n                        Jessica: Well, we always buy the box, which has a little bit of everything. And I'm never quite sure what any of it is. I know there's a piece of salmon in there. Some octopus, or squid. Um, and then from that point on I'm not quite sure what anything else is, but it's all delicious, so I eat it all, and then we also have rolls, so we buy just different rolls. Actually, last week we tried natto. Have you ever tried that before?\n                        Todd: Yeah, it's gross.\n                        Jessica: It's the most vile, disgusting food you can ever possibly eat, so I definitely don't recommend that but.\n                        Todd: Well, have you had uni?\n                        Jessica: I have not. \n                        Todd: Uni is gross.

Great!\nTodd:  What is your favorite movie?\nJamie: My favorite movie is kind of a heavy movie. It's a called Sophie's Choice with Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline.\nTodd: OK.\nJamie: It's a movie, it's set in World War II. Meryl Streep plays a Polish woman who has come to America and she's met a man, Kevin Kline. Who has a series of problems of his own, mostly psychological which she is not 100 percent aware of and she does a bunch of scenes where she thinks of the past and the very difficult decision she had while during the war living in Poland. She had to decide between two children which one would be murdered by the Nazis and which one wouldn't. It's an ethical delimma that she faced at that time. She made and immediate decision on and it affected her the rest of her life. \nTodd: OK.\nJamie: It's a fantastic movie. Not the story in itself, of course the story was brilliant but the acting, the fact that she speaks Polish, she speaks German, she speaks English with a Polish accent which is amazing. A writer who is actually a narrator to the movie as well, his character is great. Kevin Kline's basically a psycho character. He is a little bit deranged in itself is pretty neat. All in all, the characters, the plot line, the movie it's fanatasic.\nTodd: OK. Great. Sophie's Choice.\nJamie: Sophie's Choice. I think it actually won an academy award in 1985 or '84.\nTodd: OK. Great. Thanks a lot.\nJamie: My pleasure",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Kadi, you are from Estonia. Can you talk about gender roles for the new generation compared to the older generation?\nKadi: Yes, in Estonia, we have this kind of Western type of family, a woman doesn't have to be a housewife. She can work. She can do whatever she likes. Even maybe the tendency right now is that women are becoming more masculine. Often it happens that women make more money than men do and they're the ones who bring the bread in the house. Yeah, compared to Eastern society where usually women are considered as housewives. They just have to clean and cook and raise the kids, and in my country ... no ... there's not such a thing and I think it always has been like that. I'm not quite sure but.\nTodd: Who does the chores like cooking and cleaning?Kadi: Yeah, I think we all do it. We don't have that kind of rule that women only have to clean and cook. Of course in some families, it is like that because women are better cleaning, especially, rather than men are, but yeah, men are quite good cooks.Todd: What do people do for childcare? Like who takes care of the children?Kadi: Nannies. Yeah. We have nannies for working mothers, they usually like hire people to watch over the children and just they play with them and also like kindergarten, like children start going to kindergarten in Estonia when they're really young, maybe from three months I think even, yeah, you can go to work when your child is like half-a-year old. Just go to work. Take a child there, and people are going to care about her.Todd: Is the nanny expected to cook and clean as well?Kadi: It depends of on the contract. It depends on the contract. Yeah, if you hire a person who that you say you're gonna pay him or her, usually her, like for cleaning, cooking, taking care of the children, whatever, it depends on the contract.",

On the East Coast. The best beaches. Does Mexico have any beaches?Diego: Yeah, yeah. We have really, really nice beaches down by the Caribbean Ocean, like in southern Mexico, there's this beautiful place called Cancun and the Ocean is really, really blue, like baby blue, and the sand is white so it looks like snow. It's a really amazing place.Rebecca: Can you surf at the beach?Diego: I'm sure you can surf in some places, yeah.Rebecca: What about snorkeling?Diego: Yeah, definitely. It's the Caribbean Ocean so the water is transpiring so it's amazing.

They knew how to predict the eclipses for the next three hundred years, and they just vanished. They just disappeared. Rebecca: They disappeared?Diego: Yeah! And there's a new movie directed by Mel Gibson, Apocolypto. It's about their civilization.Rebecca: Oh, OK. No, I haven't seen that movie at all. Well, I suppose I could go and compare our beaches. Go to Mexico and check out this place. What was the name of it again?Diego: Cancun.Rebecca: Cancun.Diego: Well, we could do a home exchange.

        "transcript": "Transcription of Audio\nTodd: Hey Jen, we're talking about technology. I'm curious. How many times do you check your email every day?\nJen: Nowadays I check it every day because I have so many emails coming from my company so I have to be updated, but in the past I would not check it for like, I would just check it two or three times a week. How about you?\nTodd: Yes, actually I brought that up because I think this is an interesting generational shift. I don't check Facebook and all that stuff that much, but my generation, we check email multiple times a day for work, like you just said. But the younger generation from what I understand, you guys don't even use email.\nJen: Yeah, like if you asked me the same question two months ago I would say I hardly check my mails because everything, like all the conversation I have, it's all on Facebook or some other social media, not emails. I think that's very old school.\nTodd: Yeah. So you do like text messaging, LINE, WhatsApp?\nJen: Yeah, all of that. \nTodd: All of that. How many accounts do you have actively, that you actively use?\nJen: Wait. Maybe ... I actively use five of them, but I have eight of them, yeah.\nTodd: Wow, you can manage that. The reason I don't do it, I imagine that you just must get a message like every 20 seconds.\nJen: Not every 20 seconds, unless you're dating, but yeah, you get a lot of messages. \nTodd: Really? And that doesn't drive you crazy? That doesn't like bother you?\nJen: I think in the beginning it was like too much, but now we have just gotten like used to it. It's just very normal for us. It's like you checking your mail three times a day, which is crazy for me.\nTodd: Yeah, but still. Here the thing is I don't like the phone. I think we've talked about this before. My generation was the fingers generation, so we used our fingers to type. And the younger generation, you use your thumb. And to me it's really slow and just painstaking to do, to communicate with your thumb on the phone.\nJen: Really? Because for me I think it's faster than typing. \nTodd: I know. Actually I see you guys and it's amazing. I see my students how fast they can use their phone, and it's phenomenal to me. It's like blurry, it's so fast.\nJen: I think if you start using your phone more and not your PC then you would be fast at it too, because even if I were to check my mails I don't do it from my PC, I actually do reply to all my mails from my phone itself.\nTodd: Wow. Actually no, I think it's not true because I've tried. I think it's because I'm older. My phone gets stiff. I mean my phone ... My thumb gets stiff like arthritis or something, like it literally stops moving. That's why I'm amazed.\nJen: Maybe it's just in your head.\nTodd: I physically can't do it. No, no, I really like, and when I type I could type really fast, touch type, but I cannot move my thumb that fast. The more, the longer I try I get thumb fatigue, like my thumb just stops, the joint won't work anymore.\nJen: For me it's very difficult for me to type really fast. I would rather use my thumb and text.\nTodd: No, that's cool. Now these days I don't know if you've realized but you can do voice typing. Have you tried that? Google Docs for example, you don't even have to type anymore. You can just talk in a microphone and with no special software and Google Docs will type what you say.\nJen: But then again you have to be very clear because it always makes a lot of mistakes. \nTodd: Yeah, but you know what's amazing about it, is I had, I was doing it with my students and then I was going to have my student do it and the voice recorder wouldn't take their voice, it would only take my voice. \nJen: I think it's because the ...\nTodd: The user account name?\nJen: Yeah, the user account name can only recognize your voice because that's been saved first. \nTodd: Right, so it saves the first voice, then another one won't work.\nJen: Yeah, I guess. \nTodd: So that brings up the question, technology gets better and better and better. Do you think typing will be obsolete, will be gone in five, 10 years?\nJen: I cannot really say but maybe no, not in 10 years. Maybe 20 to 30 years, yes, but not in 10 years, because I think still people are more comfortable writing their books and stuff like reports, just typing. Everybody doesn't like to talk a lot.\nTodd: True. Yeah, I think there's a different mental process when you type and it's just when you just speak it goes away. \nJen: Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Yuri: So Shirley, you were talking about the shack. Can you tell me some more about it?\nShirley: OK, well, the shack - not as horrible as it might sound. I was actually born in the city, and yeah, grew up on the edge of the city of Glasgow, and my parents ... maybe I was about seven or eight years old ... my parents decided they would buy this little wooden house in the country side, only about forty-five minutes drive from where we lived, but right in the countryside, and it was really basic. It was huge. It looked like a barn, and my parents wanted to try and make it into something livable like a holiday house that we could go to on the weekends and summer holidays and stuff, so anyway we went there ... for the first time we went, it still looked like a barn, and had some beds in it and stuff like that, but no running water, no electricity, no toilet, no bath, no shower. It was like a barn in the middle of nowhere, so as you know, me and my brothers, we are kind of raised in the city, and although, you know we were kids way before video games and iPods and things like that, there was no TV. That was the biggest tragedy. There was no TV, and we though what on earth can we do up here? It's like we're in the middle of nowhere, how boring this summer holiday's gonna be, so we just had to you know, try and figure out how we we're gonna enjoy this holiday and what could we do with no television.\nYuri: Yes, exactly, what did you do? How did you spend you days?Shirley: We were out in the country side. I mean, you just need to go out and look, and there's so many possibilities to have fun: making tree houses, making dens out of the woodland ferns and things like that, going on searches for frogs. We seemed to do that a lot. Poor frogs. We made like a tennis court out in the front of the ... we called it the hut. Right, I keep calling it a barn or a shack, but actually what we called it was a hut, although it was a really huge kind of wooden house, and so yeah, we made up a kind of a tennis court and when it wasn't raining we could play tennis. We had to go collect water from a well near like, I don't know, maybe four hundred meters away, and we'd always have to go in twos because of course there's always an argument with kids. I did it last time. He has to do it this time. So we always had to go in pairs to get the water. For lights we'd just use a gas lamps. For cooking it was a kind of two stove ... two ring stove, connected to a gas bottle. We did have television, which was powered by a car battery, so we would save that until Saturday night, because always on a Saturday night there was a movie, so we would save the car battery power for the Saturday night movie, and it would usually last until the end of the movie.Yuri: So it was a bit like camping.Shirley: Yeah, yeah, I suppose but like camping, only thankfully we didn't get wet when it rained.",

How much would a hotel like that cost?Mini: OK, for that, you can pay around a thousand yen. Around nine hundred rupees.Todd: A thousand yen.Mini: A thousand yen. A thousand, five hundred yen.Todd: Ten dollars.Mini: Mm-hm.

You can pay like fifty rupees and access to the internet. You can do it anytime.Todd: Right. OK. And just lastly, what about meals? How much do meals cost?Mini: If you want to go for a nice buffet, maybe around two thousand yen, a thousand, five hundred rupees around.Todd: Oh, that's actually kind of expensive, isn't it.

        "transcript": "This is a continuation of Kara and Lupe talking about her trip to Mexico to study Spanish. Lupe is giving advice on learning another language.Lupe: So, I've noticed you tend to be a little afraid to speak the language, especially around other people who speak both languages and maybe you're afraid that somebody is gonna correct you, which is actually a good thing, so you have to be able to let yourself speak it in front of other people who can make those corrections for you so the next time you say those things you'll say them correctly or maybe a little better.Kara: And that's exactly what it is. I am much more comfortable to speak Spanish to an only Spanish speaker than I am so somebody who speaks both languages, maybe because I am afraid of that person correcting me or teasing me about the mistakes that I make, so.Lupe: It's also great that you're going down there not only for vacation but you are actually gonna be enrolled in school because it's always good to practice a language but it's great to be able to also sit in a class room studying and learn all the grammar and make sure that you are also reading and writing it and you understand it that way also. It's really important.Kara: And I'll be living with a family so I get lot of practice at the house also.Lupe: Yeah, that will definitely help you out and I am sure that, you know, after you come back, maybe you'll feel a little more comfortable since you were in a different country where that is basically all that you are speaking. Kara: That's very true. But I've always noticed my favorite people to practice with are little kids. Their Spanish, or in any language, is so simple that it's fun to talk to them, just like with English. When you're learning English, a two-year old or a three-year old, you can talk to them, and they don't notice your mistakes but they'll understand exactly what you're saying, so...Lupe: Well, you can always come over and practice with my little cousins or my little nephew and nieces.Kara: Thanks.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Eoin, I was hoping that you could introduce yourself and talk a little bit about your band. Eoin: Sure. My name's Eoin. I work and live in Beppu in Oita in Japan and I play in a band called Nanbanjin. I play base guitar. The band... there's three of us in the band - a vocalist and guitarist, myself, and a drummer.Todd: That's it. Three guys.Eoin: Three guys. Yeah.Todd: So, one guy sings and also plays guitar?Eoin: That's right. Todd: And then you play the base guitar?Eoin: Mh-hm. Todd: And then the drummer?Eoin: That's right.Todd: Are you guys all from England, like yourself?Eoin: No. I am the only person from England. The singer and guitarist is from Wales, a small country which is next to England, and the drummer is from Japan.Todd: That's a pretty mixed group.Eoin: Yeah.Todd: So, how did you guys all come together?Eoin: That's a really long story but I actually originally met the singer and vocalist, who's called Dai. I met him in Oita. We were both teaching English nearby and we got together and did some music stuff together and previously we had a different drummer, a New Zealander who was also doing the same English teaching job in Oita. He went back to New Zealand and after that we enlisted the help of Manabu, the current drummer we have now.Todd: That's pretty interesting that just three English teachers from different countries in a pretty small city in Japan... you guys just get together and...Eoin: Yeah. It was... Well, I had know Dai for quite awhile before we actually started playing and I played in another band but it wasn't really my type of music and Dye I knew could sing quite well and was into similarish music to me so we got together and tried a few things out and then it just happened, this other guy, who was playing the drums, the New Zealander, was available to help us out and it all started from there.Todd: And then, what's the name of the band?Eoin: NambanjinTodd: NanbanjinEoin: That's right.Todd: OK, can you explain the name?Eoin: Yeah. Nanbanjin was what Japanese people called some of the first Portuguese people to ever come to Japan. It means... if you translate it literally... it means barbarians from the south. Savages from the south, because presumably they thought the Portuguese were pretty savage. We're not Portuguese but we are foreigners and I thought it was quite an appropriate name for a rock band.Todd: And so it stuck, huh?Eoin: Yeah.Todd: Just Nanbanjin.Eoin: That's right.Todd: So you guys thought boom.. you thought of the name and that's it, or did you have many names and you weren't sure which one to choose?Eoin: No, there was just... at that time there was a movie called The Last Samurai. Have you seen that?Todd: Yes. With Tom Cruise.Eoin: Yeah. With Tom Cruise. And there's a reference to Nanbanjin in that movie, which is the first time I had actually heard of it and so we just thought, it just seemed like a good name so we used it. That was it. There was no real other option.Todd: Well, it's a cool name.",

I'm a civil engineer.\nTodd: So, actually what does a civil engineer do?\nVictor: In America, a civil engineer designs things.

Yes, she's my sister. I'm a good sister.\nTodd: That's very nice.

That's care and devotion.\nSanti: Well, I said before I'm a good sister.\nTodd: Wow. I guess so. Now when you first went to university, did you think your sister would join you - would go to the same university?\nSanti: No. I don't think so because, well, she's very good at chemistry and she's also good at science, so I'm hoping that she will go a different directions than me, but, well, I don't know, maybe my mother trusts me, and then my mother led her to me.\nTodd: What about similarities and differences? How would you say you and your sister are similar?\nSanti: My voice and her voice. It's totally the same.\nTodd: Really?\nSanti: Yes.\nTodd: So if your sister was here doing audio work, I wouldn't be able to tell who was who.\nSanti: Yes. It's true.\nTodd: Wow.\nSanti: Sometimes we like to play with people on the phone. It's kind of like bad but whenever her friends call, I will pretend that I was her.\nTodd: Really.\nSanti: And vice-versa.\nTodd: That is a funny joke. So what is something that's different? Like how are you different? Obviously she's good in science.\nSanti: Yeah, and, well, the appearance is different. She has darker skin, and then she's very slim.\nTodd: You are very slim, too.\nSanti: Thank you.\nTodd: Are you the same height?\nSanti: No. I'm taller. \nTodd: OK. So you really are the big sister.\nSanti: Yes, that's true.\nTodd: You look down on her.\nSanti: Yes. Sometimes.\nTodd: So do you guys fight very much, or do you usually get along?\nSanti: Uh, during my childhood - yes - but now - no - we just ... well, we know the limits. We know that we are ready beginning to be adults, so I don't think that fight is kind of like popular anymore.\nTodd: Right, so you guys are like two peas in a pod.\nSanti: Yes.",

Do you do the type to calm yourself for meditation? Jeff: Yeah, there is many types of yoga but I'm not such a smart guy so I don't get into all that Hatha Yoga, and Kundalini Yoga and all that stuff. I just do..... sort of what I do is just stretching, but I did learn yoga in India from a Indian yogi, or guru, or whatever you call them, but it's just sort of like stretching, just slow controlled stretching and it's good to have a quiet space and you do it on an empty stomach, and then you just concentrate on nothing or concentrate on your breath and it's very good for your body and your mind.Todd: So, when you do yoga, you're saying breathing is very important.Jeff: Yes, that's... to clear your head as well so that you don't have all these ideas and images going through your head: what you have to do in work that day or all your chores or things like that, what was on TV the night before. You concentrate on your breathing. You breath slowly and you focus on your breathing and it's really good because it clears your mind. It clears everything out of your mind.Todd: Now, even though when you do the stretching, you improve your flexibility, do you think that yoga makes you stronger?Jeff: Yoga does make you stronger, much stronger because when you're stretching, you're stretching the muscles and you're almost tearing the muscles and then they grow together again stronger, and yeah, you're building muscle but lean muscle. You're not big and bulky. You're lean and fit.Todd: So when you do the stretching, and you say you're tearing down the muscles, should you feel pain? Does it feel painful?Jeff: No, you don't have to feel pain. If you want to do heavy, strong yoga, heavy stretching, then yeah, it can be painful but you just do it the way you like. If you start to feel a little bit of pain, you just pull back a little. So no, it doesn't have to be painful. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. If you do it every couple of days, then you will get stronger and you don't have to feel any pain.Todd: OK, sounds great.Jeff: You should try it.Todd: Actually, I should.",

It was a great year for me I have to say. I feel like I've grown so much as a person. I've done so many things this year that made me become I feel a much more responsible person, a more mature man. I've been working quite a bit at the school, but I've also been doing a few things outside of school, such as working with children as well. I've been working in a camp where we teach kids for twelve days English. Well, actually we don't really teach them. What we do is we spend twelve days with them and during those twelve days, the children that don't speak English come to this camp and have to only speak English for twelve days and we do all kinds of different activities with them. Sabriya: So how do you teach the children without communicating with them?Fred: That's the beauty of it. I understand that English is really important, but however we have this saying during the camp that our hearts speak as one and so we understand each other without using so many words, but of course the children have some basis in English and so we can understand each other.Sabriya: OK, that's very beautiful. Going back to the topic we were discussing right now, tell me what was the best thing that happened to you this year?Fred: The best thing that happened to me this year? I have to say that the best thing that happened to me this year was when I went back to Canada, I had the opportunity of spending lots of time with my grandmother, and you see, when I was growing up as a child she practically raised me, and so I have a special relationship with her. I do love everybody from my family, but my relationship with my grandmother is really great and spending two months with her was great for me.Sabriya: Well, I can relate to that too since my grandmother raised me as well, so I hope you have another great year next year.Fred: Thank you very much.",

I've experienced a lot.Fred: You've experienced a lot. What have you experienced?Sabriya: I've tried new things. Things that I have not done before. I've tried different jobs.Fred: What kind of jobs have you tried?Sabriya: I've tried working with children, actually, this year and it's been amazing. It's just been the best experience ever.Fred: What was it exactly that you did when you were working with children?Sabriya: Basically, it was in a... it's not a rehabilitation center, but it was a center for disabled children, and basically what we do is we spend the day with them and attend classes with them and just play with them, talk to them, interact with them during the day.Fred: Wow, that's really great. So you did some voluntary activities.Sabriya: Yes. Yes. I did for the first time.Fred: Wow, that's really cool.Sabriya: It was quite an experience because I was quite scared at first. I wasn't to sure how to treat them. I wasn't to sure what exactly I should do, but the instructors were very nice and they explained that, you know, you just have to be yourself and treat them like any other children, and that's how they want to be treated - just like normal children, and that's what I tried my best to do.Fred: Wow, so you must have learned so much, and you became a more responsible, mature adult.Sabriya: Yes, it did. It changed me in that terms because I become more patient than before. Before, I mean, I used to be quite stubborn and I used to irrationally make decisions, but after this I calmed down and I always questioned myself before doing something, so I think in that way I completely changed.Fred: Could you say that what you've learned through your experiences of working with children has also helped you in other parts of your life?Sabriya: I think the whole getting a patient side has helped me in many terms because it's made me think for example, when I want study or when I want to take classes, I always ask myself, should I do this? Should I do that? Should I go here? So, I don't think like that, so it's just a matter of thinking ten times before I decide anything.Fred: OK, well you know I feel that I can learn a lot from you and maybe I should do the same thing to become a more responsible person, too.Sabriya: You should. I'd advise you to. Working with disabled children is nothing like anything else. It's amazing. You should. You should.",

(OK) I didn't vote for him in the last two elections. He, in my opinion, is too conservative. I'm from a part of America, San Francisco, we're a lot liberal in our thinking, and I think Bush lost my city 85 to 15 (%), so I'm not a big fan of President Bush. I believe in democracy, and I believe in the system, but it's not easy when the person who gets in office is not the person you want to be there. It's very frustrating.\nNitiya: OK, OK, what I actually meant to ask is, the Iraq war, and things like that, Iraq war not only affected Iraq, it affected a lot of those military army people of America (right) their wives and children back home. They don't know if their father is going to come back or not (right) I mean not only affected total Iraq it was a very bad affect on America, too. I mean people, who ever loved America, there are so many people now who have a so bad image of America because of one, this, and I consider it a very, very insensitive action of Bush, so what do you think about that?\nTodd: Well, I pretty much agree with everything you said. It's tough. I mean, I don't, obviously you don't, I wasn't for having Saddam Hussein remain in power, or, but it bothers me that my country is doing actions where children can die, or babies can die, or even soldiers can die.\nNitiya: I mean Saddam Hussein is in power or not, why is Bush interfering in that? He can mind his own business, right? I mean, I just feel sometimes, when Bush sleeps in the night, doesn't he feel some sensitivity or guilty to even one person that, when you see that those bombs, those small kids dying, and you know, whole bloodshed, how can even he sleep, with peace. I just sometimes wonder.\nTodd: No, and actually that's one, that's one criticism that he, that people even have in America, a lot of people in America have of him is that he, does he know, does he really feel the pain that people are dying, children are dying, and yeah, it's a tragic situation, and...\nNitiya: And I think, there is one thing, I really feel that, there is always two parts of this whole story, I mean, we are seeing it with our civilian eyes, but the truth, none of us know. It's all politics. I mean, Saddam knows and Bush knows and we know nothing, it's like that\nTodd: Well, I agree 100% with that.",

        "transcript": "Tu: So, Amir, I heard ... I was really surprised to hear that Iran traffic is so bad.\nAmir: Iran, yeah, Iran is actually very much famous for it's traffic. Traffic is so horrible. People have to just wait in cars for ages just to get to their places which is just by walking maybe forty minutes, thirty minutes far from the place you are.\nTu: So there are a lot of traffic jams?Amir: Yeah, yeah. The capacitiy of the streets and the amount of car just doesn't match, so people have to wait for many hours.Tu: Well, actually, you know what, Vietnamese traffic is also very terrible.Amir: Oh, OK, now you tell me about Vietnam?Tu: Yeah, especially Ho Chi Min City. I still remember it was so scary for me, for the first time I go to Ho Chi Min City. Well, you know, everyone seems to be moving, and we travel mostly by bikes, so you know, there are a lot of bikes on the streets and it seems like you get to move with them. If you stop, you're gonna get hit.Amir: Oh, so you just have to flow with them.Tu: Yes, and there seems to be no rules at all. Like, actually they used to be a lot people who just goes when it is red light, and it's pretty common. It was. It's getting better now but still, you I think it's because there are a lot of bikes. Too many of them.Amir: OK, I am sure there are reasons for this traffic, but before that, before telling me why this is happening in your city, tell me, how you get used to it? How do you overcome this craziness, this anarchy you talk about?Tu: Yeah, actually, you know, foreigners complain about it a lot, all the time, but we actually, we Vietnamese people, we actually not ... we don't think it's a matter. It's kind of a natural thing for us, to just get out of your house and go with the flow and it's just ... it is something normal, like every day life, and I think it's because we get to go by bicycle and motorbike pretty soon, pretty early, since we were primary school, and you know, one thing is, the bicycle in Vietnam ... we go on the same road with the cars and bikes, so everyone moves at the same time.",

What makes it so infamous for having food that are very, very so called \"unhealthy\"?\nClare: Well, in America we were the country that invented the fast food chain, I think. There are very many famous fast food chains that got their start in America and they became popular because Americans were working very long hours in the cities and in small towns and it was a lot easier, it was very new, to have a convenient meal ready for you. Well unfortunately these meals were not prepared in a way that was healthy. There was very little veggies, I mean french fries are fried potatoes, burgers are fried, so the way they're cooked it ... they're made quickly but they're not made in a way that's healthy, there's no boiling or steaming so ... because these chains had a very good product being offered in one respect, that they were fast and easy and convenient to get to, while on the down side they were very fattening, people sort of just chose what was convenient I think, and there are so many of them because they really are popular. It's sort of a cycle where even though people know it's bad they choose it because it's convenient and because it gets so much business more chains open in a city or along roads because Americans have ... travel very long distances for commuting to get almost anywhere. For example, where I live in Texas, along the road very small towns separated by miles and miles of desert, every small town where highways come together have at least one burger joint or ice cream place that serves burgers and fries and so it's a little bit of, I wouldn't call it American culture, its just sort of what we got used to.",

Anna is the creator and founder of HomeworX – spelled with an 'x' we should note – an app which helps teenagers with their homework. Thanks for coming in, Anna.\n\nAnna: Thanks for having me.\n\nPresenter: So, tell us about your app. How does it work?\n\nAnna: Well, teenagers and their parents have numerous challenges when it comes to homework these days. In many families both parents work and don't have much available time to help their kids with their homework. And even if they do have time to help, they may not be able to offer support with the content. What I mean is, they may not know, or at least remember, enough in any given subject to support.\n\nPresenter: You mean they might not be able to remember complex maths or might have never studied certain subjects, such as biology or economics, themselves?\n\nAnna: Exactly. So they might want to support their children with their homework, but have neither the time nor the knowledge to do so.\n\nPresenter: I see. So the app helps solve this problem?\n\nAnna: Yes, and more. The next issue is that tutors can be expensive, and there may be long waiting lists for specialist tutors in the town or region you live in. Our HomeworX app brings students and tutors together online. Students can search a database of pre-approved tutors and sign up for live online support. They don't need to be in the same town or city.\n\nPresenter: That sounds really great.\n\nAnna: It is. And this approach also enables us to offer the tutoring services at lower prices because there's no travelling time involved for the tutor to get to the student's home. And tutors who live in remote areas are happy to get access to more students, and be able to work from home, even at lower rates.\n\nPresenter: This all sounds great. So, how did you come up with the idea?\n\nAnna: Well, as you might guess, I was one of those parents I described earlier. I really wanted to help my son with his homework, but I was either too busy with work or I didn't actually know anything about the subjects he was having difficulty with. Also, we live in an area where there aren't many tutors and the ones that are there are either very expensive or have long waiting lists.\n\nPresenter: Yes. I can understand your predicament. Well, it sounds like a very useful app that is clearly meeting a need. And its popularity obviously speaks for itself.\n\nAnna: Thank you.\n\nPresenter: So, do you have plans for the future?\n\nAnna: We've just secured some funding and hope to expand the range of services we offer using the app.\n\nPresenter: We wish you the best of luck. Thanks again for coming in. That was Anna Oliveira, founder of the tutoring app HomeworX (with an 'x', don't forget!), which is available for both Apple and Android devices. Join us again next week for another business interview. Have a great week, everyone.",

Are you going to watch the Olympics on TV?\n\t\t\t            Travis: I will probably get suckered into watching the olympics I'm sure. It will be on every channel. It will only be on one channel but it will be on the whole day I'm sure. \n\t\t\t            Todd: Yeah, they kind of go overboard. It's on too much. \n\t\t                Travis: Well, I think it was the last winter Olympics, where, I don't know which channel in the Unites States was covering it but whatever channel was covering it most of the olympics was just people's background and personal stories and profiles and a lot of America got really fed up with it, and I don't know if you were still here in Japan or if you were in the Unites States at the time of the last olympics, but \n\t\t\t\t                people didn't watch he last olympics in the states. They just tuned out completely. The reason that they tuned out is because the coverage was so poor. The station that was covering it was basically just doing profile after profile of athletes, about how they had to overcome hardship, how they had to eat one meal every two weeks , and you know run five hundred miles back and forth, you know, some school in Russia and those sort of profiles, stories drown out the actual events, and it was covered very poorly, but maybe this year will be different, maybe there will be a backlash against that sort of poor coverage, and we'll get to see more of the actual olympics this time. This is the summer olympics right. (Yeah, exactly) It shows how little I know about the olympics. I'm not sure if it's the winter of the summer. \n\t\t                Todd: Well, of the Olympics, what's your favorite event? \n\t                    Travis: Running. \n\t                    Todd: Running\n                        Travis: Just straight running. It seems like a very pure athletic event. There's no guess work in it. There's not five judge panel trying to decide who won, and then the Canadian judge and the France judge get in a fight and they have to decide. Nothing like that happens. It's just run, clock, stop and whoever got through the finish line the fastest wins. It seems very pure athleticism, so I like running: 100 meter dash,\n\t\t\t\t                        200 meter dash, all of that, and long runs too. I used to run when I was in high school so that helps a little bit. Not short distances. I used to run cross country, three and five miles. \n                        Todd: Ooh, that's a long ways. Are you still a runner?\n                        Travis: Well I went running tonight but I don't consider myself to be much of a runner. No, I only say that some day I am going to train and run a marathon but I have yet to train and run a marathon. Maybe someday. Yeah, I did it when I was in Bangkok and it about killed me. Yeah, running in Bangkok, running a marathon in Bangkok was not the smartest thing. It was terrible because they had, they have pollution right, Bangkok's a great city but they have a lot of pollution right. They have to have marathon at 4 o'clock in the morning before the cars start running, and then when you're running the marathon some of the policeman that are officiating have to wear like masks because of the pollution in the air, so when you're running a marathon through that it's not that fun. But anyway, you should do it. You should run a marathon. \n\t\t\t\t                            I think maybe I will but perhaps after I finish school this year.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Eucharia, you have a new house!Eucharia: Yes I just moved last week and I have a new house. It’s on the side of a mountain. At the back of my house there are rice fields. There’s one house immediately next door to mine and it has a crazy barking dog but luckily I like dogs and the dog likes me so when she sees me she gets really hyper now and welcomes me home.Todd: That’s a nice feeling, it’s got to be nice having a dog welcoming you home! So how big is your house?Eucharia: Well it’s like a small bungalow. It’s one storey. When you go in the door there is a japanese style porch for taking off your shoes. Then you are in a hallway and there’s an extremely large kitchen which goes from one side of the house to the other on the right hand side.Todd: Wow that’s cool! So does it have an oven? Can you bake?Eucharia: I don’t have an oven yet. I have everything else but I enjoy cooking. One part of my very, very chequered past I worked as a chef so I really enjoy cooking. I’m not very good but, yeah, it relaxes me after a hard day at work and I let my stress loose on the onions. Chop chop chop chop. And then there’s a living room and there’s what I euphemistically call a work area. It’s where I have a computer, my computer and some books and research stuff. And then there’s my… It’s all Japanese style flooring except for the kitchen, so its all bamboo flooring so it smells really nice because it’s all really fresh and it smells like hay to me.Todd: Sounds like a barn!Eucharia: I know it’s bamboo. It’s like sleeping in a barn!Todd: How many bathrooms do you have?Eucharia: Oh just one but that’s completely normal in Japan. It’s a Japanese style homeTodd: So do you have the bath-shower thing? Or just a shower? Just a bath?Eucharia: I have a bath and shower but - I really like this about Japan that - the toilet room and the bathroom, shower room are 2 seperate rooms in most places. There’s also a washing machine room, a pantry thing. Todd: You have a washing machine?Eucharia: Yeah I can’t live without a washing machine! I need to buy a new bigger fridge because my fridge is too small and because it’s in the country I cant do shopping as often and by the time I get out of work most… many of the shops around here are closed.Todd: Well congratulations on your new house!Eucharia: Thank you!",
