        "transcript": "Katie: So what do you think is a good age for girls to start wearing makeup? \nAimee: I think it depends on the kind of makeup that they're wearing and the purpose, you know, because to me, it seems like there are two different kinds. You know, there are young children, young girls, young children, who wear play makeup, you know. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: It's a toy. It washes off easily, garish colors, very mild on the skin, and you know, it's literally just coloring in their face. It's not, you know, enhancing their features or trying to look as society thinks beautiful, you know. They're not covering up any pimples or spots, you know. It's not like that. It's just coloring in their face, trying to look more like a princess. \nAnd I have a six-year old daughter and she loves makeup. She has her own, like, young like toy makeup and she asks permission to wear it, and I let her wear it. I bought some for her. I make sure that she can only do it if she has a clean face and clean hands and that she washes off properly at the end. And that she tidies it away afterwards.\nKatie: That's good. \nAimee: She's actually on her final warning because she used to leave it out – and I've warned her I will throw it in the bin. Because I have a toddler and she wants to see what her big sister is doing and she wants to play with it, so she grabs it and makes a mess everywhere. So yeah, six-year old is on her final warning. \nSo I guess to answer your question, my six-year old is wearing her play make-up already. So it doesn't, yeah, it doesn't bother me. Young is –\nKatie: How old were you when you started wearing makeup? \nAimee: Well, I love makeup, and that's probably where my daughter got it from. I wanted to wear makeup from a young age, the way my daughter does. I wasn't allowed. It was forbidden. And I first actually managed to buy a secret lipstick when I was about 9 or 10. \nKatie: Secret lipstick. \nAimee: Yeah. I had to hide it from my mom, and she would only let me wear lip gloss when I was that age, and I wasn't allowed to wear any lip sticks, soI had to buy a secret one. And I was always so interested in my grandmother's makeup and my mom's makeup as well. But she never really wore much. She has a very simple sort of beauty routine. \nI'm much more interested in it than she is – she ever was. So I don't know where I inherited that from, but my daughter has definitely inherited that from me. So maybe because it was forbidden for me that's why I was drawn to it more. \nKatie: Makes it more tantalizing. \nAimee: I think so. That could be it, but yeah, it's a real hobby for me. I really, really love it. I wish I had more money to purchase more. You can never have enough. \nKatie: You can never have too many lipsticks.\nAimee: I know. It's true.\nKatie: What do you think about boys wearing makeup? \nAimee: If they want to wear makeup, then they should. Like it annoys me this horrible idea and concept of like men and boys have to be manly, like what is manly? \nFor me, makeup is an art. It really is. It's artistry. And, you know, if they want it, if they're feeling bad about their skin the way I feel bad about my skin, right. If I have pimples or spots, I'm lucky. I get to just cover up with like foundation and concealer, a bit of blusher. It makes me feel better. \nBut, you know, if there's like a boy who has, you know, going through teenage years and he's got bad skin and he wants to cover up, and his macho friends catch him wearing it or whatever people in school catch him wearing it and it can be a really bad situation for him. And I think that is awful. It is really, really terrible. I think boys should wear makeup as they like. \nI actually follow quite a lot of makeup artists on social media. And I look at many, many pictures of different products and the art that they produce, and I follow male makeup artists as well. And the skills they have are unbelievable, honestly. The blending skills. \nKatie: Their contouring. \nAimee: Yeah. \nKatie: Oh my goodness.\nAimee: The blending skills and like covering up, you know, basically just like covering up their whole face and putting a new face on top of it. \nKatie: It's pretty impressive. \nAimee: It's really impressive. It's so amazing. I would really enjoy a makeup lesson from some of the artists that I follow on different social media sites. \nKatie: Absolutely.",

Think of like a cyclone. Now there's all types of activity except for in the dead center where it's really still and quiet. I feel that meditation is a way to get back to that quiet inner self and it's something you need just to keep you settled in everyday life. For me, I'm very used to either bursts of activity or just being still so when I meditate I just like to absolutley sit still. I don't worry about sitting in a lotus position or anything like that. I sit more in a comfortable position and one that's not going to distract me from what I'm trying to do. If I can, I just don't think about anything but if I've got too much on my mind then I'll concetrate on my breathing. I'll pay attention to the rise and fall of my stomach and just count each breath one to five just over and over again and usually it can get me to my center pretty well.Todd: Um, wow, sounds good. When do you meditate and how often do you meditate?Jeanie: I usually meditate in the mornings if I have time. On weekends I usually meditate in the morning. Weekdays I don't usually have time so I meditate at night on those days. I try to find a time that everything around me is very quiet. If there's too much activity going on with other people then well I get easily distracted, and so I try to find a really quiet time and a quiet place to do it.",

Okay.\nTodd: Because I remember when I was younger, back in the day like there were certain foods I hated, certain things I hated to do. As you get older, you know, you kind of learn to adapt and you don’t hate them so much. So for example, you know what is a food that you just really dislike?\nJosh: Yeah. That’s an easy one. I really don’t like pickled plums.\nTodd: Pickled plums, yeah? Why, is it the taste or the texture?\nJosh: Something about just how sour they are and I guess it’s really pickled anything except pickles. So I like pickles but I don’t really like anything else pickled.\nTodd: So like you don’t like pickled carrots? You don’t like pickled...\nJosh: Yeah, pickled herring.\nTodd: Pickled cucumber.\nJosh: Pickled cucumbers, picked artichoke, anything like that.\nTodd: Right. I guess though, pickle is a cucumber, isn’t it?\nJosh: Yeah, a pickle is a cucumber, that’s right.\nTodd: Right. So they do it sometimes, they do it a different way with other cucumbers.\nJosh: Yeah. So I don’t mind pickles, but other kinds of pickling.Todd: Right.  Okay. Is there any other food that you don’t like, like any cooked dish you don’t like, any meat or anything like that?\nJosh: Not really, I basically like all food. That might be a part of being a teenager.\nTodd: Wow! When I was ... even to this day, I still cannot stand liver. I never eat liver. Yeah. Can you eat it?\nJosh: I can eat it. I don’t ... I wouldn’t say I like it but I don’t hate it.\nTodd: Oh man, it tastes like metal. Josh: Yeah. Todd: You know. So, both of us we lived in Asia and they have lots of different meat here than our home country which is America. So for example, tongue, can you eat tongue?\nJosh: Can I eat tongue? I can force it down but I guess I would say I hate tongue, yeah.\nTodd: Yeah. Because like if you go to a Korean barbecue they always have the tongue.\nJosh: Yeah, that’s true. I guess I kind of feel bad because, you know, it’s not actually that bad but just the idea of it being tongue is like, man, I can’t eat that.Todd: It’s actually not the visual for me, I don’t mind that it’s a cow’s tongue, it just, I don't know, it's pretty chewy, it doesn’t taste that good.\nJosh: It’s true, it’s chewy. Yeah.\nTodd: Yeah. Okay, what about if you buy chicken? Lots of cultures like to eat chicken heart.\nJosh: Chicken heart, yeah, not a fan of chicken heart, definitely hate that.\nTodd: Yeah. That’s really chewy, that’s hard to chew.\nJosh: Really chewy, yeah, not good.\nTodd: Yeah. Yeah, okay. What about the cartilage? Sometimes, you ever had like the fried cartilage, like chicken cartilage?\nJosh: I actually have a short story about that sort of, I went to a restaurant and I ordered what I thought was chicken. I asked whether it was chicken and they said, “Oh yeah, it’s chicken.” And when I got it, I took a big bite of one and it was chicken cartilage. And I’ve never had that before and it was like kind of crunchy, it tasted like fried chicken bone or something. I'm not into it. And I called the waitress and asked her what it was and she pointed to her elbow and said, “Chicken elbow.\" And I said “Oh, thank you.” You know, I muscled down a few more and left the rest on the plate but...\nTodd: Yeah, I’m with you, man. I've made that same mistake, yeah. There’s just some stuff. What about pig’s feet?\nJosh: Pig’s feet, yeah. My grandma really loves pig’s feet and she’ll always try to get me to eat pickled pig’s feet and bean pickled and just pig’s feet, not into it.\nTodd: Right. So that was a double whammy, right?\nJosh: Yeah, absolutely.\nTodd: So actually, it’s a triple whammy I guess. Disgusting part of the animal, doesn’t sound, you know, it doesn’t sound good or look good. Yeah, and it’s pickled.Josh: And it's pickled, yeah.",

Anja: Yes, I am.Fred: Oh, I was wondering because I was reading recently and I was wondering what were the traditions of Santa Claus in Switzerland?Anja: Yes, they are quite different I guess from the rest of like America or Canada, because in fact we don't have Santa Claus bringing the Christmas, the presents, on Christmas.Fred: You don't have a Santa Claus bringing presents?Anja: Yeah, that's right. Like, we do have Santa Claus but he's coming on the sixth of December.Fred: The Sixth of December! But us it's the 25th of December.Anja: Yes, that's right.Fred: Oh, wow, that's really different.Anja: Yeah, indeed. Like Santa Claus will bring you presents but it's more like little like presents of nuts or mandarins, or little chocolates.Fred: So he's bringing fruits for Christmas?Anja: Yes, that's right.Fred: Oh, OK.Anja: Because, you know, Santa Claus, he's living in the forest so he....Fred: Wait, wait, wait! Santa Claus lives in the forest. He doesn't live in the North Pole?Anja: Yes, that's right. He lives in the forest.Fred: Wow. OK.Anja: With his little fellow that helps him, you know, collect all the fruits and nuts.Fred: Are they elves?Anja: No, no. It's just one guy, his friend, and it's a little bit difficult to say the name. You won't understand it. With him as his donkey. There's a donkey too. It helps him carry all the presents for the kids, so he will just come to the people's houses and ring a bell, and so, \"I'm here.\"Fred: He rings the bell?Anja: That's right.Fred: And he enters from the front door and then gives the gifts...Anja: That's right.Fred: Oh, he doesn't go through the chimney.Anja: No, oh, yeah, that's right. He just enters the door like, the parents open the door, like, \"Please come in\" and the kids are usually hiding because they are really scared of Santa Claus. Oh, and one more thing, it's quite different, but like the Santa Claus, it's kind of a scary person because if you're actually bad, it's not only that you won't get presents, but he will also put you in a bag and take you away to the forest. Fred: Santa Claus will put the in kids the bag?Anja: Yes.Fred: And then take them away?Anja: Yes, if you were a bad boy or a bad girl he will do that.Fred: Wow, that is something very different from our tradition in Canada. So who is the person that brings the presents on Christmas day?Anja: Yes, that's a good point. Like we have an angel coming down from the heaven and bringing all the presents, actually, someone during the... at one point during the night.Fred: An angel brings the presents on Christmas day and not Santa Claus, wow!Anja: Yes.Fred: I'm very surprised.Anja: That's right.",

Lindsay: No way!Chris: Yeah.Lindsay: You're getting married?Chris: Yep. I'm actually getting married before you, probably in March.Lindsay: Oh, wow. Have you started planning?Chris: Yes, and it's one of those things that once you start, you just can't stop. There's too many decisions.Lindsay: Yeah, I bet, so do you want to have a big wedding like me or do you want a smaller wedding?Chris: No, we think maybe only fifty people, so we're probably only going to keep it quite small. We might just have it in a restaurant somewhere, and we're kind of planning just to have it in front of people and friends, and just people that we really know.Lindsay: Do you think you'll have it in the daytime or at night?Chris: I think probably in the daytime would be nice because a lot of her family are quite old so we're gonna have to keep it before it gets too dark and they all fall asleep.Lindsay: Are you going to hire a photographer or a band?Chris: We'll definitely have a photographer, but we don't really want a band. We would like it a little bit smaller so maybe just a couple of violin players, or maybe a piano.Lindsay: Oh, that sounds nice. And then are you going to hire a florist?Chris: Well, actually we don't have to hire a florist because my fiance is a professionally trained horticulturalist and florist herself so she makes wedding bouquets as part of her job. Lindsay: Oh, so she'll make the flowers for your wedding?Chris: She wants to do some of it and also a lot of her friends will be able to chip in and help out as well.Lindsay: Are you going to choose some wedding colors?Chris: Wedding colors? I don't even know what that means.Lindsay: So for my wedding my colors are red and fuchsia because I like bright colors. Are you gonna choose a shade of colors for your flowers to be and what you'll wear?Chris: I guess that's probably a question you wanna ask my fiance. She's more interested in things like that. I'll know when I see the flowers if they're some kind of theme, but we've not talked about that.Lindsay: Well, one question that I have that I'm confused about: are you going to get someone to video tape it or do you think that it's just enough to have the photographer?Chris: Actually, that's not something that we talked about, but I've been to weddings before where they've had it with someone video taping it, and it always seems a little bit too intrusive. Like someone was having to come up and they're saying, \"Oh, do you want to have a message? Do you want to give a message?\" and suddenly you're on the spot and you don't know what to say, so I think it'll be enough for the photographer and also, we'll have our memories as well so we don't need the video.Lindsay: Right. That's good. Good idea. I do think that afterwards it might be nice to show my kids when they grow up, \"This is when mommy and daddy got married\" on the video camera, but I'm still grappling with that idea if I want to video, someone to video it or not.Chris: Well, I always worry that something embarrassing might happen and then forever that's gonna be up on Youtube or something like that.Lindsay: That's true. That could happen.Chris: If we keep it to photographs, we can just delete it or kind of get rid of that film so, I don't know. We'll talk about that beforehand, but I'm really excited about it.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Hey Jenn, how are you today?\n                              Jen: Hi Todd, I'm fine thank you. How are you?\nTodd: I am doing pretty good. It's kind of getting colder, so I like that, I don't like super hot weather. \nJen: Really, it's kind of opposite for me because I really hate that it's getting colder day by day. \nTodd: Oh you don't like the cooler weather?\nJen: No, my fingers start swelling and it's really tough because you cannot really go outside. You just want to stay in your bed all day, you become very unproductive I guess. \nTodd: Yeah, I guess I can kind of ... Yeah, I know what you mean by that. But, at least in the winter, at least in the fall you can wear warmer clothes so I enjoy that. Although I don't like having to do so much laundry because you wear so many more clothes. In summer, it's just so easy to do your laundry I think. \nJen: Yeah, you're talking about warmer clothes. But the thing is, if it was summer you wouldn't really feel like wearing any warm clothes at all because that would be unnecessary. That's why I would rather go for summer than winter. \nTodd: Well I know, but what I'm saying is that in the summer you don't have to wear so many clothes. You just have a tee shirt, shorts, that's about it, pants. \nJen: Yeah, and your laundry problem would also not exist. \nTodd: Exactly. Although, I don't have that many clothes anyway. I have the same three pairs of pants that I wear, so that's the benefit of being much older. How about you, do you have lots of clothes?\nJen: Yeah, but I think even if I was older I would still have a lot of clothes. Maybe it has to do with me always shopping all the time. \nTodd: Actually, what do you do with your clothes for the season? Do you pack away your clothes for the season? Do you pack away your winter clothes or your summer clothes?\nJen: Yes, actually during winter I pack all my summer clothes and tuck it away somewhere. And during summer, I do the opposite yeah. \nTodd: Yeah, I now am regretting it so much because in the summer it was so hot this summer and I had these big sweatpants and sweaters and they were taking up space in my closet and I just threw them away. And I knew winter was coming and I would regret it, and now I regret it because I have to go buy all new sweatshirts. \nJen: Why would you do that?\nTodd: I just hate clutter and yeah, it was really short sighted wasn't it?\nJen: Yeah, it was. I'm so sorry, but yeah I'm being blunt but you should have just packed it and put it somewhere you couldn't see so it didn't bother you that much. \nTodd: I know. About clothing, how often do you keep clothes? So, you're young but you've reached, you're not going to grow too much anymore, right? You can keep your clothes a long time. Unlike me, unless I get fatter, I'm not going to grow any taller because I'm so much older. I keep my clothes sometimes for like ten years. \nJen: Ten years?\nTodd: Yeah. What about your parents? I bet your dad has shirts and pants that he's had for ten years. \nJen: Yeah, that's true actually my dad does use old clothes. But sometimes I also use his clothes because I think it's kind of cool. \nTodd: It is cool. \nJen: It's like recycling. \nTodd: That's sweet, like so what is a piece of clothing that your dad has that you wear sometimes?\nJen: Actually the jacket that I was wearing yesterday, I got it from my dad and I wear it so much because I love it. \nTodd: But so , it's a woman's jacket?\nJen: No, it's a guy's jacket but I wear it. \nTodd: Oh really, it was his jacket?\nJen: Yes. \nTodd: Oh really? Okay, that is cool. \nJen: And I miss him a lot so that just reminds me of him and that's why I like to wear it a lot. \nTodd: That's really nice. How about your mom, do you share clothes with your mother?\nJen: I'm very thin and she's not so thin, so we cannot share the same clothes. \nTodd: Yeah. My stepfather and I used to always be the same size, and now I'm a little bit bigger than him. And he says that his pants are only 34 inches, which is quite small in America, and I'm like there's no way. It looks like we're the same size, but we're not I guess. \nJen: I mean I could wear my moms clothes, like I did my dad's, because, but then you cannot really do that because if you wear your mom's clothes it will just look like you borrowed clothes from someone. But if you wear your dad's clothes it will look cooler I guess. \nTodd: Right, yeah. I know what you mean. That's cool, how about your friends, do you share clothes with your friends?\nJen: No, not with my friends but with my cousins, sisters, yeah. \nTodd: Oh really, oh nice.",

We're going to see lions and tigers and bears.Lindsay: Oh, my? Actually, I don't really like the zoo.Jake: Why not. I thought everyone liked the zoo.Lindsay: I don't think it's natural for the animals to be in a cage.Jake: Yeah, I can see your point but on the other hand, zoos often rescue the animals in the wild that couldn't survive on their own, and I hear that zoos often take very good care of the animals and they have an even longer life expectancy than they would have in the wild.Lindsay: Yeah, I agree with you. I think the animals do live longer in the zoo, but my problem is more the fact that it's just not natural. For example, I once saw a polar bear in California. A polar bear should not be in a warm climate. It should be in a cold climate where there's snow.Jake: OK, you got me there.Lindsay: Yes, I think I did. But I understand your point that zoos could be good, especially for the animals and the fact that they rescue the animals. I mean, that's nice. But, I think that you know, animals should die in the wild.Jake: Well, I think it's better that they're alive so that people can enjoy them.Lindsay: So you think the purpose of animals is for them to be enjoyed?Jake: No, no, but it's really interesting for us to be able to learn about the animals and see them in person instead of just on TV.Lindsay: I guess I agree with you, but I don't know, I don't really think the purpose of the animals are for our pleasure. I think animals should be out in the wild living freely.Jake: OK, are you opposed to circuses too?Lindsay: Oh, absolutely. I think they're very cruel to animals. Animals should not be there performing and living in close quarters and not being able to move around freely.Jake: Well, I can see your point but I still think zoos and circuses are a lot of fun and I like to go to them a lot.Lindsay: OK, I guess we'll just have to disagree a lot of this one.

        "transcript": "Todd: Jeff, I thought we would talk about healthy lifestyles. Now, you are one of the healthiest people I know. You are very lean. You are very fit, so what is it that keeps you healthy? Jeff: Many things, but I think discipline is one of the most important things. You need to be a disciplined person. A little-bit disciplined person, but saying that, it's not hard to be disciplined because you do things that you like to do, for example I do yoga, and I enjoy yoga so every day I get up in the morning and I do an hour of yoga and this is very good for your body. It's easy to do because I do it in my house, so I don't have to pay expensive gym fees and I don't have to get on a bus and travel thirty minutes to a gymnasium or a fitness center. I can do it right in my house, the front room of my house on a little mat, and I also get up with my girlfriend every morning a five a.m. and we go for a walk for an hour, a nice brisk walk and that's easy to do as well. Just a pair of sneakers and you can walk anywhere.Todd: And now you actually live in a city area, correct?Jeff: Yeah, I live in the city. Yep, in Tokyo, a big, big city, so when I say you've got to be disciplined, you can't use that an excuse. \"Oh, I live in the city so I can't walk.\" It's not true. We walk every day in the world's biggest city, Tokyo.Todd: Well, so basically, one of the pillars of your way of staying healthy is to have discipline to exercise regularly but it doesn't have to be strenuous, just little things.Jeff: A little bit of exercise every day. Something simple. Something easy. Something you like to do, whether it's walking or whether it's riding your bicycle to work instead of taking the subway, or yeah, doing some yoga. Just a little bit of exercise a few days a week and it will help you stay fit and healthy.",

How bout you?\nMichael: Oh, I liked it as well, and I read the book when I was in high school. I like the movies a lot but it still doesn't compare to the first time reading the book. The book was fantastic but of all the adaptations of that book this movie is probably the one, or those three movies are probably the one that I enjoyed the most. \nSimon: Yeah! That's true! A lot of adaptions are really quite terrible aren't they?\nMichael: Which of the three did you like the most?\nSimon: I liked the first one. The first one. It has story and it had, you know, what-will-happen-next anticipation and yeah, but all three were good. \nMichael: Well, it's interesting, you're favorite is a trilogy, and my favorite is a trilogy too, and that's the Godfather trilogy, and my favorite is the second one.\nSimon: Oh, you like the second one. That's surprising! Most people like the first one the best. \nMichael: I like the first one a lot but I like the second one because DeNiro is in it and I like the story of Don Corleone in Sicily as well. \nSimon: Ah, yeah, flashbacks!\nMichael: Yeah, and I think that the real conflict in the story comes out in the second one. More so than in the first. I see the Godfather trilogy to be very similar to a Shakespearean kind of trilogy, tragic, I think that Michael Corleone is a tragic hero and I like Shakespearean trilogies to so perhaps that's why I like it. \nSimon: Oh, that's a really good explanation.",

When I first started I did an introductory course which was just maybe like two days. \nAnd so they just sent you out with all of the equipment, put you in the sea and guided you, but then when I did the real course we started in the swimming pool which was fine and it was all great fun. \nAlthough, there were two men on my course who completely freaked out and had to leave. \nTodd: Oh..\nNicola: Yeah, so that was fine but then they took us out to sea which was a bit different. Yeah,  they made us set up our own equipment, I mean they still checked us and everything so we didn't die but we had to put on our own equipment. We had a diving buddy who I was with and I was with my friend Graham, who I was traveling with anyway and we went down into the sea. We went down maybe fifteen meters. And they always say like 'Don't Panic' just keep breathing normally and everything. But I did kind of panic a bit.\nTodd: Oh, no!\nNicola: So then I rose to the surface really quickly which you know, you're not supposed to do in diving. So I went up really quickly. Luckily we weren't deep enough to do any damage but my diving buddy Graham was having a great time down there looking at shipwrecks and didn't even notice that I was missing.\nTodd: What a terrible guy.\nNicola: Yeah, I know. so, then...\nTodd: Wow! Did they fail him? I hope he failed the course?\nNicola: No, he passed. He paid enough money. He passed. But it meant that I couldn't go diving for the rest of the day cause I had gone down quite deep so that was a shame, but..\nTodd: That's terrible. But you didn't hurt yourself, you didn't come up too fast?\nNicola: No, I was fine in the end but it was a shame because that was the end of my diving day. But we had a few more days to do it. \nTodd: So now you are comfortable diving. You don't freak out anymore?\nNicola: I don't freak out anymore but I couldn't go diving now on my own because it has been so long. Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Okay Monica, we're going to debate winning and sports, especially for young people. So do you think that winning should be stressed with sports, with, let's say high school athletes?\nMonica: Well, it depends on the situation and what they're training for, but generally I think that winning is overemphasized in sport. I think that participation is more important. Yeah.\nTodd: Why would you say that?Monica: Well, I think if you concentrate too much on winning, then the problem is, if you don't win, you don't enjoy the sport, so the emphasis is shifted from enjoyment to basically results, so I think it can be quite damaging.Todd: Right. I kind of agree with what you're saying. And actually, I played high school sports, and I was never very good. And I always wish I participated more than I did, but I actually think that the focus on winning in some ways is quite important, and that it does serve a good purpose to have a focus on winning rather than on participation.I think the main reason is because when you focus on winning, that drives everybody to be better. So if you want to win, if you want to be on the team, etc., you have to force yourself to be better, and it's the carrot on the end of the stick. And it makes people train harder, work harder, it sets a goal for them, and it kind of prepares them for life that sometimes you fail, and sometimes you don't get what you want. And so that's why sports and the whole focus on winning is good because it's exactly how life is in the real world.Monica: I would tend to argue the other way and say that actually sport doesn't reflect life in terms of winning and losing. I mean, let's take a work situation. It's not about winning or losing, it's about cooperating with people that you work with, and so, if you have had an upbringing where you've been in a sports team that has been overly competitive, you could transfer that competitiveness into a workplace and it can be counterproductive because it may mean that you... you're just not very good at being a team player in a work environment.Todd: That's actually a really good point. But you can also argue that actually, you know, even a work environment is like sport in that you have teamwork, and you have to work together, and if you don't work together in a very productive way, maybe you'll be out of a job, or your company won't be productive, so you need to have that instinct to continually drive to be better; to be better than other people. And it sounds really brutal, but I think that's just how business works.Monica: Well you're talking about work being business, but I mean, I'm a teacher, and... it brings me to quite an interesting discussion that's taking place now in teaching, which is two different, kind of political views really, in terms of teachers because people want high standards in terms of their teachers. And one idea is to rate teachers in comparison to other teachers, and basically give the top teachers incentives so that they get paid more than teachers who aren't as good as them. But the counter-argument to that is that it creates a really hostile environment in the workplace, and in a school where you really need teachers to work together, I'm not sure that that's the best way to go.Todd: Yeah, well that's another debate for another day.Monica: Is that a cop out or what?",

And next step is \"If you are free\" oh, you always have to check if she's either married, or if she's a lesbian, or if she is single.George: OK.Crystal: So, number three is what you're looking for.George: OK, number three.Crystal: So, if she is single, just say, hey, how about we go out for a cup of coffee or something.George: OK, coffee.Crystal: And, yeah, that's how you get her.George: So, yeah, what if she doesn't like coffee though? I mean, what else could we do we on a date? Assuming she will say yes. What's fun to do on a date anyway?Crystal: Fun to do on a date! It's just the fact that you're being with her and just try to get to know her more.George: Wait, wait, wait one second. Do I need to pay for this?Crystal: I don't think you should pay on the first date. I think sometimes that can be offensive to women.George: Oh, that's great because I'm totally broke.Crystal: I think you should just ask her casually, not like a date-date, just say, \"Hey, I would like to know you a little bit more, and just go out for a small little drink, like go to that new cafe that's open, like a lot of girls think that place is so cute. I think you should take her there.George: But I think cafe's are boring.Crystal: Cafe's are boring. Men! Women don't think so. This is the point. Write it down.",

        "transcript": "Gyri: What are some talents you\n                wish you had?\n                    Viyasan: I would say this talent\n                      spreads a long time back and it's always something\n                      I'm very envious about. I don't have the best memory and so I\n                      really wish that my talent was to remember a lot\n                      easier or even have photographic\n                        memory. I think that would be very\n                      useful, especially as a student during exams where\n                      we're able to read quite a bit and remember all of\n                      it. I think that talent would be interesting to\n                      have because I wouldn't always be forgetting daily\n                      things, like my keys to my apartment. \nGyri: Right. \nViyasan: Or for example, my\n                      water bottle every single time I leave for class.\n                      I think memory is very important and it's very\n                      good to remember certain conversations with\n                      people. For example, sometimes I might have a\n                      conversation with someone and completely forget\n                      that I talked about that topic and then just be\n                      reminded of it when I talk to that person the next\n                      time. \nGyri: Yeah. \nViyasan: I think having a better\n                      memory or photographic memory would be great for\n                      those situations. \nGyri: Yeah, definitely. \nViyasan: And yourself? What are\n                      some talents that you wish you had? \nGyri: I wish that I could dance.\n                      I have no rhythm at all. \nViyasan: Yeah. \nGyri: I feel so stupid when like\n                      if we go out or we listen to music, I just look\n                      really goofy when\n                      I try to dance, but I feel like dancing so I still\n                      try, but it just looks horrible. Yeah, I wish I\n                      had more rhythm and the ability to learn dance\n                      moves, I guess. \nViyasan: Yeah, I would say that\n                      dancing is definitely a talent that some people\n                      have. Likewise, I do not have any rhythm so I'll\n                      join you on that same dance floor. \nGyri: Yeah. \nViyasan: Even though I like to\n                      dance, I don't dance very well. \nGyri: Yeah. Yeah, I wish that I\n                      was better at sports as well. I really like\n                      downhill skiing, for example, but I never skied a\n                      lot, like my dad, he skied professionally when he\n                      was young, and I'm kind of bitter that he didn't\n                      take me up to the hills more than he did because\n                      if I had started at a young age I could be really\n                      good right now, but I didn't, so I'm a casual\n                      skier but I really wish that I could be like\n                      better than average in something, especially a\n                      sport. \nViyasan: Got it, got it. \nGyri: Do you play any sports\n                      besides basketball? \nViyasan: Basketball is my main\n                      sport. I used to play a little bit of volleyball\n                      when I was in high school and so I played the\n                      position of setter and so that was very fun. It\n                      took a lot of accuracy. I think if I had to be a\n                      little bit more talented, it would be at jumping\n                      because if I was able to jump a lot more, I would\n                      be able to fake my sets and just hit the ball down\n                      on the opponent's\n                      side. That would be a cool talent to have if I was\n                      able to jump maybe five to ten more inches higher\n                      than I usually did. I still remember that my\n                      vertical was 26 inches when I was in grade nine or\n                      grade ten and so maybe if I added a couple more\n                      inches onto that I would've been able to perform\n                      in more creative ways. \nGyri: Yeah. \nViyasan: Yeah. \nGyri: Can you dunk a basketball? \nViyasan: That depends on how\n                      high the rim is. If it's five feet or six feet,\n                      definitely, but on a standard regulation net,\n                      which is probably nine or 9.5 feet, I cannot. \nGyri: Okay. \nViyasan: But maybe if I had the\n                      talent of jumping extremely high, I would be able\n                      to dunk a basketball but no. \nGyri: Can you dribble with your\n                      left hand? \nViyasan: Of course. I can dribble with my let\n                      hand, I can dribble with my right hand, I can\n                      dribble between my legs. I've done a lot of\n                      different types of basketball drills when I was on\n                      the high school team and so yeah, I'm pretty good\n                      at handling the basketball. Shooting, driving to\n                      the net, and passing it a lot quite a bit, so\n                      yeah, pretty efficient with the basketball. \nGyri: Yeah, that's impressive. \nViyasan: I just can't dunk. \nGyri: Okay, yeah. Can you shoot\n                      with your left hand? \nViyasan: Mm, no, I cannot. I\n                      can't shoot with my left hand. I can do a lay up\n                      with my left hand, but I can't shoot the ball\n                      naturally like a free throw or three point shot\n                      with my left hand. \nGyri: Okay. What exactly is a\n                      lay up? \nViyasan: A lay up is when you\n                      drive towards the net, you're allowed to take two\n                      steps while holding the basketball and so that's\n                      usually how people when they're very close to the\n                      net, they do a lay up or they're also able to\n                      convert a lay up into a dunk so they're able to\n                      take two steps and dunk towards the basketball\n                      net. \nGyri: Okay. \nViyasan: Yeah, that's a little\n                      bit of basketball knowledge for you. \nGyri: Yeah, got it.",

Anja: Oh, yeah, you know Fred, I think it depends on the person, right? But usually in Switzerland people like to give gifts that have, like, some personal meaning, you know? It doesn't really matter how much they cost, you know, maybe if you buy a really expensive present, you feel a little bit like, \"Ah, this is too expensive,\" you know? So it's really nice to give maybe a picture in a frame or something like that. Mothers like that a lot.Fred: Yeah, I think gifts to mothers are really important. So, how much money would you say you spend on your gifts in general for Christmas?Anja: Oh, I'm sure it's maybe like 200 Swiss Francs. It's maybe like a 100 US dollars.Fred: 100 US dollars. Anja: Yes, but I really think it depends on the person, you know. But one thing that I really dislike about Christmas is the shopping, you know.Fred: You dislike the shopping?Anja: Yes. I love shopping, you know, but usually, but during Christmas I really don't like it because I always tell myself, I will start in November because no one will go shopping in November for Christmas presents.Fred: I see.Anja: But usually I end up going shopping on the 24th of December.Fred: The 24th of December! That's a bit late, isn't it?Anja: It is. That's why it's such a hassle. Yes, indeed. One thing that is interesting in Switzerland maybe is at one point you kind of, you don't receive presents anymore from your family members, like when you are a kid, you know.Fred: Really, your grandparents and your parents don't give you gifts anymore.Anja: Yeah, not really, you know, because you start being a grown-up, you know, and you know, it costs a lot of money. They bought you so much during your childhood, so maybe when you turn 18, 19, 20, they're like, \"Ah, it's OK\" you know. You don't expect a present anymore. That's one thing in Switzerland.",

        "transcript": "Mike: Hey, Mari. So, we're comparing places this week and you've lived in two great cities: Tokyo and New York and you speak both English and Japanese so you must know them very well, so can you tell me about the people in the places? Mari: In New York City, the people are friendly. If you're lost in the subway or you're not sure which bus to take, if you ask someone, even though they look pretty busy or absorbed they'll be willing to tell you which way you are supposed to go, and they'll be very blunt and tell you if they don't know which one you're supposed to take. When you go into the stores, the people in the stores are... they like to make small talk with you. They're interested in you as a person in terms of where you're from or you know, what you are looking for that day and why you are looking for that item. I think in Tokyo, if you are in the subway station, or the train station, the JR people or the subway people are very helpful in terms of which subway you're supposed to go on, or to help you get to that destination, but when you go into the stores, the clerks are very helpful in terms of finding whatever you're looking for, but I think because of the culture, they're not... they don't delve into your personal life as much as the shop attendants in New York.Mike: So in terms of food, how does it differ between New York and Tokyo?Mari: I think New York and Tokyo both have very international foods. In both cities, you can find foods from all over the world. I think that because New York City is a city of immigrants, you get very... the people who cook the foods are from that country, while in Japan I feel like if you go to a Mexican restaurant and you see like a Japanese person cooking the Mexican food, so I think that the cuisine, the international cuisine in New York City is more real versus the one in Japan.Mike: So, if you had to eat one thing in New York and one thing in Tokyo, what would it be?Mari: Oh, my gosh, that's a very difficult question. In New York City I would eat pizza. I think that they have the best pizza in the world. If you like greasy, cheesy pizza. In Japan, I really like the Italian food in Japan. I know that it's not very authentic Italian food but I think they do a really good job with Italian food here.Mike: Oh, that's interesting. So, in terms of shopping, where would you like to shop more?Mari: I feel like I'm going to be biased towards New York City but I think that the shopping in New York City is a lot better. The primary reason being that it's just cheaper.",

So how did you do it?\n\nAl: I just, I went out and I had the best New Year's Eve I've ever had in my life, where I went to a music party, a club, and I smoked and drank as much as I wanted for about 12 hours. I finally left at 9 in the morning on New Year's Day, my lungs dry and and then decided I'm never going to do this and stopped.\nTodd: Wow, I mean, you must have had, you know, addictions, you must have wanted to have a cigarette a couple days later.\n\nAl:You know, I've stopped smoking several times and had very bad cravings before, and this time it was, a couple of times I felt like I might like one, but no, I didn't have any nicotine cravings. I was ready this time I think.\n\nTodd:So you just think where your body reaches a point where you can take no more.\n\nAl: Yeah definitely, and your mind reaches a point where you're sickened by your own disgusting behavior\nTodd: Right, so what do you think about smoking now?\n\nAl: I hate it. I'm completely, I'm totally anti-smoking, and I used to be very liberal about people's rights to smoke and now I think it should be completely . It should be illegal to buy tobacco.\n\nTodd: Wow, they should just make it illegal.\n\nAl: Make it illegal. It kills people.\nTodd: So what is your message to smoker? If someone out there is smoking today, they're a smoker, they want to quit, what's your message to them?\n\nAl:I read a really good, I'm reading a really cool book at the moment about therapy and in one of these stories in this book one guy says, imagine you have a pet dog, and you love this pet dog, and the pet dog is you body, now would you give poisoned, say you went to the pet store and you saw these cans of dog food with a poison mark on them, poisoned flavored dog food containing poison, would you buy that poison dog food and feed it to your dog? No, you wouldn't. That's exactly what you're doing to your body when you smoke. You're deliberately poisoning yourself so stop it.\n\nTodd: Well, good message and so for all of you people out there who are smoking, STOP!",

Fred: Well, Anja, the routine in Canada for Christmas is quite simple. The kids get very excited on the 25th because early in the morning, at around seven o'clock, that's when we open the gifts.Anja: Oh, you open the gifts in the morning?Fred: That's right.Anja: Oh, wow.Fred: At around seven o'clock in the morning, we... well, as I kid I remember being so unbelievably excited, so at night, I don't think I could sleep. I was too excited about waking up early in the morning and then opening my gifts. So what we do is that the parents put the gifts under the Christmas tree, and then early on the 25th, in the morning we all gather around the Christmas tree and then, one-by-one, we open the gifts.Anja: So you open the gifts in your pajamas, and then you...Fred: That's right. But that's not the most exciting part of the day.Anja: Oh, it's not? What is then?Fred: No, the food is.Anja: The food.Fred: The food is the most exciting part of the day. Well, in Canada we eat lots of, as you may know, we have maple syrup.Anja: Oh, yes, that's right. You are really famous for that, right?Fred: For maple syrup. Maple syrup is something that Canadian people love eating during the Christmas holidays and so all of the time through the week of the 25th until New Year's Eve, the first of January, we cook many kind of different dishes and we just put maple syrup on it.Anja: Oh, really. For instance, what do you eat? Is there some traditional food you have for Christmas in Canada?Fred: Of course. We have traditional food. As you may know, pancakes.Anja: Of course.Fred: Yes.Anja: I love my pancakes.Fred: You do, you do, yeah. Yeah, I love pancakes, too. We put maple syrup on it. Oh, it's so good, you know, and you know what else is really good?Anja: What is?Fred: We fry pig's ears.Anja: Oh my god, you do?Fred: Yeah, it's delicious, and the tongue of the pig as well. We fry it. And then we put maple syrup on it.Anja: Oh, wow, I didn't know that. That's quite interesting.Fred: Yeah, it's delicious. You should try it one day.Anja: Oh, I will definitely.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Lois have you ever been to a professional football match in England? \n\t\t\t            Lois: Yes, I have. I support a team called Leicester city, and when I used to be at university I used to live in Leicester. I used to go to quite a few of their matches. \n\t\t\t            Todd: OK, so what's it like when you go to a professional game?\n\t\t                Lois: So first of all, the fans are all separated, because in England there's sometimes violence at football, so they like to keep the fans away from each other, and there's always a lot of police there, but I've never been at a match where there's been any trouble, so that's been OK. Um, the atmosphere is normally amazing because the smallest grounds hold about 20,000 people, so you get quite a good crowd, and because their stadiums are quite small, you're quite close to the pitch, so my team weren't very good though, so often my team would lose, so it wasn't so good, but when they one it was fantastic. Really, really good atmosphere and lots of fun. \n\t\t                Todd: That's cool. So how much does it cost to get it?\n\t                    Lois: See again, it's quite expensive so maybe now for the lower teams it probably, cheapest ticket is 25 pounds, but for example if you wanted to go and see Manchester United play, play then maybe 50 pounds or more, but it's really really difficult to get tickets for Manchester United because everybody has a season ticket, so if you want to go and watch them you have to know somebody who can get you a ticket. It's difficult to just buy a ticket for those games. \n\t                    Todd: Do you like Manchester United?\n                        Lois: I think there a good team. I think that the reason a lot of people don't like them is because they used to win all the time, so now they don't win so much, because now Arsenal win most of the time. So I think they're a good team, but I don't think you can like them if you're not from Manchester. \n                        Todd: So Leicester is a very hard word to spell. I take it it's not L-E-S-T-E-R, no?\n                        Lois: No. If you were an American you would probably pronounce it Lie-Se-Ster, so it's spelled L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R.\n                        Todd: Well, again! One more time!\n                        Lois: L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R\n                        Todd: Wow, that's quite a handful. Alright, thanks, Lois.",

We have our fish, our meat, our wines, our fruits, our veggies, we eat all kinds of food.\nAde: Yeah, I know.  But I mean what is popular about Belgium food?\nChris: Well if you talk about gastronomy, it’s a bit different in Belgium as I think it is in Spain.  I mean in Belgium we really enjoy the tables.  We don’t go out for dinner that often but when we go out we stay on a table for four hours.  I mean it starts with little entrants, then it’s maybe a soup, then it’s the main dish, then it’s still an ice-cream or something.  I mean it takes long so we really enjoy [0:01:00.4] and it goes slow.  For example, at Christmas, for Christmas we meet at maybe 5:30, 6 o’clock and then we start already with aperitifs and it goes all night long, I think we eat from 6 o’clock in the afternoon till 12 o’clock at night.\nAde: Wow!  So you must be fat people there in Belgium if you eat that much.\nChris: Well that’s why I just said, we don’t do it that often, but if we do it we really enjoy it and then of course next day or next few days you see people just don’t eat anything.",

There's many different people in Dublin, different types of people.\n\t\t\t             I do not think that Dublin has the mental stimuli, or does not have the hardcore atmosphere that somewhere like Tokyo could possibly have, so you have many types of people who are happy living in Dublin, going to the same places, the same bars, same restaurants, yet I feel that Tokyo has a lot more to offer because it's more hardcore. \n\t\t                There's so much stuff to do. Simple things like Karaoke, non-drink related activites that you can do over here which is great, so I wanted to get away from Ireland.

        "transcript": "Todd: Jen, we're talking about gifts. We were talking about giving gifts before. Now let's talk about receiving gifts. What is the best and worst gift you have received?\nJen: Why don't you go first.\nTodd: Sure. Mine is easy. My step-father made a basketball hoop for me in our driveway. He made it for my birthday. It was pretty cool because, he put it up in one day. I had a car at that time, so I would have seen him making it, but I just came home one day, and there was a big basketball hoop with a big bow around it. It was on my birthday, and it was great. I used it every day and I had nieces and nephews. They used it. I had all my friends in the neighborhood come over. We had basketball tournaments. It was a really good gift.\nJen: That's really cool. It's so nice of him that he would go through all that, and give you such a special gift. \nTodd: Yeah. The funny thing about it is, I think he really regretted it because, he wasn't thinking how loud a basketball would be when you bounce it. So when you would bounce the basketball, it made this really loud noise, echoing sound down the street. My dad was great. He was really cool.\nJen: That's really nice.\nTodd: Yeah. It was nice. So how about you? Do you have a really special gift?\nJen: For me, my special gift would be, my mom once made a suit. A pair of socks for me. They were really cute with little flowers on the right side of the socks. I would wear them every day when I was a kid. I though that was really special. I still have them in my bag.\nTodd: Oh really? Wow.\nJen: Yeah. Winter is coming. I'm going to use it again.\nTodd: Socks wear out pretty easily. You've really kept them in good condition.\nJen: Yeah. She probably used really good wool because, it's still there, and I still wear it a lot.\nTodd: That's great. What about a bad gift? Or a gift that you were not so crazy about.\nJen: I don't know if it's okay to say I have a bad gift or something. But, yeah, once I did get a very big teddy bear from a friend who loved toys, by the way. She thought that I would love it as much as she did. She gave me this big toy, and I didn't know what to do with it. I was so embarrassed by it that I would actually hide it in my closet so that other friends cannot see it. Yeah. Every time she came to my house I would take it out and put it on my bed, but I hated that teddy.\nTodd: Oh no. Wow.\nJen: What about your worst gift?\nTodd: Yeah. For me, a very close person to me, a good friend, bought me a shirt. It was lime green. It was so ugly. The texture also was really kind of rough. It had this ribbed texture. I knew the minute I saw it I would never wear it, ever. I felt bad because, this person would come over to my house, and you could see where I kept my clothes in my closet. It was a very small room. That lime green shirt was just always there.\nJen: That's so funny. What did you do with it? Did you wear it?\nTodd: I was thinking of a million ways to get rid of it. I would wear it occasionally, if I knew my friend was going to come around and I wasn't going outside. I knew I had to wear it one or two times. Then, I used it to mop up some coffee once, and then I threw it out.\nJen: What?\nTodd: I know. \nJen: That's so crazy.\nTodd: I know. But, it wasn't quite so bad because, there was actually two shirts. My friend bought the shirts, two for one, I guess. I still have the white shirt. But the lime green one, I got rid of. Yeah.\nJen: You know what? You could have actually worn it during winter and put on a sweater on top of it, and then a coat or something. You didn't really have to do that. That's kind of mean.\nTodd: It is actually. It is mean. I don't know why, but for some reason, I really did not like the color. I just don't like lime green. I don't like neon colors, and I would see that bright, neon color all the time. \nJen: I understand what you feel, but I do feel bad for your friend, though.\nTodd: I know. So am I a bad person?\nJen: I don't know.\nTodd: No comment?\nJen: No, you're not a bad person. Everyone has some problem with colors and stuff. I guess it's fine.\nTodd: Have you ever had something that just rubbed you the wrong way? For some reason, you look at it and it was an eyesore. You just hated looking at it. Like a piece of clothing, or maybe something in your house.\nJen: Besides that toy I got, which I actually kind of like nowadays just because, it's with me and when I own something, after some time, I end up liking them because, they're mine, you know?\nTodd: Yeah. It grows on you.\nJen: Exactly.\nTodd: Actually, just thinking about that lime shirt, it is growing on me now, and now I really regret it. I with I had kept it.\nJen: Too bad. You already spilled some coffee on it.",

        "transcript": "Presenter 1: Today we are going to talk about names, particularly fashions in names, you know, the kind of names famous people use for their children. You’ve been looking into this recently, haven’t you Finn?\nPresenter 2: I have indeed and it’s a fascinating topic. The US leads here with new names and we in Britain follow sometimes, but we tend to go for the more traditional names. So, the big trend is using nouns as names.\nPresenter 1: Nouns, what sort of nouns?\nPresenter 2: Well they can be abstract qualities like Honor or Passion. There’s a long tradition of this kind of name, like Faith or Charity, which used to be common names. A new name is Haven, that’s growing in popularity. And similar names like Shelter, Harbor and Bay also convey feelings of safety and warmth.\nPresenter 1: Mmm. I suppose Passion is used to mean ‘extreme enthusiasm’ nowadays, and people use the word a lot, so maybe it’s a good choice for a modern name. Haven has a nice, safe feel to it.\nPresenter 2: OK, then there are names which come from nature or animals, although with some of these it’s hard to know whether they come from nature or a surname – that’s another trend. Here we have Frost, Wolf, Fox, Bear, for boys, of course. And a new name: Ridge.\nPresenter 1: Ridge, like a mountain ridge? The top of a mountain range?\nPresenter 2: Yes, weird, huh? It’s seen as a tough, outdoorsy name for a boy. OK, then there are musical names. Harmony and Melody have been around for ages, but Lyric is a new one.\nPresenter 1: Lyric, wow!\nPresenter 2: Yes, it came in at number 325 in the US a couple of years ago. That doesn’t sound very popular, but there are so many different names being used at the moment that it means it isn’t so unusual. Other noun categories are months – May, June and April are common, but January is uncommon and November very unusual. And then you have colours. Beyoncé and Jay-Z called their daughter Blue Ivy – a very distinctive name, a colour plus the name of a plant. Blue is very popular for girls right now, and Red or Grey for boys.\nPresenter 1: I’ve just thought of another category. Food names, like Olive or Clementine.\nPresenter 2: Yes, that’s another one. Flower names are pretty common, but food names are unusual. Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin named their daughter Apple, of course.\nPresenter 1: Yes, poor child.\nPresenter 2: Actually, Apple is becoming more and more popular, although people think that’s because of the technology connection, not the fruit. New names always seem strange at first, but you quickly get used to them, like all the names from places or jobs. Chelsea and Brooklyn seem like normal names now; they were strange when they were first used. Taylor, Mason, Cooper are all first names from jobs.\nPresenter 1: And they are also surnames, I think that’s how they started.\nPresenter 2: You’re probably right there.\nPresenter 1: What about the Beckhams’ daughter, Harper?\nPresenter 2: She was named after Harper Lee, the American novelist who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. That’s another trend, naming children after famous writers, musicians – the British band One Direction have had an effect on names – or fictional characters, like Bella or Edward from the Twilight series, or Hermione from Harry Potter.\nPresenter 1: Sorry, can I just interrupt there. I’ve just has a message passed on by the producer. A listener has just phoned in with a very strange story about a family in Holland with six children. Their names are all anagrams of the letters: A, E, L and X.\nPresenter 2: Ah yes, I’ve heard about this. This family are famous in the world of bloggers on names. Let me see if I remember the names … Alex and Axel … and Lexa – they’re the easy ones – Xela ('Zela') and Xael ('Zay-el') and the last one is Xeal ('Zeal') – I’m guessing about the pronunciations, by the way.\nPresenter 1: You mean there are names X-E-L-A and X-A-E-L?\nPresenter 2: Yes, but they are very unusual. I think the Dutch family are stopping at six children, but there are about eighteen more possible anagrams they could use.\nPresenter 1: Nooo, you’re kidding!\nPresenter 2: All seem horrible to me, but all are possible names. This is similar to another trend of giving children names all starting with the same letter, like the Kardashian family, all beginning with K, Kim, Kourtney and so on.\nPresenter 1: The Kardashians have had enough publicity, let’s not talk about them. What about your name? Finn, that sounds like a good Irish name …",

Ok, the first one: coffee, tea or water in the morning?Eucharia: Water.Todd: Water!Eucharia: Yeah, when I wake up I usually have 2 glasses of water and then at the moment I’m trying not to drink coffee and not to drink caffeine so at the moment it’s water but if I were given a choice normally it would be coffee.Todd: Ok how about at night time. You’re at a party, which would you rather have: beer, wine or a cocktail?Eucharia: It depends on the party. If I’m going dancing, cocktail. If I’m going out eating, wine and if it’s just friends getting together, beer.Todd: You’re on an aeroplane and you’re flying across the ocean. What would you prefer to read: newspaper, a magazine or a book?Eucharia: A book, definitely.Todd: A book, why a book? That was a very strong answer!Eucharia: I love reading. I have to read every night before I go to sleep for maybe 30 minutes so I really enjoy reading and I find that I emotionally engage with the book and what’s happening in the book and I forget the fact that I’m on a 12 hour inter-continent flight.Todd: Ok you have to choose between 3 seasons: summer, fall or winter.Eucharia: Summer.Todd: Summer?Eucharia: I love sunshine, I love heat, I can’t stand rain, which is why I don’t live in my home country and I don’t like snow.Todd: Ok I’m with you on that. Ok next one. To pass the time at night you can watch TV, you can check the internet or you can watch a movie, a dvd. What would you prefer?Eucharia: Probably watching a dvd because, yeah if I’m on the internet I’m on the internet at work and so I don’t want to go on the internet late at night because I start thinking too much and I can’t sleep.Todd: Ok last one. You’re at the beach. Would you prefer to: play a sport on the beach, on the sand; go in the water and swim or surf; or lie on the beach and get a tan?Eucharia: Lie on the beach and get a tan! Yep, I’m from a country we don’t see a lot of sunshine so I still get very excited when I see sunshine. Maybe I’ll go to the beach and maybe I’ll go to the water and swim a bit but my favourite thing is to lie on the beach and get a tan.Todd: Thanks Eucharia.Eucharia: You’re welcome.",

Do you prefer working in a group or do you prefer working alone? \nJeff: That's a tough question. \nTim:  It definitely is because there is good things about both.\nJeff: That's right. That's right, so I guess I'm good at working by myself because I am self-motivated so if I am doing something I like and I can get it done quickly I like to do it by myself, but if I'm working with a good team, a fun team, people who work hard and they all want to do a good job and get the job done well, then I think a team is fun, but you need guys, you need people, men and women, who work hard to do a good job so I prefer working in a team. \nTim: Yeah, well, that's understandable. How about, do you prefer working and having a uniform or do you prefer putting on whatever you want to put on? \nJeff: I think uniforms are pretty cool \nTim:  Oh, really. \nJeff:  I think if you have a uniform too, sometimes you get respect. If you are are fireman or a policeman, you tend to get a bit of respect from the public but I wouldn't want a cheesy uniform with, you know, sort of like a strange hat or a funny looking bowtie. I wouldn't be into that, so. \nTim: Have you had any jobs with uniforms? \nJeff: Any jobs with uniforms? No, I don't think I ever had. If you call a shirt and tie a uniform, then yeah, but no, no funny hats or bow ties or anything. \nTim: So, how about a working schedule? Would you prefer working a flexible schedule with like flex time, or would you prefer set hours: come at this time, finish at this time. \nJeff: Definitely, definitely flex hours. \nTim: Yeah, why is that? \nJeff:  I think that a nine-to-five job is difficult to do. If you want to take some holidays, be with your family, or go on a vacation, or if the surfs up and it's a nice day you can go and just grab your board and go for surf but if you're on a nine-to-five job, you have no flexibility so definitely flex hours. \nTim:  So we are talking a little bit about hours. Do you prefer being paid by the hour or do you prefer a salary? \nJeff:  I think salary maybe is a better way to go because then if take holidays you get paid and if you're working paid by the hour, that style of work, you can't take anytime off because you know when you're not working, you're not getting paid so I think salary is a good way to go but as long as I'm getting paid, I don't really mind which way it is. \nTim: Yeah, that's understandable.",

        "transcript": "Presenter: Next on the programme we have an interview with someone who has been writing a book about high-achieving teenagers. Welcome, Louise Hardy.\nLouise: Hi, it’s lovely to be here.\nPresenter: Louise, many of these teenagers who have achieved success and fame early on, have done so through using new technology, haven’t they? Through blogging or using YouTube or Twitter?\nLouise: Absolutely, and the greatest example of this is Justin Bieber. As I think everyone on the planet knows, he started off by posting videos on YouTube at the age of 14 and was spotted by a talent scout who worked with the R&B singer Usher. After that he very rapidly became a worldwide sensation.\nPresenter: I heard that last year he was said to be more influential than Obama!\nLouise: (laughs) Yes, that was because he is number one on Twitter. He has over 35 million followers. There’s a new one every two seconds. A company that analyses social media called Klout said that he is the most influential person in the world because of that. But whether he’s really more influential than Obama, well …\nPresenter: Mmmm. All this exposure has negative consequences for young people too, doesn’t it?\nLouise: Yes. Although millions adore Justin, a lot of people don’t. One of his videos was the most disliked ever. And he has a big problem with privacy. He’s followed everywhere by the paparazzi, and that’s bad for anyone, never mind a teenager.\nPresenter: OK, let’s turn to a very different teenager. Tavi Gevinson was even younger when she began, wasn’t she?\nLouise: Yes, she was only eleven years old when she started a fashion blog called Style Rookie. By the way, for British listeners, 'Rookie' is an American word used for a person who is new to something.\nPresenter: Thanks.\nLouise: On her blog she posted photos of herself wearing unusual combinations of clothes and wrote about them.\nPresenter: Some of them were quite weird.\nLouise: Well, yes, I suppose a lot of high fashion is weird. Anyway, she quickly built up a huge following, up to 300,000 readers per day, and many of them were adults. Serious fashion magazines interviewed her and sent her to fashion shows in Europe and to meet top designers, like Karl Lagerfeld.\nPresenter: Some people didn’t believe she was as young as she was, did they?\nLouise: No, one magazine printed an article saying the writer didn’t believe Tavi was only 12, and that upset her. But she bounced back and continued blogging. Then, as she grew older, Tavi became interested in other things besides fashion. In 2011, when she was 15, she started Rookie Magazine, an online magazine for teenagers. In less than a week it had one million readers.\nPresenter: I’ve seen it. It’s very impressive, isn’t it? All teenage girls listening, check out Rookie Magazine.\nLouise: Yes, I think it’s fantastic and Lady Gaga called Tavi 'the future of journalism'! She employs about 50 writers and photographers – both adults and teenagers – on Rookie, but she is the editor with overall control.\nPresenter: And all this time she’s continued to lead a normal life, hasn’t she?\nLouise: Oh yes, she lives a very normal life in a small town and goes to school and so on. She’s not even twenty yet. But I think writing and editing are very different from being a performing artist. There’s a lot less pressure from fans and the press. Although some actors, like Emma Watson, seem to manage a private life and getting a normal education.\nPresenter: Yes, Emma Watson is now in her twenties, of course, but …",

And that stresses me out for her safety. \nSo there are times where I wish I could phone her or text her, but she doesn't have a phone. And I do believe that six is far too young to have a phone. \nKatie: A little bit too young. \nAimee: Yes. So purely for security reasons, I think probably around 11 or 12. \nKatie: How old were you when you first got your phone. \nAimee: Well, I'm an old person so, you know, people didn't have mobile phones. I was reaching the end of high school. I was, I think, 17 when I got my first mobile phone. And it was a big brick. But again, that was for, you know, I guess security reasons. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: My parents got it for me. I was going out, you know, I started going out at night, going to concerts. And I was beginning to be allowed going into bars and things at 17, 18. So yeah, it was a good security thing. My parents were appreciative of being able to contact me. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: How about you? How old were you when you first got your mobile phone? \nKatie: Oh goodness. I was about 12 or 13. I was really young. \nAimee: Okay. \nKatie: And I only got my first mobile phone or my first cellphone because my best friend who got the same one and I wanted to send like picture messages to her. It was back in the old days where you can send a photo, you can take photos. \nAimee: Picture messages. \nKatie: Picture messages. \nAimee: I couldn't even send picture messages. Mine was just texts, like pressing the same button over and over again. \nKatie: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So I never really used it as like a way of security. I just used it to send really overpriced picture messages to my friend for absolutely no reason. It was such a waste. And to play Snake. Do you remember Snake?\nAimee: Oh yeah, Snake. \nKatie: Like the little game that you could play on your phone.\nAimee: Yup, yup. \nKatie: Yeah. I didn't use it for a good use, I think. I just used it to waste time.\nAimee: Fair enough. Well, you're 12, you said, right? \nKatie: Twelve, thirteen, yeah. \nAimee: That sounds age appropriate, I think, age appropriate use.\nKatie: Yeah. It's a good time to start wasting your time. \nAimee: Yeah. \nKatie: Get ahead to start wasting time. \nAimee: Yeah. \n[End of Transcript]",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Rebecca, let's talk about things we wish could do that we can't do. What is something you wish you could do, that you can't do now? Rebecca: I think it would be definitely playing music, like playing a guitar. Some of my friends can just pull out a guitar and start singing and then you have everybody around and it's such a great night. I just wish I could join them and actually, yeah, have fun with that as well, but no, I can't play guitar.Todd: So, if you could play any instrument, it would be the guitar?Rebecca: Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I have played piano and saxophone before but not overly that well.Todd: Oh, really so you actually had musical training?Rebecca: Yeah, when I was in high school.Todd: In the piano and the saxophone?Rebecca: Yep. Yeah. The saxophone was maybe for one or two years and I would love to get back into playing that as well, but they're quite expensive little instruments actually.Todd: Yeah. Slightly.Rebecca: And then the piano is very large so, you can't really transport that around with you wherever you go.Todd: So do you think that if had learned music at a younger age, you would still be with it? Was the problem just that you waited to late in life to start?Rebecca: I don't think so. I think it's more the friends circle that I was with. We weren't really a musical group and the people that I've met now are really musical so you sort of wish maybe if I had kept going I could have joined them now, but I do enjoy listening to them.Todd: Well, what about singing? Are you a good singer?Rebecca: No. Not at all. I don't think I want to be a good singer either cause then everybody would expect you to sing all the time so I just do backup vocals. Really badly.Todd: Well, I'm the same way. I can't sing at all. OK, so basically you wish you could play the guitar, but you have played the piano and the saxophone before.Rebecca: Yes.Todd: OK, is there anything else that you wish you could do?Rebecca: To be able to speak maybe a couple languages would be nice.Todd: Yeah, that's a good one. So if you could speak any two languages, what two would you want to speak?Rebecca: I think Japanese and Spanish.Todd: Japanese and Spanish.Rebecca: Yeah. Yeah. They both sound really interesting and they're both the countries that I would like to go and visit and maybe attempt to work there but you need to be able to speak the language before you can work.Todd: Right. That's true. I think if I could choose any two languages I would choose Chinese and Arabic just because both those languages when I hear them they sound so completely impossible to speak, so if you could speak those, that would be pretty amazing.Rebecca: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, Chinese sounds like a hard language.Todd: All those tones.",

        "transcript": "Michael: OK, so then. Hi! I'm Michael. I'm from Toronto.\n\nSimon: Yeah, Hi! I'm Simon from Vancouver.\n\nMichael: Simon!\n\nSimon: That's right!\n\nMichael: So, are you francophone?\n\nSimon: No, I'm not Francophone. That's a common mistake that other Canadians make. My parents were German so they use the German pronunciation of Simon, which is Simon\nMichael: Oh, really\nSimon: Yeah! \n\nMichael: OK, so the German and the French are.\n                                  .\nSimon: Pretty similar. Ah, similar! Ah, yeah, Spanish, French, German. Pretty much only English has the Simon pronunciation of that, that name.\n\nMichael: OK, so you're from Vancouver.\n\n    Simon: Yeah, that's right.\n\nMichael: I'm from Toronto but some of my favorite music came from Vancouver. Ah, I'm not quite sure, you look quite young, you may not have ever seen DOA play.\n\nSimon: I'm very familiar with DOA. Actually, I'm older than I look. I'm 33, so I come from the DOA generation.\n\nMichael: Excellent, so did you go to the Commodore Ballroom?\n\nSimon: That's right, and I've actually seen DOA at the Commodore and almost got hit in the head by a beer can that they throw out during their concerts. They like to throw beer cans into the crowd.\n\nMichael: Well, I saw DOA at the university of Windsor where I went to do my undergraduate degree, and it was one of the best shows I have ever been to. It was great.\n\nSimon: Yeah! I mean when I was in high school, they were already old, so but uh, they kept rocking'.\n\nMichael: So how bout the, do you know, how long have you been in Japan? Do you go back and have you seen\n                                any new bands in Vancouver.\n\nSimon: Ah, well, I've been in Japan just over a year so not that long. I did go back one time but we didn't see any concerts and the commodore has changed since those days of DOA.\n\nMichael: OK, just to show you how out of it I've become, but I've just recently discovered Nickel Back which is from Vancouver as well and also a band that I don't think die hard DOA fans would like cause it's pretty conventional rock I guess, but I like them.\n\nSimon: Yeah, I don't. I mean, they've got catchy tunes that many people like, for example my girlfriend who's Japanese loves Nickle Back, but I didn't even know they were from Vancouver. You know, they're just I thought there were from the Prairies or something like that. Yeah, there not cool enough.\n\nMichael: They're not cool enough. \n\nSimon: I think their music is crap. \n\nMichael: Do you really?\n\nSimon: Yeah, it's, I mean they sound the same as any number of bands, you know.\n\nMichael: OK, can you think of any group from Vancouver that is cool? A new band! \n\nSimon: A new band. Well, you've caught me at a time because I'm in Japan and so new music doesn't really resonate here. Is that the correct word to say?\n\nMichael: Well, what's your definition of new then? Is it like a minute old?\n\nSimon: I can't say, you know, you stumped me on new music. Yeah, how bout you? Do you want to tell me about some music that you're listening to now?\n\nMichael: Oh, you see, once you become middle-aged you start listening to a lot of stuff that you listened to when you were in high school or you actually find yourself nauseatingly wanting to hear things that you hated when you were in high school and it brings back memories, like I can actually say that I enjoy doing a lesson where I have to play ABBA for my students, whereas I hated it when I was a kid. When I was in high school if you put an ABBA record on I probably would have punched you.\n\nSimon: Oh, sure as and ESL teacher, we both have to play, you know, cheesy ballads and things like that for our students because that's what they like. Yeah. OK, let's get back to the music. You know, they're probably already old, yeah, if you want good solid Rock, I mean, the next best thing was The White Stripes a few years ago and their still quite good. \n\nMichael: And they're from Vancouver?\n\nSimon: No, they're from somewhere in the states. But they play, you know, really edgy sort of classical style rock for the modern age. I don't know, for the 2000, yeah.\n\nMichael: I'm reading this book now about the so called Cam-Rock Renaissance, during the period 1985 to 1995. Bands like DOA of course, we've already mentioned, also from Vancouver, Skinny Puppy, would probably.\n\nSimon: Skinny puppy! There's a name I haven't heard in awhile.\n\nMichael: Yep, and The Tragically Hip.\n\nSimon: Overplayed group.\n\nMichael: Overplayed! Tragically Hip is probably the most popular group in Canada, though.\n\nSimon: Yeah, I lived with a techno DJ in university, so we often had parties at our house and he would play his new stuff that he was very proud of, you know, acid jazz, hip-hop beats, and all kind of weird stuff, but good, and he had a rule because people kept on coming up to him and saying, \"Can you play 'The Hip' man?\" and he always said, \"They'll be no 'Hip' played at this house!\"\n\nMichael: That sounds like something I did when I was DJing in bar. Everyone would ask me to play Guns n' Roses and I absolutely despised them. I even went to the extent of buying one of the waitresses their album so that she would never request them again, but unfortunately I didn't have enough money to buy everyone the album and I found myself playing them sometimes two or three times, and the same song two or three times. It wasn't my place. I couldn't make the rule your friend made.\n\nSimon: Yeah, I could hear the recurring theme. Play GNR man!\n\nMichael: Yeah!\n\nSimon: Well, let's wrap up that, this conversation.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Anita, we're talking about money.\nAnita: OK.\nTodd: I have some questions for you.\nAnita: Fire away.\nTodd: First question: are you good at saving money?\nAnita: You know now that I got married, I think I'm much better at saving money, than I was before.\nTodd: Yeah, I think it's definitely one thing that comes with age. The older you get, the better you get at saving money.\nAnita: Definitely.\nTodd: But we all waste money, so what is something you waste money on?\nAnita: Oh, what do I waste money on? Probably movie rentals.\nTodd: Movie rentals, right.\nAnita: I love watching movies, and I am capable of renting five movies a week, so that's one thing.\nTodd: You know, actually, not that you mention it, I have a huge problem with movie rentals, not so much the movie rental but the late fee. I'm terrible. Like, I'll have a movie for two weeks, and I could have bought the movie for the price I have to pay for the rental, for the late fee. Oh, it drives me nuts.\nAnita: You should do what I did. I moved to a new apartment last month and that apartment is right in front of  a movie rental place.\nTodd: That's it. That's the solution. Always live by the movie rental place.\nAnita: That's my way of saving money.\nTodd: Well, these days you can actually download movies on the internet which is really convenient.\nAnita: If you're American, yes. Usually many of these websites where you can legally download movies are only for American or people with American credit cards.\nTodd: That's true.\nAnita: Unfortunately, it's not available to the rest of the world yet, but I know in my country we have a website where you can rent movies. You download them from the internet and you get a special password, so the movie, you can only access the movie within those 24 hours that you rent it for. I've never tried it but the system is there and I think it's a great system.\nTodd: That's a cool technology.\nAnita: Yeah, very.\nTodd: What about other things like music and books? Do you spend a lot of money on that? \nAnita: Books, yes. Books yes. Music not as much. But one thing I definitely spend a lot of money on is my phone bill.\nTodd: Oh, really.\nAnita: Yes.\nTodd: Talking on the phone.\nAnita: Yes, talking on the phone.\nTodd: Well, actually it's funny because those are two things I never waste money on. 1) I hate talking on the phone, so I'm never on the phone. I always have extra  minutes, and 2) for books, go to the library. It's free.\nAnita: But then you can't keep the book at home and the whole beauty of reading a book it to... after you've read it, put it in your own personal library and feel good about yourself when you look at your library and think. \"Ah, I've read so many books\" but I like having books at home because you can reread them anytime you feel like it.\nTodd: Oh, that's interesting. I don't think I've ever reread a book, ever.\nAnita: Really.\nTodd: Yeah, one time and that's it.\nAnita: Really.\nTodd: Maybe I just don't have the same love of reading as you do.\nAnita: Could be.",

Like, to be completely honest, in the beginning I was really upset and I was like, you know, \"Why does this have to happen to me?\" you know. That is like immediately what you feel, what anybody would feel. But then when after, you know, recovering and after... while I was going through the whole thing, I basically realized that these things, they don't happen for a reason. My friend, he did not want to bang the car, you know, he didn't have anything against me. He really regretted it.Fred: Yeah, it wasn't his fault.Shibika: Exactly. It's nobodies fault, so it happens. It happens to teach you something, I guess, so basically I learned that such things happen. It made me a stronger person, you know, I was like, no more scared of car accidents or stuff like that because I'm like, OK, they're a part of your life and they go on, so. Yeah, and then I was taken care of. I had all the time, these people, surrounded by people, yeah, who used to come: my relatives, my friends, they came to visit me. All of them got really worried so you feel kind of special. You feel that, OK, you know, like it really matters for other people when something happens to you.Fred: Wow, that's really nice to hear. So yeah, so when something like this happens, you always have people around you to help you.Shibika: True, yeah.Fred: So that must be a really good feeling.Shibika: Exactly, and like, out of all the people, my mom had helped me the most, like because I couldn't even move because of the plaster. I couldn't move my hand. I couldn't do anything on my own. I couldn't eat by myself, so she had to feed me. She had to and I felt like a kid again, and she had to do everything. for me.",

Katia, if a friend came to you asking to borrow some money, what would your reaction be? Katia: If I have a good friend that really needs the money then, of course, if I have the money, I would probably lend it.Paul: So, in what situation would you lend your friend money?Katia: Well, for example, it's a person that is really trying their best to have money and it's in a situation that it's an emergency and needs the money then I would lend it. What about you Paul?Paul: Yeah, I would lend... I would be a little bit nervous to lend a close friend money because I think that money can sometimes affect a friendship.Katia: I guess that's true. Do you have a bad experience with it?Paul: Actually, I do. Yeah. I've had a bad experience of a very close friend of mine. He was asking for money from me and at first just once and then twice and then he started asking for more money and it actually had a big effect on our friendship.Katia: Are you still friends?Paul: Oh, we're not. We're not friends anymore, but he did buy his car.Katia: Oh, wow! This was for a car.Paul: Yeah, he kind of cheated me out of a lot of money, so he was working as well and he was trying to save some money and in the end he bought his car but he lost his friend. Katia: Yeah, I guess that's very difficult to say, but what about... would you ask for money if you need it?Paul: Personally, I think before I asked a friend for money I would prefer to either ask my parents or my sister. How about you if you were in that situation?Katia: Well, if I had no choice, and not asked my family, I could ask my friend. Of course, he has to be a very good friend and for a very good reason for me to ask for money.Paul: So could you lend me some money, cause I'd like to go to Hawaii next week?Katia: Well, Paul let me think about that one.Paul: OK.

I used to live in what's called a \"Gaijin house\" which is just a shared apartment. I had a 6 mat room and a shared bathroom. Now I have two 8 mat rooms and my own bathroom and a kitchen with 4 burners, instead of 2.. yeah. \nTodd: Oh wow, so you're in your new place now?\nIvan: Yeah, I'm in my new place now. Actually, the old place was owned by a company, they owned the land and this really, really, awful woman owned the building, so I rented a room from the woman. I woke up one morning and the manager was putting stuff in.. was putting flyers in people's mailboxes. I took a look at the flyer. The flyer was saying that the company was going to destroy the building within a month period so they were warning us to get out. Well, the manager was busy taking these flyers so that the people inside the apartment wouldn't see it and move out. She wanted to get one more month of rent from us. So I took my flyer and I went down to the company that owned the land and said, \"Where can I live now? You're making us leave in a month.\" He said, \" Oh, I feel really bad about what you told me happened, so he gave me this 2DK which is normally 120,000 a month for 60,000 with no key money and no deposit.\nTodd: Wow! That's nice. \nIvan: Yeah, I got lucky.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So I'm here with Shantel, and we both are from the United States. And we both are teachers in Japan. So I thought we would talk a little bit about some of the stereotypes that people might have in other countries, for example Japan, or other countries about Americans. So first, we're going to talk about hamburgers.\n                              Shantel: Okay.\nTodd: Okay, so hamburgers. How often do you actually eat a hamburger?\nShantel: Uh, hamburgers. I would say, it's actually not that often, although I love hamburgers. I love them very much, but maybe only a couple times a month or so. \nTodd: Yeah, I agree. I think hamburgers is the one thing that does not meet the stereotype, that we don't eat them that often. Like, I never have hamburgers in America. \nShantel: Ah, okay. \nTodd: Pretty much never. Like, I'll have them if somebody's barbecuing it, maybe for a picnic, or something. Um, yeah. And if I do eat fast food it's usually not a hamburger.\nShantel: Oh. \nTodd: I eat something else. Like, I eat tacos or burritos, right.\nShantel: Yeah.\nTodd: I don't eat hamburgers. So that's one. I think hamburgers don't really match the stereotype myth.\nShantel: Yeah. I agree.\nTodd: Do you agree?\nShantel: I agree, especially because I know many, many of my students here in Japan, they will ask me often, what I eat for lunch. And before I respond, cause they're playing a joke on me, they'll say like, \"Oh, hamburger? Hamburger?\"\nTodd: (laughs), yeah.\nShantel: And I have to tell them that, you know, now I do live in Japan, but in the United States I don't typically eat hamburgers every day. \nTodd: Yeah. \nShantel: But that is a lot of what they think. They think that I eat hamburgers regularly or, at least, fast food but their image of fast food is only hamburgers. \nTodd: So true. And actually,the funny side story to that, or contrary story would be you know, sushi. So we both teach in Japan, and I think most people think that you eat sushi all the time in Japan. And that's almost the equivalent of the hamburger. You don't eat it that much. \nShantel: That is so true. \nTodd: Right?\nShantel: So true. I cannot say how true that is.\nTodd: Or uh, another one, we're talking about um, stereotypes would be sumo. So Japanese people are not that into sumo, really, right, but it's an iconic thing. So that brings us to the point of baseball. \nShantel: Ah, yes.\nTodd: So do you actually like baseball?\nShantel: I do. I love baseball. I do, and I used to go to some games in the United States, in San Francisco. I went to several Giants games growing up, yeah. So I do enjoy baseball. Do you enjoy baseball?\nTodd: I do. I have to admit, like I played you know, baseball when I was younger. I loved baseball, but I do think it's not as popular as people think it is.\nShantel: Ah.\nTodd: You know what I mean?\nShantel: Yes.\nTodd: I think that like, a lot of people like it. You like it, I like it. But a lot of people could care less. \nShantel: Yes.\nTodd: About baseball. \nShantel: Most of the time I think I hear people say it's, it's a slow sport, it's boring. No one wants to watch it. \nTodd: Right.\nShantel: They're much more inclined to watch basketball or football instead of baseball.\nTodd: So true.",

Each Provence has their provincial government but as far as federal government the capital is in Ottawa, and there's actually an election coming up, probably sometime this year. Each province is given seats in the federal cabinet and seats are given based on population so Ontario and Quebec which have the largest populations have the most seats in Federal Parliament and so wherever you live you basically vote for the politician who is running in your particular geographical area, and the political party which wins the most seats forms the government that rules the country.\n\t\t                Todd: OK, and the leader of the country comes from that party?\n\t\t                Steve: Yeah, the leader of the country is elected within the party. They elect the leader (OK) So each party, when they want a leader, they have a leadership convention, and they elect a leader to lead that party, but the leader of the party must also run in their own constituency or riding, so if they don't win they can't be the Prime Minister, so, yeah, the main political parties, right now the government is Liberal Government. Other prominent parties are the New Democratic Party, sometimes called the NDP, and the New Conservative Party. Also a powerful party is Bloc Quebecois, which has most of its seats obviously in Quebec, so there are four main political parties.",

        "transcript": "Todd: OK, Terry, now when you take your bike trips, when you bicycle across America or down the West Coast, what is a typical day? Like how would you start your day and how would you finish your day on the bicycle?\nTerry: Well, a typical day, I'm camping usually, so I usually get up at or near sunrise, sometimes I get up slightly before sunrise, and I have to pack up all of my camping gear, stuff the sleeping bag in a stuffed sack, roll up my air mattress, pack up the tent, and then eat breakfast and then I usually try and, you know, do the daily essentials and then hit the road. I usually try to be on the road on the road sometime around 7, 7:30 in the morning, depending on when the sun comes up. But I like to go cycling early in the morning because it's cooler and there's, you tend to see more wildlife and I just think it's a nicer time of day, especially if you're riding in the summer, it tends to get warmer, as the day goes on, so, and then I usually try and hit, find a campground sometime in the afternoon and then the process starts again in setting up camp, setting up a tent and whatnot. Um, during the day, I'm usually cycling, actually cycling for 5 to 6 hours a day and then taking two or three hours off, various breaks, and eating lunch and what not, and then usually in the afternoon, I stop and buy some food, that I can cook, so I can cook dinner in camp and have breakfast the next morning. Oh, that's pretty cool.\nTodd: So you just pay for everything with a credit card, or you bring cash, or?\nTerry: Oh, both. Especially in the Unites States, with debit cards you can get cash back when you're buying food at a grocery store or so. It's always nice to have cash to pay for incidentals and .\nTodd: Well, that's interesting. You said that you see wildlife. What wildlife would you see?\nTerry: Oh, on this trip, as an example: elk and deer and raccoon and possums and turtles and snakes and all kinds of wildlife.\nTodd: You know, have you almost ever hit an animal?\nTerry: I haven't. I don't think I've ever come close to hitting an animal, no.\nTodd: Well, speaking of being hit, have you had any close calls with cars?\nTerry: Um, well, that's kind of, I think goes with the territory, so to speak. I've never come close to getting hit but I certainly feel like on occasion, I've been, I've had vehicles come closer to me that I wanted them to close, and, kind of, the real bug-a-boo for cyclists is logging trucks, and back east, coal trucks, they're just, they can be really terrifying when they are going by and you're cycling down the road.\nTodd: I bet. Wow. OK, thanks Terry.",

What is Omikoshi?\n                        Yoko: Ah, it's really difficult for me to explain in English, but Omokishi looks like a bigbox, lots of people, adult people try to carry together, and they usually go to temples, and they kind of celebrate a harvest or our happiness or those kind of things\n                        Todd: OK. Do you ever carry the Omikoshi?\n                        Yoko: Ah, you know, I'm not a strong guy so, I've never tried it.\n                        Todd: OK. What about foods? What kind of foods do people like to eat?\n                        Yoko: We can see lots of small shops along the street and we can buy really Japanese food, like watagashi, it's a really sweet candy but it looks like, how do you say that?\n                        Todd: I don't know.\n                        Yoko: I don't know.

It's really popular food in matsuri, and we can see okonomiyaki. Yeah, it's, somepeople say Japanese pancake, or something, but tastes different.\n                        Yoko: It's not sweet.\n                        Todd: It's not sweet.\n                        Yoko: It's not sweet.

        "transcript": "Todd: So Megen, we are both teachers, English teachers in Japan, and we both come from countries that have Christmas, but Christmas is so different in Japan than in our home countries, so I though we would talk about that.\nMegen: Yeah, absolutely. It's particularly different to Australia because we have ... we have it in summer.\nTodd: Oh, that's right. So it's a beautiful summer holiday, right?\nMegen: It is, though when it get hotter here in Japan, I start to feel that it's getting into Christmas season.\nTodd: Oh, right! So summer is Christmas.\nMegen: Yes, yeah.\nTodd: That's so cool. Do you still do the Christmas tree and the gifts under the tree?\nMegen: We do and we have a lot of the same Christmas traditions, but the food is pretty different. We eat a lot of fresh fruits, and we have like fresh prawns. I guess you might call them shrimps.\nTodd: Right, no we call them prawns too. Prawns or shrimp. Wow! That's interesting. You know, it's cool that you brought up food because we're both in Japan and I think it's very interesting that in Japan the Christmas dinner is fried chicken.\nMegen: Yeah! I can't imagine eating KFC or any kind of chicken for Christmas.\nTodd: Now did you know about this before you came to Japan?\nMegen: I didn't actually. I was shocked when I heard about it.\nTodd: Yeah, I didn't believe it at first, and then when I came to Japan, I saw the long lines outside KFC, and I thought, wow, this really is a thing. And now in Japan, not only do they have KFC chicken, but everywhere. So the supermarkets make fried chicken. The convenience stores have fried chicken. Other hamburger stores have fried chicken, all just for Christmas.\nMegen: Yeah, yes, I don't think we usually eat chicken. Maybe some families would eat roast chicken, but usually we eat cold meats.\nTodd: Oh, right, so Australia is fresh fruit, shrimp, and cold meats.\nMegen: Yeah, we have a few Australian desserts that I haven't seen in any other coutries, but I think in Australia there's a lot of variety though, so my family in particular, that's what we eat, but I think every family is different. How about in America?\nTodd: Ah, in America it's very close to Thanksgiving, so usually you have a big bird, so you have turkey or chicken or ham. Ham is a big one. So you might have baked ham. But you have lots of sweets, lots of cakes, Christmas cakes, pies, cookies. Things like that. So everybody gains a lot of weight. Do you eat a lot of sweets for Christmas in Australia?\nMegen: Well, I imagine they eat more baked goods in America, but we eat a lot of cold, like parfait, kind of desserts. With a mix of like sponge cake and jelly and cream, and we do eat cookies and different like chocolate sweets, and yeah, I think we do some baking but, yeah, not so much pies.\nTodd: So in Australia because it's so warm, do you spend the day at the beach? \nMegen: We do! Yeah, a lot of people have pools. Their own pools, so they will go swimming in their backyard, or they'll go to the beach, or play cricket outside. \nTodd: That's great! So do you barbecue? Is Barbecue a common way?\nMegen: Yeah! Especially for Christmas. It's really great to be outside. And there are barbecues you can use near the beach or in the parks, so a lot of people go outside and mingle with the locals. It's great.\nTodd: Oh, that's fantastic. So in the Northern Hemisphere, Christmas is often associated with snow, so you have the snowman and thinks like that. Do you have those types of decorations in Australia?\nMegen: We do! Although we don't have any snow, we still have the snow decoration. And usually Santa Claus still wears the long sleeve winter clothing, although we do have our own version of Santa Claus, that wears singlets and shorts.\nTodd: That's nice. So you've lived in a country with a warm Christmas, and a country with a cold Christmas. Which do you prefer?\nMegen: Well, I think because I've spend so many Christmases in Australia, that I still feel like it's Christmas when it gets warmer, and when I see things like peaches and watermelon in season I want to celebrate Christmas.\nTodd: That's so cool.\nMegen: Do you want to experience a Christmas in Australia?\nTodd: I do. I do! That is definitely on my bucket list now, to have a warm weather Christmas.\nMegen: It would be so strange for you!",

Jake: That would have to be video games. I have pretty much every video game console that was releases since the late 80's.Lindsay: Are you serious?Jake: Yes. Every one of them.Lindsay: Wow. I actually don't really like video games.Jake: Why not? They're fun.Lindsay: I don't know. I used to when I was a kid, but recently they just don't appeal to me... to sit in front and like, use my thumb to press this thing to make it jump and I guess I'm just not very good at them.Jake: Well, they're getting more and more involving now, it's kind of like having an interactive movie except you get to be the main character in the movie.Lindsay: Yeah, I guess. I need to get used to it. I'm really bad at them right now, so I'm just not comfortable with them.Jake: Yeah, I know what you mean. One thing I've noticed a lot with games lately is that they're so complicated to control that you have to be like a hard core gamer to even begin to understand how to play the game.Lindsay: Do you think you're a hard core gamer?Jake: I would have to say I am though I'm not exactly proud of it.Lindsay: Oh, really. What constitutes a hard core gamer? How often to you play?Jake: Pretty much, well, probably for most hard core gamers, it would be every day.Lindsay: Every day. How many hours?Jake: An hour or two, at the least.Lindsay: OK, what about you? How often do you play every day?Jake: Well, since, I'm working, there are lots of days when I don't play at all, and I would like to be able to play more.Lindsay: OK, so one of your goals in life is to play more video games?Jake: No, I wouldn't say that but it's a good way to relax and sometimes it's more fun than just watching TV when you have nothing better to do.Lindsay: OK, so you play... try to play every day but sometimes you don't and then, are there any tips you can give me to become a good video gamer?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJake: Well, just the more you can play, the better you'll get. I don't necessarily want to play more because as you know there isn't really any reward for playing games more.",

I was in education. I was a high school teacher. \nTodd: Where did you go? What country?\nMike: I was in Togo.\nTodd: Togo?\nMike: It's a little country between Ghana and Dahome, and the time Benan, Nigeria, West Africa.\nTodd: West Africa, yeah.\nMike: And I was a high school teacher. I was an education major at the University of Michigan, and trained as a high school teacher there, but I had to get a complete different training, skills, to work in West African high schools. I mean for one thing, the classes were huge, like a hundred students in a class, and we didn't have textbooks. We just had a blackboard in front of the class and students had notebooks, so you had to really manage the class so that the students always had something to write down, or practive from their notebooks, and you know I had like four or five classes like that every day, and it was a very grueling job, but very, very exciting work, I mean, I loved it. I just loved it. It was the best thing a college grad could do in my opinion.\nTodd: What type of experiences do you remember about living in Togo?\nMike: Ah, living in Togo, well, I was a foreigner, right, I was white, I am white, and everybody was African, black, so there was this feeling of always being an outsider and occasionally, not occasionally, often, you know kids would make fun of you for being different, and you know, so it was sort of hard to get used to that. That was one thing I remember.\n\nMike: I mean, I remember the beauty of it all, and how in the tropical area, how things grow (right) like it would rain almost every day and then when the rain stopped and the sun came out you could just literally see flowers growing, plants blossoming, you know, that's one thing I really remember.\nTodd: Man, it must have been really, really beautiful.\nMike: It is.\nTodd: Have you ever gone back?\nMike: You know, I was just thinking about that the other day, that why, no I haven't gone back. I haven't gone back. I would love to. If I have the opportunity I will, or I have to make the opportunity to go back. It's a very volatile country, though, you know. It's not an easy country to go to just as a visitor. I think you need to have something to do there, (right) like I did, you know, I had a regular routine, and place to live. I don't think I would want to go there as a tourist, but I'd love to go back if I have an inviation to do something again.\nTodd: Alright, thanks Mike.\nMike: Sure.",

It must be really difficult. Katia: Well, I wouldn't say difficult, difficult. I think it's great, but it comes with some difficult things I guess. Maybe I can think of make-up and it takes us so long to get ready and it's something that we really need to do, so maybe that's one thing that we have to get used to it.Paul: Come on. It can't be so difficult: make-up. Putting on make-up on every day.Katia: Well, you get used to it, but just imagine, we need to look for the right colors, the right brand, the right price. It really gets tough.Paul: Sounds tough. Anything else difficult about being a woman?Katia: Well, some people say that it might not be so difficult but maybe giving birth might be something that woman have to face that is difficult, but perhaps for some women it's not so difficult but I think that's one other thing.Paul: Yeah, for sure. I'll never know about that. How about good things, positive things about being a women?Katia: Well, there are many positive things. I actually can say I'm happy being a woman. Maybe one thing is, well we have in a sense... we're able to choose if we... once we marry, if we go to work or not, in general. I think that's one good thing. Don't you agree?Paul: Yeah, I would agree with that. For sure. Anything else that's positive for you?Katia: Well, since I'm not married yet, going on dates I think it's great the man has to pay. So that's a positive thing of being a woman.Paul: Great. Yeah. I definitely agree with that. OK, and finally is there one last thing. What's your favorite thing about being a woman?Katia: My favorite thing? Maybe having a sixth sense.Paul: Could you tell me more?Katia: Well, as a woman we sense certain things that men are not able to sense, so I think that's a very positive thing.Paul: For example?Katia: Well, for example, Paul, as a woman we sense people's feelings even though, for example, a man will not say anything. We can see, or we can feel what the person is feeling. The same with children, or the same with other women.Paul: I would agree with that. Women have to be more sensitive to these issues I think.Katia: Yeah, sensitive. You can call it sensitive. I call it a sixth sense.Paul: OK, it was nice talking to you.Katia: Thank you, Paul.",

Sometimes I prefer to just call someone on the phone if I'm in a hurry.Lindsay: Yeah, I go both ways. Sometimes I know I don't really want to talk to the person. I just want to ask them one question, so it's so much easier for me just to text them and say, \"Are you going to the party tonight\" for example instead of calling them, because I know if I call them, I'm gonna have to have a long conversation.Jake: Yeah, I can see what you mean. Well, usually I get off the phone pretty quickly when I call someone. I'm not a big talker.Lindsay: Yeah, that's true, Jake. You don't talk a lot. But, in general, I like to call people because I think it adds a more personal touch.Jake: So are you fast at writing the messages with your thumb?Lindsay: Well, when I first got a cell phone, which was actually only five years ago, I was so slow, I thought I would never text message, and I always called people, but then people kept text messaging me so I felt obligated to try to learn how to text message, so now, I'm pretty fast actually. What about you?Jake: Actually, I have the opposite problem, where when I first got my cell phone, I thought it was so cool and I had to text message all my friends who had one, and I was pretty fast with my thumb then, but it seems like now I don't use it so much, and I've gotten slower actually.Lindsay: Yeah, I think the text message actually is sort of has to do with your age, for example, I text message a lot and I know people younger than me, for example people in high school, they text message a lot, but I asked my father if he text messages, and guess what he said?Jake: What?Lindsay: Well, of course, he said he never text messages. He thinks it's very juevenile and unprofessional to text message someone.Jake: Yeah, I can see what he means. It's usually associated with young people and considered pretty informal to text message someone.Lindsay: Yeah, it is really informal, I think, because you're just using your thumb and you're trying to write fast. Rarely do you ever write 'dear' or 'from' or use polite language, right?Jake: Yeah, because you're using your thumb, you have to write the messages as short as you possibly can.Lindsay: Right, I mean, it sort of makes sense, when I think that I would never text message someone I didn't know very well. I only text message people I'm good friends with and comfortable with.Jake: Well, it serves it purpose then, doesn't it.Lindsay: Yeah, I guess, I mean it is cheaper than calling someone, but, you know, other times it's better to call someone, don't you think.Jake: Yeah, definitely.",

We are on, kind of on the side of a hill in the forest but we have a spectacular view of Mount Fuji on the other side of the valley. \nTodd: Yeah. It's really nice here. Why are you in this forest right now?\nKevin: Well, I'm currently working and I'm teaching an intensive English course up here at the campus.. up here in the forest.\nTodd: Oh, nice. Do you take any walks in the woods?\nKevin: Yes, I enjoy taking walks in the woods. And sometimes I even go for a jog in the woods, there's a few trails around here and there's a nice golf course as well that you can run around.\nTodd: OK, great! What's the best thing about being in nature? In the forest? \nKevin: Well, for me it's the stress relief that it provides especially living in Tokyo which is of course one of the world's largest and most chaotic cities. It's also nice to get back out into nature sometimes and just hear the insects which obviously we can hear very clearly right now, as well as some birds and you know it's just nice to get back out into nature. \nTodd: I agree. OK. Thanks a lot Kevin. \nKevin: You're welcome.",

        "transcript": "Katia: So, Enam, we're talking about arranged marriages, but what about the rate of divorce of arranged marriages? Is it high?\nEnam: Well, actually, the rate is incredibly low. Actually, it's below ten percent and it's changing but still it's really low and the reason I think because the culture in Bangladesh ... in that kind of culture, boys and girls are like grown up in different ways, and they don't really see each other that closely, and that's why when you are married with a person, you start to know that person after different ... opposite gender ... quite well and that helps develop and understanding and they both ... both of them try to understand each other - their values - and in the cultural background it's normally decided that they have to be together normally without an exception for the rest of their lives, so they just try to work in that way. Do you have a higher divorce rate in your country?\nKatia: Actually, unfortunately it is increasing. I really don't know the percentage but when I was young, if somebody of my friends parents would get a divorce that would be very shocking to hear. It was uncommon. But now, a lot of my friends actually are going though divorce or their parents have divorced, which it wasn't common but now it seems a little bit more common, so unfortunately things are changing in Mexico.Enam: Why do you think that the divorce rate is going up? What could be the reason behind this?Katia: I think it's very hard to say but I think they're various reasons. For example, women didn't used to work. They used to stay home and take care of the house, the husband, the children, but now women have become more independent. They have been able to make different decisions that before they didn't have to, so I think the independence of the women has changed things and perhaps the culture itself, the culture of marriage and divorce, it has changed also so I think possibly those two reasons.",

        "transcript": "Gyri:               Okay. So Viyasan, what do you think is the most important, hard work or talent? Or what is more useful?\nViyasan:            Hm. That's an interesting question, because I think they both play a role in whatever task that you're doing, but personally, I think that hard work is more important than talent. And I'll give you a couple examples of why I feel hard work is more important. \nI think in order to master any skill, whether it's singing, whether it's dancing, whether it's performing well at a task, you need to stay focused on the task at hand. And some people are naturally good at that task. For example, if I'm really quick at typing on the computer, I'll be able to print out multiple spread sheets, complete a lot of work and finish my assignments faster.\nHowever, I believe to really go above and beyond and master that skill, with that talent, hard work needs to be attributed as well. Without hard work, even if you're at typing on the computer, you might not want to feel like typing on a computer, you might be lazy and you just might not want to do that task.\n But hard work trains you to become good at a task, and do it very well, master it, and become efficient with your time. And so that's why I think hard work outweighs talent, because I think there's more dedication in hard work, there's regimen in the hard work, and once you've mastered hard work in a specific skill, I think you can master it a lot more easier than someone who is naturally talented at that task.\nGyri: Yeah. I definitely agree. I think you pretty much summed it up though.\nViyasan: Yeah.\nGyri: But yeah, I agree that hard work is more important than talent, and you could be very talented, but if you don't have the work ethic, then it doesn't really matter. Or especially if we're thinking about getting jobs. So, yeah, hard work definitely is more important.\nViyasan: Is there a task that you've spent a lot of time at and given that hard work to master?\nGyri: I started playing guitar three years ago, and I never played an instrument before. And usually I can be very lazy when learning new things. I get unmotivated very quickly. But one day I was just like, \"Okay, I have a guitar lying around. I just really want to learn how to play now.\" \nAnd I just put in a lot of work and hours and now I play the guitar and I am very proud of myself because I put that work into. And like maybe ... If I was born with a talent to just play guitar, that would be cool, but I wouldn't have the same satisfaction of putting my mind to it and getting good. Yeah, so ... I don't know what I was going to say.\nViyasan: Yeah, well that's a good example of using hard work and something that you like to do. That's amazing, yeah. So do you think there's any exceptions where talent is more important than hard work?\nGyri: I think so. Like, maybe especially in the entertainment business. You could put in a lot of hours, but if you want to be really good, like a really famous actor or a really famous singer, they'll choose the more-talented ones and often the most-talented ones are the ones with the predisposed talent. If that makes sense. Like ... Oh, I don't know what I was going to say. Sorry.\nViyasan: Here's an example I have. So one of my interests is basketball and usually the highest level of basketball is, I would say, the NBA, the National Basketball Association, which is run in America and Canada. And usually, lots of basketball players are very tall.\nGyri: Right, right.\nViyasan: For that reason, they're able to have longer limbs, they're able to do a lot more things with the basketball. For example, jump, shoot, run with the basketball and play the sport at a more higher level than someone who didn't have those natural, physical traits. \nAnd so, I would say that, in that case, talent, if someone who's talented at basketball, would be at a slightly more advantageous position than someone who, for example, myself, I'm five, six, who puts a lot of hard work into basketball, but just can't beat someone who's six, four, and just runs extremely quick because they're talented. \nGyri: Right.\nViyasan: So that might be one example of where talent, in some cases, beats hard work.\nGyri: Yeah. And I think the same goes for singing, for example. Like, you could practice singing, but if you're just born with a very beautiful voice, then maybe you're better off performing, for example.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Talking about kids and school, what do you think about failure? Like it seems like we're moving to where we're not allowed to tell kids that they're not doing well, that everybody has to be a winner. You know, everybody gets a good grade. What do you think about that especially as a teacher and a parent?\nJulia: As a teacher, I think, I read something recently that the chastising a student, telling them they did bad, has no motivational value whatsoever but praise does. So definitely I think it's important to always praise. If you have a really bad student and you can't find anything to praise them on then I don't know what the answer is really. But I'm sure you can always find something to praise someone on.\nTodd: Yeah.Julia: So I think it's important to focus on the positives all the time.Todd: See actually I kind of disagree.Julia: Do you?Todd: Yeah. I think that, you know, that your score is or your progress is absolute. Like either you pass or you fail, either you get high marks or low marks but that's the motivation. Like if you get, if you don't do well, then you want to try harder. You know, like if you're a fat kid and you don't want to be fat then you, you know, you're motivated to lose weight or if you aren't a star in the baseball team you need to practice harder so you move up. But if you tell kids that they're doing great when actually they're not exceptional then maybe that actually does harm.Julia: OK, well maybe I misexplained that. I don't mean give a false, I don't mean say they're doing well when they're not doing well but what I mean is focus more on the successes than the failures.Todd: Oh, I see. Like confidence building?Julia: Yeah, I guess that's what I mean more. But I guess we're talking about motivation rather than an end result like, of course, yeah, you're going to fail some things. I don't know. I never failed that many things at school and later on in life when I did encounter failure, I took it pretty bad so perhaps it would have been healthier for me to have failed a few things. I don't know.Todd: Well that's the question, isn't it? Like when you fail or you do bad I think that maybe that's the eye-opening moment you need to see. Like you need to see the truth rather than just tell somebody that they're doing well when actually maybe they're not or that they're exceptional and talented when maybe they're not.Julia: When they're not, that's true. Yeah, there was another thing that I read as well about telling, praising children for their intellgence, you should never, you should never tell a child they're smart because they get a false image of what intelligence is. You should always praise effort.Todd: Ah, right.Julia: As opposed to some sort of innate, what we believe to be an innate quality that you can never have if you don't have it. So telling a child yeah you're really smart, when the child faces a problem that requires them to apply themselves and maybe fail they're afraid.Todd: Mmm.Julia: Because then they may think no I'm not intelligent after all. So it should always be about praising effort and actually the result is not so important.",

I've always wanted to go to Thailand.Akane: Yes, it's a really nice place. I really enjoyed it.Ruth: So what did you do there?Akane: Well, one of the things I did there was to take a Thai cooking course and I learned how to make Thai food.Ruth: Oh, wow. So how do you make Thai food?Akane: Well, I don't know if I remember but I really enjoyed the cooking course. What was the course like?Ruth: Well, it was really interesting actually. They picked me up first thing in the morning and drove me to an outdoor market where they sold all kinds of fruits and vegetables and meats and spices and it was a kind of market where only the local people would go and they introduced me to a lot of different kinds of herbs and spices and fruits and vegetables that I've never even seen before so that was really interesting, and then they took me to the kitchen which was actually an outdoor kitchen right by a beach so I got to do cooking right in front of a beach it was very beautiful.Akane: Wow.Ruth: I was really lucky that day because I was the only student. It was still a new company that just opened up so I was the only student and so I got a lot of attention. There were two teachers that taught me how to do all these things and there was a lot of extra time at the end so they even taught me how to do fruit carving. I made leaves out of cucumber and flowers out of papaya fruit and things like that.Akane: That sounds fantastic.Ruth: It really was.Akane: And do you ever cook Thai at home now?Ruth: Ah, unfortunately I don't, but maybe if I have some time I might try itAkane:Good.",

I have a snake story. Todd: Ok Carla: We had a snake that lived in the bookcase. And you can never tell where he was except that that book was, except that that book was sticking out of the bookcase so you always knew where he was. And if you knocked on the book, you could pull it out and he would just lie there. But if you pulled the book out without knocking first, he would be frightened so he'd rear his head up and hiss at you and stick his tongue out and wiggle it around. He was a python, a baby python. Maybe two metres long. Todd: And you just let him live in the house? You didn't make the snake leave? Carla: When he was growing a little bit bigger, and he started leaving his skin around, we got fed up with that. I said to him “I'm fed up of clearing your skins away so you're out fella”. Todd: Wow, well who made the snake leave. How did you get him out of the house? Carla: Oh we just put him outside in the garden. Todd: Did you ever see him again? Carla: Oh I have scorpion stories too. Never mind scorpion stories. Todd: No no no, tell. Ya what's the scorpion story? Carla: Well, the scorpions were about… what ten, fifteen centimetres long. Great big black things. And a friend of mine had… We didn't have any running water in that village either. And so we had a man who would come in every morning with a big head load of water. A big huge bucket on his head carrying water, and he'd tip it into our huge barrel in the back garden. And then we would have to move it out bucket full by bucket full. Anyway, so our bathroom was always dry. There was never any water, the taps didn't work. And we kept our bath sponge on the edge of the bath. And one day, I went to take a shower to have a bath, and I picked up the sponge and I put it against myself and I got this terrible pain. Because there had been a scorpion hiding underneath the sponge. And it stung me. But luckily it stung me in a place where it didn't hurt so much. On my stomach. Todd: Wow. Carla: If you get it on your foot or you hand where you've got lots of nerves, it's really excruciating.  Todd: Oh man. I'm glad you're ok.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Anita, we were talking about your city, Prague. Now, your city now is really popular for tourists. How do you feel? Do you think that maybe your city has too many tourists? Or do you think, it's good and this brings a lot of money into your country? Anita: It definitely brings money into the economy. There's no doubt about that. That's why tourism is a very big... an important, you know, aspect for us. There are different kinds of tourists. There are tourists who come to Prague and to the Czech Republic to experience the history, you know, to look at the historical sites and to enjoy those and then are tourists who go there for the -- I would say -- the bad parts of society, you know the bad aspects of society, for example we have, what they call beer tours from the U.K.Todd: Beer tours.Anita: Yes. Where tourists, usually men, come in groups of, I don't know, ten, twenty, thirty just to drink beer in my country and unfortunately, in most cases, they don't come to nicely enjoy their tour, they usually come and, you know, get drunk and do other things, and that part of it, I really don't like because it sort of cheapens itI think.Todd: Sure, sure. Anita: Yeah, but other tourists, for example Japanese tourists are, you know, very orderly so those are nice to have there.Todd: Right, and I think in The States we have something similar. Many young people go to Tijuana Mexico, across the border just to drink, and I think it's a similar situation.Anita: I guess.Todd: But, overall you would say that it's a good thing, that, you know, the tourism brings money into Prague?Anita: I think any form of good tourism is good for a country as long as the tourists don't destroy the places they go to.Todd: Sure.Anita: For example, if you go to historical sites and you start scribbling your name on the walls or things like that, those are the bad parts of it, but as long as tourists are respectful to the culture, to the country, to the people, I guess tourism is good for any country, and we definitely depend on it.",

So we buy a small gift, 45 dollars, and then we play a small game where we exchange that gift amongst each other, so we don't have to buy gifts to everybody.Anja: Oh, that's quite nice, so it won't get too expensive, right?Fred: It won't but, personally, I like to buy gifts for my mother or my father and especially my grandmother and grandfather. It's very important, and so I enjoy doing the shopping for it.Anja: Oh, you do like shopping? Fred: For Christmas it's something different.Anja: It's really difficult on Christmas, right?

The first trip I ever did to South America I had the most massive backpack you could imagine. I mean I had to get it from a sort of military surplus store because I needed to have the kind of volume that a World War Two soldier would have had to carry things, all of his survival gear. When I travelled to Africa in my early twenties, I brought along things like, for example, a jungle hammock, you know because I was convinced that I was going to be stringing up the ropes of this, and sleeping above the ground because I was worried about some sort of dangerous animals that might come after me. When, then later, you find out the reality is, that you're always able to find some sort of accommodation even if it's very budget type and wasn't a problem.Jeff: Do you think... would you recommend this type of lifestyle to someone else?Jonathan: I don't know if my lifestyles very suitable for other people because they have more roots than I do. They've settled down in some way. They have a regular job that they have to go to. Myself, usually only working perhaps four months a year, I don't have the same responsibilities that other people do and I'm not married. I don't have kids. I have no need to decorate a room in any way.Jeff: Well, tomorrow, I'm getting rid of my house, all my possessions and saying goodbye to my girlfriend and buying suitcase.Jonathan: OK. As long as you don't try to live out of mine. There isn't enough room for you as well.",

And there’ll be hockey again starting in October. Todd: Ok now as a fan of hockey or just a sports fan in general, do you think that the athletes are making too much money, that it’s ok for them to strike and ask for more money?Alan: Yes I do think the athletes are making too much money. And I actually agree with the idea of having a salary cap, because I think it makes it more fair for all the teams in the league. Not just the big market teams that make a lot of money, but all the teams have a fair chance at the best players. Todd: Ok, can you just explain exactly what is a salary cap? Alan: Salary cap is the amount of money that a team is allowed to spend for their players. So, if you have a salary cap of 35 million dollars, the team is only allowed to spend that much total for all their players’ salaries. Todd: Oh I see. Alan: They cannot go over that. Todd: What is the reason that you would have a salary cap? What’s the argument behind it?Alan: So teams that have more money than other teams can’t just buy all the good players and leave the less talented players for the smaller market teams. So there’s more chance for the smaller market teams to compete with the large market teams for the good players.Todd: So do you think that hockey now is doing well, and that you will not have a strike for a long time to come?Alan: Yes I think after this one there won’t be another strike or lock-out for many years. Actually I think this deal is a 10-year deal. I think I read it’s a 10-year deal, so there won’t be one for at least 10 years, or longer hopefully.Todd: Well I’m glad you have hockey again.Alan: Thank you.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Shantel, you were saying that you grew up in a small town and had a very rustic life, but then you moved overseas to Italy, correct?\nShantel: Yes. I moved to Bologna. Bologna, Italy. \nTodd: Wow that's such a huge transition, what was that like? Why did you move to Italy? \nShantel: Oh wow. So I moved to Italy because I was studying abroad during my junior year at university. And so, I was to do an immersion program at the University of Bologna, which means all of my classes were in Italian. All of my homework, all of my exams, everything was completely in Italian. And I also had to find my own housing, which was also the first time I found housing on my own 'cause I had always lived in the university dorms at my university in the United States. And so, yeah. To navigate one a new city, a city in general and then finding my first apartment, and learning how to survive a new university system. It was exhilarating and very exciting. Yeah, I loved it. \nTodd: That's so cool. So, what was it like when you first got to Italy? Did you have culture shock? You came from a small town environment and now you're living in a big city in Europe. \nShantel: I think my friends would probably say that I was very quick to trust everyone. As I mentioned before growing up in a small town, I knew all my neighbors and I was very trusting of strangers and very welcoming, and I still am. But in hindsight, when I moved to Italy I think I was maybe a little too naïve sometimes and especially not knowing the language, it was easy to sort of put my trust or my faith in someone when I needed help because I needed help often, whether for translating or even just grocery shopping. And so, sometimes I think I look back I'm like, \"Oh, maybe I should have walked away a little bit sooner,\" or something like that.\nTodd: Right. Yeah. Compare life in Italy to life in the states. What was it like? How was it different?\nShantel: Life in Italy feels so much slower. People are still very productive and they're very passionate and they go to their jobs and they go to work, but there's just this sense of how important it is to enjoy your time, and to enjoy your time with family and with friends. So for example, I feel like in the United States people ... and this is very general, but I feel like people have their jobs and they work really hard to the point where maybe they're so tired they go home and they just want to watch Netflix or watch TV and relax, and that's their way of relaxing is being at home. And in Italy it feels like the way people recharge and the way that they relax and get their energy back is being in the company of their friends, and being in the company of their family. So they'll finish work and everyone will meet up for a drink in the center of town. And it's not to drink a lot it's really just to have a glass of wine, eat some delicious food, and just sit and talk, but about nothing really. Just enjoy the time and eventually people decide to go home, but it'll be hours later even though they're exhausted from work. But that's how they relax and that's how they get their energy back. And they go to work the next day and are productive. I really enjoyed that the most. \nTodd: I can relate to that. I was in Spain for about two months just traveling around and the one thing that I still remember the most is that I would go into a little pub, or a bar late at night, 10:00 a night and there would be old people. And I'm not talking like 50 or 60, I'm talking like 75 years old maybe. And they're well-dressed, and they're sitting at a table with their friends, and I can never imagine that happening in the United States. And it was so impressive. I was so impressed by that. That people really in the later years of their life still had that social spirit. They go out, they socialize, they have a good time. And we're talking late at night, like 10:00. You would never see that in America, ever. \nShantel: Yeah. I completely agree. And it's very similar in Italy too. \nTodd: So, what about the food? I hear the food is fantastic. Everyone raves about Italian food. \nShantel: Yes. It is so good. And I probably, wow, where to begin with food? I love the cheeses. There's just so many different kinds of cheese. I'm a huge cheese, meat, jam person. So the combination of having all of that available in Italy, especially the different regions are known for different foods. So sometimes you can't even eat a specific type of food unless you're in that city, otherwise you'd have to pay a lot to get it at a different part of the country. So, yeah I mean pizzas were delicious too. I know it's stereotypical but the pizzas were awesome and they're so different than the U.S. they're so thin, super, super thin there's no like deep dish pizza in Italy or double crust or cheese filled crust, that doesn't exist. \nTodd: Exactly. Like it melts in your mouth, right?\nShantel: Yeah. It's so delicious. And pastas of course are great. Their wines are delicious too. Yeah, I miss Italian food a lot. A lot. \nTodd: Well, I am thinking of going there so you'll have to give me some tips.\nShantel: I would love to. \nTodd: Cool.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So I’m here with Angela and\n                                we’re talking about families, differences in family\n                                culture and structure. We both have experience with the\n                                West. Actually, we’re both Westerners and we also have\n                                worked and lived in Thailand. \nHave you noticed the\n                                difference in the flow of money? Which I think is quite\n                                interesting. So in a lot of Asian cultures, especially\n                                Thailand, the flow of money goes from the\n                                children up. \nAngela: Yes. \nTodd: Whereas in the West, the flow of\n                                money goes from… \nAngela: Parents down. \nTodd: … the parents down or the older\n                                the family member down. \nAngela: Yes. \nTodd: It’s a completely different\n                                flow, which is quite interesting when you think about\n                                it. \nAngela: Isn’t it? Because, you know, a\n                                lot of the people that work in Bangkok and some of the\n                                tourist places in Thailand, they send money home. They\n                                don’t earn money for their own keep and their\n                                own life. They actually send money home to the villages\n                                to pay for their children, to pay for their mothers, and\n                                I think it affects the way the people respect people\n                                within the family. There’s huge respect for older people\n                                in Thailand that I didn’t notice in the West, and I\n                                think it may be something to do with the fact that they\n                                are still giving to their parents?\nTodd: Yeah, you know, that’s so true.\n                                I think also the fact that the family is almost like a\n                                bank. \nAngela: Yes. \nTodd: And they have a pool of wealth\n                                that they use together as a unit, which I think is just\n                                a great concept. \nAngela: Yeah. \nTodd: Although when I say this, I\n                                don’t give money up to my mother so… But I’m always\n                                thinking I wish my family did this. Our family in the\n                                West, we should adopt this practice. You know, everybody\n                                gives 10% to the pool, to the family pool. \nAngela: Yes. \nTodd: But I don’t know if it would\n                                ever work.\nAngela: I don’t know if it would work,\n                                no. \nTodd: I mean, so you have kids. \nAngela: Yes. \nTodd: How would you feel if suddenly\n                                your children started giving you 10% of everything they\n                                made?\nAngela: Great. Wouldn’t that be\n                                wonderful? But it’s not going to happen. \nTodd: Right. \nAngela: It’s just not in our society. \nTodd: Yeah. But you wouldn’t spend it\n                                though, right? Like the whole idea is like they just\n                                give it to the – like you would be the guardian, you\n                                would be the safe keeper of the money.\nAngela: Yeah, I’d probably have the\n                                money and then put the money away for them. \nTodd: Right. \nAngela: Because I think that the\n                                pressures in the West are different, as well. You know,\n                                it’s very hard for people to become house owners. So for\n                                my kids, it’s going to be very, very difficult for them\n                                to go on the property ladder. So if they gave me\n                                any money, I would give it back to them as a deposit. \nTodd: Yeah. You know, although there\n                                is one other thing that goes the other way, which is in\n                                Japan… I hope I say this right. I think it’s called otoshidama. Basically, you\n                                get money from your relatives. If you’re a child or a\n                                kid, you get money from your relatives on January 1st.\n                                They give you an envelope and sometimes kids might get\n                                $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 dollars on New Year’s, depending\n                                how wealthy your family is. And I think there’s Chinese\n                                New Year, maybe they do something similar. The kids get\n                                money, I’m not sure. So there is the other flow where\n                                families do give kids money, I think. \n\nAnd also, I remember years ago, when I first came to\n                                Thailand I was talking with a guy and I said, “Yeah, you\n                                know one thing that shocked me about kids in Thailand is\n                                they don’t… Nobody works. They don’t have part-time\n                                jobs. Not that many have part-time jobs.” Although it’s\n                                changed. I said, “In America, you work and it’s a good\n                                thing, like you build values.” And he said,\n                                “Yeah, well, you know, in Thailand they can’t do that\n                                because if a child works, especially for a middle class\n                                family, it’s an embarrassment to the family. Like the\n                                father can’t provide for his children. His children have\n                                to work when they should be studying.” So it’s really\n                                interesting the different dynamics in money across\n                                cultures.",

In Bangladesh, what is an environmental problem?\nEnam: Actually, we have a lot of environmental problems in Bangladesh but mainly I'd say the soil contamination is quite bad, and also the air pollution and nowadays we also have water pollution because of tanneries in the cities.\nKatia: So, tell me a little bit more about soil contamination?Enam: Actually, we used to use a lot of polythene bags while shopping for the last ten or fifteen years, but the government has banned polythene two years ago I think but still, we still have a lot of polythene bags in our soil and the polythene bags, it doesn't go away, or it stays in the ground for more than a hundred years, and for that reason the soil loses its fertility and also even if you want to ... if you try to build buildings, you cannot build more than a certain level.Katia: Alright, what about the air pollution? Is it a big problem?Enam: Actually, yes, it is a big problem in the capital city in Dhaka because there are a lot of transports, like cars there, and some of them are very old, and it pollutes a lot and there's dust everywhere in Dhaka, so if you go out in Dhaka in the moring, you must have to take a shower at night.Katia: Wow! That must be something else. In regards to air pollution, is there something being done to help the problem?Enam: Yeah, actually, the government is taking a lot of steps like nowadays if you want to import second hand cars from other countries, it couldn't be older than six years, and they always check the transports that are being driven in Dhaka, and if it it is like bad to the environment, they just ban those transportation and tranports from Dhaka.Katia: And you also mentioned water pollution. What is the situation with water pollution? Enam: Actually, the situation is really bad, like the water we have supplied by the government as a infrastructure in Dhaka, it's really bad. The quality is really bad. You cannot drink that water, and if you want to use that water, you have to like bottle that water, and you have to add all this purification process to use the water. And also, we had some tanneries in the city, around the city, and the waste from those tanneries went into the river and it was quite a bad situation, then the government decided transfer these tanneries out of the city in another place, and it was mandatory for the tanneries to use some more technology to reduce the amount of waste they produce.Katia: OK, that sounds good. I hope it will benefit the city.Enam: Yes, I hope so.",

No, 1-all because at the last minute England scored to make it 2-1, but that goal was disallowed so then it went to extra time and then I think Portugal scored first, then England scored again to make it 2-all and then it went to penalties, and David Beckham missed, uh a terrible terrible goal, missed a penalty, and then I think Portugal missed one and then England missed again and then Portugal's goalkeeper scored and then it was all over. \n\t                    Todd: Ah, well, maybe next time. \n                        Lois: Maybe, maybe World Cup in Germany in 2006.\n                        Todd: So who do you think is going to win it all?\n                        Lois: So in the first match, it was Portugal against Greece and Greece won 2-1, so although Greece are the underdogs, I think maybe they can win, but it is in Portugal, so maybe Portugal will win with the home crowd.\n                        Todd: Are you going to watch it?\n                        Lois: I would love to watch it, but in Japan it's on at 3:45 in the morning, and so I don't think I'm going to miss my sleep to watch it.",

        "transcript": "Presenter: Now the 2020 Olympics might seem a long way away to you, but people are already talking about what new sports might be included. Today I’m going to talk to two people who are hoping their sport might be included. The first is Jonny Mills whose sport is wakeboarding. Jonny, can you tell us what wakeboarding is? Is it like surfboarding?\nJonny: Well, a bit. It started in California because people wanted to surf but didn’t have waves ... It’s also a bit like waterskiing in that the rider is towed behind a specially-built speed boat.\nPresenter: How fast does the boat go?\nJonny: Usually at about 25 mph, or a bit less. The rider uses the wake the board produces in the water to launch into the air.\nPresenter: And then you do a lot of complicated things in the air?\nJonny: That’s right, spins of up to 1260 degrees, things like that.\nPresenter: 1260 degrees, that’s impossible isn’t it?\nJonny: Oh no, but it’s pretty crazy. You spin round three and a half times in the air.\nPresenter: And then you have to land again without falling over.\nJonny: You’ll have to come and watch some wakeboarding if you haven’t seen any. Come to Wakestock in July if you can.\nPresenter: That’s in Wales, isn’t it?\nJonny: Yep, Abersoch in North Wales. It’s a really popular wakeboarding and music festival. It’s right by the beach. It’s not quite the same as California, but it’s cool. It attracts a lot of great riders.\nPresenter: Who does wakeboarding?\nJonny: They reckon about 3 million people all over the world. More guys do it, but there are increasing numbers of girls too. The people who compete are usually in their teens or twenties, but anyone can do it. There’s a lot of crossover with other board sports like surfing and skateboarding. The tricks people pull are similar and the names for things are often the same.\nPresenter: And looking at you, I’d say the fashion was similar too.\nJonny: Yeah, the clothes and the lifestyle are similar.\nPresenter: Right, now I’d like to ask Jules Russell about her sport. She’s a skater in a roller derby team. Tell us about that, Jules. Is it a popular sport?\nJules: Yes, it’s becoming really popular in the UK. There are about 60 leagues in England and 1,200 throughout the world. In the US and Canada, of course, and places like Scandinavia and Australia, but lots of other countries too.\nPresenter: The sport began in the States, didn’t it?\nJules: Yes, in the 1930s, but it was more for entertainment than sport and it died out by the 1970s. Then there was a revival in Texas in 2001 and from then on it’s just been growing and growing.\nPresenter: So how do you play it?\nJules: Well, you have two teams of five people on roller skates, of course, and they go round an oval track in the same direction. Each team has a \"jammer\" who scores points by passing members of the opposing team. They do whatever they can to stop her, within reason. The team with the most points at the end of the match wins.\nPresenter: It sounds a bit rough!\nJules: Well, it’s a contact sport, so there’s bound to be a lot of pushing and falling over. It’s all good fun, though; people don’t often get hurt. If you try and trip someone up you get penalised. You do try and frighten the other team a bit though.\nPresenter: That’s right. You have frightening clothes and special names.\nJules: People used to have incredible costumes a couple of years ago. Now the sport is changing and becoming more professional. Lots of the teams train three or four times a week, and spend a lot of time in the gym you have to be really dedicated and fit. We still have nicknames, though. I’m “The Julifier”.\nPresenter: And is the sport all female?\nJules: There are a few men who do it, but it’s mostly female and amateur at the moment. Things are changing fast though, so who knows what the future will bring. It would be fantastic to be an Olympic sport.\nPresenter: What do you think about roller derby, Jonny?\nJonny: It’s wild! Those ladies scare me to death! Good luck to them with the Olympics thing though. And good luck to us too.\nPresenter: Good luck to you both.",

Good to see you. \n                              \nTodd: Good to see you.\nRichard: Long time no see.\nTodd: Yeah, it's been awhile.\nRichard: It's been awhile.\nTodd: Richard, you helped me out when I first started the website. \nRichard: My pleasure. \nTodd: Yeah, you're very kind and you talked about your dog!\nRichard: Lucky! Here he is! This is Lucky's picture.\nTodd: Wow! That's big. So tell us about Lucky. How's lucky been the last two years?\nRichard: Lucky, the last two year! Yeah! Lucky is almost two years old. His birthday is November the 11th! One-One-One-One, so he'll be 2 years old. He's doing well. He's developed some unique, sort of characteristics, personality traits. One is that late at night he doesn't like walking just with me, it has to be with me and my wife together. So he has two big bodyguards. It's true. It's an unusual thing but he will not walk by the river where it's very dark with just one person. He needs two people to walk him. Which is unusual for a dog. He's a golden retriever so he's a big dog, but he's just, he needs two people and he gets very lonely, you know he likes to follow people around the house the whole time, you know he's a really, he's a very sort of sociable dog. \nTodd: What a lovely dog?\nRichard: Yes, lovely dog! \nTodd: I want to meet him!\nRichard: Yeah, well, anytime!\nTodd: So, I think you were saying something earlier about how he gets cold.\nRichard: Yeah, that's the other thing. One of the other unique things about Lucky is that I think he's a but spoiled. I mean, you know, a lot of dogs live outdoors but this dog lives indoors, and you know the kotatsu, in the winter my obaachan, my wife's mother has the kotatsu.\nTodd: Yeah, like the kotatsu is like a big blanket.\nRichard: Ah, yeah, like a little low table.\nTodd: Oh, the kotatsu, oh, yeah, yeah, sorry\nRichard: An electric heater underneath it \nTodd: Yeah, that's right, sorry!\nRichard: And cat in Japan, cats are famous for going under the kotatsu in winter but my dog goes under the Kotatsu, so and he's quite big right, so you just see his legs poking out of the kotatsu. I mean that's a very unusual behavior for a golden retriever. Yeah, yeah, he's and unusual dog. \nTodd: So how much does he eat?\nRichard: I see, what about my son. I want to talk about my son. \nTodd: Well, no but like, first I'm just curious, how much does you dog eat?\nRichard: How much does he eat? Well, it's three times a day. \nTodd: Yeah, I mean, how much does it cost?\nRichard: Oh, the cost!\nTodd: Yeah, to feed a dog in Japan!\nRichard: Well, that's a good, that's a tough question. I buy a big bag of food. It costs me 18,000 yen and that lasts about three months, so about 6,000 yen. \nTodd: Man, that is expensive! So you're dog, that's at least 6,000 yen a month on food.\nRichard: And then Vet's bills are pretty high.\nTodd: Wow! But he's worth it! It seems like you love your dog.\nRichard: I love my dog. I carry his picture everywhere.\nTodd: That's my favorite dog too! Golden Retrievers. They're so kind. \nRichard: I also love my son! Can I talk about my son!\nTodd: OK, we'll do your son in the next interview.",

And for all that negative baggage that comes with that term, yes I am a drummer.Todd: Wait wait, so you say that there’s negative terms that go with being a drummer?Tres: Well sometimes when people hear “oh they’re a musician” you know, “oh you better watch out for them”. Yeah, it’s true. Todd: OK. Well, what kind of drums do you play?Tres: I grew up playing in punk bands, mostly because those were the only bands scouting for drummers at the time. However, what I enjoy playing is funk, jazz, blues and salsa, specifically Cuban salsa. Todd: OK. Now, so for the different types of music that you play, do you always use the drum sticks, or do you sometimes just use your hands? Tres: When I play on a drum set, I either use drum sticks or a bundle of sticks that are really small called hot rods, or brushes. Usually if I’m doing a jazz piece or a very soft acoustic set, I’ll use brushes. If I’m using other percussion instruments, for example a jimbei, then of course I use my hands. Todd: What’s a jimbei? Tres: Jimbei is a large drum that comes from West Africa. And you play with your hands using various African poly-rhythms. And lately, a lot of Western drummers have picked up the drum, and have fused Western rhythms along with African and Latin poly-rhythms. So it’s a very fun, but very difficult instrument to play. Todd: What do you prefer, using the sticks, or the hot rods or using your hands.Tres: Again it depends on the music that I’m playing. I enjoy playing in general. My preference would be playing the drum set with the sticks, just because I really love the more rocky-fusion-type-jazz, the more avant guard type stuff. And I also like salsa, which usually, you know you have your clave, which is a little wooden-like block. And your calmo, and you also have timbales, which are two drums that you hit on. Sorry for the bad description. Todd: That’s OK. When you’re playing the drums, do you ever lose a drum stick?Tres: I have in the past, yeah. Those question you’re asking are very very embarrassing for a drummer to answer. But yes, sometimes I’ve thrown them into the audience, usually on purpose. But occasionally, a drummer will lose a drum stick. So you usually have a pouch that you’ll put either next to your high hat, which are two symbols that you open and close with your foot, or next to a fore tomb which is the large drum that sits on the ground. So you have extra sticks that you can grab when you need them. Todd: Sounds cool. Tres: Very cool.",

        "transcript": "Jeff: So, Jonathan, I'd like to meet a nice girl. I'm looking to meet a nice girl but I'm not quite sure where we should go to meet women. What do you think? Where's a good place to meet some women?\nJonathan: You know, that's hard to say, I mean, there are all kinds of things that work for other people that they haven't necessarily worked for me. I mean, I talk to people who say that met girls in libraries, but I don't really want to go to a library. Usually they've got a silence rule. I don't want to go up and try to talk to a girl and have the librarian say, SHHH!\n                              \nJeff: Actually, one of my friends told me that he met a girl in the grocery store once in one of the aisles. He was looking at milk and she came up beside him, so maybe we should go get some groceries.\nJonathan: That seems to be a really unnatural kind of way to meet women in a grocery store. Maybe is a woman sees that you're buying individual portions of something and you're buying like little TV dinners that are only put in the microwave oven, she knows that you don't have someone at home cooking for you, but if I go out and I see a woman filling a basket with lots of tomatoes and cucumbers and so on, then I imagine she's probably cooking for a family.\nJeff: Well, why don't we go do something like bowling. Bowling! Women love to bowl. I'm sure we can meet some nice ladies at the bowling alley.\nJonathan: Oh, but women don't like putting on those ugly shoes.\nJeff: Well, then...\nJonathan: It's unfashionable when they go to the bowling alleys.\nJeff: Well, then, shopping! Let's go shopping. Girls love shopping. We can meet them at a store.\nJonathan: Girls love shopping but then they're gonna make you hold their bags for two hours while they go and try on different things. That's no fun.\nJeff: OK.\nJonathan: How about a concert?\nJeff: Ah, no, Too noisy.\nJonathan: Yeah, I guess you can't talk to women there.\nJeff: Well, I think actually, another one of my friends once met a lady at a bank - the bank teller.\nJonathan: Bank teller.\nJeff: Yeah.\nJonathan: That would seem like a little bit of a strange thing, and there I think the woman would be judging you by how much money you have in your account. She'd be able to see all of your information.\nJeff: Well, actually, I think let's just go to the pub.\nJonathan: OK.",

We do have some land in the Preseli Mountains and the Gwynne Valley which is a beautiful wooded area, but mainly it’s the coastal area and the coastal path is one of the big things we push with the tourists. ‘\nDai: So is it a protected area or...?\nSharron: Yeah, it’s protected and we help maintain it by cutting back the paths and maintaining the right of way for people so that they can walk the whole of the coastal path which is from St. Dogmaels in the north right around the coast, 186 miles ‘round to Amroth in the south. \nDai: So you get a lot of visitors who want to do that kind of outdoor activity?\nSharron: Yeah, we get lots of inquiries in my job from people who ask about how they go about planning a trip. Mainly, people will take, say, two weeks off work to come and walk, say, ten miles or so everyday, staying in youth hostels, bed and breakfast places, hotels, or camping every night and then carry on walking the next day. \nDai: So I guess there is a lot of activities and things for them to do in that area?\nSharron: Yeah, there is some lovely things to do and some great things to see. I mean, you can do all sorts of water sports in the area.\nDai: Oh really? What kind of water sports?\nSharron: Surfing, sailing, there’s lots of places 'cause it’s all mainly on the coast that most visitors come to see. Places like St. David’s, Tembe, most of those areas will have great outlets for, and organizations that will run courses for things like coasteering which is a great activity to do. \nDai: So if it’s a, I guess, if it’s a protected area, is there a lot of wildlife and...?\nSharron: Yeah, there’s a huge amount of wildlife and one of the main activities that a lot of people like to do is to come and go on the boat trips to some of the islands such as Ramsey, Skockholm, Skomer. You can take boat trips especially to somewhere like Skomer and between the end of May to about the middle of July, you can go over to Skomer for the day and watch the Puffins landing with beaks full of fish and running into their little burrows underground to feed their chicks. \nDai: Oh wow.\nSharron: But they're only there for sort of a couple of months, but there’s plenty of other wildlife to see. There’s rabbits, owls, all sorts of voles and unusual animals you can see on the island as well. It’s a really good day out. \nDai: Yeah, sounds like an interesting place.\nSharron: Yeah, excellent.",

Like how late do you normally sleep?\n\nAdrienne: Um, probably until 10 or 11 o'clock. \n\nTodd: Ooh, that's pretty late.\n\nAdrienne: I know. That's the best part.\n\nTodd: That's terrible actually.\n\nAdrienne: It's not terrible. It's good for you. You can catch up on your sleep, from a busy week.\n\nTodd: Yeah, but don't you think you're giving away the best time of the day. Like that's, if you sleep, you give away that time. You're never going to have it back. \n\nAdrienne: But, it's also relaxing which is something that you don't get to do during the week.\n\nTodd: Mm, that's true. That's true. But for me, it's, I like to get up early. I mean, do you ever get up early on Saturday or Sunday?\n\nAdrienne: Ah, sometimes, if I have an activity planned for the day - errands, shopping, hiking - that kind of thing.\n\nTodd: OK, well, what about food. What do you normally eat?\n\nAdrienne: On Sundays? I like to make an omelet for breakfast, ah, cheese omelet usually. \n\nTodd: What do you put inside the omelet besides cheese?\n\nAdrienne: Mushrooms (Ooh, that's good) and sometimes avocado, if I can find it. It's delicious. \n\nTodd: Do you do this every Sunday?\n\nAdrienne: No, it's not a habit but when I can, when I think of it, when I'm up early enough. \n\nTodd: OK, well, let's talk about last sunday? What did you do last Sunday? Do you remember?\n\nAdrienne: Mm, last Sunday? I was packing.\n\nTodd: Packing for what?\n\nAdrienne: To come to Japan. \n\nTodd: Oh, yeah!

We had a lot of turbulence.\n\nTodd: Ooh, what's turbulence?\n\nAdrienne: Turbulence is when the plane hits some kind of air pockets and bounces around. You have to put your seatbelt on so you don't get knocked over.\n\nTodd: Yeah, they go \"bong!\"\n\nAdrienne: Exactly!",

Did you enjoy it?\nJade: Yeah being in the army, I enjoyed it. Maybe some other Koreans will really surprised when I say I really enjoyed the military right? But ... because you know we have to go there for compulsory business and compulsory service for two years. Two years is very long but to me it was a very significant time and very precious time to me. For saying the truth, I am sort of ashamed to say this but I was 117 kilogram before entering the army.\nTodd: 117! I can't believe that! You're tiny. How much do you weigh now?\nJade: Now I am 68 kilogram.\nTodd: Oh my gosh, that's half.\nJade: Yes, it's almost half. When I finished the army just a year ago I was almost 62. I gained 6 more kilograms when I finished the army, now I'm... I get a little bit fat, but I'm still 68 kilograms.\nTodd: Wait a minute, you lost what is that 50 kilograms, 55 kilograms in one year?\nJade: Yeah, in a year, in the army.\nTodd: Oh my gosh, 55 kilograms in one year? How did you do it? ... Was it the food, was it the exercise?\nJade: In the army, every day, about the amount of food we ate it doesn't matter I think I ate more but everyday we ate regularly, like three meals on the exact time and everyday we had to do lots of training(s) like, you know, maybe somebody knows about the martial arts TaeKwonDo, a Korean traditional thing. Everyday we practice that and we ... everyday we practice lots of martial arts and lots of training things for health, so it helps me to lose weight. You know that ??? life is the best way to lose your weight.\nTodd: When you came out of the army and you went back home, people must have been shocked?\nJade: Yeah, everyone was shocked, everyone but ... they understood because most of Korean boys when they finish the army, they get changed.",

Eoin is talking about what happens after one of his performances with is band.Todd: So, usually, do people come up and talk to you after the show, or are people usually kind of shy and they don't know how to approach you?Eoin: Yeah, so that's another thing. I mean we have a CD stall and some people are very forward and they'll come and instantly like rush up and buy a CD but I think in Japan, especially it seems like people are kind of shyer about approaching you so giving out a questionnaire and asking people write it, it gives them an excuse to come up and talk to you anyway if they're interested later. So yeah, whenever we've given out questionnaires, it seems like we sell more CDs on those days.Todd: Then you just actually pass this out to the audience?Eoin: Yeah. Normally there's not that huge a number of people there, maybe forty or fifty people.Todd: Yeah.Eoin: Maybe a few more. It depends on the night. So this is... what I'm describing here is for a gig that's sort of away from home, you know. We played a concert just recently in Oita where we live and that was more of an event that we organized so we pretty much knew most of the people who had come anyway. In that case we played for longer, didn't do the questionnaire thing and just went out drinking after the gig. It was a more relaxed event on the night and afterwards but of course preparing for it in advance required a lot more effort - making sure people came and calling other bands to come and play with us and that sort of side of things.Todd: So do you have a fan base? A big fan base?Eoin: I wouldn't say it's massive but, yeah I guess when we play in Oita normally somewhere between, on a good day maybe 35, 40. On a bad day 15 to 20 people will come and see us.Todd: Still, that's good.Eoin: But, I mean, that's more, you know, we have to pro-actively contact them and say \"Hey, you wanna come and see the band?\" It's not like we just put an advert in the paper and everyone turns up, unfortunately.Todd: Well, hey, you know. Give it time.",

Mini: The basic difference of shopping in Sri Lanka is that you can bargain, like most of the places you can bargain, so if you and talk to the seller like very friendly and saying that you don't have that much money, you only have this much money, and then he will of course reduce the price for you.Todd: That's pretty cool. So, does this only apply to shopping for food or shopping for clothing or is it for everything?Mini: I think it's for everything, even for jewelry, furniture, everything you can bargain.Todd: OK, now are things, most things in Sri Lanka much cheaper than they are in Japan or the United States?Mini: Of course, it's very much cheaper.When I come here and see and it's like half the price. Todd: Wow, half the price.Mini: Yeah, most of it. For example, if it's like a 100 yen here, the thing in Sri Lanka will be like maybe ten yen, twenty yen, so it's like very cheap.Todd: Wow. That is a big difference. Only twenty percent of the original cost.Mini: But on the other hand, the salary that we receive is quite lower than the salary that you receive in Japan, so maybe in terms of Sri Lankan people it's expensive but for me, when I see from this perspective it's very cheap.Todd: Right, so if you buy a shirt, like a nice cotton shirt in Sri Lanka, how much would that cost?Mini: Around a 100 rupees in terms of yen, and it will be around 150 yen, 200 yen.Todd: That is cheap.Mini: It's very cheap.Todd: OK, and how about if you want to buy a nice suit, you want to buy slacks and a jacket and a tie and a dress shirt, how much would that cost?Mini: If you want to order it order-made, it will be around 5,000 yen, around 4,000 rupees, but if it's just like the suit in the shop, it's more cheaper than that.Todd: Even cheaper.Mini: Yeah, around 4,000 yen.Todd: So, 4,000 yen. Now, 4,000 yen is how much in rupees?Mini: 3,500, 3,200 rupees around.Todd: Yeah, I think in dollars that would be about 35 dollars.Mini: That's very cheap.Todd: That's really cheap.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Lois have you ever been to a professional football match in England? \n\t\t\t            Lois: Yes, I have. I support a team called Leicester city, and when I used to be at university I used to live in Leicester. I used to go to quite a few of their matches. \n\t\t\t            Todd: OK, so what's it like when you go to a professional game?\n\t\t                Lois: So first of all, the fans are all separated, because in England there's sometimes violence at football, so they like to keep the fans away from each other, and there's always a lot of police there, but I've never been at a match where there's been any trouble, so that's been OK. Um, the atmosphere is normally amazing because the smallest grounds hold about 20,000 people, so you get quite a good crowd, and because their stadiums are quite small, you're quite close to the pitch, so my team weren't very good though, so often my team would lose, so it wasn't so good, but when they one it was fantastic. Really, really good atmosphere and lots of fun. \n\t\t                Todd: That's cool. So how much does it cost to get it?\n\t                    Lois: See again, it's quite expensive so maybe now for the lower teams it probably, cheapest ticket is 25 pounds, but for example if you wanted to go and see Manchester United play, play then maybe 50 pounds or more, but it's really really difficult to get tickets for Manchester United because everybody has a season ticket, so if you want to go and watch them you have to know somebody who can get you a ticket. It's difficult to just buy a ticket for those games. \n\t                    Todd: Do you like Manchester United?\n                        Lois: I think there a good team. I think that the reason a lot of people don't like them is because they used to win all the time, so now they don't win so much, because now Arsenal win most of the time. So I think they're a good team, but I don't think you can like them if you're not from Manchester. \n                        Todd: So Leicester is a very hard word to spell. I take it it's not L-E-S-T-E-R, no?\n                        Lois: No. If you were an American you would probably pronounce it Lie-Se-Ster, so it's spelled L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R.\n                        Todd: Well, again! One more time!\n                        Lois: L-E-I-C-E-S-T-E-R\n                        Todd: Wow, that's quite a handful. Alright, thanks, Lois.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Monica, you are actually a trained physical education teacher.\nMonica: Yes, that's right.\nTodd: So, we often hear about how kids today are not fit, and they don't exercise enough. Do you think that's true?Monica: I think it is true, yes. I think kids these days spend a lot more time on the computer than they used to, so of course that means less time outside and getting fit.Todd: Now, in some countries there's a big debate about how much fitness kids actually do in school, so in your country, in New Zealand, do kids still do a lot of fitness actually in school?Monica: Well, recently the P.E. curriculum got amalgamated with the health curriculum, so P.E. and health were considered to be important in school, and the health side of the curriculum is often taught in the classroom, and of course the P.E. side often taught outside the classroom, and there's always debate about how much kids should be doing inside school. In fact very recently, now that it has become quite a big problem in New Zealand for teenagers, there has been talk about increasing the number of P.E. lessons that students have, but the current Prime Minister I think believes that the emphasis should be put on out-of-school activities like clubs and encouraging students to become more involved in that side of things.Todd: What do you feel? Do you think it should be?Monica: I actually agree to be honest, because I think if you increase the number of P.E. lessons that students have in a week, it doesn't actually necessarily increase their motivation to be involved in physical activity, but if like he's suggesting, you increase the opportunities outside of school, students maybe become involved in a sport that they choose, that they'd like to do and they hopefully can take it on as a lifetime sport. Yeah, which is important.Todd: Butt wouldn't the counter argument be that only kids that have a natural inclination to play sports would want to join those clubs and if the kids that are more sedentary or don't enjoy physical activity won't join a club, so you need to actually make them do fitness at school?Monica: Yeah, that's true. That is a counter argument, and a very good one … to argue on some other occasion. Of course I can talk about that side of the argument as well if you want me to.Todd: No, it's Okay. Basically, you saw there's … both sides make a good point.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Michael, this is a beautiful home.\nMike: Yeah, we've lived here for about twelve years and it's too big for us now.\nTodd: Really. It's pretty big.\nMike: Well yeah, I mean, it's got four bedrooms and it's got this big living room area and dining room area, and I've got two kids and both of them are in college now, so they don't live here anymore. So my wife and I are thinking about, you know, moving to a smaller house.\nTodd: Oh, that makes sense. Well, so where are you going to move?\nMike: Well, this area is called Walnut Creek, it's in the East Bay of San Francisco, and we want to move into an area that's in the Berkeley Hills. It's called Orinda.\nTodd: Oh, yeah. That's nice.\nMike: Oh, it's very nice. I mean it's a little more inconvenient, and it's not as convenient as here but it's a little more, there's more privacy, and there's more nature, you know more like old established trees and hills, and a little quieter, and so all those things appeal to us, so we're looking. It's not easy to find a right place but we're, actually today we're gonna meet a realtor, and we're going to be looking at some houses that are available and see if you like any of them.\nTodd: You know, actually, I've been thinking about getting a house. I'm kind of getting up there in age. What is the process of buying a house? Like how do you go about it?\nMike: Well the first step to find a place is you, generally you have to work with a realtor, somebody who has access to homes that are for sale, and then you sort of look through the listings and you find ones that you like, that you can afford, and then you visit with the realtor, and say you find a house that you like, like there is one that we're going to visit today that we think we like and we're going to check it out again. After we visit we make an offer sheet, we draw an offer sheet, that says how much we're willing to pay for the house, and the owner looks over the offer sheet. They never meet us directly, they meet only through their (the realtor) the realtors talk to each other. The buyer and the seller never actually talk to each other directly, and in this case, the house is going to have multiple offers. Many people will want this house. \nTodd: OK\nMike: So they're not going to look at the offers until next week, and say five or ten people bid on it, they're probably going to take the one, the person who offers the most money for it, so it's competitive.\nTodd: That is a tough situation.\nMike: Yeah, so sometimes you'll find a house that you love, and you can afford, but somebody outbids you. Somebody bids more for the house than you do and you lose it, and you have to keep looking so it can take weeks of months.\nTodd: Wow, well\nMike: To find the house you want.\nTodd: Sounds tough. Good luck.\nMike: Thanks a lot",

As I told you before, we got married in Ghana, and we moved to Nigeria. And our kids were born in Nigeria. But I wanna tell you a little bit about before our kids were born, because we lived in a place, a small small village that had no running water, no electricity, we could buy fresh food once a week. That means there were no toilettes, so the people used the rocks and the bushes around the village. Maybe that's too graphic, is that too graphic? Todd: No no no no. Carla: And, we had to pump our water out of a well. And at night we would pump one bucket full of water, and it would be half full of silt by the next morning the kind of muddy silt would have sunk to the bottom. And then we would pour off the clear water off the top. And it was a bad drought year in 1976. And we had to, we would cook our vegetables and then drain off the water and then use the water, reuse the water to wash the dishes and even to wash our clothes. And we had just enough water to. Fresh water we kept for drinking. Washing ourselves, washing our vegetables, cooking, washing the dishes, we used, reused vegetable water. And I had, we had no electricity so I cooked a stew once a week. And twice or three times a day I had to, we had to heat the stew up again, boil it to kill all the germs. Otherwise, it would've poisoned us. Todd: Man. Carla: But in that year that we lived there, I think we were healthier than we had ever been before, or since.",

        "transcript": "Presenter: So, we're back in the studio. Welcome back, everyone. My name's Rick Walker. From our laptops to our televisions, from the displays on our smartphones to those on our satnavs, we are in front of screens all the time. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to disconnect completely? To choose not to have access to the internet? If you have, you may be in need of a digital detox – a total switch-off from all things digital. The idea of people taking a digital detox is becoming more and more popular, especially amongst young people – and today we're joined by someone who's tried a number of digital detox activities and is here to give us some advice about it. Amanda Vince, welcome to the studio.\n\nAmanda: Thank you very much.\n\nPresenter: So, Amanda, you work for a fashion magazine in London, right? I guess your work means you need to be online a lot.\n\nAmanda: Oh, yes. Apart from the hundreds of emails I get every day, I'm always browsing fashion websites, as well as online videos. I also need to be very active online, especially on Twitter and Instagram – sharing what we're doing in the magazine, interacting with designers, photographers, influencers … it never stops, literally. Then of course there's my friends and family to keep in touch with online too, and for me, my work grew out of my passion, so friends and work colleagues aren't two totally separate groups of people and it all gets a bit messy online sometimes. I think I'm online for at least 12 hours a day.\n\nPresenter: So, how did you get the idea for a digital detox?\n\nAmanda: I read a book about it, called Log Off: How to Stay Connected after Disconnecting. The author's name is Blake Snow. That book gave me some really good advice and made me think about trying to change some of my digital habits. I started with removing distraction.\n\nPresenter: What do you mean by that?\n\nAmanda: That means turning off alerts, buzzes, alarms or notifications of any kind. I had notifications set up for everything, and it meant I was always being forced to look at my phone. Removing all of them except for important contacts helped me focus immediately. The book also made a really good point, that we should ask ourselves 'Why?' every time we take out our phone. I realised that most of the times I looked at my phone were because I was trying to avoid or ignore something else happening right in front of me. It was an automatic habit.\n\nPresenter: I have to confess, that happens to me too. But what else are you going to do when you're standing in line at the bank or waiting for your train?\n\nAmanda: OK, yes, I'm the first to admit that it's great for helping time go by. But speaking personally, I found I wasn't just checking my phone to kill time when I was alone. I was also doing it with friends or family around.\n\nPresenter: Hmmm … right. Well, so far, this doesn't sound too drastic. Turning off notifications and becoming aware of when we use our devices. That sounds easy.\n\nAmanda: Yes, it's the first step. Once we begin to realise just how much of a grip our devices have on us, then we're ready to really take the next step. First, my partner and I did a weekend with absolutely no screens. She found it easier than I did. For me, it was a little bit scary at first but it turned out to be a pretty rewarding experience.\n\nPresenter: A whole weekend, huh? I don't know if I could ...\n\nAmanda: I think everyone has to do this at their own pace. If a weekend feels too much, maybe just try for an evening. Then work your way up to more. I guarantee, once you've tried it, you'll want to try it again. We're going to try for a whole week in the summer.\n\nPresenter: OK, let's pause there then and see what our listeners have to say. You can call us here directly, or send us a message on any of our social media channels ... oops, should I be saying that? Anyway, more after the break.",

So, I'm gonna give you a quiz.Rebecca: Oh,God, I'll probably fail.Todd: OK, the first one is, do you procrastinate? Are you a procrastinator?Rebecca: Yes. For certain things. And also for study.Todd: Oh, really.Rebecca: Yeah.Todd: Cause you're a student?Rebecca: Yes. Yes. So. When I have study to do, it just more ahhhhh, there's other things that I could be doing.Todd: Right, so if you have a paper or something, you wait till the night before?Rebecca: Yeah. It's always last minute. I've heard that if you were a last minute person in high school, you will always be a last minute person throughout your life, so it doesn't leave much hope for me.Todd: You're set for life.Rebecca: Yep.Todd: Next is, are you somebody who worries a lot?Rebecca: Sometimes. Yes. Probably when I need to plan things. Yeah. Then I'll worry about if everything is OK, but other times it's just... I'll just go with the flow.Todd: Go with the flow. Do you worry about things like money or do you worry about things like like the future or stuff like that? Or are you pretty much easy going and...?Rebecca: I sort of do think about the future a bit and worry a little bit of you know, what's gonna happen, but other than that, no, I just see what happens. Money-wise, not really worry about it too much. I can't budget, so I don't worry about money.Todd: OK, that last one is, what about details? Are you somebody who's really picky about detail?Rebecca: Yes.Todd: Yes.Rebecca: Yes. I'm with paperwork. When something's written, or advertising things like that. At work, yeah, I was always very picky about the grammar or making sure that everything was in same font and lined up squarely so, yeah, but other than that, no.Todd: Well, then, just lastly, are you good at planning? Do you like to plan things?Rebecca: I do. Yeah, I've planned a holiday for my family over Christmas and New Years and that worked out really well, so yeah, I can plan things. Sometimes I plan like the future a bit too much, but yeah. Apart from that.Todd: That's interesting. So in your real life, you're very organized and you plan, but in your student life, you procrastinate.Rebecca: Yeah. Yeah. Completely two different lives I think.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Megen we are talking about Holidays and Christmas and in the last interview we talked the difference between Christmases in a cold country and a warm country, so now I thought we would talk about Christmas in countries that aren't really Christian countries. They don't really celebrate it for religuous reasons. So we're in Japan and it's interesting that in Japan it's a romantic day, right?\nMegen: Yes. Yeah it is.\nTodd: It's like Valentine's Day\nMegen: Yes, you have to spend Christmas with your partner.\nTodd: Right, and everybody looks forward to it - to go out on a date and give each other gifts, and yeah.\nMegen: Yeah, yeah, I think the fireworks are for the boyfriend and girlfriend and I think, and I think there are a lot of decorations that are similar to like Valentine's actually.\nTodd: Yeah, it's interesting because they have the Christmas decoration everywhere, but nobody gets the day off. No families celebrate it really.\nMegen: Yeah, it's a regular day.\nTodd: Except eating the chicken dinner, which we talked about -- the fried chicken dinner. Yeah, so it's kind of like one of those, like I call it a soft holiday. Like in America a soft holiday would be St Patrick's Day. Like everybody has to go to work but you do something that day related to the holiday even though you have no historical connection to it at all.\nMegen: Ah, I see. \nTodd: So for example on St Patrick's Day you drink green beer and you wear green. Like, do you do that in Australia?\nMegen: Ah, that started to become a thing in Australia that the bars do tend to have green beer, and you have green clothing that you might wear and people go out. It's definitely a drinking holiday. Not a holiday though.\nTodd: Right, are there any other holidays that you've absorbed into Australia?\nMegen: Well, people are starting to celebrate Halloween more these days and people take their kids trick or treating.\nTodd: Oh, really?\nMegen: Yeah! Not everyone does it, though I think that some people like to put a sign on their front door to say that trick-or-treaters are welcome, because generally we don't do that kind of thing in Australia, but the departments, the department stores are having more decorations and it's definitely infiltrating from America I think.\nTodd: Oh, that's interesting. So, in America Halloween is a big time to have parties. Do you have parties?\nMegen: I think more and more people are having parties. They have their own party in their house with decorations and costumes, but it's hard to say how many people celebrate Halloween really.\nTodd: Well, what about costumes? Did you wear a costume?\nMegen: I never wore a costume in Australia. I had never celebrated Halloween, but I noticed that some of my friends, and friends with children, they are celebrating it more, and it's becoming just a chance to have a party and dress up.\nTodd: As an English teacher did you dress up here in Japan? \nMegen: Yes, I did actually. Twice.\nTodd: Oh, you did. Did you like it?\nMegen: I did. It was fun to dress up. I dressed up as a character from a Jubilee movie, and it was really good to get together with my friends and to go out. Have you ever dressed up before?\nTodd: Oh, countless times. Countless. Yeah, so as a kid it was a big thing definitely in America.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Tres, lots of people might want to know when is the best time to visit the United States season-wise. What would you recommend to somebody that might go to America? Tres: Definitely the best time is in the fall part of the year: end of August through end of November, beginning of December. The reason why is because the weather is beautiful. You have blue skies almost every day. There’s not too much rain, no tornadoes or hurricanes that come through, and the weather is just generally cool and pleasant. On top of that you have the amazing food that’s associated with the fall months and the holidays also take place then. For example, Halloween, we go door to door trick-or-treating, receive a lot of candy. There’s also Thanks Giving, where many families cook the traditional turkey. Some other families have chop-suey, what have you, and there’s also the tofu-turkey. Todd: Tofu turkey.Tres: Yeah, tofu-turkey.Todd: Have you had tofu-turkey?Tres: I’ve never had a tofu-turkey but I’ve only heard about it. I went to a little arts college where there were only a few meat-eaters. Todd: OhTres: I always heard about it.  Also in the fall it’s a great time to visit the out doors in the United States. You have fall foliage. Especially if you’re in the New England States, where the mountains are just “on fire” with the oranges and yellows.Todd: Yeah, it’s nice. Nice time of year. OK, and any other season you think is a good time to visit? So the fall’s really good. Tres: I think the fall’s great. It also depends on personal preference. If one really likes the summer atmosphere, then of course going to New York or the West Coast in the summer time is great. You can visit the beaches. If you like skiing, of course winter is great, if you go to any of the Rocky Mountain States. Colorado for example, you can really take advantage of the snow out there. Great powder.Todd: Have you traveled much in the United States?Tres: Ever since I was a child, I’d get in the car and travel with my parents. We’d drive from OKlahoma to New York, or down south to the Pacific Northwest. Almost every single state. Maybe five, six states that I haven’t visited.Todd: OK sounds good. Thanks Tres. Tres: Thank you.",

Was it similar in your house?\nBuddhi: Well, dad used to do stuff like that and my brother and I didn't do much work.Todd: You were spoiled.Buddhi: Very, very, very, very .... yeah. Did you ever decide to shift work with your sisters?Todd: No, of course, it never even occured to me. I mean, when you're young, you just do they tell you to do, and to be honest I was very happy. I think I loved doing yardwork. I loved mowing the grass and pruning the trees and, you know, taking about the trash - anything that was physical I enjoyed. I didnt enjoy cleaning. But you never had to do that?Buddhi: Well, I cleaned my own room and my brother cleaned his own, and I mean, it's obvious and it's ... I mean... it's something we really should do, like at home. When we eat, you clean your dish, and maybe we ... when I grew up, I'd wash ... I'll do the dishes, and even if I didn't do my mom wouldn't expect me to do it, and make sure I do it somehow. If it's not done, she'd do it. If I do it, well, she'll be thankful.Todd: So, in your household, who mops the floor?Buddhi: My dad would.Todd: Your dad would. Who washes the windows?Buddhi: My dad, yeah.Todd: Oh, your dad! He's hardworking. OK, who does the laundry?Buddhi: My mom or myself.Todd: Or yourself? Really! OK. What does your brother do?Buddhi: Most of the time, like, he's about eight years older than me, so as soon as he graduated from high school he went abroad for high studies, so when he was doing the usual stuff, I was a kid, so I was not doing anything, so soon after he went I took over or something like that.Todd: Well you did some stuff.Buddhi: I did.

It's because, well we buy it in the supermarket and bring it home cause it's cheaper than eating in a restaurant. \n\t                    Todd: Yeah, it is a lot cheaper.\n                        Yeah\nTodd: OK, what sushi do you eat?\n                        Jessica: Well, we always buy the box, which has a little bit of everything. And I'm never quite sure what any of it is. I know there's a piece of salmon in there. Some octopus, or squid. Um, and then from that point on I'm not quite sure what anything else is, but it's all delicious, so I eat it all, and then we also have rolls, so we buy just different rolls. Actually, last week we tried natto. Have you ever tried that before?\n                        Todd: Yeah, it's gross.\n                        Jessica: It's the most vile, disgusting food you can ever possibly eat, so I definitely don't recommend that but.\n                        Todd: Well, have you had uni?\n                        Jessica: I have not. \n                        Todd: Uni is gross.

Great!\nTodd:  What is your favorite movie?\nJamie: My favorite movie is kind of a heavy movie. It's a called Sophie's Choice with Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline.\nTodd: OK.\nJamie: It's a movie, it's set in World War II. Meryl Streep plays a Polish woman who has come to America and she's met a man, Kevin Kline. Who has a series of problems of his own, mostly psychological which she is not 100 percent aware of and she does a bunch of scenes where she thinks of the past and the very difficult decision she had while during the war living in Poland. She had to decide between two children which one would be murdered by the Nazis and which one wouldn't. It's an ethical delimma that she faced at that time. She made and immediate decision on and it affected her the rest of her life. \nTodd: OK.\nJamie: It's a fantastic movie. Not the story in itself, of course the story was brilliant but the acting, the fact that she speaks Polish, she speaks German, she speaks English with a Polish accent which is amazing. A writer who is actually a narrator to the movie as well, his character is great. Kevin Kline's basically a psycho character. He is a little bit deranged in itself is pretty neat. All in all, the characters, the plot line, the movie it's fanatasic.\nTodd: OK. Great. Sophie's Choice.\nJamie: Sophie's Choice. I think it actually won an academy award in 1985 or '84.\nTodd: OK. Great. Thanks a lot.\nJamie: My pleasure",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Kadi, you are from Estonia. Can you talk about gender roles for the new generation compared to the older generation?\nKadi: Yes, in Estonia, we have this kind of Western type of family, a woman doesn't have to be a housewife. She can work. She can do whatever she likes. Even maybe the tendency right now is that women are becoming more masculine. Often it happens that women make more money than men do and they're the ones who bring the bread in the house. Yeah, compared to Eastern society where usually women are considered as housewives. They just have to clean and cook and raise the kids, and in my country ... no ... there's not such a thing and I think it always has been like that. I'm not quite sure but.\nTodd: Who does the chores like cooking and cleaning?Kadi: Yeah, I think we all do it. We don't have that kind of rule that women only have to clean and cook. Of course in some families, it is like that because women are better cleaning, especially, rather than men are, but yeah, men are quite good cooks.Todd: What do people do for childcare? Like who takes care of the children?Kadi: Nannies. Yeah. We have nannies for working mothers, they usually like hire people to watch over the children and just they play with them and also like kindergarten, like children start going to kindergarten in Estonia when they're really young, maybe from three months I think even, yeah, you can go to work when your child is like half-a-year old. Just go to work. Take a child there, and people are going to care about her.Todd: Is the nanny expected to cook and clean as well?Kadi: It depends of on the contract. It depends on the contract. Yeah, if you hire a person who that you say you're gonna pay him or her, usually her, like for cleaning, cooking, taking care of the children, whatever, it depends on the contract.",

On the East Coast. The best beaches. Does Mexico have any beaches?Diego: Yeah, yeah. We have really, really nice beaches down by the Caribbean Ocean, like in southern Mexico, there's this beautiful place called Cancun and the Ocean is really, really blue, like baby blue, and the sand is white so it looks like snow. It's a really amazing place.Rebecca: Can you surf at the beach?Diego: I'm sure you can surf in some places, yeah.Rebecca: What about snorkeling?Diego: Yeah, definitely. It's the Caribbean Ocean so the water is transpiring so it's amazing.

They knew how to predict the eclipses for the next three hundred years, and they just vanished. They just disappeared. Rebecca: They disappeared?Diego: Yeah! And there's a new movie directed by Mel Gibson, Apocolypto. It's about their civilization.Rebecca: Oh, OK. No, I haven't seen that movie at all. Well, I suppose I could go and compare our beaches. Go to Mexico and check out this place. What was the name of it again?Diego: Cancun.Rebecca: Cancun.Diego: Well, we could do a home exchange.

        "transcript": "Transcription of Audio\nTodd: Hey Jen, we're talking about technology. I'm curious. How many times do you check your email every day?\nJen: Nowadays I check it every day because I have so many emails coming from my company so I have to be updated, but in the past I would not check it for like, I would just check it two or three times a week. How about you?\nTodd: Yes, actually I brought that up because I think this is an interesting generational shift. I don't check Facebook and all that stuff that much, but my generation, we check email multiple times a day for work, like you just said. But the younger generation from what I understand, you guys don't even use email.\nJen: Yeah, like if you asked me the same question two months ago I would say I hardly check my mails because everything, like all the conversation I have, it's all on Facebook or some other social media, not emails. I think that's very old school.\nTodd: Yeah. So you do like text messaging, LINE, WhatsApp?\nJen: Yeah, all of that. \nTodd: All of that. How many accounts do you have actively, that you actively use?\nJen: Wait. Maybe ... I actively use five of them, but I have eight of them, yeah.\nTodd: Wow, you can manage that. The reason I don't do it, I imagine that you just must get a message like every 20 seconds.\nJen: Not every 20 seconds, unless you're dating, but yeah, you get a lot of messages. \nTodd: Really? And that doesn't drive you crazy? That doesn't like bother you?\nJen: I think in the beginning it was like too much, but now we have just gotten like used to it. It's just very normal for us. It's like you checking your mail three times a day, which is crazy for me.\nTodd: Yeah, but still. Here the thing is I don't like the phone. I think we've talked about this before. My generation was the fingers generation, so we used our fingers to type. And the younger generation, you use your thumb. And to me it's really slow and just painstaking to do, to communicate with your thumb on the phone.\nJen: Really? Because for me I think it's faster than typing. \nTodd: I know. Actually I see you guys and it's amazing. I see my students how fast they can use their phone, and it's phenomenal to me. It's like blurry, it's so fast.\nJen: I think if you start using your phone more and not your PC then you would be fast at it too, because even if I were to check my mails I don't do it from my PC, I actually do reply to all my mails from my phone itself.\nTodd: Wow. Actually no, I think it's not true because I've tried. I think it's because I'm older. My phone gets stiff. I mean my phone ... My thumb gets stiff like arthritis or something, like it literally stops moving. That's why I'm amazed.\nJen: Maybe it's just in your head.\nTodd: I physically can't do it. No, no, I really like, and when I type I could type really fast, touch type, but I cannot move my thumb that fast. The more, the longer I try I get thumb fatigue, like my thumb just stops, the joint won't work anymore.\nJen: For me it's very difficult for me to type really fast. I would rather use my thumb and text.\nTodd: No, that's cool. Now these days I don't know if you've realized but you can do voice typing. Have you tried that? Google Docs for example, you don't even have to type anymore. You can just talk in a microphone and with no special software and Google Docs will type what you say.\nJen: But then again you have to be very clear because it always makes a lot of mistakes. \nTodd: Yeah, but you know what's amazing about it, is I had, I was doing it with my students and then I was going to have my student do it and the voice recorder wouldn't take their voice, it would only take my voice. \nJen: I think it's because the ...\nTodd: The user account name?\nJen: Yeah, the user account name can only recognize your voice because that's been saved first. \nTodd: Right, so it saves the first voice, then another one won't work.\nJen: Yeah, I guess. \nTodd: So that brings up the question, technology gets better and better and better. Do you think typing will be obsolete, will be gone in five, 10 years?\nJen: I cannot really say but maybe no, not in 10 years. Maybe 20 to 30 years, yes, but not in 10 years, because I think still people are more comfortable writing their books and stuff like reports, just typing. Everybody doesn't like to talk a lot.\nTodd: True. Yeah, I think there's a different mental process when you type and it's just when you just speak it goes away. \nJen: Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Yuri: So Shirley, you were talking about the shack. Can you tell me some more about it?\nShirley: OK, well, the shack - not as horrible as it might sound. I was actually born in the city, and yeah, grew up on the edge of the city of Glasgow, and my parents ... maybe I was about seven or eight years old ... my parents decided they would buy this little wooden house in the country side, only about forty-five minutes drive from where we lived, but right in the countryside, and it was really basic. It was huge. It looked like a barn, and my parents wanted to try and make it into something livable like a holiday house that we could go to on the weekends and summer holidays and stuff, so anyway we went there ... for the first time we went, it still looked like a barn, and had some beds in it and stuff like that, but no running water, no electricity, no toilet, no bath, no shower. It was like a barn in the middle of nowhere, so as you know, me and my brothers, we are kind of raised in the city, and although, you know we were kids way before video games and iPods and things like that, there was no TV. That was the biggest tragedy. There was no TV, and we though what on earth can we do up here? It's like we're in the middle of nowhere, how boring this summer holiday's gonna be, so we just had to you know, try and figure out how we we're gonna enjoy this holiday and what could we do with no television.\nYuri: Yes, exactly, what did you do? How did you spend you days?Shirley: We were out in the country side. I mean, you just need to go out and look, and there's so many possibilities to have fun: making tree houses, making dens out of the woodland ferns and things like that, going on searches for frogs. We seemed to do that a lot. Poor frogs. We made like a tennis court out in the front of the ... we called it the hut. Right, I keep calling it a barn or a shack, but actually what we called it was a hut, although it was a really huge kind of wooden house, and so yeah, we made up a kind of a tennis court and when it wasn't raining we could play tennis. We had to go collect water from a well near like, I don't know, maybe four hundred meters away, and we'd always have to go in twos because of course there's always an argument with kids. I did it last time. He has to do it this time. So we always had to go in pairs to get the water. For lights we'd just use a gas lamps. For cooking it was a kind of two stove ... two ring stove, connected to a gas bottle. We did have television, which was powered by a car battery, so we would save that until Saturday night, because always on a Saturday night there was a movie, so we would save the car battery power for the Saturday night movie, and it would usually last until the end of the movie.Yuri: So it was a bit like camping.Shirley: Yeah, yeah, I suppose but like camping, only thankfully we didn't get wet when it rained.",

How much would a hotel like that cost?Mini: OK, for that, you can pay around a thousand yen. Around nine hundred rupees.Todd: A thousand yen.Mini: A thousand yen. A thousand, five hundred yen.Todd: Ten dollars.Mini: Mm-hm.

You can pay like fifty rupees and access to the internet. You can do it anytime.Todd: Right. OK. And just lastly, what about meals? How much do meals cost?Mini: If you want to go for a nice buffet, maybe around two thousand yen, a thousand, five hundred rupees around.Todd: Oh, that's actually kind of expensive, isn't it.

        "transcript": "This is a continuation of Kara and Lupe talking about her trip to Mexico to study Spanish. Lupe is giving advice on learning another language.Lupe: So, I've noticed you tend to be a little afraid to speak the language, especially around other people who speak both languages and maybe you're afraid that somebody is gonna correct you, which is actually a good thing, so you have to be able to let yourself speak it in front of other people who can make those corrections for you so the next time you say those things you'll say them correctly or maybe a little better.Kara: And that's exactly what it is. I am much more comfortable to speak Spanish to an only Spanish speaker than I am so somebody who speaks both languages, maybe because I am afraid of that person correcting me or teasing me about the mistakes that I make, so.Lupe: It's also great that you're going down there not only for vacation but you are actually gonna be enrolled in school because it's always good to practice a language but it's great to be able to also sit in a class room studying and learn all the grammar and make sure that you are also reading and writing it and you understand it that way also. It's really important.Kara: And I'll be living with a family so I get lot of practice at the house also.Lupe: Yeah, that will definitely help you out and I am sure that, you know, after you come back, maybe you'll feel a little more comfortable since you were in a different country where that is basically all that you are speaking. Kara: That's very true. But I've always noticed my favorite people to practice with are little kids. Their Spanish, or in any language, is so simple that it's fun to talk to them, just like with English. When you're learning English, a two-year old or a three-year old, you can talk to them, and they don't notice your mistakes but they'll understand exactly what you're saying, so...Lupe: Well, you can always come over and practice with my little cousins or my little nephew and nieces.Kara: Thanks.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Eoin, I was hoping that you could introduce yourself and talk a little bit about your band. Eoin: Sure. My name's Eoin. I work and live in Beppu in Oita in Japan and I play in a band called Nanbanjin. I play base guitar. The band... there's three of us in the band - a vocalist and guitarist, myself, and a drummer.Todd: That's it. Three guys.Eoin: Three guys. Yeah.Todd: So, one guy sings and also plays guitar?Eoin: That's right. Todd: And then you play the base guitar?Eoin: Mh-hm. Todd: And then the drummer?Eoin: That's right.Todd: Are you guys all from England, like yourself?Eoin: No. I am the only person from England. The singer and guitarist is from Wales, a small country which is next to England, and the drummer is from Japan.Todd: That's a pretty mixed group.Eoin: Yeah.Todd: So, how did you guys all come together?Eoin: That's a really long story but I actually originally met the singer and vocalist, who's called Dai. I met him in Oita. We were both teaching English nearby and we got together and did some music stuff together and previously we had a different drummer, a New Zealander who was also doing the same English teaching job in Oita. He went back to New Zealand and after that we enlisted the help of Manabu, the current drummer we have now.Todd: That's pretty interesting that just three English teachers from different countries in a pretty small city in Japan... you guys just get together and...Eoin: Yeah. It was... Well, I had know Dai for quite awhile before we actually started playing and I played in another band but it wasn't really my type of music and Dye I knew could sing quite well and was into similarish music to me so we got together and tried a few things out and then it just happened, this other guy, who was playing the drums, the New Zealander, was available to help us out and it all started from there.Todd: And then, what's the name of the band?Eoin: NambanjinTodd: NanbanjinEoin: That's right.Todd: OK, can you explain the name?Eoin: Yeah. Nanbanjin was what Japanese people called some of the first Portuguese people to ever come to Japan. It means... if you translate it literally... it means barbarians from the south. Savages from the south, because presumably they thought the Portuguese were pretty savage. We're not Portuguese but we are foreigners and I thought it was quite an appropriate name for a rock band.Todd: And so it stuck, huh?Eoin: Yeah.Todd: Just Nanbanjin.Eoin: That's right.Todd: So you guys thought boom.. you thought of the name and that's it, or did you have many names and you weren't sure which one to choose?Eoin: No, there was just... at that time there was a movie called The Last Samurai. Have you seen that?Todd: Yes. With Tom Cruise.Eoin: Yeah. With Tom Cruise. And there's a reference to Nanbanjin in that movie, which is the first time I had actually heard of it and so we just thought, it just seemed like a good name so we used it. That was it. There was no real other option.Todd: Well, it's a cool name.",

I'm a civil engineer.\nTodd: So, actually what does a civil engineer do?\nVictor: In America, a civil engineer designs things.

Yes, she's my sister. I'm a good sister.\nTodd: That's very nice.

That's care and devotion.\nSanti: Well, I said before I'm a good sister.\nTodd: Wow. I guess so. Now when you first went to university, did you think your sister would join you - would go to the same university?\nSanti: No. I don't think so because, well, she's very good at chemistry and she's also good at science, so I'm hoping that she will go a different directions than me, but, well, I don't know, maybe my mother trusts me, and then my mother led her to me.\nTodd: What about similarities and differences? How would you say you and your sister are similar?\nSanti: My voice and her voice. It's totally the same.\nTodd: Really?\nSanti: Yes.\nTodd: So if your sister was here doing audio work, I wouldn't be able to tell who was who.\nSanti: Yes. It's true.\nTodd: Wow.\nSanti: Sometimes we like to play with people on the phone. It's kind of like bad but whenever her friends call, I will pretend that I was her.\nTodd: Really.\nSanti: And vice-versa.\nTodd: That is a funny joke. So what is something that's different? Like how are you different? Obviously she's good in science.\nSanti: Yeah, and, well, the appearance is different. She has darker skin, and then she's very slim.\nTodd: You are very slim, too.\nSanti: Thank you.\nTodd: Are you the same height?\nSanti: No. I'm taller. \nTodd: OK. So you really are the big sister.\nSanti: Yes, that's true.\nTodd: You look down on her.\nSanti: Yes. Sometimes.\nTodd: So do you guys fight very much, or do you usually get along?\nSanti: Uh, during my childhood - yes - but now - no - we just ... well, we know the limits. We know that we are ready beginning to be adults, so I don't think that fight is kind of like popular anymore.\nTodd: Right, so you guys are like two peas in a pod.\nSanti: Yes.",

Do you do the type to calm yourself for meditation? Jeff: Yeah, there is many types of yoga but I'm not such a smart guy so I don't get into all that Hatha Yoga, and Kundalini Yoga and all that stuff. I just do..... sort of what I do is just stretching, but I did learn yoga in India from a Indian yogi, or guru, or whatever you call them, but it's just sort of like stretching, just slow controlled stretching and it's good to have a quiet space and you do it on an empty stomach, and then you just concentrate on nothing or concentrate on your breath and it's very good for your body and your mind.Todd: So, when you do yoga, you're saying breathing is very important.Jeff: Yes, that's... to clear your head as well so that you don't have all these ideas and images going through your head: what you have to do in work that day or all your chores or things like that, what was on TV the night before. You concentrate on your breathing. You breath slowly and you focus on your breathing and it's really good because it clears your mind. It clears everything out of your mind.Todd: Now, even though when you do the stretching, you improve your flexibility, do you think that yoga makes you stronger?Jeff: Yoga does make you stronger, much stronger because when you're stretching, you're stretching the muscles and you're almost tearing the muscles and then they grow together again stronger, and yeah, you're building muscle but lean muscle. You're not big and bulky. You're lean and fit.Todd: So when you do the stretching, and you say you're tearing down the muscles, should you feel pain? Does it feel painful?Jeff: No, you don't have to feel pain. If you want to do heavy, strong yoga, heavy stretching, then yeah, it can be painful but you just do it the way you like. If you start to feel a little bit of pain, you just pull back a little. So no, it doesn't have to be painful. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. If you do it every couple of days, then you will get stronger and you don't have to feel any pain.Todd: OK, sounds great.Jeff: You should try it.Todd: Actually, I should.",

It was a great year for me I have to say. I feel like I've grown so much as a person. I've done so many things this year that made me become I feel a much more responsible person, a more mature man. I've been working quite a bit at the school, but I've also been doing a few things outside of school, such as working with children as well. I've been working in a camp where we teach kids for twelve days English. Well, actually we don't really teach them. What we do is we spend twelve days with them and during those twelve days, the children that don't speak English come to this camp and have to only speak English for twelve days and we do all kinds of different activities with them. Sabriya: So how do you teach the children without communicating with them?Fred: That's the beauty of it. I understand that English is really important, but however we have this saying during the camp that our hearts speak as one and so we understand each other without using so many words, but of course the children have some basis in English and so we can understand each other.Sabriya: OK, that's very beautiful. Going back to the topic we were discussing right now, tell me what was the best thing that happened to you this year?Fred: The best thing that happened to me this year? I have to say that the best thing that happened to me this year was when I went back to Canada, I had the opportunity of spending lots of time with my grandmother, and you see, when I was growing up as a child she practically raised me, and so I have a special relationship with her. I do love everybody from my family, but my relationship with my grandmother is really great and spending two months with her was great for me.Sabriya: Well, I can relate to that too since my grandmother raised me as well, so I hope you have another great year next year.Fred: Thank you very much.",

I've experienced a lot.Fred: You've experienced a lot. What have you experienced?Sabriya: I've tried new things. Things that I have not done before. I've tried different jobs.Fred: What kind of jobs have you tried?Sabriya: I've tried working with children, actually, this year and it's been amazing. It's just been the best experience ever.Fred: What was it exactly that you did when you were working with children?Sabriya: Basically, it was in a... it's not a rehabilitation center, but it was a center for disabled children, and basically what we do is we spend the day with them and attend classes with them and just play with them, talk to them, interact with them during the day.Fred: Wow, that's really great. So you did some voluntary activities.Sabriya: Yes. Yes. I did for the first time.Fred: Wow, that's really cool.Sabriya: It was quite an experience because I was quite scared at first. I wasn't to sure how to treat them. I wasn't to sure what exactly I should do, but the instructors were very nice and they explained that, you know, you just have to be yourself and treat them like any other children, and that's how they want to be treated - just like normal children, and that's what I tried my best to do.Fred: Wow, so you must have learned so much, and you became a more responsible, mature adult.Sabriya: Yes, it did. It changed me in that terms because I become more patient than before. Before, I mean, I used to be quite stubborn and I used to irrationally make decisions, but after this I calmed down and I always questioned myself before doing something, so I think in that way I completely changed.Fred: Could you say that what you've learned through your experiences of working with children has also helped you in other parts of your life?Sabriya: I think the whole getting a patient side has helped me in many terms because it's made me think for example, when I want study or when I want to take classes, I always ask myself, should I do this? Should I do that? Should I go here? So, I don't think like that, so it's just a matter of thinking ten times before I decide anything.Fred: OK, well you know I feel that I can learn a lot from you and maybe I should do the same thing to become a more responsible person, too.Sabriya: You should. I'd advise you to. Working with disabled children is nothing like anything else. It's amazing. You should. You should.",

(OK) I didn't vote for him in the last two elections. He, in my opinion, is too conservative. I'm from a part of America, San Francisco, we're a lot liberal in our thinking, and I think Bush lost my city 85 to 15 (%), so I'm not a big fan of President Bush. I believe in democracy, and I believe in the system, but it's not easy when the person who gets in office is not the person you want to be there. It's very frustrating.\nNitiya: OK, OK, what I actually meant to ask is, the Iraq war, and things like that, Iraq war not only affected Iraq, it affected a lot of those military army people of America (right) their wives and children back home. They don't know if their father is going to come back or not (right) I mean not only affected total Iraq it was a very bad affect on America, too. I mean people, who ever loved America, there are so many people now who have a so bad image of America because of one, this, and I consider it a very, very insensitive action of Bush, so what do you think about that?\nTodd: Well, I pretty much agree with everything you said. It's tough. I mean, I don't, obviously you don't, I wasn't for having Saddam Hussein remain in power, or, but it bothers me that my country is doing actions where children can die, or babies can die, or even soldiers can die.\nNitiya: I mean Saddam Hussein is in power or not, why is Bush interfering in that? He can mind his own business, right? I mean, I just feel sometimes, when Bush sleeps in the night, doesn't he feel some sensitivity or guilty to even one person that, when you see that those bombs, those small kids dying, and you know, whole bloodshed, how can even he sleep, with peace. I just sometimes wonder.\nTodd: No, and actually that's one, that's one criticism that he, that people even have in America, a lot of people in America have of him is that he, does he know, does he really feel the pain that people are dying, children are dying, and yeah, it's a tragic situation, and...\nNitiya: And I think, there is one thing, I really feel that, there is always two parts of this whole story, I mean, we are seeing it with our civilian eyes, but the truth, none of us know. It's all politics. I mean, Saddam knows and Bush knows and we know nothing, it's like that\nTodd: Well, I agree 100% with that.",

        "transcript": "Tu: So, Amir, I heard ... I was really surprised to hear that Iran traffic is so bad.\nAmir: Iran, yeah, Iran is actually very much famous for it's traffic. Traffic is so horrible. People have to just wait in cars for ages just to get to their places which is just by walking maybe forty minutes, thirty minutes far from the place you are.\nTu: So there are a lot of traffic jams?Amir: Yeah, yeah. The capacitiy of the streets and the amount of car just doesn't match, so people have to wait for many hours.Tu: Well, actually, you know what, Vietnamese traffic is also very terrible.Amir: Oh, OK, now you tell me about Vietnam?Tu: Yeah, especially Ho Chi Min City. I still remember it was so scary for me, for the first time I go to Ho Chi Min City. Well, you know, everyone seems to be moving, and we travel mostly by bikes, so you know, there are a lot of bikes on the streets and it seems like you get to move with them. If you stop, you're gonna get hit.Amir: Oh, so you just have to flow with them.Tu: Yes, and there seems to be no rules at all. Like, actually they used to be a lot people who just goes when it is red light, and it's pretty common. It was. It's getting better now but still, you I think it's because there are a lot of bikes. Too many of them.Amir: OK, I am sure there are reasons for this traffic, but before that, before telling me why this is happening in your city, tell me, how you get used to it? How do you overcome this craziness, this anarchy you talk about?Tu: Yeah, actually, you know, foreigners complain about it a lot, all the time, but we actually, we Vietnamese people, we actually not ... we don't think it's a matter. It's kind of a natural thing for us, to just get out of your house and go with the flow and it's just ... it is something normal, like every day life, and I think it's because we get to go by bicycle and motorbike pretty soon, pretty early, since we were primary school, and you know, one thing is, the bicycle in Vietnam ... we go on the same road with the cars and bikes, so everyone moves at the same time.",

What makes it so infamous for having food that are very, very so called \"unhealthy\"?\nClare: Well, in America we were the country that invented the fast food chain, I think. There are very many famous fast food chains that got their start in America and they became popular because Americans were working very long hours in the cities and in small towns and it was a lot easier, it was very new, to have a convenient meal ready for you. Well unfortunately these meals were not prepared in a way that was healthy. There was very little veggies, I mean french fries are fried potatoes, burgers are fried, so the way they're cooked it ... they're made quickly but they're not made in a way that's healthy, there's no boiling or steaming so ... because these chains had a very good product being offered in one respect, that they were fast and easy and convenient to get to, while on the down side they were very fattening, people sort of just chose what was convenient I think, and there are so many of them because they really are popular. It's sort of a cycle where even though people know it's bad they choose it because it's convenient and because it gets so much business more chains open in a city or along roads because Americans have ... travel very long distances for commuting to get almost anywhere. For example, where I live in Texas, along the road very small towns separated by miles and miles of desert, every small town where highways come together have at least one burger joint or ice cream place that serves burgers and fries and so it's a little bit of, I wouldn't call it American culture, its just sort of what we got used to.",

Anna is the creator and founder of HomeworX – spelled with an 'x' we should note – an app which helps teenagers with their homework. Thanks for coming in, Anna.\n\nAnna: Thanks for having me.\n\nPresenter: So, tell us about your app. How does it work?\n\nAnna: Well, teenagers and their parents have numerous challenges when it comes to homework these days. In many families both parents work and don't have much available time to help their kids with their homework. And even if they do have time to help, they may not be able to offer support with the content. What I mean is, they may not know, or at least remember, enough in any given subject to support.\n\nPresenter: You mean they might not be able to remember complex maths or might have never studied certain subjects, such as biology or economics, themselves?\n\nAnna: Exactly. So they might want to support their children with their homework, but have neither the time nor the knowledge to do so.\n\nPresenter: I see. So the app helps solve this problem?\n\nAnna: Yes, and more. The next issue is that tutors can be expensive, and there may be long waiting lists for specialist tutors in the town or region you live in. Our HomeworX app brings students and tutors together online. Students can search a database of pre-approved tutors and sign up for live online support. They don't need to be in the same town or city.\n\nPresenter: That sounds really great.\n\nAnna: It is. And this approach also enables us to offer the tutoring services at lower prices because there's no travelling time involved for the tutor to get to the student's home. And tutors who live in remote areas are happy to get access to more students, and be able to work from home, even at lower rates.\n\nPresenter: This all sounds great. So, how did you come up with the idea?\n\nAnna: Well, as you might guess, I was one of those parents I described earlier. I really wanted to help my son with his homework, but I was either too busy with work or I didn't actually know anything about the subjects he was having difficulty with. Also, we live in an area where there aren't many tutors and the ones that are there are either very expensive or have long waiting lists.\n\nPresenter: Yes. I can understand your predicament. Well, it sounds like a very useful app that is clearly meeting a need. And its popularity obviously speaks for itself.\n\nAnna: Thank you.\n\nPresenter: So, do you have plans for the future?\n\nAnna: We've just secured some funding and hope to expand the range of services we offer using the app.\n\nPresenter: We wish you the best of luck. Thanks again for coming in. That was Anna Oliveira, founder of the tutoring app HomeworX (with an 'x', don't forget!), which is available for both Apple and Android devices. Join us again next week for another business interview. Have a great week, everyone.",

Are you going to watch the Olympics on TV?\n\t\t\t            Travis: I will probably get suckered into watching the olympics I'm sure. It will be on every channel. It will only be on one channel but it will be on the whole day I'm sure. \n\t\t\t            Todd: Yeah, they kind of go overboard. It's on too much. \n\t\t                Travis: Well, I think it was the last winter Olympics, where, I don't know which channel in the Unites States was covering it but whatever channel was covering it most of the olympics was just people's background and personal stories and profiles and a lot of America got really fed up with it, and I don't know if you were still here in Japan or if you were in the Unites States at the time of the last olympics, but \n\t\t\t\t                people didn't watch he last olympics in the states. They just tuned out completely. The reason that they tuned out is because the coverage was so poor. The station that was covering it was basically just doing profile after profile of athletes, about how they had to overcome hardship, how they had to eat one meal every two weeks , and you know run five hundred miles back and forth, you know, some school in Russia and those sort of profiles, stories drown out the actual events, and it was covered very poorly, but maybe this year will be different, maybe there will be a backlash against that sort of poor coverage, and we'll get to see more of the actual olympics this time. This is the summer olympics right. (Yeah, exactly) It shows how little I know about the olympics. I'm not sure if it's the winter of the summer. \n\t\t                Todd: Well, of the Olympics, what's your favorite event? \n\t                    Travis: Running. \n\t                    Todd: Running\n                        Travis: Just straight running. It seems like a very pure athletic event. There's no guess work in it. There's not five judge panel trying to decide who won, and then the Canadian judge and the France judge get in a fight and they have to decide. Nothing like that happens. It's just run, clock, stop and whoever got through the finish line the fastest wins. It seems very pure athleticism, so I like running: 100 meter dash,\n\t\t\t\t                        200 meter dash, all of that, and long runs too. I used to run when I was in high school so that helps a little bit. Not short distances. I used to run cross country, three and five miles. \n                        Todd: Ooh, that's a long ways. Are you still a runner?\n                        Travis: Well I went running tonight but I don't consider myself to be much of a runner. No, I only say that some day I am going to train and run a marathon but I have yet to train and run a marathon. Maybe someday. Yeah, I did it when I was in Bangkok and it about killed me. Yeah, running in Bangkok, running a marathon in Bangkok was not the smartest thing. It was terrible because they had, they have pollution right, Bangkok's a great city but they have a lot of pollution right. They have to have marathon at 4 o'clock in the morning before the cars start running, and then when you're running the marathon some of the policeman that are officiating have to wear like masks because of the pollution in the air, so when you're running a marathon through that it's not that fun. But anyway, you should do it. You should run a marathon. \n\t\t\t\t                            I think maybe I will but perhaps after I finish school this year.",

There’s one house immediately next door to mine and it has a crazy barking dog but luckily I like dogs and the dog likes me so when she sees me she gets really hyper now and welcomes me home.Todd: That’s a nice feeling, it’s got to be nice having a dog welcoming you home! So how big is your house?Eucharia: Well it’s like a small bungalow. It’s one storey. When you go in the door there is a japanese style porch for taking off your shoes. Then you are in a hallway and there’s an extremely large kitchen which goes from one side of the house to the other on the right hand side.Todd: Wow that’s cool! So does it have an oven? Can you bake?Eucharia: I don’t have an oven yet. I have everything else but I enjoy cooking. One part of my very, very chequered past I worked as a chef so I really enjoy cooking. I’m not very good but, yeah, it relaxes me after a hard day at work and I let my stress loose on the onions. Chop chop chop chop. And then there’s a living room and there’s what I euphemistically call a work area. It’s where I have a computer, my computer and some books and research stuff. And then there’s my… It’s all Japanese style flooring except for the kitchen, so its all bamboo flooring so it smells really nice because it’s all really fresh and it smells like hay to me.Todd: Sounds like a barn!Eucharia: I know it’s bamboo. It’s like sleeping in a barn!Todd: How many bathrooms do you have?Eucharia: Oh just one but that’s completely normal in Japan. It’s a Japanese style homeTodd: So do you have the bath-shower thing? Or just a shower? Just a bath?Eucharia: I have a bath and shower but - I really like this about Japan that - the toilet room and the bathroom, shower room are 2 seperate rooms in most places. There’s also a washing machine room, a pantry thing. Todd: You have a washing machine?Eucharia: Yeah I can’t live without a washing machine! I need to buy a new bigger fridge because my fridge is too small and because it’s in the country I cant do shopping as often and by the time I get out of work most… many of the shops around here are closed.Todd: Well congratulations on your new house!Eucharia: Thank you!",

Very cool.\nTodd: What do you recommend I do?\nJessica: OK. Well, I lived in Madrid so I'm a little bit partial to that city. It's a really, really, nice time.., when are you going? \nTodd: I should get there mid August. \nJessica: OK, then stay away from Madrid because it's too hot. It's about like 40, 45 degrees Celsius so it's really, really hot. So, the south is really extremely warm as well but the north and the east coast is really nice, cause they have a lot of really nice beaches and Barcelona is really beautiful. It's a really great place. They have this cathedral there by Gaudi which is incredible, it's incredible. Ah, Valencia is really cool. It's a very nice place to go. They have a really nice beach. A really nice downtown city. The southern coast is really nice. They.. but it's incredibly hot like I said so.. so you definitely have to take advantage of the siesta and sleep through the majority of the day and then stay up late at night, so you wouldn't burn outside basically, so sleep away the warmest part of the day but..\nTodd: OK, now if I can go to one country around Spain - Morocco, Portugal or France, which one would you recommend?\nJessica:  I would say that Morocco is definitely the most different. It's definitely the most unique. Portugal is very similar to Spain and France is of course France. Personally, I would probably go to France but if you want something very exotic and different, Morocco is definitely, definitely the place to go. \nTodd: OK, thanks Jessica.\nJessica: Thank you.",

And the manager wouldn’t hire me because I was under legal working age in the States. \nAdam: How old are you when you first started working? \nSarah: I started working when I was 14. I’m from North Carolina in the States. And there, you are legally able to work at the age of 14. So I worked as a DJ. My father owns a radio station, so I became a DJ at age 14. \nAdam: That’s amazing. What sort of things did you talk about as a DJ?\nSarah: It was mainly a programming situation, an AM radio station. So I don’t have to talk much. It was mainly just operating the board. And a few commercials, and weather and things like that I would have to talk. But mostly, it was just pressing buttons. \nAdam: Did you play any music? \nSarah: Yeah. Some music, depending on the time of day. \nAdam: Could you play what you wanted or did you have to follow a script? \nSarah: No, you have a follow a format pretty much, so. So what’s been the most interesting or exciting job you’ve ever had? \nAdam: I worked at an airport fueling airplanes when I was in college. And I drove a fuel truck around the tarmac and fueled airplanes, big commercial airplanes like 747s and also small private prop planes just with two passengers. That was a really interesting, interesting job. \nSarah: It sounds kind of slightly dangerous or maybe a lot of responsibility. Was it? \nAdam: Yeah. If you – because you’re driving this large truck around very, very expensive planes, so a lot of responsibility. It wasn’t so much dangerous, I don’t think. But yeah, it was definitely – if you made an error or had an accident, it would be a big accident. \nIt was – the hours were not very good. I had to wake up at 4:00 in the morning to go to the airport at 5:00. And when I went home I would smell just of gasoline. But it was quite an interesting and kind of exciting job. \nSarah: Nice. \nAdam: Yeah. How about you? What’s your most interesting job? \nSarah: Most interesting, I guess, for me was I was hired by a car company one time to go and do like test drive demonstrations on like different cities around the US. And I had to, like, ride around with people doing the test drive and tell them about the vehicles, which was interesting because I really know nothing about cars. So I had to memorize a lot of information. But it was fun getting to go to different cities in the US every weekend. \nAdam: Wow, cool. What car company did you do this for? \nSarah: I did that for Kia but I’ve also worked for Hummer, and Ferrari and BMW. \nAdam: Wow. That’s amazing. Were those separate contracts for Ferrari, Hummer and BMW? \nSarah: Yeah. For those, I didn’t do test drives. I was, what's called a promotional model or a brand ambassador. So the companies hire local people when they're an event in a certain area. And most of the time, you’re just getting people to fill out surveys or do some kind of prize drawing. But in the case of Kia, it was actually doing test drives. \nAdam: Did you get any free merchandise or vehicles from any of these? \nSarah: I wish I got a free vehicle, but no, just the t-shirt or whatever outfit you had to wear for the promotion. \nAdam: Yeah, that’s sounds really interesting. I love cars, so I’d love to do something like that.",

So I'd been to an emergency...\nJulia: You looked pretty then?Nathan: Yeah, I'd been to an emergency dentist session to have a new cap stuck on but I was really worried that (a) I couldn't speak properly because my mouth was still a bit getting used to the shape of the tooth and I was worried that the tooth was going to fall off but also I'm not very good in front of large groups of people and I had to, I had to do some speeches and I hadn't really...Julia: You made a speech?Nathan: Yeah, I didn't really memorize the speeches properly and so I really struggled with the speeches but I think the other thing was that I couldn't relax because everybody was taking photos and every time I wanted to have a drink of beer or have a mouthful of food, someone was like just one more photo, just one more photo and so I kept on saying to people like I'm really tired, you know, I'd really like to eat my food and everybody kept on coming up and taking photos and I actually got a bit frustrated and a bit...Julia: You were grumpy on your wedding day?Nathan: Well, I get grumpy everywhere. We had three parties so the first party was...Julia: Three parties?Nathan: Yeah, we had the wedding ceremony and then we had the meal and then we had like a second party where we did some games and then we had a third party at a karaoke booth which was fantastic.Julia: Right and were you still in your wedding gear for all those parties?Nathan: Yeah. Actually I said to you some time before that my wife had two wedding dresses but by the time we went to karaoke she was on her third wedding dress.Julia: Oh, wow.Nathan: So she had a pretty good time getting changed.Julia: It was a huge event then?Nathan: It was.Julia: How long did it take to plan this wedding?Nathan: I think it took only two months. My wife's pretty organized so she's like this is going to happen, this is going to happen, boom, boom, boom.Julia: So she made most of the important stressful decisions?Nathan: Oh yeah. The planning was easy for me. I just said yes to everything.Julia: And did you go on a honeymoon?Nathan: That's a major bone of contention. That's, I've never been forgiven for this because we, I guess we really didn't have a huge amount of money and afterwards my wife wanted to take...Julia: You spent a lot on the wedding.Nathan: Yeah, she wanted to have a really romantic honeymoon in the Maldives and I'd actually put the idea of the Maldives into her head when I was drinking one time and afterwards, we didn't do anything after the wedding because we'd been really busy during the wedding getting friends and family to fly in.Julia: You needed a break?Nathan: Yeah, but then about a month later we went to Thailand and then we went to Singapore and we did lots of small trips in Malaysia and different things but they weren't really romantic and so my wife is still waiting for her romantic honeymoon.Julia: You went travelling, well that's nice.Nathan: Yeah, well.",

What can you cook?\n\t                    Hisa: I can cook most of the Japanese dishes. And I also like baking.\n\t                    Todd: Oh, really. OK. Since you're Japanese can you tell us what things you cook in Japanese cuisine.\n                        Hisa: OK. I use a lot of vegetables in my cuisine, in cookery, and then I prepare lots of Japanese type of salad, which is sometimes we call it suno-mono.\n                        Todd: Suna-mono. OK\n                        Hisa: Yes, with vinegar w hich is especially good for spring? And the summer time, and then also pickles, is one type of thing and then I use vegetables, even cooked kind of salad I use, that is, we call it O-shi-tashi, green leaves, throughout the year, I use a different kind of green vegetables for salad.\n                        Todd: Can you talk about one kind of salad that you can make? (Yes) And how do you make it?\n                        Hisa: OK. For example, this is spring, I tell you one kind of salad, Udo.\n                        Todd: Udo.\n                        Hisa: That is a white stick, kind of vegetable. Just you peel them very thick because outside is quite bitter, so inside you slice up and then put them in the water with vinegar because that is how you can keep this white color. It lasts long, yes, and then, usually I put some wakame, sea vegetables, and then two ingredients I use, and then add some ginger, which I love very much. Chop up some ginger, and then those three things I mix with vinegar, a little bit soy sauce and then salt and then just sometimes you can even marinate if you like.\n                        Todd: Wow, sounds good.\n                        Hisa: Very light.\n                        Todd: And I can buy these ingredients at the Japanese supermarket?\n                        Hisa: Yes, green grocer's, and it is only for spring time. Udo! Sounds like Udon. Just you remove \"n\"\n                        Todd: Udo. Good luck.\n                        Hisa: Alright, I'll try and make it.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Norm, you said you have a pretty good story about going hiking and you almost got dehydrated.\n\t\t\t            Norm: Yes, it was, we were on our first day of, it was a six day hiking trip in a national park in Quebec, Canada, and I had not done the itinerary, but my friend had figured out that the first day we could walk 19 1/2 kilometers in the wilderness. \n\t\t\t            I mentioned that, I would have gone for 10 kilometers, do the first stop at the first campsite, but I didn't realize that he was more optimistic than I was, and so we started out on our first day and very heavy backpack, about 24 kilograms, and very hot day, 30, 32 degrees with hot humid day, and the first day was up and down, up and down, all the time, so at the end of the day, mistake number 1 was we passed sort of a small river and we didn't refill our bottles because we thought we were almost at our destination, the lake, but it was further than we thought so we ran out of water and darkness set upon us and we were up on a huge rock, and what had happened was, we were at the lookout and because we were tired, we were supposed to go left. We went right, so we backtracked, and I, after about five minutes, I mentioned to my other three colleagues I said, we've been here before, I said we're backtracking.                         \n\t\t\t            All three of then said, how can you tell, I said, I remember these particular trees. I said I noticed them all, and they \"There are thousands of trees here. You must be mistaken. I said well I'm sure. So they say \"No, no. no. It can't be. We're going in the right direction and so we back tracked, and by this time we never got to our camp ground and so we had to stop and we had no water. We hadn't had any water for about two hours, three hours, and so they were kinda, didn't know what to do, but I saw that there was a swamp at the bottom, and I said, \"there's water!\" Well!, so two of our colleagues stayed up with the tents and I went went down with a friend of mine and it took up an hour just to go down to the swamp, because it was not a path, just there we boulders and big rocks, and we had to go around many obstacles, and then by the time we got to the swamp, it was really dark, so I tied the bottle to a rope and I just threw it in the middle of the swamp to try and get as least dirt as possible and then use my shirt to filter it into a pot we had brought with us, to the swamp a pot and a heater, so that we could boil the water. We would ... we were very dehydrated, if we hadn't drank at that time, we wouldn't have been able to go back up, so I said we need to replenish our bodies with water, then we'll come back up.                         \n\t\t\t            So by this time is was pitch dark and my friend had this little hand flashlight that is, didn't last 45 minutes, but luckily I had my headlamp and I had just replaced my batteries and that can work 24 hours non stop so we used my single head lamp to go back up but it took up two hours to get back up so we had gone down about 8:30. We left the camp and it was close to midnight by the time we got up. Yeah, total darkness, and because we were on, just on, we could set up tent was a rock, that was like a round, rounded rock, and they set up their big tent, but I couldn't sleep in the tent, because it was just no room, so I just put my sleeping bag on the rock and just slept the whole evening. Luckily for me it didn't rain and and I managed to spend, had a fairly good night sleep.                         \n\t\t\t            So then the next day you just hiked back to your home? No the next day we had, I had brought some re-hydrating salts and that night when we came back with all the water I told everyone that we should put this in the water and then the next morning we felt much better, but then, this time we had light, proper light, sunlight and we looked at the topological map and then we figured out that where we had gone wrong. We were just barely forty minutes away from where we should have been before we made the wrong turn. We were actually very close, but when we backtracked that was our mistake, so 45 minutes later we were at the next lake where there were facilities for setting up our tents, and we were so exhausted that we spent the whole day sleeping before continuing on our trip.",

        "transcript": "Buddhi: Can you tell me about general roles in America? Is it that women do cooking or the men help out or how is it done?\nTodd: I think it's changed a lot over the years. It's similar to what you said in your country. America's probably maybe one of the leading countries in trying to make it more equal, so yeah, so now it's ... the men are supposed to help cook and clean and stuff. But actually what I find interesting is that over time I think people still settle into their old habits. I think that young couples start off that the husbands gonna cook and he's gonna help clean but as they get older naturally it does seem like women revert to more caretaking roles and men kind of get lazy I think. You know. Although, I have to say, growing up my step-father was pretty amazing. He was really good at cooking and he cooked a lot and he actually used to get home before my mother. She also worked. So he would do the most of the cooking, and he was actually the better cook, but my mom's a good cook too.\nBuddhi: So looking at him, did you ever want to learn cooking and did you ever think like, \"OK, when I grow up I'll always help whoever was around.\"Todd: No, it was actually .... I'm quite ashamed. I never did really learn cooking from him or my mother, so they never really showed me, so even to this day I'm a pretty terrible cook. So what about you? Did your mother show you how to cook?Buddhi: She did, it's just that I didn't learn and my brother ended up learning all the cooking and he's a very good cook right now, and it makes me be very ashamed of myself, but ...Todd: So wait a minute. Wait a minute. Your mom actually took the time to show you how to cook, and you say you still can't cook?Buddhi: Yes!!!!Todd: Why? What happened?Buddhi: I don't know. I don't know. Sri Lankan cooking is so difficult and it takes ... it's really time consuming, but I wouldn't want to say that out too loud cause there are some like many good cooks as well, it's just that I'm not good at it, but .... I mean, I'm not that that bad. It's just that my food don't turn out to be as good as my mom's.Todd: Right.",

What do you have to prepare?Lindsay: Well, I hired the band.Chris: Already?Lindsay: Yes. They're a funk band.Chris: Brilliant.Lindsay: They play the Beatles and Earth, Wind & Fire.Chris: Together?Lindsay: Maybe not together, but I've hired a band and they're great and I've also hired the florist, and I've hired the caterer so we have the food and everything sorted and I have picked the location.Chris: Well, how long did it take you to decide all that? It seems like you've done a lot of preparation already.Lindsay: It took me about two months to get everything done. I saw about five different bands and six different florists and I looked at about seven different places.Chris: Did the bands actually come to your house? Kind of set up in your living room and play or what?Lindsay: No, I would look at the video. Each band had a video, so I previewed by looking at their video, but it was important for me to have a band that was very lively and that had an MC, so someone could be in charge of the wedding to say the announcements.Chris: OK. Well, that sounds good. Lindsay: Yeah.Chris: And so, are you doing all the preparation or is your fiance helping out?Lindsay: He's pretty much doing nothing so I'm doing everything, so the thing last that we really need to figure out is the guest list and then what will the ceremony be like.Chris: OK. So I suppose he's paying for everything, right? That's his job?Lindsay: No, actually, I'm very fortunate in the fact that my parents are paying for most of it, and my finance's parents are paying for some of it as well, so... and I think we're going to have about a hundred people so it should be maybe kind of expensive, but...Chris: Oh, that's pretty big.Lindsay: Yeah, but I'm gonna get a lot of presents so I'm very excited.",

They don't really like the gift so much because it doesn't suit them, or something? \nTodd: Yeah. \nJen: For example, I bought this pair of earrings for this friend, and then I realized that she doesn't really like jewelries and stuff, so she never wore it.\nTodd: Right, yeah. It's kind of hard to know what they want. Actually, for that reason, I don't like giving gifts at all. I think it's because of my background, like studying economics. It's just, to me, it's inefficient. You're buying something, you don't know if they really want it, and they say, \"Oh. It's the thought that counts.\" But the time that you waste finding the gift and then you give them the gift, and maybe they don't use it. So I'm not a big fan of gift giving. Even for birthdays.\nJen: I actually agree with you. And for me, if it was my birthday, I would rather have someone make a card for me. It would have more value than someone buying gifts for me anyways, you know?\nTodd: Yeah. I think, like in Asia, it's more common, which I like. And that's kind of the gift you give to somebody when you travel. So if I travel somewhere, I'll pick something up for my mom, from a country I went to. Or somebody ... Let's say they went to Korea or China during their break, they might bring back some special food to the office, and everybody can have a cracker or a cookie, or something like that. I like that. \nJen: I'm from Nepal, and here too. In my country too, they would rather give us like, fruits and like different kind of ... Other sweets and stuff rather than clothes and jewelries, you know?\nTodd: So true. Yeah, actually another thing I like to do is sometimes buy a really nice gift, and then for one year, and then maybe for the next year or two, don't buy the person a gift. For example, like maybe one year, I bought my landlady, who I'm very close to, I bought her an iPad. I'm like, \"She's kind of older, and she never had an iPad.\" So I bought her an iPad, but then the next year, I didn't buy her something really expensive. I bought her like a box of chocolates or something, you know. \nJen: In that case, I think it would create a problem, because once you give someone a really special thing, then the next year, they will expect something more, you know?\nTodd: Yeah. \nJen: So like, it'll be really disappointing if they get something that's not very valuable than it was the year before.\nTodd: Yeah, it's kind of hard to climb back from that, isn't it?\nJen: Yeah. Off an iPad? It would be bad.\nTodd: Though, she's a really nice woman. She definitely ... I don't think she thinks that way at all. She's actually better at giving me gifts. She's always giving me gifts. So, have you gotten any gifts recently for anybody? Are you already planning to get your gifts for the end of the year?\nJen: I actually just presented a pair of shoes for my friend, because it was her birthday. The thing is, we don't really celebrate New Year at this time of year. It's kind of different for us, because we celebrate the Lunar ...\nTodd: Ah right, which is in April, right?\nJen: Yes.\nTodd: Okay, cool.\nJen: So haven't really thought about like Christmas gifts or anything.\nTodd: So in your country, in Nepal, like when do people give gifts? On what occasions?\nJen: During our New Year. We have a lot of festivals, so more than gifts, we just invite people and ... you know? Gather around and eat good food, that's it. \nTodd: Yeah, that's the best.\nJen: Yeah, I believe so too.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So I’m here with Jerri and she\n                                is from Thailand, and we’re talking about islands. So\n                                these islands in Thailand get a lot of tourists. \n\nJerri: Yes, right. \n\nTodd: Thailand probably gets more\n                                tourists to its islands than any other country in the\n                                world. Is there like any concerns about the environment\n                                or development on the islands?\n\nJerri: Yes, of course. Wherever there\n                                are people, there’s always an effect on the environment.\n                                And you see this a lot, especially on the most visited\n                                islands such as Phuket and Samoi with the development of\n                                condominiums, schools, malls, leads to deforestation, of\n                                course, and more pollution. You also see the effect more\n                                on the more vulnerable islands like the smaller islands\n                                such as, I think, Koh Phi Phi or Koh Lanta. All of the\n                                islands used to be full of trees and it used to be like\n                                national parks. And now with the people taking speed\n                                boats and everything, you really see the oils on the\n                                sea. The coral reefs are not as colorful as they should\n                                be. All the plastic that comes with, you know, getting\n                                food boxes, plastic straws. Yeah. And you really see the\n                                ecosystems in the sea are affected. \n\nTodd: Yeah, that’s what I tell –\n                                that’s a problem that we have to solve everywhere in the\n                                world, it seems like, especially the plastic. Do you\n                                know about Easter Island in Chile? You know, with the\n                                big stone statues?\n\nJerri: No, not so much.\nTodd: Yeah, that reminds me of Easter\n                                Island which is, you know, famous in Chile for its\n                                really large stone monuments like the stone faces. And\n                                they couldn’t figure out how the people\n                                disappeared or why they disappeared, and now they think\n                                it’s because they cut down all the trees. \n\nJerri: Oh, wow. \n\nTodd: And after they cut down all the\n                                trees, that basically destroyed the environment, and the\n                                people couldn’t survive anymore so they had to leave the\n                                island. So islands really are vulnerable, especially\n                                with their trees, right?\n\nJerri: Right. Yeah, absolutely. \n\nTodd: That’s one of the reasons I\n                                really like Koh Chang, because you can only develop on\n                                one side of the road, you know. \n\nJerri: Yeah. \n\nTodd: So there’s a road around the\n                                island and if it’s on the beach side you can develop,\n                                but anything inland on the other side of the road,\n                                there’s pretty much no development. \n\nJerri: Yes. But there are also on the\n                                positive side you see, you know, when – there\n                                are things like bad things happening to environment, you\n                                see innovation, people actually coming up with ideas. So a lot of hotel chains, for example,\n                                are becoming more sustainable. They’re incorporating\n                                metal straws, paper straws. So you do see some changes\n                                but there’s a long way to go. \n\nTodd: Yeah, you know, I think that’s a\n                                great point. Like eventually, business can find the\n                                solution. \n\nJerri: Yeah, yeah. That’s always…\n\nTodd: It’s in their best interest,\n                                right? Oh, that’s really nice. So what about the\n                                economy? I guess the biggest jobs are the resorts?\n\nJerri: Yes. So the Thai economy relies\n                                on tourists. Yeah, like the hotels, the restaurants,\n                                that’s where we get our money flowing, I would say. \n\nTodd: Right. So that’s your [inaudible\n                                0:03:19.4] of the capital influx from other\n                                countries. \n\nJerri: Yes. \n\nTodd: Right, okay. So, you live in\n                                Bangkok. Out of curiosity, how often do you get to a\n                                resort or to the beach?\n\nJerri: More than I should, to be\n                                honest. Like I love the islands so every opportunity I\n                                get, I’ll fly down south, and then visit the different\n                                ones. But yeah, as I mentioned, my favorite one would be\n                                Koh Pangan. Yeah. \n\nTodd: Can you fly directly from\n                                Bangkok to Koh Pangan?\n\nJerri: Yes. Well, not directly, but\n                                you can fly to the mainland which is Surat Thani. And\n                                it’s actually nice just to spend a day there because\n                                Surat Thani, there’s like a culture there and then you\n                                get to try the authentic Southern food before you\n                                actually go to the islands and it becomes a little bit\n                                more like Western, with the taste and everything. So\n                                that’s my recommendation. And then the next day, you can\n                                just go to the pier and take a ferry to the different\n                                islands you want to go to. \n\nTodd: Oh, wow. So I definitely,\n                                definitely want to take your advice. \n\nJerri: Thank you. \n\nTodd: Well, that’s really nice.",

Well, is there a one recipe that you know how cook really well?Ruth: There is actually. It's chocolate cheesecake. Akane: Wow! That sounds really good. So what kind of ingredients are in this chocolate cheesecake that you're talking about?Ruth: Well, you need chocolate spread, digested buscuits, condensed milk, and you also need cream too.Akane: Wow! And where can you buy these things?Ruth: Well, normally I buy them in the supermarket. It's quite convenient.Akane: OK, and it's pretty easy to find?Ruth: Very easy to find. All of these ingredients.Akane: And what kind of utensils or equipment do you need to make this cake?Ruth: Well, you need a baking tin, which has got an open bottom and you also need a whisk and you need a bowl and you need a fork, and other than that I think that's about it. Akane: I see.....Now, how do you get started with this recipe? What do you do first?Ruth: The first thing that you do is you crush the digested biscuits, and so that they're like crumbled, and then you heat the butter, and you add the butter to the digested biscuits.Akane: OK, well that sounds easy enough. And what do you do next?Ruth: Well then you leave that in the fridge for a day, then when you come back to it, you whisk the cream, you whip it up, and then you add the condensed milk to the cream with the fork very slowly, you fold it in.Akane: Oh, fold it in. Is that hard to do?Ruth: It's quite, yeah, it involves skill. It's quite delicate. Akane: OK. Is that it? Is there any other steps?Ruth: Well, then you need to heat the chocolate spread up and you need to add it to the top and fold that in as well. Akane: And it's done?Ruth: And then that's the end of the cheesecake.Akane: Oh, OK. Now, with this recipe is there anything you need to be careful of?Ruth: Not really, I mean it's quite easy, but the main thing is that you leave the digested mixture in the fridge for long enough, and then after the whole cheesecake is ready, you still have to put it back in the fridge. I'm always tempted to eat it immediately, but you have to wait a few hours for it to cool. Akane: Oh, that sounds great. Thanks Ruth. \nRuth: OK.",

I don't know. I've been thinking, we should do like some online dating. You know, try to meet some women that way.\nJeff: What do you mean? We just sit at home and through the computer. Or how do you do that?\n                              \nJonathan: No, you don't have a date through the computer. That would be awful. But, you know, in the modern world people are rushed. They always don't have time to go out and meet people. If you only go to bars, to try to meet people, you're only meeting a small percentage of the population: the people who do like to go out and drink and have fun, and so on. You're cutting yourself off from a lot of people.\nJeff: So how does this work, this online dating? Do I have to pay to use this site?\nJonathan: Oh, there are some sites where you pay and some where you don't. You can put up a profile of yourself, you know, with a picture if you like, or perhaps you would like to stay more anonymous and not put your picture up. You can see a lot of basic information about people even before you're ever in contact with them.\nJeff: So, if I'm living in a city, do I look for dates or women only in that city?\nJonathan: Well, most of them have search critereas. You can choose within say twenty kilometers or a hundred kilometers. Anyway where in the world if you like? You don't always find love just around the corner. You might find you have a heck of a lot in common with somebody on the other side of the world. But with online dating, people put up some information that they are comfortable sharing, so you can see what somebody does in their free time, what somebody's beliefs are, what somebody is interested in finding, so you may find by doing the search that you meet someone that really matches up with you that you would be interested in contacting without ever going out to the bar, or if you just go out and hit the bar, you may feel a one in a million shot to meet the right person, whereas online, maybe you can search a million people and you find that right one.\nJeff: Online dating. That sounds great. I'm gonna give it a go.",

(Yes) Yeah, and can you talk about the food in Italy?\nMarion: Sure, I'd love to. I love Italian food.\nTodd: I know, it's so good.\nMarion: Yeah, well, I suppose everybody thinks immediately of pasta and pizza, right?\nTodd: Right, right, right, right.\nMarion: They're the most, the two most common types of Italian food and they are really good, I mean, there's just no comparison I think to the pasta and the pizza that we get in other countries, also the ice cream actually in Italy is just different from any other country in the world I think. They really, they really have the number one on those three items I think. But apart from that, I mean there's a whole world of Italian food and it's all really, really good. I mean, the first time I lived in Italy I lived in Genoa, so that was by the sea. Obviously there is a lot of seafood involved in the cooking. Um, fish stews and that kind of thing and they were really, really good, also that region around Geneoa is where pesto originated, so you know the basil sauce (oh, yeah) Yeah, that from Ligiuriea, which is the area around Geneoa, so while I lived in Geneoa, I think I must have had some form of a pesto dish, at least once a week, but I loved it. It's one of my favorite tastes, actually, pesto. \nTodd: Yeah, pesto's great.\nMarion: Yeah, yeah, you can add it to anything and it tastes great. I put it on my sandwiches sometimes.\nTodd: Really.\nMarion: Yeah. Yeah, so Italian food, it's quite difficult tp talk about Italian food really because in Italy there are so many different regions, so all over the country each region has it's own special dish, or special dishes, so the food can really vary from the North to the South, in the north for example, in some areas you can find food that's more like german food or in the south it's more mediteraran like greek food for example.

Basically, the tabloids are just gossip, and they will report anything and everything in great detail. Um, a lot of people kind of disapprove of the tabloids but personally I find them quite interesting and entertaining. In our house, we have a tabloid newspaper, The Daily Mirror and we have the Daily Mail as well. And in the Mirror you'll get all the gossip, and things like horoscopes, and real celebrity news like recently you've had the David Beckham thing that he's been having an affair, and that was interesting. It went into real detail all the text messages that they sent and everything, uh, and it is kind of, it is just gossip, but then many people get the tabloids because it reports the sport in a lot of detail, so a lot of men get the, for the football scores and horse racing and everything.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Carla, you said you have a chameleon story? Carla: Yeah.Todd: Actually first of all, just for the listeners, what is a chameleon. Carla: I was going to tell you what that is. A chameleon is an animal that can change its' colour depending on where it is. So if you put it on a black book, for example, it'll turn very dark. If you put it in a light place, it'll go bright bright green. It could go spotty yellow and green. And the other thing that's interesting about it is that it's eyes can move in two different directions. So it's right eye can look forwards and it's left eye can look backwards. So if you stand on one side of it and wiggle your hand around, one eye will look towards the back and the other eye will look towards the front. And it also has a long long tongue so it zaps its tongue out to catch a fly. Anyway, we found this chameleon, and we took it into our house. And we had it for about, I think maybe two weeks. And we had an electrical chord, that went from our refrigerator, up the wall, into the ceiling above up to the electrical box in the roof space. And this chameleon spent two weeks crawling up the chord getting to the ceiling and dropping off. And crawling up the chord and getting to the ceiling and dropping off. But every once in a while we would, I took it into the classroom sometimes and we would kind of play with it because we liked to, it was a good biology experiment … Todd: Yeah. Carla: … to put different colours of things around it and see what colour it would turn into. Then after a while we let the poor little thing go. Todd: So it didn't mind you picking it up and taking it? Carla: Actually, it did mind because if you picked it up by about half way… three quarters of the way down it's back, that was safest because it can't swing its upper body around. But it would turn around and hiss at you. Todd: Oh, wow. Carla: So you, the first time I just dropped it cause it was scary. And the second time I realised that's about as scary as it got so. That was it.",

        "transcript": "Gyri:               What are some superhero skills that you would like to have?\nViyasan:            There's lots of different types of skills out there that have my attention but I think the most important skill or the most useful skill for me would be to clone myself. There's an anime, Naruto, and coincidentally we're in Japan as well. In Naruto, you're able to clone yourself and when you clone yourself you're able to still retain all the knowledge that your clone is doing. For example, I could be here doing an interview and my clone could be outside swimming and practicing swimming, and then when my clone disappears, I'll still retain all the knowledge I have from swimming even though I was performing an interview here. I think that would be very useful in learning a lot of different types of things. For example, languages, practicing sports, cooking food, and it would be very efficient with my time and I'd be able to complete everything on my schedule. \nGyri:               Multi-tasking. \nViyasan:            Exactly. Multi-tasking at its finest. That's definitely a superhero power that I would love to have. \nGyri:               Mm-hmm. \nViyasan:            What about yourself? What would you like to do? \nGyri:               Oh, I'm not sure. When I was little I always wanted to be able to fly or breathe underwater because I really wanted to be a mermaid when I was little, but I think now maybe just teleportation would be really nice. I wouldn't have to walk everywhere. I'm a little lazy. I wouldn't have to sit on the plane for like ten hours when I visit my family in the states. I hate flying, it's just really boring. \nViyasan:            Yeah. \nGyri:               So yeah, definitely teleportation, I think. \nViyasan:            Okay, that's a very interesting superhero ability to have. \nGyri:               Yeah. \nViyasan:            Definitely makes life a lot quicker. You won't have to sit in rush hour either when you're driving home from work. \nGyri:               Yeah, and I could just teleport to all the different places and countries that I wanted to go to. \nViyasan:            Exactly. \nGyri:               Yeah. \nViyasan:            That'd be amazing as well, yeah. What else? What other types of superhero powers would you have besides teleportation? \nGyri:               Maybe superhuman strength. \nViyasan:            Mm-hmm. \nGyri:               That would be cool, I think. Just walking around lifting people up and stuff. \nViyasan:            Yeah. \nGyri:               Or lifting up buildings, like Superman. \nViyasan:            Yeah, like Superman. \nGyri:               Stopping astroids and yeah. But people would definitely notice that I had super powers and maybe that's not a good idea. \nViyasan:            You might want to compete in some strong man or power building competitions. \nGyri:               Yeah, yeah. \nViyasan:          Super lifting, yeah. \nGyri:          I would become famous. \nViyasan:          Exactly, yeah. That would be a good career move, eh? \nGyri:               Yeah, but it would be purely talent and not hard work. \nViyasan:            Exactly, exactly. But I guess you'd have to practice your superhero strength. \nGyri:               I guess. \nViyasan:            By picking up different things. \nGyri:               Yeah, and practicing not using too much strength and crushing things. \nViyasan:            That's true. That's true, yeah. That's very cool. \nGyri:               Are there any other powers that you would like to have? \nViyasan:            The one superhero that's my favorite is Spiderman and so I saw all of his movies as a little kid and so I think having webs coming out of your wrist, being able to fly between skyscrapers, being able to stick people onto walls, fighting crime. That would be really cool, but just mainly for the amusement aspect of flying around, sling shotting different things with your webs. That would be very cool and a very unique skill to have. \nGyri:               Yeah. \nViyasan:            That super power would be amazing to have, yeah. \nGyri:               Mm-hmm . He's your favorite superhero? \nViyasan:            Yeah, I would say that he's the superhero that I relate to the most. Just recently Spiderman High School came out and so it depicted Peter Parker, Spiderman, in high school and so it was a very fun movie and definitely relates a lot to high school and it was very fun to watch and I really enjoyed that. Definitely Spiderman is my favorite superhero and I really enjoyed his movie and definitely would love to have his web shooting abilities. \nGyri:               Mm-hmm . \nViyasan:            Yeah.",

How many days did that take?\nTerry: Um, the total trip took 42 days but that included one day on the bus up and then one day on the bus back so 40 days on the road, of which 36 days were riding days and 4 days off.\nTodd: That is so cool. So first you have your bike in your hometown and you put your bike on the bus and you took the bus to Vancouver?\nTerry: Right. Yeah, you have to put your bike in a bicycle box as it's know. It requires a little disassembling of the bicycle but, it's not difficult.\nTodd: As, so you take the bike apart and put it in a box and then put it, \nTerry: Yeah for sure it on a bus or an airplane, they're both the same, you have to put it in a bike box.\nTodd: So are you really good at bicycle maintenance?\nTerry: Ah, no. I would say that that is one of my shortcomings. I certainly do some bicycle maintenance. Whenever you're on a long bicycle trip, you by design, you have to take care of your bike and then that's your transportation. You're carrying everything you have with you so you need to take care of your bicycle. YOu can stop in bicycle shops along the way and have then do any major repairs, but on a day to day basis you need to maintain your bicycle.\nTodd: OK, so when you are taking a trip, what tools do you need to take with you? To take care of your bicycle?\nTerry: Oh, just some basic Alan wrenches and screwdrivers and, oh and obviously, a repair kit for patching a tube, or some extra inter tubes. I usually just take along extra inter tubes, and you need tools to take your wheel, your tire off, and things like that.\nTodd: Wow, so you just take the tubes with you, huh? How many inter tubes do you take?\nTerry: Oh, I usually take two or three extras. I'm, anymore, I'm not real keen on patching flats. I usually just take the tube out and throw it away and put in a new one.\nTodd: So on your last bike trip, did you have any problems with your bike? Did it break down at all?\nTerry: No, no, no. No real problems.\nTodd: Oh, cool. Alright, thanks Terry.",

Every state, every like, we have 27 states in India. Every state has it own language. Our general language.\nTodd: 27 different general languages. (Yeah) That's what divides the country is the languages?\nNitya: No, it's divided by the states, I mean different states we call different parts of it, and also by the language. Yep.\n\nTodd: Wow, that's pretty amazing. So you said Punjabi.\nNitya: Punjabi, Gujarati, Tamil, Malayalam. (Wow) Huge, yeah.\nTodd: That's pretty amazing. How many languages do you speak?\nNitya: Six.\nTodd: Six.\nNitya: Yep. \nTodd: What do you speak?\nNitya: Ok, I can speak Hindi. I can speak Punjabi a little bit, and I can understand the whole of it all, and I can speak Tamil. I can speak Malayalam, because Malayalam is my mother's language. She's from southern part of India. My dad is from the north part of India and I speak Hindi. I understand Telugu, and I guess Marathi also a little bit.\nTodd: Wow, and that's not even including English or Japanese.\nNitya: Yeah, OK, and then you include English and Japanese and that.\nTodd: That's amazing.

        "transcript": "Jana: Peter, you're from South Africa, right?\nPeter: That's right, yeah.\nJana: I heard there's a lot of beautiful mountains that are famous for hikes. Is that true?Peter: That's true, yeah. Actually, I've been hiking since I was in elementary school really because there's so much, there are so many hikes to go on. The area that I grew up is actually quite close to the Drakensberg which is a famous mountain range in South Africa and it runs almost the whole length of the country and there are so many hikes, camping spots, places that you could go to and the hikes that you can go on for like a day, or two days, a week, ten days, a month if you want to. Really so much so I used to go most, I guess most holidays, or twice or three times a year even go hiking.Jana: That sounds great. Is it safe? Are there any dangerous animals like snakes?Peter: I guess, hmm I guess I'd have to say yes to that but in all my years of hiking, I have, I have seen many snakes but I've never been bitten or even felt in danger. Like once or twice maybe but South Africa is like also famous for its many poisonous snakes and there are quite a few things that you'd rather avoid but I guess, especially in the Drakensberg, the altitude for the mountains it's quite high so not many dangerous animals live at high altitude if I can put it that way. So it's really, it's really kind of, yeah, it's not dangerous I would say. Like obviously you have to take care and, you know, go during times of the year that is less, that you are less likely to get caught in a snowstorm or get snowed in or freeze to death or something but I think if you take adequate preparation there shouldn't be any problem and it's really gorgeously beautiful.Jana: It sounds really nice. Is it easy to get to? Do you need a car to get around?Peter: Yes. Mostly you should, you should, you need a car and in some places you'd even need a...Jana: Helicopter?Peter: No. I guess you could go with a helicopter but like if you have something like a Land Rover or a Land Cruiser or a four by four vehicle of some kind then you could get even into more beautiful places and more far away distant places that I would recommend even more. There are really so many places you can go to.Jana: It sounds really great. I'll ask you again. Hopefully one day I will get a chance to visit South Africa.Peter: Yes, you should, you should go I say. Do you like hiking?Jana: I do but I hardly ever go, you know, as you get so busy with your daily life and I like the idea of hiking but I hardly ever go, do any sort of outdoor activity but yeah I guess it's a good thing to do during holidays.Peter: Hmm.Jana: Yeah, when I was a kid we often went to the mountains with my parents so we would go for walks, short hikes, that kind of thing.Peter: OK.Jana: But yeah then one just gets a bit busy with the daily life so I kind of forgot.Peter: Yeah, life really has a way to get away with one, it really goes fast.",

        "transcript": "Obviously, this is the sequel to Fun in the City, which is a film I didn't like so it's fair to say my expectations were low. So, you could say I wasn't disappointed, as it met my expectations. It was awful! It was so awful, I'd rather not spend any more time on it by talking about it. But, that wouldn't be a film review and I think I owe you all a review to save you wasting your money going to see it.\n\nSo, it starts off with this big wedding scene. And, I won't go into why, but the whole scene is just there so they can make this one joke. It's not even a funny joke ... it's just, ah, it's just terrible. It's got nothing to do with the rest of the film. Anyway, it starts there. Then, instead of the characters and the plot staying in New York where the original film was set, one of them wins a ticket to India and decides to take all her friends. It's what directors do when they've run out of ideas … let's take our characters on tour!\n\nAnyway, they gossip, cry and shop, and they repeat this until the end. No real people would ever act like this. I didn't have any sympathy for their problems or even care what happened to them. Don't go and see it, you'll only encourage them to make another sequel. The world doesn't need three of these films. Please save your money and go and see the other big film this week: Twilight Mirror.\n\nSo, if you're a fan of the book it's based on, you're probably as excited as I was about this. For everyone else, this is a film fans have been waiting ten years to see. I have to confess, I was a bit nervous. I'd seen the posters and they didn't look right. I didn't love them at all. And I wasn't sure about the actors they cast either. So I went in not sure what to expect. But … I loved it.\n\nOne thing I really liked about it was the pace. They went backwards and forwards between the real world and the computer world and it worked really well. The special effects brought the computer world to life and I totally believed in it. But, more than that, I felt emotionally connected to the story and the characters. The whole film worked on so many levels. It reminded me of going to the cinema as a child – how much fun that was. I can't recommend it enough.",

        "transcript": "Good morning. Today I’m going to talk about how to study. Now you probably think you know all about that, right? You’ve been studying for years. And I expect some of you are fantastic at studying, really organised and good at concentrating. But there’s always room for improvement, and your exams aren’t far away, so these tips are for all of you.\n\nRight, so, what’s the best way to study? Well, first of all, it’s a good idea to have some kind of plan or timetable. This could be for the week or a longer revision timetable for an exam, from one month to six months. Yes, if you’re studying for an important exam it’s important to think long term. Draw up a timetable, but revise it often. If it’s not going to plan, you may have to rethink it.\n\nNext, think about your environment. Make sure the place where you are going to study is comfortable with enough light, air, etc. Not too hot, not too cold. Make sure there are no distracting noises around, such as television. If you think you concentrate better listening to music, experiment and see if it’s really true. Some people really do seem to work better with music in the background, especially classical music, but for many people it spoils their concentration. However, if you have to work near a TV, you might have to use headphones to play music to drown out the sound of the TV. In this case, find out what kind of music works best for you, maybe something without words. By the way, you might think you work fine with the TV on, but, again, experiment. You might be surprised at how much better you work away from a TV. Oh, and the other thing is the internet, text messages, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Forget about all of that while you’re studying. No, really, you can ignore it for an hour or so; it won’t be the end of the world if you don’t reply to a message immediately.\n\nRight, planning breaks. Plan your study periods in chunks with regular breaks. Many people recommend half an hour of concentrated study, then a ten-minute break. But you can adjust this to suit you. If you study for too long at a stretch your mind will work less effectively, so be careful. In your short break, you can give yourself a treat, such as a cup of green tea. I wouldn’t advise a chocolate bar as a treat – a sugar rush is not great for concentration.\n\nOK, so next let’s think about what you do when you’re studying. Some people just read through their notes or textbooks and underline in pencil or highlight important bits. If this works for you, fine, but I’d suggest that it’s better to write notes of some kind, so your mind is processing the information more. This way you are also producing material which will be useful for last-minute revision. I don’t recommend very last-minute revision, by the way, but we’ll come back to that later.\n\nHave a look at these examples of student notes. Which do you think are best? The first person has written important phrases at random, the next has a table with clear headings and boxes with notes, the next has summaries, and the last one has mind maps: you’ve got the main topic in the circle, then lines coming off the circle attached to subcategories, then more lines to further details. Mind maps are great for showing the connections between different bits of information. They seem to work in the same way the brain works. So what do you think? To me, the first one wouldn’t be very useful to come back to and use in the future. But the others are all fine – it depends on your personal preference. Mine is for mind maps. I would suggest using colours, though, and even little drawings. They can make things much more memorable.\n\nObviously, when you are studying, the first thing to think about is whether you understand the information, and the second thing is how you are going to remember it. Let’s look at some more ways of making information more memorable …",

Each place has it's own good points, for example the country is quiet and relaxed and you're calm in the country and your head is clear, your mind is clear and you listen to the birds and look at the clouds and watch the sunrise and it's very peaceful but in the city it's.. there is a lot of energy, there's a lot of people and there's a lot of commotion, a lot of lights and a lot of action. So the quiet country side gives you energy and makes you strong but the city and all the action and all the sites and the sounds and the smells also gives you energy so I think they both have their good points.",

I went through a lot of ups and downs, and yeah, at first I did really well in my classes and I got a scholarship so that was something that was really nice. It made my parents really proud of me, but then later I went back home for vacation and then unfortunately, I met through an accident, a car accident, and yeah, I had to be in bed for a month or something, so that was... initially I was like, a bit of thrown off but then that itself was a very good learning experience because it made me really strong and, yeah...Fred: OK, so you're saying that even though you had a bad experience, it made you a stronger person.Shibika: That's right. Yeah. It made me a really strong person and then it was like, I was not anymore more scared of accidents and I was not scared of any unfortunate mishappenings because they're a part of your life, you know, you can't really help them happening, they don't happen for reason, so you just got to accept them and move on.Fred: Yeah, that's right but I'm guessing that you're gonna be so much more of a stronger person the following year and so you can accomplish...Shibika: That's right. That's right. Fred: Many more things.Shibika: Yeah. At that time I felt as if like I had wasted a lot of time and I was not able to go for my classes or I could not... I was not able to enjoy my vacations but it was, it didn't turn out to be that bad because I sat at home, watched TV and I was being served and taken care of all the time so that was a good thing.Fred: That's nice. You can say that that's the best thing that happened to you this year.Shibika: Yeah. The best thing in disguise, you know, because initially I didn't see it as a good thing obviously but, yeah, it made me feel how much people who are close to me, how much they care for me and how much they love me, so it was a really good thing.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Anita, we're talking about money. When you go shopping, do you prefer to pay by cash or credit card?\nAnita: You know, there are times when I prefer paying by credit card because it makes me feel better because at the end of the day, I don't feel like I spent that money.\nTodd: Right, right.\nAnita: Because if I pay by cash, that money is gone out of your wallet, and you really feel it missing, so there are times when I prefer credit cards. There are times when I prefer cash, but if you look at it in the long run, I prefer cash because you know exactly what your financial situation is. You don't have to worry about getting a credit card bill at the end of the month, and not being able to pay it, so I would say I prefer cash.\nTodd: You know, I used to think exactly like you do, but I changed because I found that when I was using cash, I couldn't keep track of how I was spending my money. I really had no record. I couldn't keep the receipts. I would lose the receipts, so a friend of mine said you should do everything on credit card or debit card and then it's on the computer. You can check, and then you could buy software and you can keep track of your finances and I did it and it works. It's really good, like I'm more careful with my money because I know exactly what I am spending on and I can check it. \nAnita: That's true. That's true, and I do something similar except I don't have computer software for it but I have a little cash book where I write my expenses.\nTodd: You mean writing, actual work.\nAnita: I.. yes actual work: pen and paper, but for me that works better because if I use my credit card unlike you, I lose track of my spending. I forget when I use the credit card, when I didn't use it and it's much easier for me to buy things with a credit card. If you have cash in your wallet and the cash is not enough to buy whatever you want, you know that you cannot afford it,  but with a credit card, that is not there so sometimes you tend to overspend and buy things you don't actually need.\nTodd: True, that is a good point. I guess the key thing is to be careful.",

Todd: Yes.Mark: How long have you been doing that?Todd: I've been doing it now for about two years.Mark: Two years. OK, and I've been on the site and there's a place where I can send a comment to you, right?  Do people ever send, send you comments, or?Todd: Yeah, actually, I get, I do, I get about five letters a day, usually, from people all over the world, some days more, some days less, and usually people are very sweet and they say, oh you know, \"Nice Job\" and sometimes they give me suggestions for how to improve the site.Mark: Really! Do they ever, is anyone ever critical or say any negative things?Todd: Well, the one, the main critical thing I get a lot, often is, \"Why don't you have real authentic speech?\" Like, why don't you have people talking natural. And actually, there's quite a few reasons why?Mark: OK, well, I don't understand exactly because right now, you and I are talking (right) and this is not scripted, we're basically talking (right) we're talking off the top of our head, so how is this not natural?Todd: Well, this conversation actually probably is more natural because I'm really explaining why I don't have natural conversations. It's kind of ironic, but I think because a lot of the conversations are staged. They're unscripted, but I do just sit down and ask two people to talk about something, and because I tell them to talk about it, it's not as natural as it would be in real life.Mark: Ah, I see, because they're not, they didn't think of that topic on their own. They're given the topic and then, sort of, they must say something about that topic.Todd: Right. And also there's a problem with just the recordings. You know when you record audio, you have to have the mic equal distance to both speakers, and so that means both people have to sit down and put on the headsets to get good quality audio, so in order to get people speaking naturally in real life, I would have to follow them around with a microphone, and it's, technically it's just too hard to do.Mark: So what do you do to try to, is that, well let me ask you, actually, is that the only criticism that you get?Todd: Ah, no, there's, well, there's quite a bit. The other criticism is that, this is the funny part, it's either too easy, or it's too difficult, so usuallyMark: So you need more intermediate.Todd: Well, I guess that's what they say, they say that there's not enough stuff for low level listeners, and there's not enough stuff for the advanced listeners.Mark: So what do you think your gonna do in the future to address those needs?Todd: Well, hopefully by next year, Ill be able to have enough that I can do both. For the people who really want high listening, or more advanced listening I think they should just go to the links page and listen to authentic stuff, because if you're listening is that good then, that's probably the best thing to do, but I do need to start working on stuff for beginners soon.",

I had two contracts in Germany. The first one in the seventies, for three years. I was an immersion teacher, which means that they're English students at the elementary level who take all their courses in French, so with a particular second language approach I would teach them not only French, but I would teach them mathematics in French, science in French, visual arts in French, physical education in French \n\t\t                Todd: Wow, in Germany.\n\t                    Norman: In Germany, yes! This was for the Canadian Armed forces. The, usually it's the man the father, who's there as a soldier, but sometimes it's the woman.

What a cool job! What did you think about Germany? \n                        Norman: Germany is very interesting in that it's a very lively country, I find. I enjoyed certainly the nature part. Every weekend, Susan and I tried to go on what they call volksmarch, which means, it's, \"volks\" means popular, popular walk. You have a choice of five kilometers, ten kilometers, or fifteen kilometers walk and at the end, once you complete the walk, you get a metal, and the walk is always in some nice\n\t\t\t\t                        village. You go up the hills, up the mountains, you have beautiful sights, and every now and then they have some kind of a food stand with a Bavarian band playing, and then you have those Bavarian sausages and it's just a whole lot of fun so we would take our children along with us and it would be quite an event. \n                        Todd: That's nice.

Most hooligans are very proud of their home city and their home team, and what usually happens, are when the away team come to the city their hooligans try to actually take over the other teams actual bars, pubs so it's a race to get in the bar for first.\nTodd: Oh, wow!\nMark: Yeah and when that happens, when the actual away team is actually, if their supporters are drinking in your bar, then obviously you want to take your bar back, so there's usually a lot of violence.\nTodd: So you've actually seen fights?\nMark: Oh, lots of fights, yeah, sure, sure. If you go to most games in England on a Saturday you can usually see the odd fight or maybe, I've been to some games where there has actually been full scale riots but usually not in the stadium, usually outside.\nTodd: What happens when there's a riot?\nMark: So, one, the biggest riot I've seen, was actually at a stadium and it was two local rivals: it was my team and the local team called Leeds and basically the guys were all fighting in a field near the stadium so what all that happened was the police actually surrounded them with horses, and police dogs, and they just let the police dogs go off the leads, and then the horses charged in and basically the police where just hitting the supporters with the batons.\nTodd: Wow! Pretty intense.\nMark: Yeah, yeah, lots, usually a few arrests. So usually when there's a big riot the papers will report how many arrests there were. Sometimes a 100, 150.",

And it is a public holiday, so on that day we go to the beach, and we do various Australian kind of things. We have barbecues and picnics, and it's a day to wear the flag colors.\nTodd: So it's your patriotic day?\nMegen: Yeah, it is.\nTodd: Like our fourth of July.\nMegen: Yes, yeah, like that. We don't usually have fireworks though.\nTodd: Oh, because of fires?\nMegen: No, I don't know why we don't, but I guess fireworks are popular on the Fourth of July right?\nTodd: They are, although these days they don't do it so much because of fires.\nMegen: Oh, it's summer in July.\nTodd: Right, so it's dangerous. ... what about other holidays like for example Valentine's Day? Do you celebrate Valentine's Day?\nMegen: Yeah, we do.\nTodd: Is it a romantic day?\nMegen: Yeah, so for Valentine's Day, usually you'll go out with your partner for dinner ... usually chocolate and flowers. It's pretty extravagant actually. The flowers are becoming more and more extravagant, and people like to send bunches of flowers to their partners work, and there's decorations and a lot of the products in the store are aimed at Valentine's Day I think.\nTodd: What do you think of Valentine's Day? \nMegen: Well, I didn't want to get caught up in every thing when I was in Australia. I would go out for dinner sometimes, but nothing big.\nTodd: Now in Japan they have two days. They have Valentine's Day and they have White Day. Can you explain that?\nMegen: Yeah, well, I was surprised that is the day when the girls are supposed to give something to the boys.\nTodd: Right, it's reversed.\nMegen: Yeah, because I think in Australia on Valentine's Day, it's very important for boys to give something to girls, but not necessarily as important for girls to give something for boys.\nTodd: So when do boys give something to girls?\nMegen: So that is what White Day is for. So the White Day is the day is the day for the boys to reciprocate the action of giving chocolate or something to their partner, and the students are school as well, they will exchange chocolates or candies that they've made and they will give something back on White Day.\nTodd: Yeah, it's kind of nice how they flip it around. I actually like that it's broken up.\nMegen: It gives you time to think about what to do, maybe.\nTodd: Right, exactly.",

I wasn't drafted high enough in professional baseball to.. in order for me to sign, so I ended up retiring from baseball and pursuing other things.\nTodd: OK. Great. Do you like any others sports? \nKevin: Yeah. I actually, I enjoy all competition. You know I enjoy  the other typical American sports of basketball and American football and so on, but I also try to learn about and enjoy the national sport of the countries that I'm in. For example now I'm in Japan and I've actually gotten quite into Sumo wrestling. \nTodd: Oh, really?\nKevin: Yeah.\nTodd: Nice. Have you ever seen a sumo match live?\nKevin: Yes, I have. I've been to two sumo bashos as they call them, or matches in Tokyo.\nTodd: Nice. Yeah, I wanna go. I wanna go myself.\nKevin: Yeah, let's go sometime.\nTodd: OK. Let's do it.",

Well, you need chicken, chili powder, rice, canned mushroom soup, and lots of cheese. \n                        Todd: OK, and how do you make it?\n                        John: Basically, you cook the chicken. You can like grill it or bake it. Whatever you want and you strip it into pieces and then you cook the rice and then you take the rice and the chicken and the mushroom soup and the cheese and the chili powder and you basically mix it all together in a big slop and then you put it in a casserole dish and throw it in the oven.\n                        Todd: Oh, wow, sounds pretty good. How long does it take to make?\n                        John: You could do it in about an hour. \n                        Todd: An hour!\n                        John: Yeah. \n                        Todd: Wow, that's pretty fast\n                        John: An hour or under an hour.\n                        Todd: OK, have you made it recently?\n                        John: No, I haven't made it in awhile.

I knew he was away but I thought it was for personal reasons?\n\nWill: I'm pretty sure that's not the full story. Have you ever worked with him?\n\nKiera: A long time ago, but … well, I've heard stories about him for years.\n\nWill: I've never worked with him directly but I know people that have and they say he was always shouting and screaming, threatening to fire people. And Susanne told me he took credit for one of her ideas. She had this idea for a project and she brought it up at the monthly creative workshop and he liked it – everybody did. But she saw the notes from the meeting and there was no mention of her name anywhere. John had agreed with her and repeated some of the things she said and the notes made it look like they were his ideas in the first place. He made her do all the work planning it, then when the project actually got started – it was that cars one – Susanne was moved to something else.\n\nKiera: It won an award, didn't it?\n\nWill: Yeah, but Susanne didn't get to share it – there was zero recognition of her contribution. She was furious but she couldn't do anything about it. Not if she wanted to keep her job.\n\nKiera: Yeah, it's almost impossible to report people who are as high up as John is, or was.\n\nWill: How did you find working with him, then?\n\nKiera: Well, you know what you said about him shouting at people? I've been in meetings with him and we all learned to keep our mouths shut. It was horrible. People were genuinely afraid of him.\n\nWill: Did you ever see him stealing people's ideas?\n\nKiera: It was never that obvious. He was a genius. He had incredible vision but, you know, there was a whole team of people working with him. Not every single idea came from him and after a while it's not easy to say, 'Oh, this idea was mine and this idea was yours.' For me, the bigger problem was that you could be in his good books and then suddenly, with no explanation, you were out. And if you were out, life got very difficult.\n\nWill: I heard women in particular had a hard time working with him.\n\nKiera: Yeah, well, like I said, you had to stay in his good books. So, if there was a comment that made you feel uncomfortable, you didn't say anything.\n\nWill: Did that happen to you?\n\nKiera: Not to me, no, but we all knew … and no one said anything. And I was lucky I didn't have that much contact with him myself.\n\nWill: They're doing a full investigation so I suppose a lot of these stories are going to come to light.\n\nKiera: I hope so. I really hope he's not coming back.",

Ruth:That's such a bargain. That's fantastic. Akane: Yeah, it was. Ruth: So how often do you go shopping? Akane: Um, not too often, maybe about once a month. Ruth: Once a month. For clothes? Akane: Um, yeah, just to browse around, look around. Um, I might not always buy something, but once in awhile I do. Ruth: And where do you go? Akane: Well, I like to go to the local market, and things like that, cause I think that's the best place to find bargains. Ruth: Do you normally try clothes on before you buy them? Akane: I do. I prefer to try them on before I buy them. It's not always possible though. Ruth: So if you buy something at a market, so you try it on first?Akane: Well, yes I would ask the person if I can try it on. If they say no, then I would try  to see if it fits or not right on top of my clothes and make a good guess.Ruth: Do you ever buy clothes which are second hand, which other people have already worn?Akane: I used to be really into vintage clothes when I was younger. Yes, there's a huge area  in Toronto where I'm from where there are many shops with vintage clothes, and I used to go there  all the time. Ruth: Wow. So there kind of dated clothes are they?Akane: Yes, they are. They are second hand clothes. They're used and they're very cheap and very fashionable.Ruth: Oh, that sounds fantastic. Akane: Yeah, it is. Ruth: Does anybody else ever buy you clothes? Do your parents buy you clothes sometimes?Akane: Um, I suppose they used to when I was younger, but not anymore, because you know, I like to choose my own things.Ruth: Of course, yeah.Akane: But once in awhile I might go shopping with my mother, and if there's something  I like she might buy it for me if it's a special occasion.Ruth: Oh, that's generous.

        "transcript": "Todd: So, we're here... first of all, how about everybody introduce themselves. Fred: OK. I'm Fred from Canada and it's a pleasure to be here.Katia: Hello. I am Katerina. I'm from Mexico and I'm also very glad to be here.Todd: Thanks guys. And then, I'm Todd. I'm from the U.S. Now for the listeners, we all live really close to each other and we live in a neighborhood, where I guess, all of our houses are probably within two or three minutes of each other.Katia: Very close.Todd: So, we thought we would talk about the neighborhood, and the first topic would be the stray cats.Katia: Which are also are neighbors.Todd: Right. First of all, how many stray cats do you think there are in the neighborhood?Katia: At least at night, you see them all together, especially in one corner, and I see at least about six cats, at least, all together.Fred: I would say much more than that.Todd: Yeah, I would too actually. How many do you think?Fred: I would go for maybe twenty of those around the neighborhood.Katia: But this is just one corner.Fred: OK, just one corner, so multiplied by four or five corners, yeah, twenty, twenty-five cats.Todd: OK, so then, what do you guys think about the cats? Like should something be done about the cats? Should the people feed the cats?Katia: I think especially for a lot of the elderly people that live here, I think for them it's very nice to have the cats around and they feed them and I think as long as they don't go into the trash, I think it's OK, but for me, I haven't seen any trash, and I don't think it would be a problem.Todd: Well, you know, they break into my house. I don't know if they break into yours, but they're amazing. If I don't lock the windows, the sliding glass doors they pull the door open with their paw and they come in and they look through my trash and then they leave.Fred: Those are very clever cats.Todd: Yeah, I thought it was a raccoon. I thought I had a raccoon, and I went to talk to my landlady, and she's like, \"No, that's just the cats.\"Katia: I think you were just not feeding them.Todd: Well, yeah, I guess that's it. Like, they're so hungry that they break into people's houses for food.Katia: OK, I don't have that problem. I live on the third floor.Todd: Oh, really.Katia: So, maybe that's why.Todd: Right.Fred: I don't have that problem either, although I do live in a house similar to yours, Todd, where we live on the first floor and there is a lot of stray cats around the neighborhood but I've never had any problems of them breaking into the house.Todd: Yeah, I don't know. They're pretty amazing. Like, I did not even know that cat's could break into a house, but they can.Katia: Very smart cats.Todd: Yeah. Or very hungry cats, as you said. Katia: Or friendly cats. They want to visit.Todd: Yeah, right.",

We go abroad to support people and help people if there is some sort of war or some trouble abroad, but we don't fight against any country.Todd: So when there's a major conflict, you don't take a side.Anja: That's exactly this.Todd: So, how about ,,, are Swiss people very political? Like are they in terms of your country, like are they very involved with politics?Anja: Yes, actually you have to, especially young people are very involved in politics as well, and like we have votes and what not, like every month there's something we have to give our vote, and people always do it. It's really amazing. I like that a lot.Todd: What a minute! You vote every month?Anja: Yeah, for some local things or prefectural things and we always get the stuff back home in the mail, and then we have to fill it out. You know, tick a yes or a no and bring it to the, how do you say?Todd: Like the post office?Anja: Yes. Then vote.Todd: So, it's like a referendum? It's about some local issue.Anja: Yes, exactly. Like referendums or yeah, for the prefecture, for your city or for your village all the time.Todd: That's pretty amazing. Now, are these issues that you take time to look into, or do you just kind of guess?Anja: Well, it depends a little bit, like, if it's not of very big importance, like of course, everything is important, but then, you know, you just do what you feel is the right thing and you just tick a yes or no, but if you feel like it's a really big deal, like a lot of money's being invested or it's like something that concerns the whole country, then of course you will do like research on it and well, it's on the news anyway, so you .. they like the government informs you a lot and you get brochures like for the topics and so, yeah.

        "transcript": "Christophe: OK, Aiste, we're going to talk about environmental issues in Europe. So, does Lithuania have environmental issues?\nAiste: Oh, actually were are facing kind of a big problem. The Baltic Sea that's besides Lithuania. You know three Baltic countries: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, together with Scandinavian and Denmark are close to the Baltic Sea that's very isolated and almost has no contact with the ocean and because of that it functions almost like a lake so it means the oxygen can't really get into it and there are a lot of algae growing and the eutrophication and together pollution as well as nutrients increase due to the factories that are around the place where people live are causing a lot of problems in Baltic Sea. \nChristophe: Eutrophication? What does that mean?Aiste: Eutrophication is actually a process when due to the increase nitrates and other organic materials, a lot of algae starts growing in the sea, and therefore it deprives the sea of oxygen and once it deprives the seas of oxygen, no more fish can live in the sea and they start dying out. Therefore the sea smells with kind of sulphur - strange smell - and it's a huge problem because the biodiversity and the fish and the in the sea decreases.Christophe: Wow! That sounds horrible.Aiste: What about Belgium? Do you have any problems in Belgium do the environment?Christophe: Well, first of all we have a lot of people living in a very small country. I think we have around four hundred people each square kilometer, so it means that there are too many people in my country. Everything is full of houses, so there's almost no forest any more. There's a real huge problem of deforestation. The second problem is that we have a lot of rivers that are polluted. We have many factories and they're polluting our rivers because we have a lot rivers in Belgium. Remember, it is raining there a lot of times and there just dumping all their stuff in the river so this causes rivers that have no fish anymore, or where children cannot swim in anymore, so that's a very, very huge problem in Belgium and we're trying to solve that now.",

Was it hard for you to eat? Was it hard for you to go to the bathroom? What? How was that? Shibika: Right. Every bit of it. Every bit of it changed because, like you use your hands to do everthing, you know, in your daily routine, from sleeping to eating to everything, so basically, yeah, and it was initially it was really frustrating because for everything, even while getting up from bed, to going to the bathroom as you said, or eating by yourself, I needed help. I needed assistance.But then I just tried to do it by myself because it's not like to call my mom, or call somebody for every small pain you know, to help me, so I tried to do it by myself or I used to use my left hand while doing it, so it was interesting, rather and I developed new hobbies because I had to be in bed the whole time so I couldn't really go out so I started dreading. I picked up reading. Fred: Really, what kind of hobbies?Shibika: Yeah, exactly, like reading. I used to read a lot and then I used to play video games a lot. I got really hooked after that, so I used to play video games and watch movies and stuff. Activities that did not require a lot of effort.Fred: So, on a daily routine, so for, could you eat your food at the same time, like breakfast, lunch, dinner? Could you eat regular food?Shibika: Yeah. I could eat regular food, but I had to eat it from my left hand. I had to brush my teeth from the other hand, and like anything, I couldn't really move one hand completely. It was tied to a sling that was tied across my neck so, I couldn't move that hand at all, and if anything required both my hands, like if I had to wash my face or something I had to ask my mom to do it for me.Fred: So how long did it take you to heal?Shibika: It took me a month and a half to actually be you know allowed... after a month and a half the plaster was opened and the sling was taken out and then I could actually move the hand. But after that, also the doctor advised me not to pick up any heavy luggage or not to put any strain on the hand.Fred: So, still today do you still have any constraints from your accident?Shibika: Not really constraints, but sometimes, like I can not go to the gym and I can't exercise the hands, or sometimes I forget that that hand was injured so I can't really put a lot of weight on that hand still.Fred: I'm really glad that you're healthier now and that you can start living your life normally.Shibika: Thank you, Fred.

        "transcript": "Todd: So, now Terry when you finish your bicycle ride at the end of the day, you go to a campground, so what do you do, I mean, you set up camp, I mean, and how to you take a shower, or brush your teeth, or?\nTerry: Oh, in this, as an example on this trip, I was staying mostly in state park in Washington, Oregon, and California. Almost all of the state parks that I stayed in had showers, so of course they have restrooms and all your basic facilities, as far as that goes, and as far as what I did, what we do in camp, or what I do in camp is, I usually pick up a newspaper during the day and I usually carry a novel with me so, part of what I do in the afternoon is just to relax and read the paper, or read a book, and then also in the afternoon, I work on my bike if I need to, just try and get ready for the next day, or unwind from that day.\nTodd: Ah, what time do you normally make dinner?\nTerry: Ah, it just depends on, usually 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock, something like that. I, when I'm on the road I tend to be the proverbial \"early to bed, early to rise.\"\nTodd: Sure. Like what things do you cook? Cause you probably don't want to carry a lot of food. Like what would be a typical meal that you would have?\nTerry: Um, you're absolutely right. You don't really want to carry a lot of access food because you're carrying a lot of weight anyway's. My, when I'm on the road, my bike probably weighs 45 kilos, so it's, that's a fair amount of weight to push up over a mountain range. Um, cook pasta for dinner, so some soup or something fairly simple. In groups you tend to buy more elaborate food, buy salad material and what not.\nTodd: Now, what do you actually prefer, doing the bicycle trip alone, or in a group?\nTerry: Well, they both have their good points. I think the main thing was just that, it just depends if you're interested in doing a trip when a trip is available. In this case, there was a trip that was available, going down the West Coast but it was in the month of September and I had to return to Japan and so, the timing just didn't work out out for me, and then I think lately, doing these trips solo has, is working out for me because I'm not training for the trips. Typically when you're going with a group, you have to be in shape when the trip starts so that you can keep up with the group, so this, this is working out for me, to do solo trips\nTodd: Oh, so you prefer the solo?\nTerry: Well, it kind of depends.\nTodd: OK. Well, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot for talking about your trips.\nTerry: Thanks I enjoyed it a lot.",

        "transcript": "Ayako: Hello, sales department. This is Ayako speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSam: Hi, Ayako, this is Sam from Events-4-U. I'm calling about the piano you want at your Christmas party next month.\n\nAyako: Oh, good. It would be a great surprise to have one there for our boss for the night. He can play and it would be a great addition for the party. Have you been able to source one?\n\nSam: Well, yes, I have, but …\n\nAyako: But what?\n\nSam: Well, we're going to either have an issue with the logistics or the budget, or possibly both.\n\nAyako: Oh dear.\n\nSam: Well, we've found a baby grand piano, as you requested, and it's available for the date you want.\n\nAyako: OK, great. So what's the issue? Is it too expensive?\n\nSam: No, it's within the budget you gave me, so everything there is OK. But it's too wide for the entrance doorway into the building.\n\nAyako: Oh, I see. So what are our options? Could we dismantle it outside and reassemble it inside?\n\nSam: Er, no. Unfortunately, you can't really do that with pianos. But don't worry, I'm sure we can find some inventive solution.\n\nAyako: Do you have any ideas?\n\nSam: Well, we could hoist it up to the first-floor balcony. The door there would be large enough to fit it through.\n\nAyako: Great. That sounds like a good plan.\n\nSam: That would work, though it would increase the cost considerably as we'd need a crane, an extension on the insurance policy and probably two to three additional people to manage getting it successfully into the building.\n\nAyako: Oh, I see. Well, we can definitely stretch the budget by about ten per cent, but we shouldn't go over that. If we exceed the budget by more than ten per cent, then other areas of the party budget will have to be cut. And we don't really want that.\n\nSam: OK, so this idea won't work then. Sorry if I wasn't being clear. The considerable budget increase I was referring to would add a further fifty per cent. You know, cranes are expensive.\n\nAyako: Oh … um … OK. So what other options do we have?\n\nSam: Well, how fixed are you on the piano being a baby grand? Would an upright piano be an option?\n\nAyako: Hmm. I don't know.\n\nSam: It would fit through the door on the ground floor and cause fewer problems. I've also got the option on a really nice white vintage upright piano, with black design work.\n\nAyako: OK. That sounds like it might work. Could you send me over some photos of it?\n\nSam: I'll do it now, together with the rental and delivery information and costs.\n\nAyako: Great. Thanks, Sam. Let me think about it and I'll call you back later today.\n\nSam: Sure, no problem. I'll wait for your call.",

I wasn't when I first arrived, because of all the excitement about being here, and everything, but since actually about a month and a half ago, my boyfriend came here for three weeks, three and a half weeks, and we went traveling around the rest of Japan, which I think is very important, if you're here, you got to do it and he was the perfect person to do it and we had loads and loads of fun, and since he's left, yeah, I've started to think about home a bit more, now living here is kind of just normal way of life and after the big excitement of having him here, you know traveling around everywhere, it's, I'm starting to think about him, my family, my friends and just you know when I ring him up they're all doing stuff that we used to do together, and it sort of makes you think about what it would be like to get home. I think I'm quite looking forward to going home now.\nTodd: OK, could you, this is very interesting. Could you describe your boyfriend? Like what kind of person is he? How did you meet?\nEli: We actually met in a club which he runs. He has two jobs. He runs a club in Bristol and he edits magazines for recycling in Bristol and Wales and writes articles about environmental recycling issues. Actually when he came to Japan, he managed to interview a few people here about it, and Japanese recycling isn't as strict as you think it is, um, yeah, but we met in his club and he is a friend of my brothers and we knew a lot of the same people, but it's cheesy to say but almost it was love at first site. I t took about half a year for us to get together, but we were sort of good friends before that and we've been together for two and a half years now. (That's a long time.) It's not really though. It's just zoomed by so quickly. Yeah, we live together now in England and sort of very happy. We never, we're one of these couples that never argue. We obviously have disagreements but there's never any sort of shouting involved. We like a lot of the same things. We like lots of different things as well. I think it's very important. You can't only be into the same things. I'm slowly turning his mind towards anime and computer games. I'm twisting, twisting him, but I do have to make it clear when any Final Fantasy games are out, that I have two boyfriends and he is only one of them.\n\nTodd: Wow. He sounds like a really interesting guy.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Eoin, when you finish playing your gigs, when your band is finished, so then is it you just sit back and have drinks with the people and you know hit it up. Eoin: Yeah, in an ideal world. I mean we certainly have drinks, but there are a few other things that we normally have to do, especially if we're playing away from home at a live house not close to where we are, where we've been invited as a guest band. We normally give out questionnaires to the people who've been watching.Todd: Wait a minute. You give questionnaires?Eoin: That's right.Todd: Like forms?Eoin: That's right.Todd: You ask people to evaluate you?Eoin: Yes and no. In fact the questionnaires that we give out, most of the questions are completely meaningless, like just sort of jokey questions about whether you like ramen, which is a kind of Chinese noodle soup or some other things like that, but basically the reason we give it out is the question at the bottom which says if you are... if you enjoyed the performance and would be interested in seeing this band again, please write your e-mail address.Todd: Yeah, right.Eoin: So that's the real aim of giving out questionnaires, so if we get the e-mail addresses of the people, then if we come and play at that place again, or that city again, we can send out an e-mail to all of the people who said they were interested in coming again, and hopefully a few of them will come and that way the owner of the live house is also happy cause a few more customers are coming in.Todd: Oh, right. Eoin: So even if we weren't to get any addresses, at least if they owner sees us giving out the questionnaires, he's thinking, ah, there's a chance they'll bring some more people this next time than they did the last time, and so it makes him more likely to invite us back.Todd: Wow, you know, being in a band sounds like a lot of work. Eoin: It is. Yeah. It's tiring.Todd: It's like a job.Eoin: It is and I already have a job so it's like extra tiring, but it's enjoyable you know, like the creative aspect of making music and also performing, it is very enjoyable even though, as you said before, it's pretty short, the actual performance.",

What do you think?Akane: It is a tough call but I personally prefer to rent.Todd: Really? So why would you rather rent?Akane: Well, because there’s just no extra costs. You don’t have to pay for extra things like maintenance and just keeping up your home. When something gets broken you don’t have to pay to get it fixed. Property tax is already included, things like that.Todd: Yeah but if you own a home I mean first of all I think the biggest reason is you’re not throwing money away, it’s a solid investment. You can actually make a profit on the home later on.Akane: That’s true but with this day and age you really never know when you’re going to lose your job or if you’re going to have to move for job reasons and for that reason I think that if you’re stuck with a mortgage and you lose your job then you won’t be able to pay it and what if you can’t sell it?Todd: That’s a good point actually but you could always rent the house out, right, so… One common thing that rich people all have is that they own property and they own real estate. So you could just rent it to someone else.Akane: Well that’s a good idea but still I think that’s a lot of work for somebody as busy as me and I’m not a rich person.Todd: That’s how you get rich!Akane: Right! Well, I don’t think I could be bothered with the hassle of renting to somebody and first you have to find someone to rent it and then you have to make sure that they pay the rent and then you have to make sure that things are fixed It’s too much of a headache for me.Todd: That’s a good point. You know, actually I think the main reason why I would ever want to own a home is because you could have a dog. Akane: Oh that’s a great reason; I love dogs.Todd: When you rent a house often they won’t allow you to have a pet.Akane: That’s true. Well you can have a cat or fish and maybe a hamster.Todd: True, but if you’re a dog lover its not the same thing.\nAkane: I guess so.",

My grandmother knows it but I don't. And especially for dinner we have a special arrangement in the table, like seven ... well, seven is a lucky number so seven types of dishes and then we got like money from our elders.Todd: You get money?Santi: Yes, we get money but we don't get presents. We get money.Todd: So when you get this money, what do you normally do with it? Like do they give you money and are you supposed to, like buy gifts, or are you supposed to put it away for savings?Santi: I think they want us to just save the money in case like for rainy days and then ... but most of my cousins just spend it for buying things like clothes, bags, shoes, but in my family it's kind of different, so whenever I get money I just give it to my mother.Todd: For your mom to keep for herself or for your mom to save for you?Santi: I don't know. I'm not very good at money so it's better for me to just give it to my mother and she will allocate it.Todd: Well, actually, I think that's also a Chinese tradional also in the United States where I think that Chinese families, isn't it custom for children actually to give their parents a portion of their money?Santi: YesTodd: Which is actually, I think makes a lot of sense.Santi: Well, because we trust our mother. We trust our parents beyond reason sometimes and I think it's good.Todd: So always give a little money up?Santi: Yes.Todd: I agree. I agree. Although I hope my mom's not listening. She's gonna expect some money from me.Santi: And I feel better whenever my mom just gives me money to spend it ... not my ... just my entire money and then I spend it.

        "transcript": "Adam: Sarah, I heard you worked in reality TV. Can you tell us a little bit about that? \nSarah: Yeah. When I was living in Orlando, Florida, I worked for a production company that filmed reality television. And first of all, it was an interesting job because I worked from 7 o’clock at night until 5 in the morning. It was me and four other guys. And I was the only person who hadn’t been to film school that was working there. \nAnd overnight we would transcribe video footage. So what we would do is we would watch the extended footage of the reality shows that this company produced, and we would type out everything that they were saying. And I quickly came to realize that everything in television is scripted, even reality television because they would often prompt the people what to say on the shows. \nAdam: Interesting. Was the producer there on camera prompting them to say things that you saw but we as viewers might not see? \nSarah: Oh yeah. So all the producers and the staff are all around and in-between takes, you know, they’ll try to get them to say things a certain way. And so they’ll often retake scenes over and over again until they get the kind of footage that they want. \nAdam: Interesting. Can you tell us what TV show you were filming? \nSarah: No, I probably can’t say that. \nAdam: How did you get a job like that if you didn’t have the same filming background that your colleagues had? \nSarah: I grew up in radio, so because I had radio, media on my resume, they hired me. \nAdam: Were you interested in reality TV before you got that job? \nSarah: Not at all. I was just trying to pay rent and pay my bills. So actually at that time, I was working five different jobs. That was just one of them. \nAdam: Wow! That’s amazing. Pulling all-nighters as well. \nSarah: Yup. \nAdam: Was there a reason that you had to work at night? \nSarah: That particular job, that’s what they hired me for because they had people who did that job during the day, too.\nSo we were the night shift. \nAdam: So that’s really interesting.              So when you watch reality TV show today, how do you feel? Can you sense what the producers are trying to do or can you enjoy it? How do you feel about watching reality TV now?\nSarah: I never really liked reality television before I worked with reality television. And now, I like it even less because I realized it is all fake and all scripted, and it’s not very interesting to me. \nAdam: How did the actors or the members of the reality TV show casts, how did they feel about this scripting of the TV show? \nSarah: They seem to be fine with it because they, you know, signed all the contracts and the things to be on the show. So they don’t really mind it. \nAdam: Wow. That’s really interesting.",

        "transcript": "The first item in the news today is the recent elections that took place across the country. This was a crucial vote, which may see a dramatic change in how the country develops over the coming years. Overall, a 54.5 per cent voter turnout was registered. This represents an increase of 11 per cent over the previous election and six per cent above the average for the past 50 years. There has also been a slight change in demographics, with an increase in youth turnout in the 18- to 24- and 24- to 29-year-old brackets. Despite this increase, young people are still less likely to vote than older people; 84 per cent of voters in the 70 plus age group came to the polling stations.\n\nMoving on, the global digital powerhouse ONK today posted quarterly results which were above forecast. Back in March, Tim Bolling, CEO, issued a profit warning over fears that there would be losses following the recall of their leading product, the 40d device. In fact, the company posted quarterly revenue of US$14.8 billion which represents an increase of 11 per cent from the same quarter a year ago. They also announced that they had sold 21 million 40d devices over the quarter. The company has provided the information that with this level of revenue, there will be a gross margin of 34 to 35 per cent, ultimately leading to a US$1.20 per share cash dividend awarded to shareholders.\n\nAnd in our final news item we ask, will we soon be saying goodbye to coins and notes forever? The nationwide trend of using cashless payment options is increasing. There are a number of reasons for this development. A key reason for this is a growing interest in reducing the number of items people need to leave their homes with. As almost everyone carries a smartphone with them, and many people also have smartwatches, the ability to pay for things using one of these two technologies is particularly appealing. More and more retailers are accepting cashless payments and in some cases they've stopped accepting cash altogether.",

Spiders is OK.Todd: Oh, really, you don't mind snakes?Katia: Mm-hm.Todd: See I think snakes are much freakier.Fred: Yeah, I think snakes can be pretty freaky as well, but I think centipedes are scary because of the fact that if they bite you, then it becomes dangerous.Katia: And you never know where they are, and they're small. You don't know where is the front, where is the back, and all the legs \"sch-sch-sch-sch\".Todd: I know. I know.

I used to be really afraid of cockroaches. I thought they were the most disgusting little insects, but living here, they're just everywhere, that you kind of get used to them and sure, no problem anymore. I don't feel so uncomfortable around them.Todd: Wow!Katia: Nature is smart. There's always a reason why cockroaches exist, why spiders exist.Todd: That's true.Fred: Oh, thats a good point. Spiders in your house will take care of the cockroaches, but the cockroaches will take care of the smaller spiders, or the smaller little pieces of food that might be on your floor or little things.Katia: There you go.Fred: It's the chain.

I need a study group, in a big way.\n\nBea: Me too.\n\nAli: Do you think we have enough people here for a study group? I mean, there are only four of us …\n\nBea: Sorry. Three of us. Chris can't do study group. Right, Chris?\n\nChris: Yeah, there's no way I can do a study group. I have an assignment and then I'm too busy. But I'll stay for this first meeting.\n\nAli: Should we try and get another group together with us for this?\n\nBea: No, I don't think so. I think three is fine. Ideal size, really.\n\nDina: Me too.\n\nAli: OK, three people then. Four people for the first meeting. What next?\n\nBea: What about a meeting place? We can't meet here in the library …\n\nAli: It's not too bad, especially if those other people would go away.\n\nBea: But we can't exactly ask them to leave, and people might get annoyed with us talking.\n\nDina: Can I say something here?\n\nAli: Sure, go ahead.\n\nDina: There's a study hall next to the cafeteria. It's almost always empty. Could we meet there?\n\nAli: A study hall?! Who knew? Well, it sounds good to me.\n\nBea: Yeah. I've never been there but …\n\nAli: So, we ought to decide how long for and how often.\n\nDina: I read somewhere that you should make the meeting at the same time each week. Like a seminar. That way we'd take it more seriously.\n\nBea: We may as well make it for this time since we're all here. Is this time OK?\n\nDina: Works for me.\n\nAli: Me too.\n\nChris: Hang on just a minute. I know I'm not going to be in this group, but aren't we supposed to have a seminar at this time every other week?\n\nDina: Umm, no.\n\nBea: Thursday, no? \n\nAli: No, that's on Thursday. \n\nChris: Sorry. Forget I said anything.\n\nAli: Don't worry about it.\n\nBea: So everyone agrees that this time is fine? Every week?\n\nAli: How long should we make it?\n\nBea: An hour?\n\nDina: Could we find a way of making it two hours?\n\nAli: Two hours seems a bit like … too much. To start with then?\n\nBea: Ninety minutes? Compromise?\n\nAli: Is that OK with you, Dina?\n\nDina: Fine by me.\n\nAli: OK, so I guess all we have left to decide is exactly what we'll do when we meet. The final exam is a way off. I guess we could review our notes, or practise learning things by heart.\n\nDina: I have a list of dos and don'ts actually that I got online. I could be a moderator, and we could use the ideas as a starting point …",

Generally, I like all types of music apart from country music. \nTodd: I'm the same way. I hate country except for Johny Cash.\nMatt: Yeah. The older country is good but the newer, I don't like the newer stuff.\nTodd: Yeah. How expensive are CDs in your country?\nMatt: Well, a brand new CD is probably between about 15 and 20 dollars. Yeah, but you can find used CDs from anything to a dollar to.. you know, 20 dollars I guess,  depending on the CD. So you can find cheap CDs. \nTodd: Wow, that's pretty cheap. Do you play a musical instrument?\nMatt: No, I don't. Although, when I was a kid I played the piano and a little bit of the guitar but I've long since forgotten all of that.\nTodd: Usually, you pick up the guitar and you don't \n                          stop playing it.\nMatt: There was no talent.\nTodd: Do you go to concerts?\nMatt: I go. I really enjoy going to concerts but I like to go to small venues. Small shows. I don't like those big stadium shows where you need binoculars just to see the stage. \nTodd: Yeah, I agree. And the last question, most importantly, do you sing in the shower?\nMatt: Of course I do. Yeah, every chance I get. \nTodd: Wow, what kind of songs do you sing?\nMatt: Oh, wow! I guess anything that's in my head, the last thing I heard I guess. \nTodd: Can you sing something right now? \nMatt: I don't think so. This isn't a shower.",

Is it a nice shopping center?Rebecca: Yeah, it is quite nice. They have a juice bar there which is really, really good. We need fresh fruit, so that was really good. I tried an apple and pineapple juice and it was delicious.Todd: So, actually, at this juice bar, they actually make the juice fresh right there?Rebecca: Yeah, they do. Right in front of you. They use a big industrial juice mixer.Todd: Right. So there's no sugar or anything like that in the juice?Rebecca: From what I can see, no. Only natural sugar from the fruits.Todd: Well, that's good. That's good. Well, as for the shopping center, what did you think? Is it a nice place?Rebecca: Yeah, it is nice. A lot of shops. The majority of shops were clothing shops, though so if you're interested in buying new clothes, then definitely go.Todd: Well, I am but, you know, usually shopping centers are mainly for women. Did they have lots of men's clothes?Rebecca: I didn't really notice that much. I was just shopping for myself, so there were a lot of women's clothing so, maybe small sections might have been men.Todd: Oh, right. Well, what about the prices? Was it pretty cheap?Rebecca: It was because it was on sale because of the new opening. Hopefully after it opens up, it should be OK still.Todd: Well, did you buy anything?Rebecca: Yes, I bought... What did I buy? Two t-shirts, which were on special so that was a bargain.Todd: Yeah, well, I definitely need some shirts myself so I think I'm going to head down there this weekend.Rebecca: Yeah, you should go.

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Eli, you're young and you're into Manga, so I take it you like video games?\nEli: Mm-hm, I do very much. It's my other hobby. Um, almost an obsession sometimes. I think my friends get quite worried about me sometimes, the amount I play, but yeah I've always since I've been little liked computer games. I think my dad on his old macintosh forced us into it originally, so I blame it all on him, but that sort of developed into obviously in my field that I do which is animation. It's very close connected to it, and I'd like to maybe work making computer games one day, uh.\nTodd: What's a really good game? What do you think is the best game?\nEli: My favorite games are I think a split between two, the Final Fantasy series, which is a spread of lots of different games which are RPG which are role playing games, where you are, you're a character, or party of characters and you run around talking to people, discovering things, fighting battles, lots and lots of puzzles, lots of secrets. That's what I like.\nTodd: Is the setting now or the future or the past?\nEli: The setting's always in some fantasy world, but you don't know about. That's kind of, that's one of the nice things about computer games, it's almost escapism. You can escape the reality of the real world and go and run around in some fantastical world I mean, now that the graphics and computer games are getting so advanced it really does feel like your going into a new world of your own actually,and that you're there running around, so yeah, that's great and I think my other favorite game would have to be the SIMS series, which is,\n                                started with SIM city, which is a little city building game, where you're the mayor of the city.\nTodd: You're the mayor!\nEli: You're the mayor of the city and you have to build up your city over hundreds of years and advance it, and then from that they made the SIMs which actually goes into the houses and you control the lives of the little SIM people in the houses. It's almost like playing dolls houses, but very, very advanced and they have their own wants and needs and they fall in love and they go to work and it's basically just determining the destinies of your little character and furnishing their houses at the same time, which is always fun.\nTodd: Wow, what a game! So actually, shows how old I am, you said, \"computer games!\" So you don't say video games anymore?\nEli: Well, the SIMS and SIM City, I mean the first SIM City series I played on, probably the Mac had only just got a hard drive, um, really old when I was about, sort of seven or eight, even younger than that, so yeah, those PC games, mac games, and also video games, video games are Play Station, the ones that you play on the TV.\nTodd: Which to you prefer a play station or an actual arcade game to play on?\nEli: Uh, I never actually got into arcade games, cause you got to put money in to play them so, and I don't\n                                think my, our parents ever wanted us to sort of waste money like that so.\nTodd: What kind of player do you have: a play station?\nEli: I have a play station, and a Dreamcast, and an X box, and a Game Cube, and an N64 and a Gameboy\nTodd: Wow, I don't even know what those are.\nEli: And a PC!",

They are very happy and very fun, and very welcoming people even though Indians are poor, many Indians are poor, they're still very nice, and when you go to Indian, India, the Indians welcome you there, and they're very happy that you're in their country, and you feel this happiness and it makes you happy, and it's a great place. \n\n                                India is full of surprises. When you are in India you see many things that are very shocking and very strange to your culture. For example, the cow is a very holy animal there. It's part of the religion so you don't eat meat in India, and the cows are allowed to go free and go wherever they want, so maybe when you are driving down the street there will be a cow standing in the middle of the road and you have to drive around him, so this is very, very strange sight. You'll never see a cow in New York city, but you will see a cow in the middle of New Delhi city and it's very surprising at first, and maybe another strange site are the holy men, the Indian Sadus or Indian holy men. \nThey give up everything. They give up their family, they give up all their belongings. They give up their car, their money, and they just wonder around the country, from religious site to religious site, and they beg for their food and they beg for money to take the bus, and they all wear orange, orange robes and many of them have big long beards and long hair, and they are very distinctive looking, and their very wonderful people, very kind and very nice, and they're very, their inner strength for their religion and for life is very strong and you learn a lot from these people, and you learn a lot from India",

        "transcript": "Teacher: Are you all sitting comfortably? We’re going to do a short quiz called ‘What kind of student are you?’ I want you to listen carefully and think about your responses. Then I want you to write your answers in your notebook. Please be sincere! Nobody is going to look at your answers. When we complete the quiz I’ll read out the results and you can think about them carefully for a few minutes in private. You need a pen and a blank page in your notebook. OK, pay attention, please.\n\nOne. When do you usually get to school?\na) Early, you like to have extra time ‘just in case’ something crops up.\nb) You always turn up just in time, as the bell rings.\nc) You often get to school late, out of breath from rushing.\n\nTwo. When do you usually do your homework?\na) As soon as you get it. The same evening.\nb) A day or two before you have to hand it in.\nc) The same day you hand it in. Sometimes it’s late.\n\nThree. What is your average mark in tests?\na) You usually do well and get seventy-five per cent or higher.\nb) You usually pass tests but your marks are near to fifty or sixty per cent.\nc) Your marks are often below fifty per cent.\n\nFour. What kind of a relationship do you have with the staff at school?\na) Great! You get on well with most of the academic staff.\nb) Not bad. You have a good relationship with some members of staff.\nc) Dreadful. In general you don’t get on with teachers.\n\nFive. Where do you usually sit in class?\na) Usually at the front so you can see the board easily.\nb) Somewhere in the middle so you can daydream unnoticed.\nc) Near the back so you can turn on your mobile without being seen.\n\nSix. What do you want to do when you finish school?\na) Carry on studying at university or college.\nb) You don’t know yet. It depends on your exam results.\nc) Look for a job and start earning your own money. You’ll be fed up with studying by then.\n\nOK. Now look at your answers and count the number of As, Bs and Cs. Then I’ll read out the results. Are you ready?\n\nIf you have mostly As, you are an exceptional student. You are mature and you have a superb attitude towards your studies. You definitely grasp the importance of a good education.\nIf you have mostly Bs, you are an average student, but you are capable of much more and it isn’t too late to improve and become an excellent student. You just need to make a few changes to your habits.\nIf you have mostly Cs, you really need to adjust your outlook. You waste your time and you are at risk of finishing school without any qualifications. Think about your behaviour and consider making some changes before it’s too late.",

Nice. \nKevin: In the United States.\nTodd: Wow, were you born in Phoenix?\nKevin: Actually, no. I was actually born in New York because my parents happened to be living in New York at that time . My father was a Major League baseball player and the year I was born, 1971, he was playing with the Mets in New York City. My birthday is in May, May 25th to be precise, and so my mother happened to be with my father in New York because it was baseball season. So I was actually born in New York but I grew up in Phoenix. Phoenix is what I consider to be my home town. \nTodd: Wow! That's amazing. Do you remember anything about New York?\nKevin: Yes. Actually, I do have a few memories because we spent probably three years there from the time I was born. Obviously, until I was about two and a half or three years, we spent the summers or the baseball season in New York. We rented a condominium on the second floor and I remember it was right across the street from La Guardia Airport. Of course, when I was a little kid, one and two years old, I used to love sitting by the kitchen windows.  I even remember it was a bay window, the kind where you can roll the window open. I used to roll the window open and just watch the airplanes take off and land all day. \nTodd: Wow! That's cool.\nKevin: Another memory I have is the people, the couple that lived below us was an elderly couple and they acted pretty much like our grandparents.  I actually called them Grandma and Grandpa. Grandma Stevenson used to give me a bath in her kitchen sink because I was so small.\nTodd: Wow!\nKevin: That she would actually give me a bath in her kitchen sink and I remember that as well.\nTodd: Wow, those are good memories.",

What is strong?\n\t\t                  Matt: Austrian coffee.\n\t\t                  Todd: Yeah, Austrian coffee is strong. Can you get Austrian coffee in Japan?\n\t                      Matt: Well, I'm not sure. They serve Viennese coffee. Which is supposed to be from Vienna, but when you go to Vienna, the coffee there is just small strong coffees. Viennese coffee in Japan has like cream on top and things like that, so it's like a new take on Austrian coffee.\n\t                      Todd: Wow, that's bizarre. OK, what is weak?\n                          Matt: What is weak? English coffee, I suppose. The English aren't really very good at making coffee compared to other people, other countries in Europe, so yeah, English coffee is generally weak.\n                          Todd: OK, well it's the same in America, so. Alright, what is heavy?\n                          Matt: Metal. \n                          Todd: Metal!\n                          Matt: Yeah, as in the music.\n                          Todd: Oh, OK. Do you listen to heavy metal music?\n                          Matt: I used to. I used to be in a rock band when I was at college, and it was kind of punk, heavy metal, but I used to listen to a lot, not so much anymore.\n                          Todd: Did you play?\n                          Matt: I was the singer.",

Almost, about one week after I quit smoking, I quit drinking.\n\nTodd: Wow! No more? No beer? No wine with dinner?\n\nAl: No.\n\nTodd: Nothing?\n\nAl: No.\n\nTodd: Never?\n\nAl: Nothing, never.\n\nTodd: Have you even had a little bit since you quit?\n\nAl:No, I can't have a little bit. It's all or nothing for me so.\n\nTodd: Wow!\n\nAl: Yeah, nothing at all.\n\nTodd: That's pretty tough to do. Well, I mean, you seem pretty happy, I mean.\n\nAl: I'm very happy.\n\nTodd: OK. So what, why did you stop drinking? Why do you think it's better not to drink any alcohol?\n\nAl:I don't, I mean, I'm not against drinking the way I am against smoking. I knew that for me it was the best thing to do because drinking is getting in the way of other things I wanted to do with my life.\n\nTodd: Right.\n\nAl: So, and I didn't really, I drank a lot and I didn't enjoy it anymore.\n\nTodd: Yeah.\n\nAl: That was the thing.\n\nTodd: Actually, I have to feel a little bit the same way. I'm a social drinker. I only drink when I'm with friends and I really don't like drinking because I don't like how it makes me feel afterwards, like if I have a glass of wine or beer, I can't work afterwards and that bothers me but its nice to have a glass of wine with a good meal.\n\nAl: It is. Yes. There are things I miss about it but there are so many other good things that I've got from not drinking so I look at the balance and the sacrifice and for me it's worth it, not to drink. I can give up a glass of wine with dinner if get the other things I've got from it, so.\n\nTodd: Well, do you feel healthier? Does you body feel better?\n\nAl: I feel much healthier. I feel much more focused. My thinking is much clearer, and I like, I still go to bars and hang out with people and they drink and I don't and I go home, I love leaving a bar when I'm still sober. I love that feeling. I don't know why it's a fantastic feeling.\n\nTodd: Well, sounds like something maybe I should consider. \n                                            Thanks Al",

I've been meaning to come in and find some information about here for some time. I was wondering if you could help me?\n\nReceptionist: Sure, of course. What would you like to know?\n\nCustomer: I saw on the sign outside that you have the best budget membership in the city. Is that right?\n\nReceptionist: You've got that right, yes. If you find a better rate, then we'll match it. Also, we don't have any sign-up fees or cancellation fees.\n\nCustomer: Sorry, what was that last bit?\n\nReceptionist: Cancellation fees. Some gyms charge you money if you leave before a minimum number of months or something like that. We don't do that.\n\nCustomer: That's useful to know. Ummm, what times do you have?\n\nReceptionist: We open at 5 a.m. and close at midnight.\n\nCustomer: Not 24 hours then, I see.\n\nReceptionist: No. Almost, though! We tried doing the 24-hour thing, but there really weren't a lot of people who wanted to do exercise at 2 in the morning.\n\nCustomer: Makes sense. Another question: do you have trainers? Like, will you do a personalised evaluation of me?\n\nReceptionist: Sure we do. As we say on our brochure, we can show you what to do, how to do it and why you're doing it. Have you worked with a personal trainer before?\n\nCustomer: Err, no. No, I haven't. No.\n\nReceptionist: So, it's very easy. For your first visits we'll assign you one of our expert personal trainers. He or she will design an exercise plan that's just right for you and show you exactly what to do. We even include nutrition advice in the plan.\n\nCustomer: Let me get this straight. All of this is included in the price?\n\nReceptionist: Yes, it is. If you want to continue with your trainer after the first few classes, we can talk about that. It does cost extra though. OK?\n\nCustomer: Yeah. Sounds ... great.\n\nReceptionist: Do you have any other questions?\n\nCustomer: Hmmm, yeah. Um, OK. Why should I choose here instead of any of the other gyms in the city?\n\nReceptionist: What, you mean apart from our competitive rates and personalised attention?\n\nCustomer: Yeah, I guess.\n\nReceptionist: Listen, here's a free day pass. Why don't you drop by and see for yourself? That way you can talk to other members, see the facilities and our staff.\n\nCustomer: OK, I'll do that. Thanks very much!",

If it's something I really like, sometimes I can't put it down and I just keep playing it and I finish it in a few days and sometimes, well, it's alright but I can't get myself to keep playing it so sometimes it can take me a few months to finish a game.Lindsay: Oh, OK. So do you think you're a very skillful video game player?Jake: No, I'm pretty bad sometimes, especially at the newer games. I'm better at the old ones.Lindsay: One final question, do you think it's more important to beat the actual video game or when you're playing with someone to beat the person that you're playing with?Jake: What do you mean?Lindsay: So, you know, when you're friend comes over and you're both playing the video games together and you're competing against one each other, or is it better to actually like beat the video game itself? Does that make sense? Don't you usually against your friend?Jake: Yeah, sometimes I play against my friends, but it seems like there's less goal to it when you're playing against someone else. You win sometimes and you lose sometimes, but once you finish the game, then you can feel like you've accomplished something.Lindsay: Oh, OK. Have you ever been so addicted to a game, and then you finished it and you were disappointed because you liked the game so much?Jake: Actually, that happens a lot. Sometimes you finish a game that you really like and you wish there were more games that you could keep playing it.Lindsay: OK, that happens to me but that's when I am reading a book, or yeah, usually when I'm reading a book or finish a long project but I can't imagine that happening with a video game.Jake: It's exactly the same as with a book or with a TV series or something else that you really enjoy.

Can you give me some advice or tips on things I should see or do?Alan: Yeah, sure Todd. I'd be happy to. There are a lot of things to do in Vancouver, especially in the summertime. I would recommend first you go to Stanley Park. It's one of the largerst and most scenic city parks in the world. There's a sea wall around the park that you could jog, go for a walk, and beaches. It's one of, it's high on the list of tourist attractions of Vancouver.Secondy I would reccommend you take a gondola up Grouse Mountain. From Grouse Mountain you can see the whole or mainland. It's a very good view from there, and there's a nice restaurant and gift shops up there and there's hiking trails and so on, mountain biking trails you can go on, in the summertime, of course in the winter, it's a ski area.Todd: Ah, sounds good. Hey, what about all the islands? Can I take a ferry to one of the islands?Alan: Yeah, you can take a ferry from Vancouver to Victoria located on Vacouver Island. It's about an hour an 35 minutes and in Victoria there's sights like the legislative buildings, because victoria is the provincial capitol. It has the legislative buildings, goverment buildings. Buchart Gardens which are world famous flower gardens, and of course if you drive out of Victoria on the highway up north you can see many small towns and places on vancouver island.Todd: Now to get around the city should I rent a car or should I just use public transportation?Alan: Well, it depends on where you want to go. I would, for the close sights, things like Stanley Park, even Grouse Mountain, the Canada Place, another attraction in downtown Vancouver, any of those close attractions you could use public transport. If you want to go out of Vancouver a little bit, maybe to the islands, or maybe you want to drive up to Whistler, which is only two hours away, I would recommend you rent a car, for the longer distances.Todd: OK, well, sounds good, man, I'm really excited about my trip. Alan: All right.",

You can already create a believable character on a computer and give it life and emotion, and he won't be asking for 10 million pounds a movie. He'll be free to create and he'll do exactly what you say, and he'll come to the set on time. He won't need to come to the set will he. He won't turn up on the set drunk is what I mean. He'll be just completely at your mercy to do whatever you want with.\nTodd: So, you're saying in the future, they'll just write a story and then just like animation, they'll just design the character and then have the movie with the background and everything.\n\nAl: Yeah. Actors will only be important for reference. Directors will go on back and look at great performances and copy them, or copy nuance and performance for there computer generated character. You'll need the voice actors for awhile, and then computers will be able to create the human voice, recreate the human voice, too.\nTodd: Are there any examples of movies, where this is actually happening now?\n\nAl: You look at Yoda. In Star Wars Episode III, Yoda is completely believable.\n\nTodd: And that's all computer graphics, it's not?\n\nAl:It's all computer, I think he's a puppet, I think in this one he was completely computer animated. It was a puppet for some of Episode II.\n\nTodd: Yeah. That's pretty impressive.\n\nAl: Yeah, and scary. Human will be unnecessary soon.",

        "transcript": "Dai: So Darren, it’s not long now until Christmas, are you looking forward to it?\nDarren: Yes and no. I do like Christmas, the spirit of Christmas, I believe it does bring people closer together, but the thing I find year upon year is becoming more and more tiresome for me is the pressure put on people, especially families with young children, to spend lots and lots of money. I think the true meaning of Christmas is lessening year upon year. \n                              \nDai: Right. What is the true meaning of Christmas then?\nDarren: Well I think it like I said it’s families getting together and people showing kindness to one another. I think that should happen all the time mind, but I think at Christmas people do get together and you see people and you wish them a Merry Christmas and it’s a really lovely atmosphere to be in over a couple of weeks over the whole Christmas period. That is what I really do enjoy about Christmas, but as I said I think it’s becoming too commercialized--too much pressure to buy the latest toy. There always seems to be the in-toy to have and I think people who could afford it: great, but I think a lot of the families really struggle at Christmas and they’re probably in debt for the next twelve months until the next Christmas. \nDai: Wow, it sounds like it would put a lot of pressure on families.\nDarren: Yeah, I think it does. That’s in general, but especially at Christmas I really do feel for some of the families who obviously are struggling with finances. I’d like that to not detract from what Christmas is really about which is a great time and we have got a fairly big family and we do do a lot of visiting and we have great times at Christmas and we probably do too much on the food and drink.\nDai: Food and drink: like what kind ... you know, what are your favorite bits about the food and drink?\nDarren: I always love Christmas dinner. The turkey is always cooked to perfection and wherever we go the cooking is usually absolutely spot on. No matter how much we eat of Christmas dinner, there’s always room left for a bit of Christmas pudding as well. \nDai: Christmas pudding?\nDarren: Yeah, it’s a very rich, fruit-based pudding which you can usually have with either brandy sauce, which is the only time of the year you ever eat brandy sauce, or with something like cream or custard. \nDai: Oh, OK. And what does it taste like then? \nDarren: It’s very, very rich. It’s one of those things where you either love it or you hate it. I think I’m the only one in my family who eats Christmas pudding, which is great news for me because it means I’ve got it all to myself, but I do suffer for it afterwards--very, very bloated and flake out on to the settee and one eye on the television and the other eye sleeping. \nDai: OK, yeah, it sound like a good time then.",

That's a long way.\nDevon: Yes, it was. It took three weeks. I did it as part of a tour with 10 other people. \nTodd: Man, that's a cool trip. That must of cost a lot of money. \nDevon: It did cost a lot of money but not a lot of people can say they have done that.  I looked in, I researched the trip several months before I actually took it. A friend and I did it together and there was one other American and the rest of the people were from Switzerland.\nTodd: OK. Cool! What was the landscape like?\nDevon: A lot of it was flat and for miles around you could see absolutely nothing and as you got into Siberia there was scattered trees. When we got into Mongolia you could see some Camels every once in awhile but besides that there was a whole lot of nothing.\nTodd: Wow! Just wild camels.\nDevon: Wild Camels around the drinking hole. Yes, saw that more than once. \nTodd: So how did you eat on this train?\nDevon: We stopped several times along the way and upon every platform you could buy food that local people were selling. A lot of it consisted of dried fish and other types of Russian delicacies and a lot of noodles that you heat it up with hot water. Every train had hot water on it on every carriage so you were always able to make noodles if you were desperate. \nTodd: So was this a luxurious train or was it a pretty basic...?\nDevon: It was pretty much the most basic you could get. There were no animals on board but sometimes they were coal-heated so it was very basic. \nTodd: Wow! Would you do it agian?\nDevon: Great question. Would I do it again? Yes, I would do it again but I would wait several years to do it. One because it does cost a lot of money and two because there are many other things to do, to see.\nTodd: OK.

        "transcript": "Todd: Rufei, you said that your education system is very strict and you study like 15 hours a day. \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: Okay so, if you were in charge would you keep the system the same way? \nRufei: It depends on the person. I think there should be a place that's as strict as my high school. You can choose to send your children to go there or if the students themselves, they want to go to that school, they can go. I think that's really, really motivative to student's to study hard because everybody do the same and they are trying their best to be the best. \nTodd: Wow. Yeah we have a phrase in English like, \"A rising tide lifts all boats\", and I think it's kind of the same. So if it's really rigorous for most people, it's gonna pull everybody up. \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: Rufei, you said that your education system is very strict and you study like 15 hours a day. \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: Okay so, if you were in charge would you keep the system the same way? \nRufei: It depends on the person. I think there should be a place that's as strict as my high school. You can choose to send your children to go there or if the students themselves, they want to go to that school, they can go. I think that's really, really motivative to student's to study hard because everybody do the same and they are trying their best to be the best. \nTodd: Wow. Yeah we have a phrase in English like, \"A rising tide lifts all boats\", and I think it's kind of the same. So if it's really rigorous for most people, it's gonna pull everybody up. \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: Okay. There's nothing you would change? Like if you were in charge would you give maybe a little more vacation time? Would you start the day later? Would you make classes smaller? \nRufei: If I can choose I will definitely don't choose my school because that was horrible for me because I need a lot of sleep than normal people, but I cannot have that much time to sleep. So I always sleep on the class, and when somebody found out that I am sleeping on the class they will decrease the score of my class. \nTodd: Oh, that's serious. \nRufei: Yes, very serious. Yeah, your teacher would punish you to write a paper like, \"I am sorry I decreased the score of our class, I shouldn't sleep on the class\", and I have to write it for like an hour to write that stuff. \nTodd: That is very harsh. \nRufei: Yeah. \nTodd: I think though a lot of people, when they hear stories like that they actually are a little bit envious, especially parents or teachers. Because in the rest of the world it's not that, students don't try that hard. \nRufei: Yeah. \nTodd: So that's kind of special, actually. \nRufei: Yeah, I think that's the special point of China. \nTodd: Wow. So, what time did you have to get up every day to get to school at 6:45? \nRufei: I have to get up at 6:00. \nTodd: Oh, well that was not too bad. That's pretty fast, you wake up at 6:00, you get to school by 6:45. \nRufei: Yeah, I can wear my clothes pretty fast and directly get on my father's car and eat on my father's car and put my socks on, on my father's car. \nTodd: Wow! Talk about streamlined, very mobile. That's great. What about the tests? It's really controversial in the US about standardized tests. Rather than just learning, the students often have to prepare for tests. In your country is there also a big movement just to have a lot of testing? \nRufei: We have a test each month, and we only do paper tests. The questions can be really difficult, yeah always very, very difficult. In my case, I'm in the middle ... \nTodd: Middle of the pack, as we say. \nRufei: Yeah, the middle of the pack. For mathematics, we have totally 150 scores and probably I can get 60 to 70. \nTodd: Wow, that's a big range. Do some students get 100%? \nRufei: No. \nTodd: No? \nRufei: If you get more than 120, you are really brilliant. So the question's always really, really difficult. \nTodd: Can the teacher get 150? \nRufei: I'm not sure. \nTodd: Well I have to admit, because even English teachers will tell you, and they're lying if they don't admit this, even on tests like the TOEFL, it's very hard for a teacher to get 100%. Not because of knowledge, but because of concentration. \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: Right? \nRufei: Exactly. We have a lot of questions and some of them, they are kind of tricky. \nTodd: Right. \nRufei: Yeah. \nTodd: So they mislead you a little bit. \nRufei: Yeah. \nTodd: Oh no, that's great. So you took all these courses, what was the course you were best at and the course you were worst at? \nRufei: English was my worst at. \nTodd: Oh no, your English is wonderful! Really? \nRufei: Yeah. \nTodd: Oh I disagree. \nRufei: It was. \nTodd: Oh, OK. How do you learn English in China? \nRufei: Actually, my speaking skills I gathered from my traveling, I did solo traveling last year. \nTodd: Wow, you've learned a lot, quickly. \nRufei: Thank you. \nTodd: That's great! That's really inspirational I think for a lot of the students that listen to this site. One year? \nRufei: Yeah. \nTodd: Fantastic. \nRufei: But the thing I have to mention about is, you have to know a lot of words. Before you start to speak English, you have to know what you know. Like you have to remember a lot of words, and then you can use it when you have to use it. \nTodd: Okay, right. So English was tough, not easy. \nRufei: Not easy, for everything you have to learn. Learning isn't easy and funny stuff for everyone. Starting is hard and it's kind of betray the human ... \nTodd: Spirit? \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: Wow, that's crazy. So how many students would be in an English class? I hear that China has huge English classes. Like there might be 100 students in one class. \nRufei: It can be, but it depends. In my high school we have the same class at the same classroom always, and in my university we have 30 students in my English. \nTodd: Oh okay, that's kind of normal. That's still a lot, for an English teacher that's a lot. Were your teachers usually Chinese, or an international teacher? \nRufei: Chinese teacher. \nTodd: Chinese teacher, okay. And so there was a big stress on grammar and vocabulary, things like that? \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: How about listening? \nRufei: We only do the audio listening test. So it's always the same pronunciation. \nTodd: Yeah, so you don't have a lot of variety of accents? \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: Yeah. Okay, well you have to introduce ELLO to China, the website. \nRufei: Yeah, cool. \nTodd: What was your best subject? \nRufei: My best subject was mathematics. \nTodd: Oh great. Yeah, that's impressive. I have a degree in economics and there's a lot of math. I went to a good school but I was not strong at math and I was terrible at physics. And physics and economics are kind of related, but not really, I did not do very well in physics. So how are you at physics? \nRufei: Actually I love all the math stuff, but also included physics, because you also have to use a lot of mathematics on your physics. For the physics you have to know the formula very well, then you can use it. If you don't know the formula very well, when the question is there you cannot ... \nTodd: Apply? \nRufei:  ... apply that. \nTodd: Yeah. Oh yeah, I agree, it's tough. I am very impressed with you because whenever I meet somebody who is good at math or physics, I have great admiration. My degree was math heavy, but math was not my strong point. \nRufei: So what was your strong point? \nTodd: That's a good question. I was never a good student at anything. How I got to a good university is actually surprising, but I was always middle of the road. Middle of the pack, as we said. Always B- student, in everything. \nRufei: I see. \nTodd: Yeah, I was not exceptional like you. \nRufei: You don't have to be very good at starting, but you can handle your life very easily. That's also an important thing for a human. \nTodd: That is true, I do agree with that. But I think if I was a student in China, I would be that Mister 2000.\nRufei: Yes.\nTodd: Okay. There's nothing you would change? Like if you were in charge would you give maybe a little more vacation time? Would you start the day later? Would you make classes smaller? \nRufei: If I can choose I will definitely don't choose my school because that was horrible for me because I need a lot of sleep than normal people, but I cannot have that much time to sleep.

        "transcript": "Todd: Okay, Christian, you were just telling me that you lived in New Zealand as an exchange student. \nChristian: That's right, in high school. Yeah. \nTodd: What was that like? \nChristian: I mean, I was 17 years at the time and I was leaving home for the first time and going abroad for a year without going home. And it was the first time to actually move out of my family and it was an intimidating experience, but at the same time, it was extremely enjoyable. I had a great time, traveled around, met a lot of great people, got introduced to the Maori culture and yeah, it was fascinating, really fascinating. Yeah. \nTodd: What did you like the most about New Zealand? \nChristian: The country itself, probably the nature and the wildlife. It's just so pure, so green. You've got the big mountains. You've got the fjords, the rivers. It's a great ecosystem. You can tell that it's non-polluted and it's just really nice. And if you appreciate - call it nature - you can walk around and just soak up the atmosphere. It's really good. \nTodd: Yeah. What was the hardest thing about living so far from home? \nChristian: The fact that I could only communicate with my family through faxes in the beginning because calling was a bit expensive and the circumstances didn't allow me to use a phone where I was living. So I had to use faxes and that is a bit strange. \nTodd: Wow. So there was no email or internet? \nChristian: Well, actually at the time email wasn't that much used in New Zealand. There was one computer in my school that had internet connection and I was allowed to use that because I was an exchange student. I was the only exchange student at my school. So they said, \"Well, you can come in every now and then and use it.\" But I used it maybe once a week because I had never used email before, because this was back in '97. So it's like eight, seven, eight years ago. And I guess, well, in New Zealand they didn't really have that many connections. So yeah. \nTodd: Great story. \nChristian: It was truly great. Yeah.",

While you were\n                      learning English, what are some shows you watched?\n                      Something I wanna tell my students they can watch.\nHana: My favorite all time is\n                      the TV drama called Friends.\nBen: Oh, yeah! Yeah.\nHana: Have you seen it before?\nBen: Friends is super popular in\n                      the U.S. Yeah, yeah.\nHana: It is, yes. I mean, first of all, I just\n                      love the story. \nBen: Okay.\nHana: Other than just learning\n                      English, it's second purpose, I guess. There was\n                      an Italian or there is a character who is playboy and he used to\n                      say like, \"How you doin'?\" Yeah? And, it's interesting is,\n                      first, I watched the drama with my first language subtitled. \nBen: Oh, right.\nHana: Yeah.\nBen: So, you're watching in\n                      English with your language in the subtitles?\nHana: Yes.\nBen: Okay.\nHana: So that I can understand\n                      the main concept first.\nBen: Right.\nHana: And then, gradually, I\n                      changed to English subtitles.\nBen: Oh, okay. That's a great\n                      idea! So, first, to understand the meaning of\n                      what's being said, subtitles. Then, to maybe watch\n                      it again a second time or even a third time to\n                      understand exactly how the English is used in\n                      context of the show.\nHana: True, yeah.\nBen: Okay, that's a great\n                      strategy.\nHana: That way you can enjoy\n                      just watching the movies or dramas and that way\n                      you can spend a lot more time, rather than just\n                      trying to study English. \nBen: Right, so it's more ... a\n                      way to enjoy learning English and studying.\nHana: Yes.\nBen: Actually, you know ... You\n                      said Friends, right?\nHana: Yep, yep.\nBen: So I think Friends is on\n                      ... It's so popular, right? And it's all over the\n                      internet. I believe it's on YouTube. You can watch\n                      it on YouTube and Netflix.\nHana: Netflix, yeah.\nBen: Yeah, Netflix. One thing\n                      that's great about YouTube, I think, is that they\n                      have a closed captioning or a subtitling option, so if you can't exactly\n                      catch what they're saying while you're listening\n                      the first time, you can put the subtitles on like\n                      you said.\nHana: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nBen: That's a great-\nHana: And there are so many\n                      websites that shows the transcripts of the ...\nBen: That's true. You can read\n                      the scripts from the show to follow along, as well.\nHana: Mm-hmm.\nBen: That's great. So you said\n                      you watch Friends, right?\nHana: I do.\nBen: Are there any others that\n                      you've heard of? Friends, I know is popular. Many\n                      people know Friends.\nHana: Full House.\nBen: Full House, yeah!\nHana: Full House, yes.\nBen: Okay, you know they\n                      recently did a revamp, a newer version it.\nHana: Yeah, they did. Yeah, I\n                      haven't seen it yet but, yeah, it's good. Good,\n                      good.\nBen: I haven't either. Well, you\n                      recommend either Friends or Full House.\nHana: One of my friends, he\n                      liked a drama called Prison Break.\nBen: Oh, that's on Netflix, as\n                      well.\nHana: Have you ever heard it?\n                      Yeah.\nBen: Yeah, I have.\nHana: He watched like 60 hours\n                      or more than that and I asked him, \"How's it\n                      going? Is it good?\" He did understand without\n                      subtitles, which is good. And so, I asked him, \"So\n                      you can speak English now, yeah? Can you use those\n                      phrases from the drama?\" And he said, \"Actually,\n                      not.\" I said, \"Why?\" It's because the words that\n                      they use from the drama. There's a bombing or\n                      escaping or something that's not daily life\n                      conversations, so that way Friends or Full House\n                      that people in daily life.\nBen: That's daily English. Yeah,\n                      daily life English.\nHana: Yeah, so I found it easier\n                      to use.\nBen: Okay, so you recommend-\nHana: Yeah, yeah.\nBen: Okay, yeah. That's great.\n                      Thank you so much. I think my students would love\n                      to watch that kind of drama and learn daily-\nHana: Daily, yes.\nBen: ... actual phrases you can\n                      use. Thanks so much for the tips. Thanks, Hana.\nHana: You're welcome.",

You can make your dream home, reasonable dream home. OK, what kind of house would you have?Mark: Well, I don't normally dream of like an enormous mansion, or anything. Just a nice, you know, medium to large size home. I guess almost more importantly for me is to have some land with the house, like I don't like, I wouldn't want my neighbor to be, you know, just three feet away from my house. I'd like to have a little bit of space.Todd: OK, so assuming you have a big yard and you have this space, you have land, what kind of landscape would you have?Mark: Well, I grew up in Alabama and I really like the landscape there. It's kind of hilly and lots of trees and lots of pine trees, you know, it’s a deciduous area of America, and lots of lakes so I guess, you know, that kind of setting, like a deciduous you know, lots of trees, lots of lakes, you know, or some water nearby and hills: things like that.Todd: OK, but actually, what would you want your yard to look like?Mark: Oh, I see.Todd: You don't want a lake, right?Mark: No, no, but, yeah, I don't know, I would want it to be taken care of, but not overly manicured, like I don't want it to be, you know, too much pruning, just, but I wouldn't want it to be completely wild either, so green but not like a just completely perfect square, or anything. I'd like for it to be a little bit, chaotic.Todd: OK, so what do you want: a big bathroom, small bathroom, big kitchen, small kitchen?Mark: Big bathrooms, big kitchen. Yeah. The bigger, the better!Todd: The bigger, the better.Mark: Yeah.Todd: Two car garage?Mark: Sure. That'll be fine. And actually the way the house is decorated, you know, if I'm married, my wife can decorate most of the house but I'd like to have one room that was my room, like that, you know, maybe I could put a small library and lots of books, maybe a pool table but one room that I got to do, you know, my own thing with.Todd: Yeah, man.

        "transcript": "Todd: Rufei, you are from China. In America, Chinese students have a reputation of being very hard-working. Is that true?                            \n                              Rufei: Yes, exactly. In my high school, in one class we have around 70 students in one class and everybody wants to be the top student, so everybody works so hard. I say my high school was kind of like a prison. You have to go to school every day from 6:35 AM to 9:40 PM. \nTodd: Really? That long? \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: That's over 12 hours; that's like 13, 14 hours a day! \nRufei: Yes, exactly. \nTodd: How did you feel as a student studying that much? \nRufei: Sleepy. \nTodd: I bet. \nRufei: Every day I'm so sleepy. \nTodd: I can imagine. Do you think it was productive studying that much? \nRufei: I think their purpose just like as to stay as much time as we can in the school and we cannot get distracted by other stuff, so we always stay at school and we always focus on our studying ... We cannot know anything about the outside of the wall from school. \nTodd: That's amazing. For such a long day, can you talk about the daily schedule? What was your schedule like everyday? \nRufei: From 6:50, we start to have class. From 6:50 until maybe 11:45; we have 45 minutes class and then 10 minutes break. We also have 30 minutes we have to do exercise on the playground and, in the afternoon, is the same routine. Then, we went to dinner around 6:00 to 7:00. From 7:00 to 9:40 we have to do our homework. \nTodd: So, you study at school? It's not homework, it's school work; you don't actually go home, right? \nRufei: Yeah. \nTodd: That's crazy. How many classes would you have every day? \nRufei: Eight classes. \nTodd: What were the subjects? \nRufei: We separate the subject. If you learn more Mathematics, we learn mathematics, English, and Chinese, and physics, chemistry, and biology. \nTodd: That's very rigorous. Did you enjoy all the subjects? \nRufei: Yeah. I love physics and biology and chemistry. \nTodd: Now you are training to be a doctor? \nRufei: Yeah. \nTodd: That's fantastic. Did you know you wanted to be a doctor when you were in high school? \nRufei: I kind of know because my father is a doctor and he was kind of forcing me to study medicine. \nTodd: Nice. We have a phrase in English; we say, \"Follow in your father's footsteps.\" You definitely are following in your father's footsteps. That's great. Is your mother a doctor? \nRufei: My mother is a businesswoman now. \nTodd: Okay, great. You had all these courses. In America, there's a big controversy about tests, that the kids take too many tests; it's too test driven. What about in China? Do you have a lot of tests? \nRufei: Yeah, I have test every month. They will make a list of every single person; how much score you got in this test- \nTodd: Whoa. They rank everybody to see- \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: That's very competitive. \nRufei: Yeah. I think that's kind of bad for our emotion. \nTodd: Yeah, so it creates a lot of stress. \nRufei: Yeah. We have 2000 students in one grade. \nTodd: That is crazy. So, you can be number 2000, you can be the lowest student? \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: And they put that out there? \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: Really? They could never do that in America. \nRufei: Yeah, I think so. \nTodd: Oh my gosh. Do you think that's a good idea? \nRufei: Depends on the person. \nTodd: Right; yeah. Wow. You have a lot of pressure. Did you feel pressure from your parents, from your peers, from your teachers? \nRufei: Yeah. \nTodd: Who gave you the most pressure? \nRufei: Myself. \nTodd: That's good. \nRufei: I don't want to be lazy. I don't want to be worse, so I have to always work hard to chasing other people ... Everybody wants to be the best, so everybody worked really, really hard. Even we have breaking time, they don't break at all. \nTodd: Seriously? \nRufei: Yes. \nTodd: What do they do during the break? \nRufei: They do questions. \nTodd: Wow. They quiz each other? The students quiz each other or they just do homework? \nRufei: They do their homework and they find out what problem they've had and they solve the problem with teachers or other students. They just starting all day; they can't do that. \nTodd: That's amazing. Kids do this 14, 15 hours a day? \nRufei: Yeah. \nTodd: Wow. That's really good for China! \nRufei: We don't have that much summer vacation and winter vacation. In winter vacation, we have two weeks because of the Chinese New Year; it's about two weeks off. We have two weeks in winter vacation and one week summer vacation only. \nTodd: Is that enough? \nRufei: Of course not. Even we have vacation, the teacher would give us a lot of homework to do. \nTodd: That is very impressive. \nRufei: This is very not good experience. \nTodd: We'll talk about that in the next interview; I think that's a very interesting point.",

We go by car to Laos and then on the way back, then we drive back on to the Seven. Then we saw on the news on television that like the \"tsunami\" hit on the west coast and first we thought like we watching the documentary, that it is somewhere else, not in Thailand but then suddenly it is getting more serious and then ... it's a really sad story ... and 26 it happened and 27, because living not really far away from Phuket and also I really want to go and help them. But then my Dad didn't allow me because they say the 27 it gonna have the aftershock, so we wait until the 28th. And then my uncle, my Dad's friend, he have a small company and he really want to help so brought two vans, with one van full of food, like lunchbox for maybe 300 packs, and then lots of necessary stuff like the medicines or water and all those kinds of stuff. So we drove to Phuket and then tried to, you know, distribute all the food as much as we can, even though we have no idea where we are. actually that time there were not many volunteers still, so we were following ... follow with the other radio staff, local radio staff who really want to help as well. So we went up into the hills, where the people move up because they are afraid of the \"aftershock\". So we went there and then there were, like, our villagers around 210 people who were waiting for food because they ... they were living there without any food or water for two days already. So we went there, like, try to provide as much as we can, like all the food that we had and then it was very sad because what you see, it's like nothing from T.V. you know.",

Ivan: Well, I think maybe most Indonesians will say that it’s Bali, but as for myself I think that, yeah I think the most favorite one is the island where I was born, Bangka Island because, I don’t know, it’s just that it is a nice feeling if you’ve been to the place where you were born and then you just get the feeling that… you, I mean like, you get to know the real you. Todd: Right. Ivan: Yeah, and that’s the most important thing that I have. And recently I went there after, like, 15 years and then, really, I felt that kind of thing. I felt that this is my roots of myself and even though I stayed in Jakarta for the past 12 years or so but really being there is really my home. Todd: Ah, you went home for the first time in 15 years? Ivan: Yes, that’s true. The last time I went there was like, well it’s not 15 years, but actually the last time I went there’s like in ’95 so it’s like 12 years. Todd: That’s a long time ago. Ivan: Yeah, it’s a really long time ago. But you know what, I have a driver over there and then when I went there in the last holiday I came to see him. And it’s just so nice to see… well, he’s getting older of course, he’s really old like 70 years or so but he still remembers me and how do I behave when I was a child and all. Like, I was hard to eat something and he had to take me around to make me finish my food. He still remembers the small things and it’s really giving me, like, a recall to my past and get to know who I am, who I was when I was small, so...",

        "transcript": "Note: This is a continuation of a conversation about student learner types from conversation 1289.  \nTodd: Yeah, but next time you teach, when you look at your students, think about it.\nJulia: I will, yeah.\nTodd: Who's a player, who's a pupil, who's a participant, who's a prisoner.\nJulia: Who's a prisoner.  And do you find that you have like an even distribution of those four types within any one class or...?\nTodd: No, usually you'll a couple players, like let's say if you have a class of 20, if you have a class of 20 students you might have one or two players, one or two pupils, about 12-14 participants and maybe two or three prisoners.\nJulia: Well, it's interesting, as you were giving those definitions, student's names and faces were coming to mind. Oh yeah, he's just described...  Oh yeah, that's her, yeah.  I could see how they would fit into the categories.\nTodd: See, it works.\nJulia: It does.  But how does it help you teach them?\nTodd: I think it does help you teach, like you know how to deal with everyone differently, right.  So like a prisoner for example, you just have to have a lot of empathy, you know, you have to understand that they don't want to be there so you shouldn't expect that they have a great attitude about the class.  You know, a participant, you should make it really highly interactive, you should make it very social, as much as you can. A pupil, you know, you give them the extra feedback when you write, you know, comments on their papers and stuff and you give them the encouragement like, \"Oh wow, you did a really good job on your test.\"  A player, you, you know, because I'm a language teacher, I try to talk with them a lot, like almost cordial, like a friend so that they have a lot of personal interaction.  So, yeah, I think it's, you know you just kind of ... you have to adjust to each one.  Yeah, and the thing about this is, I've thought about these four types a lot and I think they apply to any subject and the person can change, like one person isn't automatically a player in every subject, so for some subjects you're a player, for other subjects you're a prisoner, maybe other subjects you're a participant.  Okay, so what subjects were you a player?\nJulia: Language, definitely, foreign language, loved French.  I did Latin at school as well which was quite unusual but enjoyed it.\nTodd: And a prisoner?\nJulia: A prisoner, at the time, music.  When I was at school I was a prisoner in music and I don't think it was just my response to the subject, it was also my response to the teacher.  Didn't have a good relationship with the teacher but nothing I could do, couldn't escape, had to be there and that affected my learning I think.  Being a prisoner's not a good ... I don't think it's a good learning situation.\nTodd: No, definitely not.\nJulia: No.\nTodd: How about, were you ever a participant?  You just did something to be with your friends and you really didn't care what it was?\nJulia: Yeah, there were some subjects like that I think.  Like history and geography, those kind of subjects, humanities subjects, they were mildly engaging but I liked, yeah ... I didn't have an aversion to them because I was hanging out with my friends.  I didn't love them, I didn't excel in them, I wasn't particularly interested in them.",

I've been teaching for about five years, five or six years. They're fine. You just have to be a bit silly with those kids. \nAimee: Yes. \nKatie: Have a good time. Can't really be too serious when you're teaching young kids because they're still kids. \nAimee: That's true. So how about younger than that? How about the kindergarten age? How are they for you? \nKatie: They're probably my achilles heel. I'm not great with kindergarten students or younger than that because they don't respond to reason. \nAimee: Right. \nKatie: Yeah. So they – I mean, yeah. They're difficult for me to teach. I prefer teaching older students. \nHow about you? What kind of age range do you like teaching? \nAimee: I think I appreciate all parts of all age groups. Every group has its pros and cons. Recently, I've been teaching university students, and I think I'm remembering how much I enjoy it because, you know, they are adults and you can teach them like adults. And you can still have a bit of silly, fun with them, too. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: So these days, I think I prefer teaching the older students, university age students. You can, you know, you can really go into topics quite deeply. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: And you can get some interesting answers from some students. Other students, of course, you can't. \nKatie: Everyone is different, right? \nAimee: Yes. You just have to find a way of teasing, teasing their potential, of all of them, I think. \nKatie: Is there a group that you don't like teaching? \nAimee: I'm not used to junior high school children, junior high school students. I don't have any experience with them. So that would make me nervous, I think. \nKatie: How do you think they would be different to university students? \nAimee: I think, from what I mentioned before, the teenagers, the hormones. I think that would be different. There's, you know, it's bubbling inside them, all of these changes of feelings and emotions. And they have so many things to deal with; pressure of growing up. And I think that can be more challenging. \nBut I think it's important as a teacher to try to remember what it was like when you were that age. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: I think that's the biggest thing that will help you. \nKatie: Absolutely. So what do you think about teaching younger children like babies? How are you with that?\nAimee: I do really enjoy that. Babies are awesome. They have their own set of needs. But usually, the very young classes come with, you know, the parents are there, too. So it's kind of a group-led situation, teacher-led group. And yeah, it's good fun for me. They're very cute and squishy. And very – not uncontrollable – what's the word? \nKatie: Unpredictable? \nAimee: That's it. Completely unpredictable. You know, one day they can be in the best mood ever, and then the next day, they're just a nightmare. \nKatie: I think that's why I'm terrified of them, because they're so unpredictable. I don't like it. \nAimee: Yeah. That's true. And the bodily functions too, you know. \nKatie: Yeah, no thanks. \nAimee: There's all of that. \nKatie: Yeah. I'm not prepared to deal with that. No, thank you. No, thank you. No bodily functions.",

Thibault!\nTodd: OK, and that's your last name?\nRaphael: Ah, yeah, it's my last name, but it's a first name too in France. \nTodd: Oh, really\nRaphael: Yeah! It's quite traditional. It's from the middle ages. \nTodd: OK\nRaphael: Yeah, yeah, yeah!\nTodd: Wow, Where are you from in France?\nRaphael: I just finished my studies in Paris, but I was born in the South. Actually, it's the place they make foie gras. If you know about foie gras. \nTodd: Yeah, yeah, yeah\nRaphael: We used to eat on Christmas and..\nTodd: What exactly is foie gras? Sorry, it's hard for me to say.\nRaphael: It's from the duck. It's um, how do you call it?\nTodd: The liver?\nRaphael: Yeah, the liver! That's it. The liver, and it's cooked an official way and you can have it both like cold or hot, I mean, any kind, but the point is, the duck has to be fed in nature, right! It's not working if it's in a, industrial feeding duck \nTodd: Oh, really!\nRaphael: It doesn't produce really good foie gras, yeah!\nTodd: So the duck must come from nature?\nRaphael: Yeah, actually, that's why this place is famous for because it's countryside. There's no really big cities and most of the people are farmers so they actually produce some really good foie gras, like I heard the competition comes from East Europe now but they make more like industrial foie gras. It's a little different, but anyway, that's the place I'm born.\nTodd: Wow! Is that the eastern side or the western side?\nRaphael: It's the southwest.\nTodd: OK, towards Spain.\nRaphael: Yeah, that's it. Exactly! Like below Bordeaux, a city called Bordeaux, it's a bit below this city.\nTodd: OK, so Bordeaux is known for wine.\nRaphael: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nTodd: So, is it near the mountains or?\nRaphael: It's not that close to Spain. It's, how can I say, yeah, it's not the extremity of France, it's more like center-south, you know.\nTodd: Oh, OK. Sounds like a pretty place though. \nRaphael: What?\nTodd: It sounds like a pretty place.\nRaphael: Yeah, yeah, it's quite nice. It's quite nice. I mean, it's countryside right. You have to like it. There's not a lot of things to do, but, I spend like my, from fifteen years old, I live there and then I moved to another city called La Rochelle, which is close to the sea, just in front of the sea actually, and that's a better place. I like it much.",

I started when I was in my first year in high school, however I played it only a year and then because.... due to, you know busies and studyings and so I started to play it again when I was a graduate... after graduating from high school.Todd: So, you were on the tennis team in high school?Tini: Not actually the tennis team but I was just like, as a hobby. I did it as a hobby.Todd: Oh, OK. So are both your father and your brother really good players?Tini: Well, in some sense, yes.Todd: Who's better, your father or your brother?Tini: Well, regarding style, I think my brother is much better than my father.Todd: OK. Now when you play, do you prefer to play singles or doubles?Tini: I prefer to play singles. You know, you have better control, actually.Todd: Oh, OK. You don't like to play with another person?Tini: Well, I can but it's that I don't play it very often playing double.Todd: Oh, yeah, right. It's a lot more difficult I think playing doubles.Tini: Yes. Yes. Yes. You know, you have to get all the strategies fixed up.Todd: Right. So, what do you think is the most difficult thing about playing tennis?Tini: Difficult thing about playing tennis?Todd: Is it for example serving the ball or backhand, or?Tini: Well, I think like controlling the ball, that is the most difficult one. Like for example, like you want to hit it like, so that the ball would go, how do you say, straight to the, you know, the boundary lines that will be harder for your opponent to catch it, so.Todd: Right. Right. That's true. That is true. It is kind of hard to keep the ball within the boundaries.Tini: Yes, within the boundaries.Todd: So, do you have a really nice, expensive racket?Tini: Well, yes, actually. It was expensive.Todd: It was! It's not expensive anymore?Tini: You know, like new fashions come along, new styles come along, new models come along, and then so...Todd: Oh, your racket is a little old.Tini: Yeah.

I have a favor to ask you.\nTodd: Sure.\nMarion: Well, the thing is, I'm thinking of buying a computer OK, but I really, I don't know too much about computers, you know that, so I want to know, which is better, a laptop or a desktop? Which do you think I should buy?\nTodd: Ah, that's a good question. Well, I'm not a computer pro but, I guess if you get a desktop computer for your house there's a lot of advantages. It has more memory, it has more power. You can get a bigger monitor for watching movies and things like that, and I think the number one reason that I like the desktop is it doesn't break. You know and it can't be stolen.\nMarion: As easily, yeah.\nTodd: Right, so when you have the laptop, you take it and you carry it everywhere that means it's easier to break, you know you can drop it (yeah) or it's easy to be stolen, so yeah. On the other hand though, if you just want to be mobile with your computer then obviously you want a desktop because you can take it everywhere, and you can use it in different places, so that's actually why I have two. I have a desktop and a laptop.\nMarion: So you have the best of both worlds, really.\nTodd: So what do you want to use your computer for?\nMarion: Well, mainly I want to use it to keep in touch with my family and my friends. That's my number one reason. I'd also like to use it for work, to make worksheets and that kind of thing for school, and the other thing, what was the other thing, oh yes, I want to use it to store my photos from my digital camera. That's really important to me because I'm afraid I'm going to lose one of the CD's and all of those photos or something like that.\nTodd: Well, how often do you think you'll be taking a computer with you, to work or somewhere?\n\nMarion: I don't know really. I mean, I suppose I could just buy a laptop and leave it at home, couldn't I?\nTodd: Sure. Sure. Yeah, I guess if you're just going to use for basic stuff then maybe, a laptop is good for you.\nMarion: Yeah. Yeah, maybe. It's so confusing. It's such a big decision for me. I don't know what to do. Thanks though for your advice.\nTodd: Sure.",

I teach wine.\n                        Todd: OK, so let's say if I'm going to have friends over, and I'm making let's say steak. I'm having a grilling steak. Can I serve wine with steak?\n                        Sandra: Yes. Steak goes with almost any red wine.\n                        Todd: Oh, really. OK. So, red. How about if I want to mix wines. Is it OK to go red wine, white wine?\n                        Sandra: You always start out with white wines going towards red wines.\n                        Todd: OK, always go white wine first, then the red wine. (Yes) OK, and how about for dessert. Is there a special dessert wine?\n                        Sandra: There are many great dessert wines, so it depends on what you like, how sweet you like and what you're making for dessert.\n                        Todd: OK, so how about I'm making terimisu.\n                        Sandra: Terimisu, then I would probably have a tawny port, either from Portugal or from Australia, which makes great ports, or you might even go for a fruity and oaky zinfandel, which is dry wine from California.\n                        Todd: OK, nice. How much will that cost me?\n                        Sandra: Depends on how much you want to spend. For a port, a tawny port, anywhere in between 3,500 to 10,000 (OK) And for a California Zinfandel, a good one probably about 3,000 (yen).\n                        Todd: 3,000. I think I can maybe afford that. Not much. And, how about what would be a good wine to start off for like appetizers or with a salad or something like that.\n                        Sandra: I always start off with a sparkling wine.\n                        Todd: A sparkling wine.\n                        Sandra: Yes. I prefer champagne but if you can't afford it, even though champagne is the lowest price anywhere in the world is in Japan\n                        Todd: Oh, really.\n                        Sandra: And many of my students load up on cases of champagne and have it sent home by their companies container.\n                        Todd: Oh, wow.\n                        Sandra: Yes.

I went to live with couple in their seventies whose children had moved away from home. \nThey started treating me like a second daughter. At first it was really fun because they'd encourage me to speak and they'd act everything out for me, including my landlord's experiences during the Second World War in Poland. \nWhere he'd stand up and perform but after awhile it got a bit wearing because when I was out the house he would go into my bedroom and start picking up my dirty underwear from the floor, all he used to leave on the bookshelf for me. \nHe would also go into the bathroom, take my underwear off the line and hang it outside so it would smell fresher. Sometimes he would cook for me which is great up to a point, because I got to taste some real Polish home cooked food.                But when he decided that I really was his long-lost daughter and started chopping my egg for me and then trying to feed it to me I began to feel that maybe it was starting to get time to move out. He would also invite me into the living room so that I could watch the Polish TV and improve my language and then spend half the television show prodding me and getting me to speak to him in very fast Polish. He was very kind to my friend Kathy when she came over to stay but unfortunately, he wanted me to translate his thoughts on the Polish economy from very fast Polish into English and the same time she was asking me to translate her ideas on English Cricket to Polish. None the less, it was an experience I would not have missed.",

Like, I remember in my family, you know, we have the special, like space in our house just for the Christmas tree, just for Christmas time.Fred: A special space for the Christmas tree!Anja: Yes, indeed! And I remember I always went with my parents to buy the Christmas tree, maybe, three days before Christmas.Fred: OK, three days before.: Yes, and we wouldn't put it actually until Christmas day, like I remember how me and my mother and the rest of my family, we went to church and then we would come back. My father wouldn't go to church and the door would be closed and then we open the door and suddenly there would be the Christmas tree. So actually, you know, like, I never knew that my father actually put the Christmas tree. Of course, it was like some angel or something like that, but actually I never decorated the Christmas tree because an angel was doing that for us... as in my father.Fred: So when you were a young child, you always thought that some kind of angel would come down to your house and decorate your Christmas tree.Anja: That's right. During the time I was in church, and did it for us. And it's really pretty, and it has a lot of lights and it's really colorful. You know some people like it one specific color: in red or blue, but our Christmas tree always had a lot of different colors. It's really nice. What about you? How is your Christmas tree like in your family?Fred: Ah, it's just great. It's a bit different because the whole family would gather and then put up the Christmas tree together.Anja: Oh, really?Fred: We would decorate the Christmas tree together.Anja: Yes.Fred: Maybe too or three days before Christmas, we would all go to the store or just use what we already had and then we would all gather together and put up the Christmas tree together listening to Frank Sinatra's best Christmas songs, and actually, the size of the Christmas tree was the most interesting part.Anja: Oh, is it? Is it really big or...Fred: It was a really, really big Christmas tree, and my father used to love those big Christmas trees and then it would take so much time to decorate it. Think about a fifteen foot Christmas tree, how much time you have to spend to decorate it.Anja: Oh, wow that's a tall tree.Fred: Yeah, but it's a lot of fun.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Katia and Fred, we're talking about your dance school, and before we were talking about the belly dance, and Katia you do the belly dance, but you also do Salsa. Fred: That's right, Todd. Todd: And that takes two?Fred: That takes two. It takes two to salsa.Todd: It takes two to salsa. So you are part of the salsa team?Fred: Yes. If we could call it a team, I mean, Katia: Yes.Fred: It's mostly Katia teaching me how to dance and then I try to pass it onto the others.Katia: That's not true. Fred... Fred is a very good teacher, I think he's just very humble but where I think we make a very good team: We're both patient and we know what a student is struggling and that's the important part.Fred: And it's also good to have partners like this to teach other people, whether they're partners or not, or they just want to learn salsa, like the men would come to me to learn about a special move and then the women would have a tendency of going more towards Katia so we're making... striking a perfect balance in teaching, I think.Todd: Now, do you get a fair balance of students, of male to female students, for salsa class?Katia: Right now, we have more women than men so hopefully we'll have a balance in there, but yeah.Fred: I guess women are more open towards taking dance lessons than men are. Maybe men feel a bit scared. I don't know. How do you feel, Todd? Would you come to the school?Todd: Well, you know what, I will. I will come, but I have to admit my feeling would be that I would be intimidated. That I would look really foolish, so yeah. I think most guys would probably feel the same way.Fred: Yeah, that's why we have more girls I think.Katia: Unfortunately, but the truth is from what I've heard from the guys, from the men, they do want to learn how to dance.Todd: Yeah, it does sound fun. It does.Katia: And women also like it. Women like for the men to dance, and especially in Salsa, usually it's the man is the leader,so it's very important that the man is who leads.Todd: That sounds like more pressure.Katia: No, no, no. Well, you learn how to be a good leader and how to lead, and the woman how to follow.Todd: So, let's say somebody goes to your school, like myself and they have two left feet. They cannot dance. How long does it take to where you can do a salsa reasonably well?Katia: We... right from the beginning, at least we can a little bit, where the person is and does it, can they hear the music or not. From the first class, you dance with a partner. Of course not freely. We can tell you what steps to take. And we advance accordingly, so it might take in one step, it might take a long time, so it depends on people that are in the class, and it all depends on the person.Todd: Right. So some people learn faster than others.Katia: Yes.Fred: But definitely after one class, you will have learned a minimum two stepsTodd: OK. Really.Fred: Yeah.Todd: OK.Fred: Guaranteed. Todd: I'm sold. I'll definitely come and try it out.Fred: Please do.Katia: Please do.",

        "transcript": "Good morning, everybody. Good morning. Hello. Now, have you ever noticed that when you log on to the internet, you nearly always see adverts for things that you're interested in? Yes? OK. So, let's say you were looking for a new pair of trainers last week. Well, suddenly you'll see adverts for trainers all over the place. Well, believe it or not, this isn't random. The internet browsers, websites and apps that we use know a lot about us because they monitor how we use their site or app. This way they can work out what we like and don't like. Clever! So, you've probably heard of cookies. Am I right? Yes? OK. When you visit some sites for the first time, a cookie is downloaded onto your computer that keeps a track on how you travel around the site and exactly what you do. So, the next time you use the site again, your computer will check the cookies and adapt, depending on the information it stored from your last visit. With me? OK. So, without even thinking about it, we give out a lot of information that can then be used to personalise our online experience.\n\nNow, I saw a great presentation last week by the internet activist Eli Pariser and I want to tell you a little bit about it. He wrote a book a few years ago called The Filter Bubble and I think it's something that we should all know about. Here's the book. We actually have it in the school library if you want to borrow it. In this talk I'm just going to give you a little taster. Now, he likens the 'filter bubble' to an ecosystem and he claims it is something that we should all be worried about. Now, after reading his book and watching his talk, I've got to say I agree with him. I think it's something you should all know about too.\n\nSo, let me try to explain using a simple example. Imagine I support a political party … so, to keep this really simple let's call it the Yellow Party. OK, so let's say I have lots of friends who also support the Yellows but some of my friends support the Reds. Now, on my favourite social media site I want to see the posts from all my friends but I tend to click more on the links that are posted by my friends who support the Yellows, like me, obviously. Even so, I do still want to see what the Reds are posting about. With me? OK. Now, a few months ago, just before the big elections I noticed something quite weird happening on my newsfeed. I noticed that my friends who support the Red Party had almost completely disappeared from the site, and I was only being shown posts from my Yellow friends. Weird. Now, I wondered if all my Red friends had left this social media space and moved somewhere else, but when I clicked on their profiles to check, I could see that they had been busy posting links and talking to people, but their posts were being hidden from me. And it's only now I understand why. I know it's because I hardly ever clicked on their posts and I didn't interact so much with them. So, the social media site itself had decided for me that I wasn't interested in their posts, so they decided not to show them to me. Now, this is an example of what Eli Pariser means by the filter bubble – it's when the websites and apps choose what information we can and can't see. Does that make sense?",

Why don't you talk about how lawyers are good for society: Why we need lawyers?\nAlex: Well, first we need lawyers because most of the time a lawyer will try to settle disputes between parties before it gets to a courtroom. Usually you have one side that has a problem and the other side is also aurgueing another point. So usually a lawyer will try to bring the two sides into their offices and to mediate a dispute before it gets to a courtroom. Another way a lawyer can help a society is usually lawyers can be very expensive, but there are programs out there that help people with less money, not necessarily to get free advice, but they can do it on a sliding scale, or a lawyer can do pro bono work which is free, and can help someone just, sometimes all they need is a letter written to resolve a problem or they just need somebody to go with them to court to explain what is going on, or just explain a lease or some other document for them that doesn't take much time and makes the client feel a lot better and a lot of times lawyers will take up the cause of children. If there is a custody dispute or some sort of bad thing that's happening to a child that needs a visit to a courtroom, the lawyer is there to be the lawyer for the child and no one else can influence the decisions that can be made for the child. It's almost like a protection and many other communitites or other sections of society that don't have a voice can get a voice through a lawyer.\nTodd: OK, great and what kind of lawyer are you going to be?\nAlex: An aviation lawyer.",

Nice jeans and T-shirt.\nMarion: Oh, thank you.\nTodd: Where did you get it?\nMarion: Actually, my T-shirt is a hand-me-down from a friend of mine who's leaving so she gave me some of her clothes.\nTodd: Oh, really. Ah, OK. See, that's cool, like if I know the person who wore the shirt before, I'll wear it, but I will never go to a second hand clothing store or a used clothing store (Really) I think that's disgusting.\nMarion: Why?\nTodd: Well, I mean, you don't know who wore it before.\nMarion: But they're washed, Todd. You know!\nTodd: Yeah, but, OK, first of all, what if the person who wore it was just the type or person you really hated. There's something about the person that you just really didn't like, and then, now you're wearing that person's clothes. Doesn't that disgust you?\nMarion: No, do think a person's personality rubs off on their clothes (No, but) and then it survives the wash cycle in your washing machine?\nTodd: OK. Right. Right. I see what you're saying, but I'll put it to you this way. Imagine that you work with somebody.\nMarion: Yes.\nTodd: Ok, at your job, is there somebody that you don't like.\nMarion: Yes.\nTodd: OK, now imagine that there's a clothing bin and people can put clothes in there and you see a shirt and you like it, and you're just about to take it and someone says, that's that persons shirt. Would you still take it?\nMarion: Mm, I probably wouldn't.\nTodd: Right. See. See.\nMarion: Yeah, but only because I wouldn't want to feel like that person had done me a favor in some way. (Right) I wouldn't want to be beholden to that person if I don't like them.\nTodd: Right. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I guess it's good to have second hand clothes if people don't have anything, you know for charity and things like that.\nMarion: Yeah. Well, actually, when I was in college, I didn't have very much money, so the only clothes I could buy were second-hand clothes so I actually really got to like going around the charity shops and finding clothes that I really liked, so nothing that was following the trends of the moment, but in college that really doesn't matter. I think it's better to wear something if you feel comfortable in, and I think there's a real sense of achievement when you find something that you've wanted for God-knows-how-long, for example, I found a brown suede jacket one time in a charity shop, and I thought, \"Oh, my God. This is exactly the type of suede jacket that I have been longing for\", but I could never afford that jacket at full-price, even at half-price in a normal shop. I could never have had it, so actually most of my wardrobe at home is second hand clothes I would say, and I love it. I will go to a second hand clothes shop before a normal clothes shop any day. It's so much more fun.\nTodd: Well, that's very interesting. You have fun shopping at those stores\nMarion: I will.",

We didn't see a snake.Todd: You didn't see one snake?Jeff: Nope. The villagers... I think they hunt animals for food, for their food, so I think the animals know and they stay away from the side of the river. They stay away from the villages, so if you want to see animals, you have to go further into the jungle, but it's very dangerous and it's difficult, so we didn't go far from the river's edge.Todd: Oh, so you never ventured in the jungle.Jeff: You can't. You really can't. It's too thick. You need a machete to hack your way through. You need someone who knows where they're going. A guide with you. It's not... you just can't go on a nice walk in this kind of Amazon jungle. It's dangerous, it's difficult.Todd: So, how many days did it take you to get down the river?Jeff: I think it took us, say, fifteen days.Todd: The distance wasn't so far. I was only I say 300 kilometers but the canoes go straight down. There wasn't any public transport. These canoes were just transporting good from one village to the next, so we had to wait until a transport canoe came along, and then we just hitched a ride to the next village. Wait there for a day or two and then hitch a ride to the next village so a very unorthodox kind of travel. No tour buses. No trains. No taxis. So..Todd: Well, that sounds like a pretty amazing trip.Jeff: mm, it was lots of fun, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.",

So do you play hockey by yourself?Brian: I don't actually. When I was a kid, I wanted to play ice hockey, and I was always like begging my dad and asking him but he always said 'NO'.Fanny: Why?Brian: I think the big reason is that... Well, he told me it was too expensive.Fanny: Is it?Brian: It's not cheap. You know, it costs quite a bit to get all the gear but the big reason I think is the practice was always very early in the morning.Fanny: Oh, I see.Brian: Like five a.m. is when the practice is, and I think he was too lazy to wake up and take me to the practice.Fanny: Oh, I see.Brian: He told me it was too expensive. Deep down I think he was.... he didn't want to drive me.Fanny: So are there many people playing hockey?Brian: There are. It's a great sport. It's very popular with many children, and maybe high schools and universities all have hockey teams.Fanny: Oh, nice. That means you're a lot of rich people in Canada, then.Brian: Or maybe they spend all of their money on hockey gear. Have you ever played hockey?Fanny: No, no, not really. It's not that popular in China.Brian: What kind of sports are more common in China?Fanny: People always play soccer...Brian: Ah, soccer.Fanny: And table tennis. Table tennis is very popular.Brian: You're country is very strong at table tennis I think.Fanny: We always get all the medals in the big, you know, big eventsBrian: Why is table tennis so popular now do you think?Fanny: I think the first reason is that everybody can play it because it's very easy to get the, you know, the... to get ready for the sports. It's not expensive.Brian: No, I guess you just need the ball and the paddle.Fanny: The paddle. The ball and the paddle. Yes, and a partner.Brian: Right. Right. So have you played it then?Fanny: Yeah, I'm quite good at it. Brian: Oh, really.Fanny: Because my mother plays very well and so I always played with my mom, so I got better now.Brian: OK. So she taught you how to play table tennis?Fanny: Actually she didn't teach me but we always played together.Brian: Right.Fanny: Practice makes perfect.Brian: So they say.Fanny: Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Katia: Hey, Enam, I've heard that in Bangladesh there are still arranged marriages. Is that true?\nEnam: Yes, it is true. We still have arranged marriages but the number of arranged marriages are declining these days because students, or even you can say young generation, don't like this custom anymore. They want to choose their own bride or groom by themselves, but yeah, we still have this arranged marriage in our villages where the bride doesn't know the groom and the groom doesn't even know the bride. Their parents just arrange the marriage and introduce them for two days or a few weeks, they just get to know each other, maybe just little talks ... then they just get married. Everything starts after the marriage.\nKatia: Wow! That is so interesting, but what about you? How do you feel about it?Enam: Actually, I have decided not to go for arranged marriage, and I have already talked with my mom and she said, \" OK, you can choose your own bride\" ... but tell me Katia, what would you do if you were in Bangladesh and you had to do arranged marriage? Suppose you are in Bangladesh. You are a Bangladeshi girl and your parents are asking you to marry a guy they choose for you.Katia: Well, I would really trust my parents that they would choose the best thing for me, however if I would meet somebody else before they did, I would probably want to choose my own husband, but then it would also be interesting to understand my parents and because I know they would want the best thing for me, but it's a little bit difficult question.Enam: So, Katia, do you have arranged marriages in Mexico? Or you don't have?Katia: Actually, not really. Mexican boys, Mexican girls ... they fall in love and many times actually they go against the parents and that's actually common in the movies. So, no arranged marriages in Mexico. But Enam, I'm very curious, how do arranged marriages happen? How do they work?Enam: Well, it's kind of interesting I think because the match makers often study about the family backgrounds, their values and their perceptions, everything, and when they see that this two persons have the same, kind of, values, and they share the same level of understanding, then they talk with the parents and always both the man and woman has a chance to talk about the values and how to think about the lives and that then they decide whether to get married or not.Katia: That is so interesting.",

Jonathan: I wouldn't really say my home is a suitcase, but I think that people really hold onto their possessions a little bit too much, and people think that they need to have their favorite books nearby when they probably will never even read it again. I really don't think it's necessary to have all of those things there, so I don't need to have a lot of nice clothes with me all the time. I don't need to carry around all of these souvenirs of days gone by. I'm perfectly comfortable having just a minimal amount of things with me. I have changes of clothes so it's not like I'm in any way suffering from a lack of personal hygiene and such things.Jeff: So, but... so what do you do? How do you clean your clothes? What do you do when you want to buy something new?Jonathan: Well, I find that in fact I don't often buy some many things when I travel. I buy the necessities, but I try to keep everything small in size so for example I have one small little pack that has shampoo, conditioner and body soap, and I can in fact, fill it up from a lot of hotels which offer those things to their guests. I can have a little bar of soap. I have a small towel to travel with. I can take my clothes to a coin laundry. At worst, I put on a pair of shorts while I'm washing my two pairs of jeans. If it's a cold weather country perhaps people look at me a little bit funny, but being Canadian and descended from cold weather countries, I don't have a difficulty with it.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, I'm here with Jerri, and\n                                she's Thai, and we are in Bangkok. And we are going to\n                                talk about fashion. So, Jerri, Bangkok is a very, very fashion-conscious city. \nJerri: Yes, absolutely.\nTodd: Shopping is huge here. So, let's\n                                talk about prices. So, first we'll talk about jeans. You\n                                are wearing jeans today. So, how much are an expensive\n                                pair of jeans in Bangkok?\nJerri: Well, that's funny that you ask because\n                                the price range for clothes here is quite wide, so you\n                                can go from 200 baht - Thai baht - for a pair of jeans\n                                up to 4000 Thai baht for a pair of jeans in a, like a,\n                                like, one of the top brands.\nTodd: Wow. So, just so people know,\n                                200 baht would be - in U.S. dollar that's about six\n                                dollars. And 4000 baht would be about 130 dollars.\nJerri: Yes. Yeah. \nTodd: Wow.\nJerri: So, it's quite a, quite a difference\n                                there. But I would say that generally it will be in the\n                                range of 500 to 2000 Thai baht.\nTodd: Okay. 500 to 2000. That's still\n                                pretty a wide gap.\nJerri: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nTodd: Okay, cool. So those are jeans.\n                                What about, for women, a blouse?\nJerri: A blouse? I would say...for, like, a nice\n                                quality one, like, 500 Thai baht.\nTodd: Okay. That's not bad.\nJerri: Yeah. That's alright.\nTodd: Fifteen dollars, about. Okay.\n                                What's the most you would pay for a blouse?\nJerri: No more than 1000 Thai baht.\nTodd: Okay.\nJerri: Yeah.\nTodd: That's your, that's - what about\n                                the cheapest?\nJerri: The cheapest? Like, 300 Thai baht. Like,\n                                if you started going lower than 300 Thai baht, then you\n                                have to accept that the, you know, the quality - you\n                                might get to wear it not more than three times.\nTodd: Okay.\nJerri: So, that's the price you pay.\nTodd: Nice, alright. So, what about\n                                shoes?\nJerri: Shoes? It's - it also depends on where\n                                you go. So, Chatuchak market is known for affordable\n                                clothes, so the shoes there would be from 200 Thai baht\n                                to 500 Thai baht. But if you visit the more well-known\n                                stores and the department stores, then they can be from\n                                500 Thai baht to 1000 Thai baht.\nTodd: Okay, that's interesting. So,\n                                you mentioned Jatujak market - can you kind of talk\n                                about Jatujak market?\nJerri: Yes, so, this is one of the main\n                                activities for tourists to do when they visit Bangkok.\n                                It's a weekend market, so it's only open on Saturdays\n                                and Sundays. It's quite crowded, but it's definitely\n                                something you should do. There's a lot of souvenir\n                                  stores, a lot of local shops, and, yeah, a place\n                                to shop for clothes. And it's not just for tourists, you\n                                also see a lot of Thais go there because all the stores\n                                there are reasonable - reasonably priced and\n                                they're quite trendy. Yeah, they have, like, different\n                                styles...stores that you won't find anywhere else.\nTodd: Right. Oh, yeah, I've been there\n                                a couple of times. It's massive. It's really,\n                                really big.\n\nJerri: Yeah, it's massive. It takes about half a\n                                day to do the entire thing.\n\nTodd: It's easy to get lost right? \n\nJerri: Yes.\n\nTodd: If you go inside, you kind of don't know\n                                where you are.\n\nJerri: Exactly, exactly. Which I guess is also\n                                the fun part of it. It's like an adventure in itself, right?\n\nTodd: Right, exactly. Okay, so, what about things like,\n                                like belts or, you know, like accessories?\nJerri: I would recommend going to Platinum Mall.\n                                This mall is located near Siam BTS station.

Todd: What is it with the raisins? You always have raisins!Ruth: I really like raisins. They’re so nice. They’re so practical because you can take them anywhere. It’s not like if you take other fruits with you: they squash and they bruise but raisins are so handy and they come in a little packet and you can always have fruit with you. Todd: That’s a pretty good point there actually but still, I mean, all the time? I see you with raisins every day!Ruth: I eat raisins every day. I really like them.Todd: Don’t you get sick of them? I mean eating them every day?Ruth: I don’t ever get sick of things like raisins or broccoli for that matter. I could never get sick of it.Todd: Well that’s strange. What about grapes? Because you like raisins do you like grapes? Ruth: Actually I prefer grapes. Grapes are probably my favourite fruit but they’re not practical. You can’t carry them around with you and they’re heavier and they’re more expensive as well. Raisins are cheap.Todd: Have you ever noticed that grapes, at least when I eat grapes, my mouth gets a sensation (not the taste) but something about the texture of eating grapes: my mouth gets a sensation that no other food gives me?Ruth: Yeah that’s true. I don’t know why that is. Do you think that’s because its slightly acidic maybe?Todd: Ah, could be.Ruth: I don’t know but I like it. Todd: Yeah, grapes are great. Actually where I’m from in California it’s a big producer of raisins.Ruth: Oh yeah that’s right and you can get raisins in little red boxes can’t you?Todd: Yeah. The thing is, I love raisins but not just plain. Eating raisins just doesn’t do it for me but I love raisins in my cereal. And I love raisin bran. Best cereal ever made.Ruth: I really like it too.Todd: And I love raisins in cookies and raisin bread.Ruth: I don’t think I’ve ever had raisin bread.Todd: What? You’re like a big raisin fan. And you’ve never had raisin bread?Ruth: I don’t think so. Is it like a teacake?Todd: No, it’s just like a sweet bread with raisins in the middle.Ruth: No, I’ve never had that.Todd: You are deprived!Ruth: Obviously!Todd: Well I’ll find some raisin bread and I’ll give it to you.Ruth: Oh you’re a star, thank you.",

Can you talk about your journey down the Amazon? Jeff: The Amazon... What people think of the Amazon is a beautiful river with a nice green jungle and lots of animals, and it's not like that. It's not a beautiful place. It was... the river was muddy and dirty. It looked like coffee. The side of the river, the side of the Amazon was very overgrown and full of mosquitos and black flies. We didn't see any wild animals because the canoe was just a long, thin wooden canoe piled high with things like rice and food other materials that the villagers needed and it had an outboard motor that was very noisy, so it wasn't romantic at all, the ideas of the Amazon river, and the beauty and the adventure. It was difficult and dirty and hot and dangerous, so it wasn't romantic at all.Todd: It doesn't sound like it. Where did you stay as you would go down? Would you sleep on the canoe?Jeff: No. Every night they would stop at a little village, and it was just made out of little village, a little cluster of bamboo thatched houses just on the side of the river. They'd clear a little spot out of the jungle and then they'd have a, say a dozen bamboo houses there and we'd sleep say on the floor of one of their houses in our sleeping bags.Todd: Were these houses made especially for travellers?Jeff: No, no. There was no travelers. There's no houses for travelers. These are just with the villagers. There's no restaurants or no hotels. There are no internet cafes. Half the villages didn't have power, so it was real basic village life.Todd: Wow!",

So what do friends like to do for fun in high school in America?Tini: Well, of course, you know teenagers, we all like to have parties, and one very interesting thing about parties in America is like they like to do it at their own house, especially when their parents are out.Todd: Yes. Actually, I'm American. I remember well.Tini: Uh-huh. Well, like, like when your parents are out on a business trip or on a vacation to some other states or to some other countries and then, you know, you will be baby-sitting your house for a couple of days, and that is actually a really opportunity to have some parties.Todd: Right. Right. Actually, I remember there's a lot of peer pressure actually, so if your parents are away you feel like you have to have a party.Tini: Exactly. Exactly. Like, \"Hey, I heard that your parents are away. Why not this, huh?Todd: Right. So does that happen in other countries, like in Vietnam or in Japan?Tini: Oh, absolutely no.Todd: No!Tini: I don't think so. Like to my own experience, I don't think so.Todd: Oh, why not?Tini: Well, first of all, parents are always home. That is the number one rule, and you actually, you can't, you know stay, we have like curfew times for... especially for students in Vietnam, for example you have to be back home at ten thirty. And period.Todd: That's pretty early.Tini: Well, yes, you know people are pretty conservative.Todd: But kids don't have curfews in America?Tini: I... Yes, I do think so, but you know, um.. they are pretty more flexible.",

How much water do you drink every day?\n\nAl: I guess about three liters, so six of those 500 millileter, five or six of those 500 millileter bottles.\n\nTodd: Yeah, that's a lot. That's about what I drink. Yeah, I think I'm addicted to water.\n\nAl: I definitely am.\n\nTodd: Yeah, it's my security blanket. I must always have a bottle of water nearby to drink.\nAl: And you have a theory to about why I always feel like I get thirstier the more water I drink, and you have a theory about that don't you?\n\nTodd: Yeah, that's right. I think that the water bottle people somehow put a special chemical that always make you want to drink more water.\n\nAl: I agree.\n\nTodd: Yeah, cause haven't you noticed that if you drink water from a tap, from the sink, you have a glass of water, you're not thirsty after you finish the glass, but when you finish a bottle of water, you're still thirsty.\n\nAl: One bottle is not enough. Yeah, definitely. A glass of tap water I would rarely finish the glass, but a bottle of bottled water, I need more, and like you said I need to know there is more close to me or I get upset.\nTodd: Well, do you still drink tap water?\n\nAl: No, never.\n\nTodd: Never?\n\nAl: I cook with it but I don't drink it.\n\nTodd: Why?\n\nAl: Ah, it tastes like crap.\n\nTodd: Yeah, it does taste pretty bad. Well, we both live in Japan, how is the water in England?\n\nAl: It's about the same. It's kind of, it's drinkable in theory but it has this weird processed taste to it and doesn't smell all that good, so it's supposed to be safe to drink but I don't really believe that, for a minute.\nTodd: Actually the water where I'm from in Norhtern California is pretty good.\n\nAl: Is it?\n\nTodd: Yeah. Ah, that's the one thing you can drink from the tap but people still drink bottled water. Actually, I think the next time there's a huge, massive world war, it might be over water.\n\nAl: Yes.\n\nTodd: It's kind of scary.\n\nAl:It's like we live on this planet that is mostly water and we can't manage it properly. There isn't enough for everybody. \n\nTodd: Yeah, no kidding, so anyway, for all you people out there, remember, be thankful for your water.",

Can you talk about the last bicycle trip you did?\nTerry: OK, the last trip that I did in the summer, I started in Vancouver, British Colombia and rode down the West Coast to San Diego. It took about six weeks to do that.\nTodd: Wow, so you started in (Vancouver) Vancouver and you went all the way down to San Diego. (Right) How far is that? How many miles?\nTerry: Ah, depending on the route that you take, it's about 1800 miles, give or take.\nTodd: Man, so do you train before you do this?\nTerry: Actually no. For this particular trip I didn't do any training. I just started out in, once, I took the bus from Salt Lake City up to Vancouver and got to the bus station in Vancouver and put my bicycle together, put the gear on the bicycle. On the first day I rode, I only rode 25 miles and then I slowly increased the miles. So I guess it's kind of training as you go.\nTodd: Man, that's incredible. Now, is this the first bicycle trip you've ever done? \nTerry: No, I've actually done five, I don't know, I've probably done four or five long trips in the United States.\nTodd: Man, that's, do you always go along the West Coast?\nTerry: No, no, I've, originally, my first long trip was with a non-profit organization out of the United States -- Adventure Cycling, and we cycled the Trans-America trail, as it's know. It goes from Yorktown, Virginia to Astoria, Oregon. That was a three month self-contained camping trip with a group of about 13 people.\nTodd: Wow, and you rode all the way from Virginia on the East Coast to Oregon on the West Coast. (Right) and how many miles was that?\nTerry: Um, it's about 4,300 miles.\nTodd: Oh,that's a long way. Wow!\nTerry: But you just, it's like eating an elephant one bite at a time. One day at a time. Wow, that's cool.\nTodd: All right, thanks. We'll talk more about your bicycle trip, but thanks Terri.\nTerry: Sure.",

I mean, I prefer to own my own home instead of always renting an apartment somewhere.\n\nTodd: Yeah, but see, I think it's better to rent, cause you know, when you rent a house, you don't have to worry about losing your job, or if you have to relocate. You don't have to worry about if there's a natural disaster, and in Florida you seem to love those hurricanes down there.\n\nMark: That's definitely true.\n\nTodd: You know.\n\nMark:But there's something about owning your own house, that's just, this is my house but I'm renting. It's like someone else, you know, I mean someone else does own your house, and you know, there's that feeling of like, you depend on them, you know for lodging but if it's your house, you own it, then there's a sense of independency there.\n\nTodd: Yeah, that true. That's a good point but on the other hand, I just love my free time, and when you rent, you just got more free time. You know when you own a house. You have to do maintenance. You have to do all the paperwork for taxes, and you know, city government stuff, like that. When you rent it's just really easy.\n\nMark:Well, you know, the maintenance stuff can be fun. It depends on how you look at it. Like, you know, if it's your house, you actually might be motivated to make it look better cause it's, you take pride in, you know, where you live and it's your house, and what do you do in your free time anyway? Like what do you do in your free times?\n\nTodd: What do I do in my free time?\n\nMark: Yeah.\n\nTodd: Well, I don't fix pipes and work on plumbing and garden, that's for sure.\n\nMark: But, well, but why not?

Is that true? Jeff: Yes. It's true. People often ask me how do you get in shape? How do you stay in shape? What should I do? And they always say should I exercise, exercise, exercise and I always answer no. You can do a little bit of exercise but what really matters more is your diet: what you eat and how you eat. I think people don't realize that I think it's more important, your eating habits than your exercising habits.Todd: Yeah, you know, earlier you were talking about discipline and I have very good discipline when it comes to work and to exercise. I exercise every day, but I have no discipline when it comes to eating. I eat terrible foods.Jeff: The thing is though that a lot of people think that only the delicious food is the foods that's not healthy, but I think once you... it's like everything else, once you start doing something you can sort of become to enjoy and like more healthy food. Chips are good, but if you start eating vegetables, fruits, bananas, apples and oranges, your body will start to develop a taste for those, so that when you eat potato chips they're not as good as a nice fresh piece of fruit. It sounds strange but, yeah, your body begins to enjoy foods that are healthy.Todd: Well, you are a very lean person, very fit, so what type of diet do you follow? What foods do you tend to eat?Jeff: Lots of things that are not fried. That are not heavy in carbohydrates, like breads, and rices and things like this. Lighter food, fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, lots of fish. I tend to stay away from meat cause it's very heavy and pork. It's heavy. But lighter things. And I don't eat so much. I always eat so that I'm not full. I'm not stuffed. And then lots of good snacks, light snacks: peanuts and rice crackers or fruit or... Any junk food, I don't eat much junk food and I don't eat any thing that's fried and I also stay away from sauces, oils and butter and heavy salad dressings and things like that.Todd: What about beverages?Jeff: Of course you have to stay away from soda, in Canada we say pop. So you stay away from pop, but yeah, drink lots of water and drink lots of juice and you can become lean and mean, a lean, mean fighting machine.Todd: So you're saying that if you follow this diet you will be a lean, mean fighting machine?Jeff: That's what I'm saying: a lean, mean fighting machine.",

        "transcript": "Tom: Jess, you were talking before about mistakes that your Hungarian students always made, and how some students from the same country all make the same mistakes again and again and again. Well, I work here in Thailand and they have a very cute phrase, \"same, same\" which I think means to describe something as being the same as something else, I spend five - ten minutes talking to a student explaining that instead of using same same, she should use \"the same as\" and I was trying to get this phrase over to her and finally she understood what I meant and she looked at me and said, \"Ah, same as same same same same\".\nJess: In Spain I think the most common mistake was that in Spanish the noun people is a singular noun. You would say \"le gente es\" so when my Spanish speakers would use this noun they would always say, \"Oh the people is very hungry\" or \"the people is very quiet\" and I spent most of my time in Spain going \"are - are -are\" after these, the people even upper intermediate, advanced learners will still making that mistake. \nIn France, one very common mistake was the pronuciation error. The sound \"Th\" at the beginning words, for example, \"there\" or \"those\" that the French would pronounce with a zed sound, so \"zere\" or \"zose\" and I was very reluctant to correct it because it's such a sexy accent and it sounds so much more gorgeous with the French \"ZZ\" but I did have to correct it and I was always in France sticking my tongue out of my mouth to emphasize to them that there tongue needed to be forward to their teeth to make the correct sound. You said you worked in Libya. What were the common mistakes for Libyan students?Tom: One that always made me smile was when a cheery student or the security guard at the school or people that I met around the compound where I was living would give me a cheery wave and say \"How are you? I'm fine\" and it took me a good month or two before I realized that in Arabic the question and answer to go together. It just sounds strange in English. I thought they were jumping the gun by answering their own question.Jess: Sounds like they were talking to themselves. And how about in Japan?Tom: Now, Japanese have another common phrase which I think it used both in Japanese and because it comes from English they use it in English to. It's \"so-so\". I'm not quite sure when you might use it. It's when things are not quite good, not quite bad, so if you say, \"hey, how are you doing?\", they will say \"so-so\" or if you say, \"Hey, how's your food?\" they'll say, \"so-so\". It's not English and the first few months I had of hearing that, I really couldn't quite work out. I understood the meaning, but I knew that it was not something I would ever say, but the difficulty there is trying to think of a good alternative. It's that kind of non-commital, I don't really care answer. I like strong opinions. I love it. I hate it. Let's leave this so-so.Jess: I agree. It's like over use of the adjective nice. It just sounds really bland.",

This is the best chance to get a job.George: What do you mean?Crystal: Well, I don't know, like, I think this is your last chance to get a job before you graduate. Or what do you plan on after graduating? Just hanging around? Playing games?George: I don't know. I have no idea what to do after graduation. Do you have any plans?Crystal: Well, for me ... well, since the economy is going bad, like there is no opening at the moment, but I was thinking if I could be able to like find an internship in a different country or maybe I could keep doing my part-time job at the moment just until things start getting better. Well, I guess you still have nine months left.George: Yeah. It's a little depressing though thinking about graduation. Being thrown out into the real world.Crystal: All my friends who graduated, they're already regretting. They want to go back to school.George: Oh, boy!Crystal: Speaking of which, how about we go to grad school?George: No!Crystal: Why not?George: Grad School!Crystal: Why not?George: I don't know if I could deal with another four years of school.Crystal: It's not four years. It's only two years, and plus, like, I mean, if you're gonna regret so much like getting a job, like, and plus the economy is really bad for a job right now, I think it's best to lay low and just, you know maybe study a little bit more till the economy gets better and then get a job then.George: Well, if I could get some sort of full scholarship, perhaps I would be more inclined to do it, but ...Crystal: Yeah, yeah. It's not bad.George: I don't think I could get a scholarship with my horrible G.P.A.?Crystal: Same here!George: Hmm! Grad school!",

        "transcript": "Todd: OK, Sarah, how long have you been in Japan?\n\t\t\t            Sarah: I've been in Japan for two months. I came in April. \n\t\t\t            Todd: Again, when did you come to Japan?\n\t\t                Sarah: Two months ago. \n\t\t                Todd: OK, and what do you think about Japan?\n\t                    Sarah: It's a very interesting country. I expected a very big culture shock when I first came here because I've never been to Asia. I've always taught in Europe and I've been to America but they were all places that weren't particularly different from England, like Japan, but I didn't have any culture shock and I don't know if it's just because I was in an environment with other English speaking people and I was in a company where it's very secure and safe so there was not need to have that kind of shock but I think the differences here are just unbelievable. It's very difficult to explain it to somebody who's never been to Japan before, so talking on the phone about being here, talking to someone back in England is very difficult to explain to them how different it is here.\n\t                    Todd: Yeah, what do you think about the food? \n                        Sarah: I like the food because I like fish so I was lucky, so the food, I've tried some different things, tried to be adventurous.\n                        Todd: And the people?\n                        Sarah: Ah, the people are nice, very nice, first quite difficult to, when teaching, very very different than teaching Europeans, particularly the Austrian people from my experience are very loud and forthcoming, and at first they were very, very quite, and we've seen quite a difference now that they've got to know us, and they've opened up quite a lot and it's easier, but generally I find the people very kind in the streets. When we meet people they're always very helpful, very kind.\n                        Todd: Yeah, I think Japanese people are, that's one of their best traits. Yeah, they're very, very sweet. OK, what do you think about the weather?\n                        Sarah: Yeah, very changeable. I was quite surprised. Most people think that in England the weather is very, very bad but here it's, the rain is just unbelievable. I've never seen rain like this before. It's just very, very changeable and it can be hot for a minute and then the next day it's quite cold.\n                        Todd: And now, it's very loud. You live by the train tracks. What do you think of the trains? \n                        Sarah: The service, or?\n                        Todd: Or just overall? Do you like the trains? Do you like living by the train? \n                        Sarah: I'm not, I don't think about living by the trains, but I think the trains are very, they're always on time, always very frequent, very good service but I have never seen so many people get on a train before.\n                        Todd: Yeah, they are very crowded.",

Took a boat around Manhattan and went to a show on Broadway.\n\t\t                Marion: That must of have been exciting. \n\t                    Mauve: Oh, it was great. It was brilliant.

It was called, it was called \"Wonderful Town!\" I had never heard of it before but we just cued and got tickets during the day and whatever we could get we just went to see it. Yeah, but it was really, it was a comedy as well. It was really funny, and there was dance. It was very good.\n                        Marion: Mm, yeah, so would you go back to New York?\n                        Mauve: Yeah, I would, definitely. Um, it's funny though, like after I spent a week there, and after the week I feel I really know it very well, you know, we did a lot of walking, went to all the different districts, Chinatown, So-Ho, Grenich Village, and Central Park kind of, it's very easy to find your way around as well. \n                        Marion: All right. Yeah, that's good. With the grid system, which Dublin doesn't have. You know Dublin for a tourists it's probably harder to find their way around. It's not as sign posted or well signaled. Not as well laid out kind of thing.\n                        Marion: Yeah! Which of the kind of the areas did you prefer in New York. Did you have, like,one favorite?\n                        Mauve: Um, I really liked Chinatown. Chinatown was lovely. We went into lots of little small shops and it was lovely, like, you know, really quaint little places. We ate in a few, we ate in one place there as well. It was nice \n                        Marion: Yeah, real Chinese food.\n                        Mauve: Yeah, exactly and like all Chinese people walking around. It's funny. You walk around chinatown and you just see Chinese people and you walk into the Italian district, you know, Little Italy, and you just, people are speaking Italian. It's fun, you know, when you're in one city \n                        Marion: And the kind of change from one to the other, obvious as well. \n                        Mauve: Yeah, exactly, yeah! See you kind of forget you're in New York, almost. \n                        Marion: Cool. Thanks Mauve.",

At times there are still some things that are a little bit difficult but for the most part, I don't have a culture shock anymore.Joel: For example? Michele: Something that I still struggle with?Joel: Yes.Michele: Well, there's still the language barrier because I'm still not fluent in Japanese so, like today I went to the bank and I was trying to do something that was a little out of the ordinary I guess I just had some trouble and I couldn't get it done.Joel: And you said you had gone back to the United States...Michele: Canada.Joel: I'm sorry. You had gone back to Canada and did you have kind of reverse culture shock when you went back?Michele: Yes, I did actually. I... at that time, I had lived in Japan for about three years and I returned to Canada and I was so used to living in Japan and I guess I had to change my thinking and behaviors a little bit while I was in Japan so when I went back to Canada I felt like, \"OK, now I have to change back.\"Joel: The first thing I noticed when I had gone back to the United States was in the grocery store, the supermarket, when I was buying my food the cashier would talk to me and ask me questions.Michele: Right.Joel: And when I lived in Asia, the cashiers, they never talk to you, and it just threw me off. It threw me off guard. I was very surprised at how much just people you don't know will approach you and talk to you and ask you questions.Michele: Right.Joel: And also, you're planning to move back soon again?Michele: Well, I'm going to go back Canada in the summer for my holidays but then I'll be back in Japan.Joel: Oh, I see. What do you think you'll miss most while you're gone?Michele: What will I miss about Japan?Joel: Yeah.Michele: I think I'll miss the food the most.

        "transcript": "Chris: Hi, Adelina.  So, let's talk about ... about life in general.  Could you tell me a bit how ... how has been your life, some highlights up till now?\nAdelina: Well, I don't know.  I can say my life is like a roller coaster so I don't know, I think life is all about learning lessons and I completely agree when they say that when you stop learning lessons then you are ready to die.  So I don't know, I think I'm learning experiences and lessons every day.\nChris: Explain me why you would say you're like a roller coaster, your life is a roller coaster.  Like, you travel a lot or you ...  I don't know, explain that.\nAdelina: Yeah, my life is a roller coaster because I hate routine so because of that I travel a lot and I change job a lot and I change friends a lot.  Well, I still keep them but I'm not with them I'm not like a girl that lives in a village and she always hangs out with the same people and everything so that's why maybe my learning experiences are much more in volume than a person that they are like robots that they do every day the same routine and the same things all over again so they will learn less lessons than me for example.\nChris: So in a way you're not like a stable person?\nAdelina: No I'm not.  Who wants to be a stable person?\nChris: Well, I guess there are different opinions about that.\nAdelina: Yeah, of course but it's like for me, to do every day the same, to have all the future so planned, it's like a movie you've already seen.\nChris: Yeah, that seems more like ... like you said that you're quite spiritual that you have a lot philosophies about that but it could also turn out bad for you.\nAdelina: Why?\nChris: I mean, of course, you're not a stable person, you want to try new things but not everything you try has a happy ending.\nAdelina: No, but I think if I keep trying I will find my happy ending, but my really happy ending.\nChris: I guess that's the real idea behind learning.\nAdelina: Yeah, and also to get better, to challenge yourself.  Like, I don't know, I'm very critic with myself and I think it's good because at the end of the day, it's the only way you can get better.\nChris: Yeah, and is there an example, a highlight of, for example when you fail that something and learn that important lesson in life?\nAdelina: I don't know, I cannot say something specific. but I fail ... when I fail I don't blame anybody else, I blame myself because I trust people or because I put too much faith in something. I don't have the only control of it.  That's when I fail, when I trust other people and there are so many people with two faces and they don't turn the way they are selling themselves, you know.  So that's when I fail because I trust too much.\nChris: Okay, thanks for that.\nAdelina: Thank you.",

Fred: Well, for myself, I can say that being Canadian, it's not in my blood or anything... to know how to dance.Todd: The Canadian salsa.Fred: The Canadian salsa. Right. If such a thing would exist. That would be great. But in fact, yeah, for me it was quite a challenge because I didn't know so much about salsa when I first started dancing when I was maybe 14 years old, where I got interested, and so I started to take some lessons in Canada and then I started dancing a bit and then I decided to do an exchange program in Spain for two years, where of course, in a latin country people dance more, those kind of dances, so I could take some lessons from a professional Argentinian tango teacher which taught me a lot about listening to the music, the rhythm and everything like that, so I really got into it so since then, since I'm 14 years old, so it's been close to 8, 9 years now that I've been dancing South American dances.Todd: That's a pretty good background.Katia: It's very good, and you can tell right away. You put on the music, the latin music on and there goes Fred dancing. Fred: I just can't stop myself. I really enjoy it. It's fun.Todd: The pride of Canada.... Katia, how about yourself?Katia: OK, my background. Well, I'm half Mexican, half Russian so I do have the latin blood and European or Russian blood, and I started dancing when I was very young. My mother was a ballet teacher, so that's where I took it from.Todd: So you started out in the ballet?Katia: Yes, classical ballet. Classical ballet, that was my first type of dance, and after that, of course, I mostly grew up in Mexico, so there was a lot of salsa and merengue always around so I grew up with both classical ballet and latin dance and then of course I started to learning a little bit more about different dances. I like belly dance and also ballroom dance, or sports dance, which includes cha-cha, and waltz, and fox-trot, a little bit of tango, which I was not very successful, unfortunately, at least yet.Todd: You can't be successful at everything, so.Katia: Why not? No, but after I've been teaching for many years, since I was 17 years old, I was teaching in Mexico and then I moved to the United States. I was also teaching there, classical ballet, and now here. I also held a few dancing jobs. I worked in a circus, dancing.Todd: Get out of here. You worked in a circus?Katia: I worked in a circus, and I also worked in Las Vegas with... as a back.. in the back of the stage. There's an impersonator, for example Janet Jackson or Micheal Jackson, or Elvis Presley, and I was one of the back dancers.Todd: Wow, you guys are the perfect team.Katia: We... I think, we are the perfect team.Fred: Yeah, I think, we are a pretty good match but I really do think that Katia is a great teacher as well as being a good dancer.Katia: But, I do believe that many of our female dancers, when they come to salsa, they see Fred and they really feel motivated to see somebody that is not Latin and being able to dance how he does, so I think Fred inspires a lot of people.Todd: So, yeah, for anybody out there that are interested, this school is in Beppu which is in Kyuushuu Japan and I wish you the best of luck.Fred: Thank you so much.Katia: Thank you.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So I’m here in Bangkok with\n                                Jerri and she is Thai. And, Jerri, I thought we would\n                                talk about Thai islands. \n\nJerri: Of course. \n\nTodd: So there are some major islands.\n                                Can you first talk about the major resort islands in\n                                Thailand?\n\nJerri: Yes. So as most of you know,\n                                Thailand is probably visited because of its islands. So\n                                the most well-known ones would be Phuket and Koh Samui,\n                                which are both down South in Surat Thani. And yeah, I\n                                think those are like the main destinations. They have\n                                changed quite a lot since the last 10 years. It’s quite\n                                developed, so it’s an island where, you know, if you\n                                really want like a very nice resort and have like a\n                                convenient place, like malls are everywhere. There’s\n                                also like international schools so a lot of people now\n                                move to live at Phuket or Koh Samui. It’s like a little\n                                Bangkok but by the beach. \n\nTodd: Oh, really? Wow. And Phuket\n                                really developed quickly after the terrible tsunami,\n                                right? So it’s really rebounded and now it’s quite\n                                vibrant. Correct?\n\nJerri: Yes, yes, yes. Correct, yeah. \n\nTodd: Okay. So both Samui and Phuket\n                                are the more traditional maybe tourist package islands. \n\nJerri: Yes. \n\nTodd: Are there some smaller islands\n                                or less known islands that you would recommend?\n\nJerri: Yes. We have a lot of islands\n                                in Thailand. Just near Koh Samui, you have Koh Phangan,\n                                which is also known for its full moon party. That is the high season, but Koh Phangan is actually really\n                                nice apart from the full moon. If you visit the other\n                                less well-known beaches, Hat Rin, which is where the\n                                full moon party happens. There’s a lot of hidden beaches\n                                that is very quiet, very relaxed, and it’s not as\n                                developed as Koh Samui so you still feel that island\n                                lifestyle. There’s a lot of small businesses, local\n                                shops. \n\nTodd: Oh, that sounds nice. You know,\n                                I actually have not been to Koh Phangan but I’ve been to\n                                Koh Tao. And that’s the diving island, correct?\n\nJerri: Yes, yes, yes. \n\nTodd: Yeah. Can you talk about that?\n\nJerri: Yes, of course. So Koh Tao is\n                                known for its crystal clear water and corals for diving,\n                                so a lot of people go there to get their diving\n                                certificate. That’s actually the best place to do it.\n                                And you can spend like three days there, do the course,\n                                and then the island itself is also quite remote. So\n                                there’s a few stores, not as much as in Koh Phangan. But\n                                yeah, it’s nice and quiet, and…\n\nTodd: Oh, that’s beautiful. There’s\n                                some other ones too, right? So there’s Koh Chang. Can\n                                you talk about that? \n\nJerri: Yes. Koh Chang is closer to\n                                Bangkok so you can drive there. It takes about five\n                                hours. It’s in Trat Province. Koh Chang is a big, big\n                                island. And yeah, some people like it, some people\n                                don’t, because it’s less vibrant, I would say,\n                                compared to like Koh Samui or Phuket. But there’s a lot\n                                of big resorts there and the beach is also really\n                                beautiful. \n\nTodd: Yeah, I have to confess.\n                                It’s my favorite island by far. \n\nJerri: Yeah, yeah. \n\nTodd: So I first went there 25 years\n                                ago and it was really quiet then. I mean, incredibly\n                                quiet. And the movie came out, The Beach.\n\nJerri: Right. \n\nTodd: I remember when I saw that\n                                movie, I’m like, “Oh, that’s Koh Chang.” There was\n                                nothing to do on the island, and so that’s… It’s\n                                beautiful. It’s a natural park, correct?\n\nJerri: Yes, yes. Correct, yeah. \n\nTodd: There’s another little one near\n                                Bangkok called Koh Samet, correct?\n\nJerri: Right. Yes, yes. That’s a very\n                                popular one, especially for Thais to go during the\n                                weekend. It’s like a two-hour drive from Bangkok, in\n                                Chonburi Province. All you do is you drive there and\n                                then you take a quick boat, about 30 minutes. It’s also\n                                a national park so there’s entrance fee, but it’s really\n                                nice. The beaches are smaller but there’s like different\n                                beaches and a recommended activity would be just to rent\n                                a bike and then drive around the island. Takes about\n                                like a half a day but all the beaches have their own\n                                unique character, which is nice to see. \n\nTodd: Oh, that’s so awesome. Actually,\n                                when I was there years ago, I don’t think they had the\n                                road around the island. \n\nJerri: Yeah. \n\nTodd: But I remember they had… It was\n                                just amazing, beautiful beaches. \n\nJerri: Yeah. \n\nTodd: So there’s two more that are\n                                quite famous or one that’s very famous, and that’s Koh\n                                Phi Phi. That’s way down in the South. And there’s also\n                                Koh Lanta which is not too far away, I think, as well.\n                                So can you talk about those?\n\nJerri: Yes. These two I haven’t\n                                visited. I don’t remember visiting them but I know a lot\n                                of people go there for its clear water. And Koh Phi Phi,\n                                I believe, has the well-known sand in the middle of the\n                                ocean that you can walk across one island to the other,\n                                and it’s known for taking a boat and the water is very\n                                clear. And Koh Lanta… Yeah, Koh Lanta, I think it’s also\n                                known for the same reason as Koh Phi Phi, for its\n                                crystal clear water and there’s beautiful resorts there,\n                                too. \n\nTodd: Great. Okay, so I’m going to put\n                                you on the spot. If you had to choose one island to\n                                visit, recommend one place, where would you go?\n\nJerri: Koh Phangan. \n\nTodd: Koh Phangan!\n\nJerri: Without thinking, yes.\n                                Absolutely, yes. \n\nTodd: Really? And why?\n\nJerri: It’s always… It’s a place that\n                                feels like home to me because my mom is there, as well.\n                                So we know the locals, which makes a difference.\n                                And also, I think the island hasn’t – you know, it’s not\n                                developed but there’s also like things to see and you\n                                really feel like you’re on holiday, really feel like\n                                you’re going on an adventure. \n\nTodd: Oh, man. I think I want to go\n                                there right now. \n\nJerri: Yeah. \n\nTodd: I’m serious. I have a week and\n                                I’m like, “I’m going to go an island!”",

        "transcript": "This conversation is continued from #825. Katia, Fred, and Todd are talking about stray cats in their neighborhood and whether something should be done about them.Todd: So, then the question is, do you think something should be done about the cats? Should they be taken away? Should they be just left?Katia: The first thing I would ask, what can be done? I don't think it would be fair to feed them and then just take them somewhere else. I think maybe, so they would not have more kittens, that would be something to help the problem, if there is a problem, but that's something that would be good to do.Todd: To?Katia: To... for the, for... so they would not have more kittens.Todd: Right.Katia: So, it would not get so many cats.Todd: Right, so I'm sorry, you're saying they should be left alone but not just fed?Katia: I think not. I think once you start feeding them, it's very hard to just stop feeding them, and I think for the elderly people, it's a pleasure to do this. I see many times in the little corners, there's like umbrellas for the cats when it rains, they have a little house, so the people do like the cats and they take care of them, so it would not just be taking care of the cats and getting rid of them, but also for the elderly people, it gives them something to do, I think.Todd: Well, that's a good point. Fred, what do you think?Fred: I would have to agree with Katia.Todd: She's like point. Ting.Katia: What about you, Todd? What do you think? Todd: Well, you know, I don't really have any point. I think, I do feel sorry for the cats and I do want to help them, but like you said I feel like if I feed them it's going to make the problem get worse, but I don't want to see them suffer. So, like today, there was a cat on my deck and I gave it a tuna sandwich.Fred: You did.Todd: Yeah. So... and it was so hungry too. Man, it ate that sandwich pretty fast, so actually, it was really sad. It was... my desk is by like the window,and it's up on the balcony, and I hear this rapping on the window and I open the window, and I kid you not, the cat, a little kitten was looking at me with sad eyes, like \"feed me\" and it's a stray cat, and like it knew that it could give me, just give me a sad look and I would feed it. So I did of course.Katia: No, I think it's natural to feed them in...Todd: So, basically the cats have us hostage.There's nothing we can do cause we feel guilty.Fred: Yeah.Katia: They're smart.Fred: Real smart cats.",

How is it different?Fred: It's very different because, well, actually, Santa Claus comes on the 25th of December. He doesn't come of the 6th of December. I've never heard that before, and so Santa Claus, well, as I just mentioned comes on the 25th, and then he has these little helpers. They're called elves. He has many of them, and also they live in the North Pole and together they work at making the toys for the kids.Anja: Oh, really, so they live in the North Pole and not in the forest like the Swiss Santa Claus?Fred: No, they live in the North Pole.Anja: That must be cold.Fred: Yeah, well you see, it's true yeah, you're right. It is cold but the idea is that it's Christmas and so in Canada or in the United States it is cold. There's a lot of snow and so the image of Santa Claus is actually like snow. He has a big white beard, and he's dressed in this red suit, you know, and he also has a wife.Anja: Oh, he does?Fred: Yeah, Mama Santa Claus.Anja: Oh, really, I didn't know that.Fred: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so they work together at bringing the kids their gifts that they've ordered, because you see in Canada the kids, maybe a month ealier...or two, three weeks before the 25th write a list of what they want for Christmas.Anja: Oh, really. That must be a pretty long list. I remember when I was a kid, I always had a lot of things I wanted.Fred: Yeah, I think so, so Santa Claus has a lot of work right.Anja: Oh, poor Santa Claus.Fred: And so the kids write a list, and so for instance if somebody wants a bike, he writes, 'I want a bike' and then the list is being sent to the address in the North Pole. Santa Claus takes this into consideration, meaning that if the kid has been good all through the year, he will be receiving that gift, but if he hasn't, then maybe he won't get the gift on the 25th.Anja: Oh, so better be good if you want your presents.Fred: That's right.",

        "transcript": "Hi, everyone. Thanks for coming to this short presentation on our new product design. As you know, we've already redeveloped our 'Adventure' shampoo to make it more modern and appealing. And we've renamed it 'Adventure Tech'. Our market research established the target market as men in the 18–40 age range who like to be outdoors and also like technical gadgets, such as smartwatches, drones and things like that. We needed to create a bottle which appeals to that market.\n\nSo, today, I'm happy to unveil our new bottle design. As you can see, it's designed to look like a black metal drinking flask, with some digital features printed on it.\n\nI'd like to talk you through the following three points: the key features, sizing and our timeline for production.\n\nFirstly, you'll notice it has an ergonomic design. That means it fits smoothly into your hand and can be easily opened and squeezed using one hand. And, it looks like a flask you might use when hiking outdoors. The imitation digital displays are designed to remind the user of other tech devices they may have, such as a smartwatch or smart displays in their home.\n\nI'd now like to tell you about the sizes. It comes in two sizes: the regular size and a small travel size. The travel size is the same type of design – a flask, also with imitation digital displays on the bottle. We were thinking of starting with one and following with the travel-size in a few months, but we've worked hard and both are ready now.\n\nFinally, I'm going to talk to you about our timeline for production. You've probably heard that we're launching in two months. In preparation for that, we're starting the marketing campaign next month. You can see the complete overview of all phases in this Gantt chart.\n\nIn summary, the bottle's been designed for men who like adventure and technology, and it comes in two sizes. The marketing campaign is starting next month and we're launching the product in two months.\n\nOK. So, any questions? Feel free to also email me for further information in case we run out of time.",

        "transcript": "Lindsay: So, Jake we were just talking about zoos. Now, I'm curious. What do you think about hunting? Do you like hunting? Jake: Not really. I know a lot of people who do hunt though. Lindsay: What do they hunt?Jake: Well, deer mostly and sometimes grouse and different birds. Lindsay: Do they use a gun or a bow and arrow?Jake: They use guns.Lindsay: Yeah, I don't know about hunting. I'm not a really big fan of hunting.Jake: Yeah, a lot of people enjoy it I guess, and plus they get to eat the animals after they hunt them.Lindsay: Yeah, my father was a very big hunter. He actually kept a big rifle gun and would go pheasant hunting twice a year. He would always come back with this nasty pheasant and put it in our freezer but my mom never knew how to cook it so it would just stay in our freezer forever. Jake: So you never ate the pheasant?Lindsay: We never ate the pheasant. But in general both my mom and I were very upset with my father for hunting. We just didn't think he needed to go out and shoot poor animals. Jake: But he must have really enjoyed it to go against you and your mother's wishes and go hunting all the time.Lindsay: That's a good point. He did really enjoy it and basically he just did what he wanted to do, but have you ever eaten a hunted deer?Jake: Yes, I have, and it was pretty good actually.Lindsay: Does it taste different than cow?Jake: It's not the same as cow definitely, but it's not a really unusual tasting meat either, I would say.Lindsay: OK, so someone went and hunted the deer and then served it to you?Jake: Yes.Lindsay: And that was OK for you?Jake: Yes, it was OK for me because I eat cow and chicken all the time and I don't see how that's different.Lindsay: Yeah, but this deer was in the wild, and what if it was a mother?Jake: Well, some of the cows that we eat are mothers as well.Lindsay: You think so? I never really thought about that. I guess you're right, but something about the idea of going out and shooting a poor deer. It just reminds me of Bambi. It's so sad.",

It tastes like different and just… if I find a juicy one and it’s my wonder of the world maybe. It’s really hard to find it anywhere else outside of Indonesia maybe because lack of lambs? I don’t know.Todd: Yeah, maybe.Ivan: So once I find one I really cherish that moment.Todd: Now in your city, is it common for people to eat in street stalls?Ivan: Yes, we have lots of hawkers in Jakarta. I mean, you can find meat ball sellers, you can find any street smoking vender shops and then you can find any… yeah, you can eat Nasi Goreng or Mi Goreng in the road also. Like maybe, well usually, when there’s a traffic jam going on, usually when you can find some hawkers you can just “Hey, I want Nasi Goreng”, they just go get and give it to us and you can eat.Todd: From your car, you call to the people and they bring you the food?Ivan: Yeah, yeah they bring you the food. Or maybe sometimes we just park in anywhere and then if you see a hawker that sells Nasi Goreng you can just order and you can eat in there.Todd: Wow, that’s pretty cool.Ivan: Yeah, so it’s anywhere, basically, you can eat anywhere.Todd: I think I would gain a lot of weight.Ivan: Yeah, so…",

Dogs can make good companions.Lyndsay: Yeah, I think so. That's why we want to get one, but the problem is our apartment is really small. Do you think my apartment is too small for the dog?Jake: It could be. Dogs can get very lonely too is don't take care of them.Lindsay: Yeah, everyone keeps warning me about the fact that not only is my apartment small but I'm not home a lot and either is my fiance so the dog will be home a lot of the time by itself.Jake: Well, then maybe you'd better reconsider getting one.Lyndsay: But they're so cute and I'll walk it in the morning and when I come home from work. I mean, do you think that that will be OK for the dog?Jake: Well, I'm not so sure. Personally, I don't really see what's so great about having a dog anyway.Lindsay: Oh, what! You don't like dogs?Jake: Not really. I mean, well, first of all, I'm a little bit afraid of them. I think maybe I was attacked when I was very young, but I don't like them very much.Lyndsay: So you're afraid of them or you don't like them, or both?Jake: Both. I think also, sometimes they're kind of dirty inside of the house. They leave lots of pet hair and sometimes they're not properly toilet trained.Lindsay: Well, of course. They're like babies. You have to train them to go outside, but once they're trained they can be wonderful companions, and I don't know they're pretty soft and cute and lovable.Jake: But I don't think it's worth the extra work. You have to clean up after them and of course, like you said, you have to train them.Lyndsay: But a dog will always love you. There's not another animal that's like that? That will always love you no matter what. Don't you think so? Can you think of another animal that will always love you?Jake: Cats maybe. Lindsay: No way. Cats are so finicky. Cats don't really like you, I feel like. I feel like the dog is there right when you walk in the door waiting for you to come home. A cat is out next door walking on the fence. They don't care about you.Jake: Yeah, you're right. I think dogs are more friendly than cats overall.Lyndsay: I think you're just afraid of dogs because you haven't had a good experience with a dog, but if I get a dog than you can come to my house and play with my dog.Jake: I am sure I would like your dog.Lindsay: Oh, good. OK. So please come to my house and play with my new dog, if I get one. I'm not sure yet.",

What's some advice you can give me on me learning Spanish?Lupe: Well, are you traveling by yourself to Mexico? Kara: Yes, I am. Lupe: OK. I think to start off that is great idea because I know when we took our trip to Mexico, it's a little bit different when you have someone else with you who speaks your primary language. It's so easy to just ask for help or ask that person to just say something for you, so I think you going and being there by yourself and not being around people that speak your primary language which is English is really going to help you with practicing your Spanish because I do believe that practice does make perfect, and it doesn't matter how many classes you take or how many books you read, you really have to practice, so for you to be around other people who speak Spanish is really going to get you involved and really going to get you to speak the language.Kara: And that's probably my biggest problem. I've taken a lot of Spanish classes and I learned in class but I've never liked to practice because I've always wanted to speak my Spanish perfectly. I've always wanted to be able to just start speaking and not have to worry about making a mistake.Lupe: Yeah, and you can't worry about things like that because you can't expect yourself, you know, to learn it quickly and learn it perfectly. Pronunciation is always hard but you have to understand that even when you don't pronounce everything perfectly, people are still gonna understand what you're trying to say, and the more you speak it, the better it's gonna get so you will perfect it with time so don't expect yourself to pronounce everything right the first time. That's really how you learn -- from your mistakes.",

I did at the elementary school back in Canada. \n\t\t\t            Todd: And what was that like? Like how did you actually teach computers.\n\t\t                Norman: Actually, I initiated a computer project. We were placed behind the gym, in the storage area. At the time we didn't have the state of the art computer labs. It was just starting in the eighties, it was like pioneering in the school. \n\t\t                Todd: Oh, OK, well was it pretty easy to do? \n\t                    Norman: Ah, it was kind of difficult because being in the gym, when the students would play basketball, the basketballs would bounce against the, it was just a wooden door, and the students wouldn't be able to hear me and it was kind of difficult as well to see the whole class as there was a wall that was separating my class, so I could see only half the class at a time. \n\t                    Todd: You could only see half the class and you were teaching computers!\n                        Norman: That's right! That's right, and so I would have two boards. One board at one end where I would teach the lesson to half the half the class, and then I'd walk over to the other end and do the same thing.\n                        Todd: Oh, man that must have been a nightmare!\n                        Norman: It was. It was, because I could never see what the other half was doing in my absence.\n                        Todd: So did they ever doing anything bad to get in trouble!\n                        Norman: Oh, yes, they were, they were. I can remember one instance when one student calls me over and he said, \"Mr. Groussier, I have water in my external drive. At the time you used floppy disks and put them in the external drive. I said, \"Water, oh no. There's no water!\" So, I went over and I tried to insert the floppy disk, and it just wouldn't, there seemed to be something blocking the floppy disk from going in so I peak in and sure enough I see that it's stuffed with watermelon. So, hence, that external disk drive was useless from then on. \n                        Todd: Wow, so how many years did you teach computers. \n                        Norman: Well, in that particular lab only one year and after that we moved to a full-fledged lab and I taught computer to my own class which meant once a week, a formal computer teaching and then we would go to the lab for other reasons like doing some research projects.\n                        Todd: Oh, Wow. Did you like it, teaching computers?\n                        Norman: In the computer lab, yes, because it was really well equipped with apple computers and printers and we had so many programs that students could use and do some really nice projects or nice cover pages, we had color printers and very efficient printers as well, so it was wonderful.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Tres can you talk about American high school. What was high school like for you? What is American high school like?Tres: That’s a very good question. When one says “an American high school”, to some people maybe movies that depict high school life come to mind. But the most thing I would like people to keep in mind is that depending on the school district, the state, the area of the state in which you live, the high school you go to can vary extremely. \nThere are many poor schools in poor districts. And there are very rich schools similar to the “Beverly Hills 90210” television show, that’s quite popular around the world. I was fortunate to go to a high school that was a public school under a magnet program. And the idea was that you have a test to get in to the school. You have to excel academically. And the school would try to suck in, or attract students from all over the state, students that excelled in the math and sciences, sports, English, literature, foreign languages, and tried to bring those students together. Not only that, the idea of the school was to create an atmosphere that was “biologically diverse”. That just sounds better than “racially diverse”. So we had students of various socioeconomic backgrounds, meaning we had students of various races. Even though I don’t think “race” truly exist. But sociologically speaking, we had students of various races. At the school you could take classes from Italian to classical English. Many of our teachers had Ph.D.s so it was just a great academic atmosphere to be in. And then, we had a lot of fun on top of that. The first few years I went there, we had an open campus, which meant that during our lunch, we were able to get in our cars because we all drove to school. Get in our cars and drive home or drive to our friend’s house or drive to a restaurant during our lunch period. So we didn’t have to stay at school for lunch. We were completely free. And the school was very liberal. So the teachers had a very open idea of how students learn, and they wanted to make sure that we were learning in a way that was best for us. Now that doesn’t mean that they were not strict on us. When we did something bad, when we were in trouble, they let us know. But still many of our teachers were very open, and they would give us hugs if we needed hugs. \nTodd: The teachers would give you hugs. Tres: Yes, I know some schools, many teachers would want to keep that professional  distance. But I think when you’re working with children, always keep in mind that they are young adults. And they need to be taught a good model to fit into society. I think one of those models is reaching out to others when they are in trouble. Sometimes you know, a student may need a hug, be it your friend or be it a teacher. So I really enjoyed getting hugs from my principal, so I always give hugs to everybody. Todd: Wow, that’s a lot different from my high school.",

They’re the ultimate in cool.\n\nPresenter: But they’re not very new, are they?\n\nJed: Well, no, but the modern ones are better than ever and last October was the first ever world championship in China. The price is coming down, too. Now you can buy one for 600 to 2,000 dollars. It’s still too expensive for me, but I suppose it’ll keep coming down.\n\nPresenter: OK, what about useful new inventions?\n\nJed: There are lots of those. There’s a new solar water distiller created by Gabriele Diamanti aimed at parts of the world where it’s hard to get clean drinking water. You pour in salty water and let the sun do the work for a few hours. Then, hey presto! You have clean water! It’s a very simple device and fairly cheap to produce.\n\nPresenter: Can I hear some doubt in your voice?\n\nJed: Well, they still need help with investment to start producing the distiller properly. So if anyone out there has money to invest in a great product …?\n\nPresenter: Absolutely. Get in touch with the designers.\n\nJed: Another useful invention which it would be good to see in production are ‘enable talk gloves’. These were invented by some Ukrainian students to allow people with speech and hearing impairments to communicate with people who don’t understand sign language. The gloves use sensors to translate sign language into text, then into spoken language using a smartphone. A brilliant invention!\n\nPresenter: Yes, that could benefit thousands of people.\n\nJed: Another useful invention comes from a surprising source, James Cameron, the film director.\n\nPresenter: The Titanic director?\n\nJed: The very same. Cameron was part of a team, headed by engineer Ron Allum, which designed the Deepsea Challenger Submarine, capable of descending to the lowest parts of the sea, 10 km down. Last year Cameron went down to the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the sea in the world. He was the first person to do a solo dive there, and he stayed for three hours, the longest time so far.\n\nPresenter: That sounds impressive!\n\nJed: Yes. We know so little about what’s at the bottom of the ocean, and it’s important to find out more. OK, so now for something useful in a different way. You know that feeling when you’re trying to get tomato ketchup out of a bottle and it won’t come out, but you’re sure there’s lots more in there?\n\nPresenter: Yeah, of course. It’s really annoying.\n\nJed: Well, a team of students at MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have come up with a new product that you use to coat a glass or plastic bottle, and then what’s inside, hair gel or mustard, or whatever, comes out really easily.\n\nPresenter: So, it saves hours of frustration trying to get stuff out of bottles?\n\nJed: Exactly. Right, now for my favourite invention. This is really silly, but I love it. It’s a way of producing clouds indoors.\n\nPresenter: Clouds?\n\nJed: Yes. A Dutch artist has come up with a way of forming perfect, small, white clouds inside. They’re just beautiful. I don’t think you can do it yourself at home yet, though.\n\nPresenter: I don’t think I’d want to.\n\nJed: Oh, you would if you’d seen the photos. They’re amazing.\n\nPresenter: OK, Jed, thanks for that. We’ll leave you with your head in the clouds and see you again next week!",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, going back to before you went in to the army, what made you get so big? Was it just that you were sitting all day? Were you eating hamburgers everyday or what were you doing?\nJade: I don't want to blame American culture ... but as you said, like pizzas, like especially not Italian pizza but like Pizza Hut, like American pizzas and hamburgers made me really big. And I really liked that ... like coke and stuff and that made me really big. I always liked reading books. Reading books and eating something was my only hobby that I did at my home. I really didn't like to exercise or join the soccer games with my friends. I was just a really quiet person, but in the army I had to change. I had to learn how to fight, I had to learn how to, you know, move my body Everything was for protect our country but besides that, I became more healthy too. I really appreciate that thing.\n                              \nTodd: Yeah, that is a great story actually. So ... but you said that you are healthy now and you've lost all this weight but you used to eat burgers and pizzas. Do you eat them still, sometimes?\nJade: Sometimes, yeah it's hard but you know, all the temptation of that is always tough but I'm still,you know, I won't deny that. I really like burgers or pizzas even now ... \nTodd: Oh I'm with you man, I like it too!\nJade: But I am trying to avoid it ... I still now, I prefer water than coke. But I still like, you know, sweet things or something but still now, you know last point, even I have changed a lot but I have to keep that 'til even now, but there is \"no pain, no gain\" - I got the word from the army ...\nTodd: Right\nJade: And I have to keep this, I wanna ... I like the way I am now and if I wanna keep this, I have to, you know, do many things for me. I have to pay it\nTodd: Well you look fantastic. I have only known you the size you are now, so I can't imagine you being 117 kilos so ... I can't wait to see the photos.\nJade: OK, I'll give you the photos later, you can see it. I'll show you that.\nTodd: OK, thanks man.\nJade: OK, see you later.",

I love comedy movies, and for me the most important thing about a movie is, does it have good dialog, does it have good writing, so I don't care about special effects, and stuff like that. It just doesn't interest me, and actually I don't like big Hollywood movies (OK) I think they're terrible.\nNitiya: Terrible!\nTodd: Yeah. (OK) What kind of movies do you like?\nNitiya: I guess a lot of adventure, like the movie like \"Star Gate\" and The beach\" and, and \"The Beach\" was not good but, I like something which is so different, something which is about the universe, or something which is about rockets and stuff like that.\nTodd: So you like movies that re quire... (detective movies also)... and what?\nNitiya: Detective.\nTodd: Oh, detective movies. (Yeah) So you like movies that require imagination?\nNitiya: Exactly.\nTodd: Now, since we're talking about movies, India has a very big movie industry, Bollywood, (Yeah) do you like the Bollywood movies?\nNitiya: It's great. (Yeah) Awesome. Yeah. I guess a lot of people in the whole world like it a lot.\nTodd: Bollywood, they always have so many people, like the thing is, where do they get all those actors?\nNitiya: Lots of actors, so much drama, and I guess a lot of music and dancing and it's just so different from Hollywood movies, so I guess for the reality, I prefer the Hollywood movie and if you just want to have some fun, it would be Bollywood movies.\nTodd: So, how often would you watch Bollywood and how often do you watch English?\nNitiya: Whatever I get.\nTodd: whatever you get.\nNitiya: I just love movies. I'm crazy behind movies.\nTodd: You're addicted to movies?\nNitiya: Very much.\nTodd: OK, you know in the states when you go to the movies, it's always coke, popcorn, hot dog. When you go to movies in India, what's the food that you eat?\nNitiya: Ok, coke is always there.\nTodd: Right.\nNitiya: And yeah, something like chips or potato chips or anything you get in your hands. Basically I don't like getting disturbed when I'm watching a movie. I'm a person who likes watching a movie very quietly. I don't like watching with friends. I mean, I prefer going who also like watching movies quietly. I mean there are some people in the world, they sit for the movie and they go, oh, this is going to happen next and things like that. I get so irritated. Let me watch it, concentrately.\nTodd: Right, I hate that.\nNitiya: I really want to do it quietly, peacefully. I just want to watch the movie. Not talk to the person sitting behind me.\nTodd: Ah, I totally agree. And I want to see the beginning, and I want to see the end.\nNitiya: Exactly.\nTodd: And no interruptions\nNitiya: Once I begin I really want to go till the end. (Right) I can't stop it in the middle and say, \"Oh, oh.\"\nTodd: Yeah, which do you prefer, watching it at the cinema, or on DVD at home?\nNitiya: At home.\nTodd: At home. So nobody bothers you?\nNitiya: Yep.\nTodd: Right. Yeah, same thing. OK, thanks, Natiya.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Hey Leath! \nDo you want to go ahead and talk about the story you we're going to say?\nLeath: OK. Yeah, this was about-- I'd say a year and a half ago and it was in Harare the capital, where my mom lives. \nI was on holiday back home seeing my mom and anyway it's a Sunday morning and I was in the shower. \nGot up pretty late, it must have been about half ten and all of a sudden my mom burst into the shower and she says,\" Leath, Leath, there's a snake, there's a snake in the kitchen.\" \nAnd so I thought, \"Ah, what kind of snake would this be?\" because we live in the capital, residential area almost high-rise. Well, not high rise but residential area. \nAnd so I put a towel around my waist and walked bad-temperedly throught to the kitchen. Attached to the kitchen we've got this little courtyard where we set out to have morning coffee and breakfast. It's tiled and leads onto a small garden. And so I walked out onto the courtyard and there was a seven foot Egyptian cobra. Wow! I was really, really blown away because I know a bit about snakes and I know that a bite from an Egyptian cobra in a country where antidote isn't readily available is almost certainly fatal. And there we were, my mom and I, with a seven foot Egyptian cobra slithering between the courtyard and our kitchen. And, eventually, we trapped it in the courtyard and I went to fetch guys who work for national parks. National parks are the guys who kind of look after animal problems\n                          within the city and brought them around. And we were hoping that they were going to catch it because Zimbabwe isn't so rich at the moment and stuff like that. They don't have the facilities to keep caught animals so unless it's endangered they just shoot it, so the guy shot our seven foot cobra. \nTodd: Oh, they shot it huh?\nLeath: Yeah, and we had to bury it out back. \nTodd: Really? Well, still I'm glad you just didn't want to be bitten or anything.\nLeath: No, no. No way.\nTodd: What a story. Thanks!",

        "transcript": "Dai: So, you mentioned coasteering. What is that?\nSharron: Right. What it is, it's organized by some groups of people. It can be quite dangerous but it's very well-run in that you all go out in wetsuits, and you'll go out for a few hours around the coast and what you basically do, is you're walking around the rocks of the coast right on the sea level, so areas that you can't actually walk around the coast on the rocks, you jump in the sea and swim, so lots of people like to do that, cause it's a little more dangerous with the sea currents and all the activities. You know, you could get stuck and ... but, you know, it's handled very well and it's quite a thrilling sport to do. \n                              \nDai: So, I guess you can like do jumping into the sea ...\nSharron: You jump in. They mainly ... you know they do it carefully, they mainly get you to jump in. Where you can't climb the rocks, you jump in and swim round to another area. You can climb up and it's just basically going from cove to cove on the sea ... on the sea level ... and around the sea rather than being up on the cliff, on the land walking around seeing the scenery you're actually down ...\nDai: Have you had a go at it?\nSharron: No, but I would like to. I can't find anybody to go with me yet.\nDai: So, if I was going to do coasteering, what kind of equipment would I need?\nSharron: I think they provide you with a full length wetsuit and the shoes that go with it as well. You'd also need ... probably to be a pretty good swimmer. You can't really go unless you can swim pretty well. But they have guides with you all the time. You don't go out in a group and do it on your own because that's far too dangerous. They know exactly the best places to go and I think it would probably cost, a day's activity like that, would probably cost you thirty pound each, I would imagine. I haven't been myself so I don't know exactly but ... \nDai: Thirty pounds.\nSharron: Yeah. Which is quite a lot of money but it is good fun and it's not something you'd do every day. It's a, you know, once a year ...\nDai: Sounds pretty reasonable, to me, for a day.\nSharron: Well, there's some beautiful things you can see. You see a lot more from that level down at the sea than you would ...\nDai: Oh, right. OK.\nSharron: Very often you'll have things like the sea lions or whatever you see close up the seals, sorry not the sea lions. You'll see close up and lots of different fish and things that you may not get to see.\nDai: Any sharks?\nSharron: I don't think so.\nDai: OK.\nSharron: No dangerous ones anyway. But you may see dolphins. We do have dolphins that come up and ...\nDai: ... oh nice\nSharron:  Yeah, really good. I don't think they come very close but then, you know, they can be seen.",

Spiders is OK.Todd: Oh, really, you don't mind snakes?Katia: Mm-hm.Todd: See I think snakes are much freakier.Fred: Yeah, I think snakes can be pretty freaky as well, but I think centipedes are scary because of the fact that if they bite you, then it becomes dangerous.Katia: And you never know where they are, and they're small. You don't know where is the front, where is the back, and all the legs \"sch-sch-sch-sch\".Todd: I know. I know. Yeah, there're kind of... actually, I have to hang my clothes on a hanger because it's... If I hang them on a hanger, the light goes through the clothes, and I can see if they're in there or not.Katia: Ooh!Todd: Well, because this place is by the woods so, yeah, there's more I think.Fred: OK, cockroaches. I used to be really afraid of cockroaches. I thought they were the most disgusting little insects, but living here, they're just everywhere, that you kind of get used to them and sure, no problem anymore. I don't feel so uncomfortable around them.Todd: Wow!Katia: Nature is smart. There's always a reason why cockroaches exist, why spiders exist.Todd: That's true.Fred: Oh, thats a good point. Spiders in your house will take care of the cockroaches, but the cockroaches will take care of the smaller spiders, or the smaller little pieces of food that might be on your floor or little things.Katia: There you go.Fred: It's the chain. It's the food chain.Todd: So you're saying you don't have to vacuum basically.Katia: No, you just...Todd: Cockroaches take care of it for you.Fred: Is that what I'm saying?",

Is there anything from your childhood that you can tell us?\nShirley: I've got a really funny story actually. Maybe I was about ten years old or something, and we used to have this little kind of shack in the countryside that we were dragged to every weekend, and away from civilization, you know, and no running water, no electricity. So we kids had to make our own fun. I've got my brothers, myself, and a couple of cousins, we would always go there at weekends or school holidays or something, and one of the highlights was to go to the Sunday School, the Sunday morning church service, and the reason ... one of the reasons this was attractive to the kids was because they bribed us to go there by giving us sweets when got there, so it was great. So we always went anyway. It was a church service for about an hour, singing hymns and stuff like that. Anyway, this one Sunday we arrived early, about half an hour early. There was nobody there. The church wasn't open yet, so it was, as most people know, it rains a lot in Scotland, so on that rainy day, we all were wearing our cagoules which is a kind a rain jacket with a big pocket in the front, and while we were waiting for everybody else to arrive, we started just kind of playing around in the trees. There was a little river nearby, and it was at the time of year when the tadpoles were turning into baby frogs, so we got this crazy idea to collect all these ... I'm talking hundreds of frogs were around, so we all got a big handful of baby frogs, put them in the big pocket of our cagoule, went off into church. So there we are, we're kind of in the middle of the crowd. You know, we weren't at the front of the back, kind of in the middle, and everybody's standing up singing the hymns, and really getting into, you know, the church singing and stuff like that, and then we decided that we would get the frogs out, so each of us, one at a time, one of us kids, one at a time kind of crouched down like we were tying our shoe lace, and let all of these frogs out of our pockets, so these tiny little frogs started jumping all over the church, and there's all these ladies in their Sunday best and started squealing and screaming and the minister didn't know what was going on, and he's trying to keep everybody calm, and we're just singing along with the hymn, you know, we're really innocent and they had no idea, cause they didn't see us do it, so they had no idea what had happened, and yeah, we got away with it. We didn't get told off, cause we didn't get caught, and yeah, when after the church service, you know, we had such a laugh after the church service, and yeah, that's one of my greatest childhood memories.

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Buddihini, today we're going to talk about roles and family: traditional roles or what people do. Now in Sri Lanka, is it common for usually the women to do all the cooking?\nBuddhi: It was so. It was so, but still the mentality is such that they expect the daughters and the wives to do the kitchen stuff and the cleaning, the laundry and all that, but we do have a lot of working mothers now and they are many single parents as well so the culture has been changing a little bit, but still the majority is that women should do the usual household stuff and the men do the work outside and get the money. If it's like the cityside, and if the wife is also working, obviously it's not expected that the wife ends up doing everything. \nTodd: So, what happens? Do you split the duties or do you hire a servant?Buddhi: Yes, hiring some helper is quite common in Sri Lanka. I personally don't agree with that.Todd: Oh, really, you don't want to have like a cook or a maid or anything like that?Buddhi: It'll be nice to have but I wouldn't want to have. I want to do my things on my own. I think it's easier to do things on your own, and I'd make sure when I get married that I have the correct partner who'd want to help me out with things and having kids and all that. I wouldn't want somebody else to come and help us out.Todd: So, when you get married, you'd like to split the duties with your husband?Buddhi: Of course.Todd: So, you expect your husband to cook and clean?Buddhi: At least help me out and make sure that he knows what I'm doing. He values what I do cause I'm definitely not the kind who'll stay at home and do only the household stuff. I'll definitely go out and get the money as well.Todd: So, you want to be the bread winner?Buddhi: I wouldn't say that. We will share. I mean, why he suffer alone, and why I suffer alone at home. We suffer together.Todd: Now is this a common viewpoint with most young women from your country?Buddhi: Yeah, I'd say so. I'd say so, but there are many people who don't like to go out and be a working mom. They'd rather prefer staying at home and you know, waiting for their husband to come home in the evening or stuff like that, but I'm definitely not that kind.",

Yeah, it's huge though. I think, you know, that's one thing when you come out of high school, and you go into this huge university, it's such a different environment. Like I remember the first year, I was pretty lost in how big everything was.\nTodd: Now, Michael, a lot of people don't know about American football, but at your university, the university of Michigan, football is huge. Can you describe a typical Saturday football game? Like what happens at the stadium? What do students do?\nMike: Well, yeah, the stadium at Ann Arbor, at the University of Michigan, I think it holds a 102,000 people. Something like that. It's one of the biggest in the country.\nTodd: That's mammoth.\nMike: And every game is sold out. It is, it's an incredible event, so yeah, all Saturdays are abuzz with excitement for the home games, and it's just a very big deal. The whole Michigan football program just generates a lot of excitement, generates a lot of money, right, and you know, to tell the truth, though, back when I went to Michigan, I wasn't a big football fan.\nTodd: Oh, you weren't.\nMike: I actually never went to a home game.\nTodd: No, really.\nMike: People ask me that and they can't believe it because,\nTodd: No way.\nMike: It's such a big deal.\nTodd: Yeah.\nMike: But you know, I was more of like a, I don't know what you call it, kind of hippie at the time, and we kind of distinguished between the jocks and, you know people who were interested in sports and the people who were interested in, what, culture of something like that, so I, at that time I wasn't into the football. I think now if I went back, I would love to see a football game. \nTodd: Yeah. That's interesting. Man\nMike: But the Wolverines, the Michigan Wolverines, you know and a big source of pride for the University of Michigan.\nTodd: Well, thanks for sharing that.\nMike: Sure",

The weather was really hot the entire time I was there. Um, and it was very confusing, cause I didn't know the language very well when I first arrived but I learned quickly because I was living in the situation every day where I had to use language so that was really helpful in the end.\n\t                    Todd: So, what were the people like? What was the city like?\n                        Adrienne: The city was small. 1 million people, and that's pretty small. The architecture is very colonial style. It's interesting. Very beautiful, old, a lot of wood and stone and the food was great. Very spicy.\n                        Todd: Mexican food's the best.\n                        Adrienne: I think so too\n                        Todd: Yeah, and the people?\n                        Adrienne: The people are really friendly, really, really friendly. Big families and they're always inviting you over for dinner, lunch and breakfast, and tea and coffee and chocolate and it's really, it's really a very familial environment.\n                        Todd: What was your favorite place in Mexico?\n                        Adrienne: My favorite place, still, is a town called Cholula. It's a very small town. That has a pyramid, and Aztec pyramid with a cathedral on top of it and it has views of the mountains, the volcano and, um, just beautiful landscape all around. It's a great place to watch the sunset. \n                        Todd: What volcano?\n                        Adrienne: Po! They call it Popo, but the full name I think is Popocatepetl. It's an Aztec name.\n                        Todd: Oh, sounds like a nice place. \n                        Adrienne: It's beautiful.\n                        Todd: Any plans to go back to Mexico soon?\n                      Adrienne: Of course.

Is it in the north island or the south island?Kate: It’s in the bottom of the north island.Todd: What’s Wellington like?Kate: Wellington is a very beautiful city. It’s got… the centre is obviously the townshop with a few tall buildings. Then we have the harbour which is very beautiful especially at night time with city lights reflecting on the harbour. And then on the outside we have all the suburbs where everybody lives.Todd: How is Wellington different from Auckland or Christchurch?Kate: First of all Auckland. Auckland is much bigger: it’s the biggest city in New Zealand. And the city itself in the very centre, downtown centre, the buldings are much taller and much more hectic. Traffic is hectic every day, going to work. Wellington is much more calmer. However in Christchurch it is flat, completely flat. Wellington is very hilly, many hills.Todd: Is it a cheap place to live? Or is it expensive?Kate: Reasonably cheap. Compared with Auckland it is much cheaper.Todd: How much do things cost? In New Zealand how much is a bus ride?Kate: Bus ride from home to town would be 1 dollar 50, New Zealand dollars.Todd: Ok and how much is a loaf of bread?Kate: Loaf of bread, 2 to 3 dollars.Todd: What’s the best thing about your city?Kate: Best thing about my city is strangely enough the wind.Todd: The wind?Kate: It’s known for its wind. Todd: How’s that a good thing?Kate: How’s that a good thing? The cool breeze especially in summertime when it gets quite hot, a cool gentle breeze although it can get quite strong.Todd: And what’s the worst thing about your city?Kate: Worst thing about my city would be the trains: they’re so inconvenient and they don’t cost so much but they’re just inconvenient and the buses aren’t so good either.Todd: Well it’s kind of the same in my country!",

At the time we didn't have the state of the art computer labs. It was just starting in the eighties, it was like pioneering in the school. \n\t\t                Todd: Oh, OK, well was it pretty easy to do? \n\t                    Norman: Ah, it was kind of difficult because being in the gym, when the students would play basketball, the basketballs would bounce against the, it was just a wooden door, and the students wouldn't be able to hear me and it was kind of difficult as well to see the whole class as there was a wall that was separating my class, so I could see only half the class at a time. \n\t                    Todd: You could only see half the class and you were teaching computers!\n                        Norman: That's right! That's right, and so I would have two boards. One board at one end where I would teach the lesson to half the half the class, and then I'd walk over to the other end and do the same thing.\n                        Todd: Oh, man that must have been a nightmare!\n                        Norman: It was. It was, because I could never see what the other half was doing in my absence.\n                        Todd: So did they ever doing anything bad to get in trouble!\n                        Norman: Oh, yes, they were, they were. I can remember one instance when one student calls me over and he said, \"Mr. Groussier, I have water in my external drive. At the time you used floppy disks and put them in the external drive. I said, \"Water, oh no. There's no water!\" So, I went over and I tried to insert the floppy disk, and it just wouldn't, there seemed to be something blocking the floppy disk from going in so I peak in and sure enough I see that it's stuffed with watermelon. So, hence, that external disk drive was useless from then on. \n                        Todd: Wow, so how many years did you teach computers. \n                        Norman: Well, in that particular lab only one year and after that we moved to a full-fledged lab and I taught computer to my own class which meant once a week, a formal computer teaching and then we would go to the lab for other reasons like doing some research projects.\n                        Todd: Oh, Wow. Did you like it, teaching computers?\n                        Norman: In the computer lab, yes, because it was really well equipped with apple computers and printers and we had so many programs that students could use and do some really nice projects or nice cover pages, we had color printers and very efficient printers as well, so it was wonderful.",

        "transcript": "Fanny: Hey, Brian, you know, recently I heard that the Canadian dollar is very strong. Brian: It is. It's been amazingly strong in the last few months.Fanny: What happened? I mean, how come?Brian: It went up. The reasons behind why the Canadian dollar is strong...Fanny: Yeah.Brian: Very good question. Without getting too complicated, my understanding is the Canadian dollar is linked to a lot of primary industries, so things like, say like, oil or mining or timber from like forests and right now I think there's a high demand for those kind of products, so because of that it's pushed the Canadian dollar up. But also I think many other currencies have gone down a bit, like the American dollar has dropped a lot.Fanny: Really. OK.Brian: I don't follow the currency markets too closely.Fanny: OK, I see.Brian: But I think because the American dollar has gone down as well, that means that, you know, it doesn't take as much Canadian money to equal the American money now, so I think those are probably two of the reasons why it's been strong.Fanny: I see. I know that Canada is a country which is really rich in the natural resources, but are there still a lot of natural resources left now.Brian: That's another good question. I think that there are still quite a lot of resources.Fanny: Oh, nice.Brian: Which is, you know, is good but some of them are decreasing quite a bit.Fanny: I think so, because of consumption.Brian: It's too...Fanny: Too big.Brian: Right.Fanny: Yeah.Brian: And we export a lot of our resources too, so, you know, the Unites States is always taking a lot of our resources so that's like a huge market right there, but I think there's still lots of oil but maybe the... some of the trees, you know, they cut them down pretty fast and they take a long time to grow back, so you have to watch out there.Fanny: OK, I think that's a very reason for the strong Canadian dollar.Brian: It could be but you probably should ask an economist. Maybe they can tell you a bit more informed insight than I can.",

What influences you?Melissa: Well, what I do when I go shopping. I usually have something in mind that I want to buy, so either a certain color or just a certain item of clothing and then I look around at all the different shops and compare the best prices and things like that, and then I'll buy the one that's the best deal and I'll feel really good about it. Todd: So for your style, do you look around and also you say, \"Oh, I like what that person's wearing. I wanna dress this style\" or do you just think, you have your own style and you don't care if it fits into a mold.Melissa: I think it's a mix. I think that sometimes I'll see something that someone's wearing and I'll like it or want something similar and then of course that mixes in with things I already have, but I also like to make my own clothes, and remake clothes and things and things like that, so sometimes I'll remake something and realize that I need a sweater or something to go with it and then I'll just buy it based on something else I already have.Todd: Oh, so you make your own clothes.Melissa: Yeah, I don't do it from scratch a lot. Sometimes I'll go to a craft store and buy fabric and then cut it up and make a shirt from fabric, but often take a shirt or pants I already have and make into something. Like, I recently was living with a couple of roommates and my roommate was getting rid of all her old jeans so I cut her jeans up and cut a sweater up I had and then I made it into a jacket.Todd: Oh, nice.Melissa: Yeah.Todd: And you still have it.Melissa: Totally.

You buy things you don't need?\nMelissa: Yes, but recently I've been trying to veer away from that habit.\nTodd: So, what influences you most to buy something? Is it like commercials or is just impulse?Melissa: I think it's kind of just having the money and feeling like I deserve it.Todd: So, it's a reward?Melissa: Yeah, it's always a reward for something.Todd: Well, how about ... how persuaded are you to buy something by commercials or advertising or things like that?Melissa: Defintely food commercials persuade me to buy it. Like I'll see a food commercial or even a picture of deliciously looking food and I'll want to have it, so I have two or three concrete examples over just the past month where I saw an ad for food and I went and bought it.Todd: Oh, really. Like what did you buy?Melissa: One was hot Hotto-Motto. It was like a kind of fast food chain and they were selling a fried chicken on rice that looked really good, and the other was a McDonald's Cinnamon Role.Todd: And you saw it and you're like, I gotta have it.Melissa: Yeah, and like one weird thing happened. I just say a red and yellow sign and it reminded me of Wendy's and then I was craving a chocolate milkshake ...frosty ... so I went somewhere else and bought it.Todd: And you got it?Melissa: Yeah.",

I'm catching a ferry leaving at 7 and I'll get in at 6:30 in the morning.Todd: Oh, you're taking the ferry?Eoin: Yep. That's right.Todd: Oh, wow. Why did you choose the ferry?Eoin: Because previously when I've been up to Kansai, we caught a night bus, but it's not that comfortable on the night bus. You can't talk and difficult to go to the toilet even. On the ferry, there's a lot more space to move around. You can go to sleep when you want to. There's also a bath, so you can wash before arriving.Todd: Right. Actually, I took the ferry once to Osaka. I thought it was great. I preferred it. But you could have taken the train?Eoin: I could have taken the train but it costs considerably more than the ferry so I went for the cheaper option.Todd: Right. It is expensive. How much was the train to...? Eoin: The train to Osaka, I believe it was somewhere in the region of 20,000 yen.Todd: Wow!Eoin: On the shinkansen, which is the bullet train.Todd: That's round-trip or one-way?Eoin: That was one-way I think.Todd: Well, how much is the ferry?Eoin: The ferry... with the internet booking discount that I got it cost 7,000 one-way.Todd: Oh, that's not bad. That's what it was when I went two years ago, about 7,000.Eoin: Yeah. I think there's other ways of getting it cheaper. There's some kind of members card that you can enlist for which is pretty cheap. Unfortunately, I'm going to be pretty tight for time when I arrive at the ferry port so I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to sign up for it and get the extra discount or not.Todd: Right. Right. Well, actually when I went, I guess the cheap ticket, you have to sleep in that big room, right.Eoin: That's right.Todd: The sleeping area. It makes you feel like an immigrant. You know, people coming to America or something for the first time.Eoin: Yeah, I actually quite enjoy that in some ways,  It's more social than having your own cabin.Todd: True. True.Eoin: And I'm going up there with my band so we spend a lot of time together. It's always nice to meet a few different people on the way up.Todd: Right.",

What you see on National Geographic and this ... you know .. documentaries is true. It's nothing ... it's not anything that ... they wouldn't show you that's not true that you'll find in Kenya.\n                              \nShirley: Wow! So I could be just out there ... what driving around in my car and on my own just seeing all those animals?\nDavid: No, you don't get to drive in your own car. They provide services for you like ... we have like for instance in Kenya we have an institute called KWS: Kenya Wildlife Service that does that and it has its own warders that are highly trained to protect you when you're in the forest.\nShirley: OK, so the tourists are kind of regulated?\nDavid: Yeah, sort of.\nShirley: All right. So what could I expect to see if I go out?\nDavid: You can expect to see the wildlife itself: animals in their own habitat, some sleeping, some walking, some hunting. You never know. It depends on the time when you're doing your safari.\nShirley: Am I gonna get chased by a rhinoceros?\nDavid: No, they actually don't chase you cause, you know, most of the time you're just passing by. You're not disturbing them, but at times you get into contact with animals. You know, animals live in packs, so when one animal is excommunicated from its pack, it's an angry animal. For instance, buffalo, so when you find one buffalo by itself, that's not a really nice thing.\nShirley: So, what would happen if I found a buffalo by itself?\nDavid: That's what we call a charged buffalo. It's really angry. It's been excommunicated from it's pack and it cannot join the other pack so it attacks at anything, you see, sometimes they are really dangerous and that's why you need the game warders who carry like ammunitions just to protect the tourists.\nShirley: Wow! Really! So what's the chance of me getting attacked by a wild animal?\nDavid: One in a million. But you never know. You can never rule these things out.\nShirley: So it doesn't happen very often?\nDavid: It doesn't happen very often but at times in the past it's happened.",

They're digging up underneath the city and finding Roman bath houses (Whoa) and there is, there's so much history there.

And I went to a lot of theme clubs, too, I went to one that's called The Music Hall and it's like just, like a big theater, it was just amazing.\nTodd: So, what's The Music Hall like?\nRina: Um, well they had that night I went, they had five different groups: One American group, one Spanish, one Lebanese, and they all just, it's like a theater, like scene one, scene two, and each scene would be a different music, genre like, you know.\nTodd: That's pretty cool.\nRina: Yeah, it was cool.\nTodd: So, at these night clubs, how do people dress? What's the fashion?\nRina: Um, Lebanese girls, and people that were like Lebanese girls, they're very trend conscious. Oh, yeah. Like if it's in a magazine, they're wearing it type thing. They look down on anybody, that doesn't.\nTodd: Ah, so.\nRina: Yeah, and it's all like, done up like they went to the salon that day to go out sort of thing.\nTodd: Wow! (Yeah) So we're talking, like the skimpy dressed that they have?\nRina: Everything. Oh, yeah.\nTodd: Your kidding. What do the guys dress like?\nRina: Ah, the guys are, they dress prettier than some of the girls.\nTodd: No kidding.\nRina: Yeah, the guys dress really well, but very, just as I said, very trend conscious. Everybody's very image, image conscious. It's really a lot like Japan in that way.\nTodd: Mm, oh cool. Thanks.",

        "transcript": "Todd: OK, guys we're going to talk about Halloween. So, what do you think about Halloween?\nAdrienne: I actually like it. It's a fun holiday for kids especially because you get to dress up in costumes and you get lots of candy if you go trick-or-treating. I have a lot of good memories. of Halloween growing up.\nTodd: OK, what is trick-or-treating? Why do you trick-or-treat?\nAdrienne: Trick-or-treat is when you go, you dress up in your costume on Halloween and you go door-to-door ringing doorbells, knocking on doors. One person comes to the door, you say, \"Trick-or-treat\" and usually these days they give you a treat which is candy or apples or something like that but in the older days, you could, if they didn't give you a treat, then you could play a trick on them or they could play a trick on you, instead of giving you a treat, something like that.\nMike: I always thought that it was they performed, the person at the door performed some kind of trick for the kids because they didn't have candy to give, but I could be wrong. \nAdrienne: Yeah, I don't know exactly. It's one of those three options.\nTodd: Yeah, I think it's you play a trick on them.\nMike: Oh, really\nTodd: You throw trash against their house.\nAdrienne: Toilet paper their.\nTodd: Toilet paper, eggs, \nMike: Egg their window.\nTodd: Dog pooh in the paper bag on fire. On fire!\nAdrienne: Yuck. \nTodd: Yeah, that's gross. So, Mike, you're from Canada, so do you have Halloween American-style in Canada? Do you celebrate trick-or-treating? Do you do trick-or-treating?\nMike: Oh, yeah, I think it is the same as in the U.S. I believe it is a little bit different in Europe, maybe. They don't have the same kind of traditions but, yeah, exactly the same as in the U.S. We watched all the Snoopy, Charlie Brown Halloween kind of things, just like everybody....\nTodd: OK. That's good. I'm glad because now we can diverge. What was, what were your costumes when you were younger?\nAdrienne: Ah, I had so many. My mom was a seamstress so she used to make a lot of my costumes. I designed them and she would make them for me and my sister so one year I was bat girl, another year I was Wonder Woman. Another year I was Princess Lea from Star Wars, I was a rainbow and a clown and a cat, and a witch and everything, basically that you're supposed to be for Halloween I was.\nTodd: A lot of heroines in there.\nAdrienne: Of course. Strong women!\nTodd: Mike, how about you?\nMike: I was goat boy.\nTodd: Goat boy!\nMike: I was always goat boy because there...\nTodd: Every year?\nMike: Yeah, we, I couldn't afford to get a decent costume every year. \nTodd: So how were you goat boy? What did you look like?\nAdrienne: Where did you get goat boy from?\nMike: They just put some sort of, they put a lot of trash on me, and forced me to eat a can. It's OK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t        I got lots of candy but then the other kids would beat me up and steal it from me. That's OK.\nAdrienne: That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.\nMike: Well, you know. That's all right. It toughened me up when I got older.",

        "transcript": "Aimee: So Katie, you're a teacher.\nKatie: Yes. \nAimee: What is your favorite age group of students? \nKatie: Probably my favorite age group is around the junior high school age. So from about 11 to 15. \nAimee: Okay. \nKatie: I think they're the most interesting to teach. \nAimee: What makes them so interesting? \nKatie: Well, they already have personalities. And they're like almost adults but not quite adults. So it's interesting to see like – I think that it's just really interesting to teach them and see how they respond to stuff. It's very different from adults and it's very different from children but it's kind of almost there but not quite. \nAimee: Yeah. That sort of bridging, bridging age group, I guess. \nKatie: Yeah. So they're still like, they're still young kids. I can still teach them stuff but they're old enough to also do stuff by themselves. \nAimee: Yes. \nKatie: So it's like the perfect age group to teach, I think. \nAimee: Yeah. Independence. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: That's right. What about things like behavior and attitude? I just imagine that age group to be quite challenging. I mean, there's a lot of hormones going on and, you know, personalities are forming, so.\nKatie: Usually when in their first year of junior high school, they're fine because they're all still like, they're still babies. They've gone from being the oldest kids in elementary school to like the babies at junior high school. \nBut when they get to second year, that's when they start getting like a bit moody, a bit hormonal, a bit grumpy in class. But then when they go to third grade, that's when they start becoming normal people again, I think. \nAimee: So the second year is the challenging year. \nKatie: Yeah. Yeah. The terrible twos. \nAimee: Yeah. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: Well that works in both ways, huh? \nKatie: Yeah, it does. \nAimee: So do you have any particular strategies or tips for dealing with that difficult age? \nKatie: I think why they're so moody is because they're – again, they're almost adults. They're becoming adults. So if you stop treating them like kids and start treating them like adults, talking to them like adults, treating them like you treat an adult, then they respond better to that than if you like to shout at them like you would a kid or if you discipline them like you would a kid. \nAimee: Yeah. \nKatie: Yeah. Just treat them more like adults and they respond to it really well, I think. \nAimee: So you find they step up to the – they meet the expectations.\nKatie: Most of the time. Most of the time. \nAimee: Have you ever had any particularly challenging moments in the classroom? \nKatie: Yeah. Yeah. \nAimee: Silly question really, isn't it? \nKatie: Of course. Yeah. I mean, I've had kids like throw textbooks out the window. \nAimee: Oh really?\nKatie: I've had kids like punch their fists through walls like just – yeah, I've had lots of angry kids. But they're very rare.\nAimee: Wow. \nKatie: I've had lots of them but they're rare. \nAimee: Yeah, that's an interesting…\nKatie: Interesting, yeah. \nAimee: Yeah. \nKatie: In terms of like overall in a class, there's usually only one in each class that's a troubled student. But I mean, that's anywhere. That happens anywhere. \nAimee: That's true. So how do you deal with troubled students? \nKatie: I think that's a very difficult question. There's no like textbook way of dealing with troubled students in general because every kid is different. Every kid has a different problem. Every kid is acting out for different reasons. So you have to find out why they're troubled, why they're acting out and try and deal with it in the best way you can. \nAimee: Uh-hmm.\nKatie: Yeah. Don't get angry. It was probably my best advice even though you feel like strangling them sometimes. But just try and be patient, try and figure out why they're acting out and just deal with it from there. \nAimee: Yeah. Nine times out of ten, staying calm is probably the best option, isn't it? \nKatie: Hmm. And the one time out of ten, is when you really need to get really angry. That's the scary time. \nAimee: Yeah. Sometimes, they just need to know because there may be children with, you know, just personalities, strong personalities and they just are maybe showing off to the class, being a clown. And they just need that one moment where you show them, \"You have to listen to me. I am the boss\" kind of thing. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: Just get your power back perhaps?",

And you lease not only the plane but engines as well?\n                          Alexandra: Sometimes you have an airplane that's delayed at the airport because of some reason and they need to swap an engine out, or whatever.\n                          Todd: Right before the plane takes off, they sometimes switch engines?\n                          Alexandra: They'll take the passengers off and put them on another plane cause it takes a lot longer than the 10 or 15 minute turnaround, but, you will have, it's more an emergency type of situation, so they'll take the engine off, and it might be and overnight deal so we go ahead and furnish a replacement engine until they can move that plane back to where it belongs or have the engine repaired. \n                          Todd: So can you lease a pilot?\n                          Todd: You can, yes, you can lease a crew. Yes! It's called a wet lease, and we used to do dry leases meaning we only provided the equipment but a wet lease includes a full crew that will fly the airplane, flight attendants, etc.",

Now in England you\n                                have something called \"Boxing day\". \nNicola: Yes, we do. \nTodd: So, we don't have that in\n                                America. What is Boxing day? \nNicola: Well, boxing day is\n                                always on the 26th of December, the day after Christmas day. And it was originally called boxing\n                                day because it was the day in England when the\n                                very rich people in Victorian times gave\n                                presents to their servants, the day after\n                                Christmas. And usually it would be something like\n                                money, or food but they would give it to them in a\n                                small box, and so on December the 26th, servants would receive their boxes,the Christmas boxes, and\n                                that's why it was called Boxing day. \nTodd: OK \nNicola: Today, people don't\n                                really receive money or food so much, sometimes\n                                you give extra tips at Christmas, but\n                                Boxing day has stuck. So that's the name. \nTodd: What do people do on\n                                Boxing day? \nNicola: Nothing really. Uh, eat\n                                the leftover turkey, turkey sandwiches, watch TV,\n                                and in my family we usually go and watch dog\n                                racing, grey hound racing. \n\nTodd:Oh, really?\n\nNicola:Yeah, and lose some money...\nTodd: Lose money! \nNicola: Yeah always. At least I\n                                do. \nTodd: Wow, cool. Dog track. Is\n                                there a dog track near your house? \nNicola: Yeah, there is, where I\n                                live, yeah. \nTodd:Oh,\n                                \n                                cool! Alright, thanks a lot!\n\nNicola:That's\n                                \n                                OK!",

Well, we have a school that's called International School of Dance, where we teach belly dance and Latin American dance, which mainly consists of Salsa, merengue, bachata, and it is located in Beppu, Japan.Todd: So, when did you think of this idea for...?Katia: We thought about it maybe a month, a month ago. Not long ago. Right the next day, or right away, Fred was already working on everything, so we just gave some e-mails, were doing this, and what about this, and so everything he started right away and we actually had an integration for the school maybe almost three weeks ago, and since we opened the following day we already are teaching.Todd: Already. Fred: So, we have something close to twenty students in three weeks of the school opening.Todd: That's pretty fast.Fred: Yeah. It is very, very fast.Katia: Yes. I think we are surprised.Todd: So, why did you choose those two dances: belly dance, right, and salsa?Katia: I think mainly because this is what people are interested in right now and it's something that a lot of people can learn and it's popular and of course I can teach this kind of dance so of course.Todd: So, you're saying that belly dance is popular?Katia: Yes, it is. Yes, it is.Todd: I had no idea.Katia: It's very popular, and especially around women. It's something that gives a certain feeling to the woman so it's of course you workout. You use your body movements, but also there's a special feeling about doing belly dance so it's popular.Todd: Could you kind of explain a little bit more? Like, what do you mean it has a special feeling? Like, this dance has special... I don't know, uses special muscles or...Katia: No, not exactly like that. Of course the music has to do a lot with it. When you hear a Latin music, you feel different and you move different. When you hear Oriental music, then you have completely a different postureand for example, as a woman, you will tend to take a different posture. Your body will be different depending on the music. With belly dance, your body posture is very different, that for somehow, some reason... and maybe because of the history of belly dance, it's very related to femininity, being feminine and dancing.",

Like how soon must you be there? You know, how long do you play, etc.? Eoin: Yeah, there is some variance from place to place about that but generally it's pretty standard that if you're playing that evening, you'll need to be there about maybe two, one or two in the afternoon just to... especially if it's a place you haven't played before to go and greet the... or say hello to the owner of the live house and then do your rehearsal, your sound check to get... make sure all the volumes are correct and normally there's some paperwork to fill in, like list out the songs you're going to play, copy for the lighting people, and copy for the sound guy on the sound desk, and plus if there's people coming to see you and they want to reserve advance tickets, you need to write out a list and give that to the reception guy and then apart from that... yeah, that's most of the preparation done, so normally, you'd go in, greet their live house manager, rehearsal, after that have a bit of free time and the events normally start around 6:30, 7:00 in the evening, and each band plays for about half an hour normally.Todd: That's it. Only thirty minutes.Eoin: That's it.Todd: All that work for only thirty minutes.Eoin: That's right.Todd: That must go by so fast for you?Eoin: Yeah, it does, but in an ideal world it would be nice to just play for hours on end but I've seen bands play for hours on end, especially bands that I never heard the music before, and I think it's too much to take in. You know, for... if you're a listener, taking in much more than half an hour of brand new music from one band at one time is a lot. I think it's a good length of time to perform if you're not a really well known band.Todd: Well, for you though, does the time just fly by?Eoin: Yeah, it feels pretty fast but I don't know. It's a rush, you know. It's a buzz to play and even though it's short, it's enjoyable as many things in life are.Todd: Right.",

Yes. It's interesting though because we do really look for the leisure time that we have but yet the working... if you have a look at the working rates, they are quite high. The figures are quite high, so.Todd: Oh, yeah, really.Rebecca: Yeah. Yeah. We do have long working hours. I think that's more so for people who are in farming and have their own business.Todd: So, on average, you know, how many hours do you think an average Australian works a week?Rebecca: I think the figures are 45 hours plus.Todd: That's a lot.Rebecca: Yeah, yeah, it can be.Todd: Now, do Australians usually have a lot of holidays during year? Vacation time?Rebecca: Yeah, it definitely depends on what area your working in. I get four weeks per year, and then if own your own business, you can take holidays, but you need to work hard to get those holidays. Todd: So what are the big vacation times in Australia?Rebecca: The big vacation times are generally... coincide with school holidays, I suppose because families, so it would be September, because that's coming into summer and then Christmas is always quite big as well. Todd: Now in the States, we have a phrase, you know, \"Work hard, play harder.\" Do you think that would fit Australians?Rebecca: Yeah, I suppose it can. Definitely. Yeah, we definitely work hard, but yes, when we do get a chance to go out and play, that is quite hard as well.",

I think it's just good for the countries that are directly and indirectly involved with the business that is going on between countries.\n                        Todd: OK. Great. Thanks a lot. \n                        Jamie: My pleasure.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Okay. So Meg, we’re talking about baking. And in the last one, in the last interview, you mentioned cake pops and some other stuff. Now you also mentioned truffles. What is a truffle? \nMeg: A truffle is – it’s a little chocolate candy or it can be not so tiny but it’s not huge. It’s like bite-size. Bite-size chocolate candy with something in the inside that’s called ganache, which is – can be a chocolate or a different flavor. Kind of creamy or a little more firm and then coated in chocolate. So it’s a chocolate candy basically. \nTodd: Okay. Now, I sometimes hear the word truffles like something that pigs find under the trees. Is it the same word? \nMeg: Yeah, different – no. Well, same word. Same word but those are a type of mushroom, I think.\nTodd: Yeah. \nMeg: Yeah. So there’s truffles mushroom and then there’s truffles chocolate candy. So I guess be careful which one you’re ordering if you’re at the store. \nTodd: Right. And they have nothing to do with each other. \nMeg: No. I mean maybe someone has made a mushroom chocolate truffle before. I’m not sure, but not me. \nTodd: Okay. So are truffles easy to make? \nMeg: They are – they’re time consuming. So I don’t think they are difficult to make but you have to have the time to put in because you need to make the inside chocolate part first and mix together the ingredients and then form – I always did it by hand – form all the little balls so that you can dip them in chocolate. And so, one batch could usually get maybe 60 truffles. So probably I had to spend a few hours working on a batch of truffles. \nTodd: Can you go through the process, like how do you make them from start to finish? \nMeg: So probably my favorite ones are like an espresso chocolate kind where you would – I need some chopped up chocolates, more like baking chocolate or really dark chocolate or if you want milk chocolate, you can use it. And then mix that with some heavy cream and butter on the stove. And if there’s any flavor, you’re going to add. And so if it’s like a coffee flavor, you can add some coffee grinds and later strain them out, so it has that flavor. \n                                And then…\nTodd: And that’s the inner part that you’re working on?\nMeg: Right. Yeah. \nTodd: That’s like – what’s that called again? \nMeg: Ganache. \nTodd: Ganache. \nMeg: Hmm.  And so, then you’ve made that and so it’s still pretty thin, more liquid-y. And so you need to put it in the fridge to let it firm up for – it can take – that recipe can take a few hours before it’s ready. And then once it’s ready, I just use like a small spoon to scoop a little out and then use my hands to roll it into like a ball shape. \n                                And then let that sit, and then I had to put it back in the fridgebecause your hands kind of warm the chocolate back up. And then once it’s out, you can use a special dipping fork or just a regular small fork and have some melted coating chocolate that you can get at craft stores where there’s fancy kinds or cheap kinds or whatever. And then you need to dip each ball individually and put it down on wax paper, like a special paper that it won’t stick to. \nAnd then you let them – if you’re going to add anything on top like sprinkles or anything, you can do that then. And then that’s it. You’re done. \nTodd: Wow. And then you just put them on the fridge. You chill them, right? \nMeg: You don’t have to. They’re better actually if keep them out of the fridge because if you put them in the fridge then you maybe have to handle issues with it going from cold to warm. And chocolate – you might not know chocolate – if it gets too cold sometimes or like frozen, little white spots can come to the surface. And so it kind of ruins the prettiness of the chocolate.  So you can just leave them out. \nTodd: That’s good to know. Thanks. Well, I might give it a try but it still sounds pretty hard. \nMeg: Well, I’ll help you.",

How long did you live in Italy for?\n\n    Marion: Um, for two seperate periods, so a year each so it total about two years. Almost two years.\n\n    Todd: Wow, that's pretty cool. So why did you go to Italy? What were you there for?\n\n    Marion: I went there to study Italian. The first time I studied Italian and then French, and then the second time I went back after graduating to study more Italian.\n\n    Todd: That's pretty cool.\n\n    Marion: Hmm! It was interesting, yeah.\n\n    Todd: So were you classes tough? What it a tough study program?\n\n    Marion: Hmm, they were very interesting, and the first time I went, my Italian wasn't so good, cause I had only studied for two years before I went the first time, so even though my Italian improved enormously over that first year, in the beginning it was quite difficult, I had one professor for example, who would constantly say to me, in class, in Italian, \"Are you following? Are you following?\" so it was a bit intimidating.\n\n    Todd: Yeah, I don't think I could do that with my students.\n\n    Marion: No, no, it was really awful, he was really singling me out, so all the other people in the class used turn their head around and look at the strange foreigner in their class who maybe or maybe, maybe could understand or maybe didn't, but I just felt very nervous and a bit awkward there because I was just waiting for him to pounce on me, \"Mi segue, mi segue!\" It's terrible.\n\n    Todd: \"Mi segue\" is \"are you following?\"\n\n    Marion: Are you following me, literally, yeah, basically do you understand.\n\n    Todd: Ah, OK. Um, what was life like in Italy, at university. How was it different than say, univeristy in Ireland?\n\n    Marion: Well, my university is one one big campus, I think that's maybe the way in America as well. In Italy though, the buildings of the university are spead all over the city, so you'll have for example, the language and literature faculty, where I was, in one part of the town, and then maybe 10 or 20 minutes away by bus you might have the faculty of education where I had to go to some lecturers as well so that was very different, for me to have everything so spread out. Also, the buidlings were so old, you know in Italy there are really old traditional buildings, so they are beautiful, really beautiful, you walk into the faculty building, and there's a huge courtyard, and beuatiful architecture, all around you. It's absolutely amazing. You felt like you were a little part of history, inside you know, so yeah, that was amazing.\n\n    Todd: Well, sounds cool.\n\n    Marion: Yeah, it was great, one of the best years of my life.",

        "name": "Boy bands",
        "transcript": "Presenter: The internet is full of articles about what makes a good boy band. But many bands appear and disappear without a trace. Alana, it can’t be as easy as following a formula, can it?\nAlana: No, I don’t think so. The traditional formula is that you have four or five good-looking young guys with some musical ability and the ability to dance – the choreographed dancing was very important to boy bands in the past. They tended to wear the same, or very similar clothes when they performed, so you had to decide on a ‘look’ for the group. The most important element, however, was said to be that the band members had different and very distinct personalities.\nPresenter: Right, the cute one, the rebel, the joker, the shy one, mysterious one ...\nAlana: Yeah, although sometimes they all just seem to like the cute one! The idea is that different boys appeal to different girls, so you can have a bigger fan base. There’s someone in the band for everyone.\nPresenter: So, do you think this all still holds true? Or have things changed in the 21st century?\nAlana: Yeah, I guess things have changed for several reasons – partly just because we needed a change – but mainly because of changes in the media and with new technology. Take One Direction …\nPresenter: Ah, I’ve been counting the seconds before you mentioned One Direction!\nAlana: Well, we have to talk about them because they’re the biggest thing at the moment, although who knows how long they will last.\nPresenter: Oh, ages and ages ...\nAlana: We’ll see. Anyway, One Direction, as you know, came to fame through the X Factor, a reality show, and that was a great way to start. You had loads of people watching them every week and wanting them to win. They felt as if they had a personal stake in their story as they voted for them every week.\nPresenter: What age group does One Direction appeal to exactly?\nAlana: That’s another clever thing, they seem very unthreatening, so they appeal to very young girls, they are cute so teenage girls really like them, but they also have a laddish, slightly naughty side to appeal to the mums! The teenage girls and the mums are the ones who will spend money. The lyrics to the songs are calculated to appeal to girls who feel a bit insecure about themselves, like most teenage girls. \"You don't know you're beautiful, that's what makes you beautiful\", that kind of thing. Lots of girls want to feel wanted, but not scared, and that’s traditionally what boy bands do. They present this image of a clean-cut, reliable boyfriend. Actually, One Direction’s clothes also help here: chinos and clean casual shirts and canvas shoes. You’ll have noticed that they don’t wear the same clothes. Their stylists have been instructed to keep them looking individual, but despite that they all have this attractive but unthreatening look. No tattoos, or piercings, or black leather, or make-up or anything.\nPresenter: You make them seem very cold and calculating. Remember that they’ve been nominated for loads of music awards and they’ve won dozens, so they’re regarded as serious musicians.\nAlana: OK, if you don’t want to believe they’re calculating you can blame their management. They’re nice boys who are fantastic musicians.\nPresenter: They are! And they keep proving their critics wrong. A lot of people said they wouldn’t make the leap from the UK to the US market, but they did very quickly.\nAlana: Yes, and that’s all down to their clever use of social media, or rather their management’s clever use of social media. One Direction are all over Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Tumblr. That’s how they made it in the States so quickly. In the past it was a lot more difficult and took a lot longer. Bands had to try and get air-time on local radio stations and that was really hard. But they’ve by-passed all that. Social media has become the new radio, as their manager said.\nPresenter: Their first record, Up All Night, went to number one in the US, didn’t it?\nAlana: Sure did! They achieved a world record as the first British band in history to reach number one in America with a debut album. It sold 176,000 copies in the US in a single week.\nPresenter: Amazing. And the boys are all rich from the merchandising too.\nAlana: Yes, well, the boys and their management company. There are One Direction phones, toys and games. Dolls, even. I think that’s another 21st-century thing – companies are cashing in on success in all possible ways as quickly as possible.\nPresenter: May they all enjoy it while it lasts.",

        "transcript": "So, we think we know how to motivate people, right? Offer them a reward. Do this and you'll get this. Do this faster, earn more money. Do this better than everyone else, here's a promotion. We offer incentives when we want people to do things. We do it at work, at school, even at home with our kids. Tidy your room and you can watch TV.\n\nBut when social psychologists test whether incentives work, they get surprising results. Sam Glucksberg, from Princeton University, America, set people a problem to solve and told them he was going to time them to see how long they took. Then he put them in two groups. He offered one group a reward for finishing fast. Five dollars for anyone finishing in the top 25 per cent and 20 dollars for the person who finished the fastest of all. To the other group he offered no incentive, but he told them he was going to use their times to calculate an average time.\n\nThe first group, the ones with the reward, solved the problem faster, you'd think, right? Well, no, they actually took three and a half minutes longer than the group who just thought they were being timed. Incentive didn't work. In fact, it made them slower. This experiment has been repeated, with the same results, many times. But in business we still offer bonuses, promotions and rewards to staff.\n\nThat's fine if we want them to do something simple, like chop wood. We'll pay you more if you chop the wood faster. An incentive works then. But if we want someone to do something complex, something creative, something where they have to think, rewards don't work. They might even have the opposite result, and make people perform worse. Another study, by Dan Ariely, showed that the bigger the reward, the worse the subjects performed on a complex task. The reward made them focus so hard on the result that they couldn't think creatively any more.\n\nAnd this all matters because more and more simple jobs will become automated. We'll be left with creative, problem-solving jobs that computers will never do. And we need to find a way to motivate people to do those jobs when we've proved the traditional incentives don't work.\n\nSo what does work? Giving your workers freedom; freedom to work on the things they want to work on, freedom to choose when, where and how they work. Want to work from home three days a week, get up late and work into the night instead? Fine. Just do the job well. And evidence shows people who choose the way they work get results. Companies that give employees time during the week to work on things that interest them and are not part of their regular job achieve amazing things. Some of the big tech companies are good examples of this, with ping-pong tables and areas to relax in …",

It's not one of the big events known in Oman but we do celebrate New Year and we follow the same calendar as you guys do.Fred: Oh, is that right? So, as New Year's is almost coming soon, do you have any New Year's Resolution?Sabriya: Well, for the past maybe three or four years I've been trying to have different resolutions but I never manage to stick to them or keep them. However, this year, I think I've made my mind up on a resolution which I plan to keep and that is to limit or actually lessen my phone bill. Fred: Lessen your phone bill. Wow. I can't imagine how big the phone bill was before if you want to change it.Sabriya: Oh, my goodness it was so big. I mean, you know, you know how much I love talking on the phone so, yes, it was quite big and I intend to, you know, discipline myself a lot more. So what about you Fred?Fred: What about my New Year's Resolution?Sabriya: Yes.Fred: Wow! My New Year's resolution... I would say more my New Year's resolutions. I have many, but I think I have to focus on one or two of them to make it happen, so number one, I think as many people out there, I would like to quit smoking.Sabriya: Good for you.Fred: Thank you very much.Sabriya: Good for you.Fred: Will you support me?Sabriya: Definitely. No doubt about it. I will personally support you. Fred: Thank you very much for all your support. I think it's gonna be very good for me. Not only because this is bad for my health, but you know, it's just something that I think will give me a lot of confidence if I'm able to to do this, to quit. I will say I am strong and confident in myself and I can do this. Now, my other New Year's resolution would be... I love my grandmother so much, but as I don't live close to her anymore, I feel that I'm losing a bit in my relationship with her, and so I would like to call her every week.Sabriya: That is very sweet. That is so cute. I think that's something we should all have. Fred: Thank you very much.Sabriya: To have grandmothers and mothers and call them all the time.",

So you met this guy, this Russian guy, who was going to go with you across the Amazon, and you were in Lima, Peru, so how does your journey start? Jeff: The beginning of the journey is we had to get a truck. We had to get in a truck and the roads are terrible. They're not really roads. They're dirt tracks, and because it was monsoon season, the roads were really bad - just muddy and deep mud and the rivers were overflowing across the road so... there's no buses. There are no cars. So we had to get in the back of a big truck, a logging truck, and the Russian guy and myself and say twenty peasants, Inca Indian peasants, rode in the back of the truck down the... through the Andes Mountains and then down the backside of the Andes Mountains for four days in the back of this truck.Todd: That must have been so uncomfortable. Jeff: Oh, it was terribly uncomfortable, and it was raining quite often during the day, so you had to pull a big piece of plastic over the back of the truck, so it was dark and wet and damp and hot and humid and the road was bumpy and the truck got stuck many times, and it was... yeah it was a real adventure.Todd: That was for four days?Jeff: Four days, yeah. Yep. Yep. And you'd sleep in the truck overnight, and yeah, you just... everyone had big bags of food with them so they could eat along the way cause there's no restaurants. Yeah, it was interesting.Todd: So, in this rough beginning to the trip, did you start to think maybe you wanted not do it, postpone it and go back?Jeff: No, I never thought that. I like that kind of challenge and adventure but you just wonder how difficult it's going to get because each day gets a little more difficult and then the truck gets in really deep mud and you wonder can we get out of this? Are we going to have to start walking and maybe wait for another truck to come along and climb into that truck, so you never... I didn't want to go back, but you just.... it's great suspense cause you never know what's going to happen on a trip like that.Todd: And then the truck took you all the way to the beginning of the Amazon.Jeff: Yep. It was a transport truck so it had supplies and it was going to the... to a little town at the Amazon River and then from there we transferred into a canoe, a wooden canoe and the canoe would take the supplies into the little villages along the Amazon River.Todd: Amazing.",

We have to buy the washing machine, the refrigerator and I'm just worried there might be a little bit of stress probably for the first few months.Lindsay: Yeah, getting used to living with each other. Is your fiance very clean?Chris: Hopefully, she's more clean than me cause I tend to leave things out all over the place, and I've lived alone now for the last six years so I worry that I've got into some bad habits, so I'm going to have to be more considerate of her I think.Lindsay: Right, that could be a conflict. I know when I first started living with my fiance, he never put... he never cleaned and it drove me crazy so he would always... for example he would leave his socks on the couch or he would leave his glass and wouldn't take it to the dishwasher, or he would eat food from take-out for example, and he would wrap up the baggage and then put it next to trash can, but not in the trash can, and it drove me crazy. I didn't understand why he couldn't clean.Chris: Well, that's just a man thing I think. I'm completely with your fiance on that point. I like to not be completely clean because then I don't feel like I live there.Lindsay: Yeah.Chris: Is there anything that you're really looking forward to?Lindsay: I'm really looking forward to going on the honeymoon, together. I think that will be fantastic.Chris: Where are you going?Lindsay: I haven't decided yet, but we're thinking maybe the Maldives.Chris: Oh, right!Lindsay: Or maybe going to Hawaii, so my fiance really likes to surf so he really wants to go somewhere he can surf but I really don't like to surf, but I like to go to the beach and read books, so as long as there's a beach somewhere, I think we'll be very happy.Chris: We were thinking of going somewhere completely different, for example Iceland.Lindsay: Oh, wow.Chris: Because my fiance found out that they have a wonderful, great big outdoor pool, with like hot water, volcanic hot water, so she's really excited to maybe to maybe go there. And also somewhere, where for the rest of your life, you're going, \"Where did you go for your honeymoon? Iceland!\" You know, it's somewhere a bit strange, so...Lindsay: Right. It's supposed to beautiful - Iceland, so it will be fun. So, you'll be in the cold and I'll be on the beach.Chris: And loving it, I'm sure.Lindsay: Exactly.",

If you do ... everything have cause and effect. So if you do something it is going to give you a return in somehow, in someway, like whenever it's going to happen.

        "name": "The Maasai and the lions",
        "transcript": "For thousands of years the Maasai people in Kenya had no doubts about their relationship with the lions who shared the land with them. They were enemies. The lions wanted to kill the tribe’s livestock and the Maasai had to protect the animals. It was even part of the coming-of-age ritual of young warriors to kill a lion.\n\nBut now things have changed and the Maasai are part of a new East African scheme to protect lions, called the Lion Guardians. The aim is for local people to be trained to manage and protect the lions without involvement from outsiders after the period of initial training. The Lion Guardians are taught basic literacy, how to manage data, how to deal with conflict between humans and lions, GPS and telemetry tracking of radio-collared lions. Some of them also learn how to speak in public and how to blog.\n\nThe Lion Guardians monitor the lions and other carnivores and inform cattle herders when to avoid the areas where there are lions. They also help improve the livestock enclosures and educate people about wildlife. Helping find lost livestock is another important job. In the past these would often have been killed by carnivores.\n\nIf anyone is about to carry out a lion hunt, the Lion Guardians try and persuade them not to. Since many of the Guardians have killed lions in the past and are very experienced, they are highly respected in the community and are listened to by their age-mates, or peers, and often by their elders. They explain the importance of the lions to culture and tourism and how they can now be arrested for killing protected animals.\n\nOne such Lion Guardian is Olubi Lairumbe. He has killed seven lions in his lifetime. The last one was a lioness who was pregnant with five cubs. He regretted killing her very much, had a massive change of heart and volunteered to become a Lion Guardian. Olubi’s father used to hate lions and encouraged his sons to hunt them, but since Olubi became a Guardian, he has been advising them not to kill carnivores. Olubi was recently interviewed by Sir David Attenborough and appeared on the Africa documentary series.\n\nAnother Guardian, Mingati Makarot, is very good at tracking lions using his traditional skills and has a great knowledge of the area that acts as a refuge to many wildlife species. Mingati is a past lion killer but has completely converted to being one of its ardent protectors. His name, Mingati, is a ‘lion name’ given to him meaning one who is fast and doesn’t lag behind.\n\nIn the past, a moran (a Maasai warrior) received a lion name after spearing a lion. In Maasai culture the name represents the characteristics of both the warrior and the lion he has killed. A warrior with a lion name feels that he has achieved something great. When the successful warrior brings the lion’s mane and tail back to his manyatta (his home in the community) to be put on display, he is treated as a hero. Other young men who don’t yet have their lion names are called by the general name of ‘moran’. They long to have recognition and dream about the day that it will be their turn to bring home the lion trophy.\n\nNow, this naming tradition is changing. The Lion Guardians experimented by giving lion names to boys who had not killed lions and it worked. Other young people called them by the lion names, then the older people did so too. There were still some boys who wanted to do something to prove their bravery, and they were assigned conservation tasks to do. Now young men can earn respect by protecting lions, rather than killing them.\n\nAnother change is that the lions are now given Maasai names and each has a card explaining who the lion is related to and which lions they keep company with. Personalising the lions helps them to be seen as individuals by the community.\n\nSince the programme began in 2007, no lions have been killed in the area patrolled by Lion Guardians. Compare that to a similar neighbouring area without Guardians, where 63 have been killed, and you can see just how successful the scheme is. The Maasai have managed to successfully adapt their culture to changing times without giving up their identity.",

You? \n\nClara: Great, as long as I don't think too hard about all the essays I have to write this term!\n\nBen: Yeah … \n\nClara: Hey, are you OK?\n\nBen: I have to admit, I'm struggling a bit. Maybe even a lot. I've not been sleeping well at all and then I can't concentrate. And all these things are just going around and around in my head.\n\nClara: Mmm … that doesn't sound good. So, you're sleeping badly and you can't concentrate. Is that all it is, do you think?\n\nBen: Well, if I'm honest, it's more than that. I'm starting to dread going outside. I find myself worrying about stupid things like what if I forget the way home. Or, what if I go to class thinking it's Monday but actually it's Friday and I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time. It sounds even more stupid when I say it out loud. It took me two hours to leave the house today.\n\nClara: It doesn't sound stupid at all. It actually sounds a lot like me last year.\n\nBen: Really? But you're so together!\n\nClara: I've learned to be, but even I still have bad days. I used to have panic attacks and everything. When you were trying to leave the house today, how did you feel?\n\nBen: Like I couldn't breathe. And my heart was going way too fast.\n\nClara: Hmm … that sounds like a panic attack to me.\n\nBen: I thought I was going to die.\n\nClara: You'd be surprised how common they are. Loads of people have them, they just don't talk about it.\n\nBen: How did you get over them?\n\nClara: I actually talked to a doctor about it, and you should too. But I learned some practical things as well. Though they're easier said than done, and they're going to sound weird, so hear me out, OK?\n\nBen: OK …\n\nClara: So, one thing I did was to try to reduce the power of the anxiety and the panic attacks when they came. So – and this may sound strange – at a time when you're feeling safe and OK, you literally do things that make your heart start racing faster and your breathing speed up. Like spinning around on a chair until you're dizzy or hyperventilating so you're short of breath.\n\nBen: That sounds awful!\n\nClara: It is, but it means you get used to the symptoms, so they feel less scary. \n\nBen: Right. \n\nClara: Then you have to deliberately do the things that usually make you feel panic. So, if it's going to class on Monday and being scared you've got the wrong day, on Monday you go to class. If you let the anxiety control you by making you stay at home, it just makes it worse the next time you really do have to go out.\n\nBen: And what did you do if a panic attack came anyway?\n\nClara: I had a distraction plan. So, I walked everywhere instead of taking the bus because the exercise helped, but also I did things like count trees or red cars or something. Whatever it was didn't matter, as long as I had something else to focus on.\n\nBen: I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I thought …",

        "transcript": "Adrienne: So Rob, tell me why you don't like elephants?\nRob: Why don't I like elephants? It's a long story. I was traveling in India with a friend of mine and one night we decided to spend the night in a national park, looking at wildlife and we were staying in a small hut. And to get to the hut we had to walk across a swamp and we had to take a boat, then we had to walk across another swamp. And after walking for about half an hour we reached the hut, all upon big lakes about 20 meters up into the air and I climbed the steps and when I got to the top of the steps, on the other side of the hut there was a huge snake about 3 or 4 meters long, a cobra. \nAdrienne: Wow!\nRob: I hate snakes. I absolutely hate snakes. So I ran down the steps and said to my friend, \"I am not staying here. I can not sleep in this place\" And we thought about what to do and there was a village maybe two kilometers away. So my friend walked to the village to find out whether someone could come and scare away the snake and she came back and said, \"The people said there is no way, we can not scare the snake off. Do you think we're crazy? We are not fighting the snake but you can stay in our huts. You can stay in the village\", so we started walking back to the village and this was about half past six, seven o'clock in the evening and the sun was going down and as we were walking through the jungle we heard all sorts of noises from other parts of the forest and there was lots of rustling noises. And \"Oh I wonder what that is, there must be some  animals. Wow. Cool, some animals\" and then after a little while a big pig appeared in the middle of the path and we thought, \"Oh, it's a pig\". Pigs are not very exciting but it seemed exciting at the time and then the pig went walking off in the opposite directions and after about 2 minutes the same pig \"bang\" came running back in front us. We didn't know what had happened but we could still hear the noises coming slowly and slowly towards us. And after a little while the noises started getting louder and louder and louder and then we stopped. And at the side of the path in front of us we saw a trunk appear, just one trunk appear, only the trunk, off to the side of the path and then another trunk and then another trunk, so there were three trunks and I was like \"Wow, elephants, great!\" And then one of the elephants came out onto the path and looked right at us and then we were not so happy but we thought we're unyielding, we're tourist. So we took photos of the elephants but unfortunately my camera flashed and the elephant was very unhappy, \"RRRR\" but he did nothing. He just stood but we knew he was angry so we ran and hid behind a tree and after about ten minutes we thought, \"OK, the elephants will have gone\" so we started walking down the path again and all the bushes and the grass was above our heads and then we suddenly came to an area where the grass was only two or three feet high. So we could see a big area again and we looked over to our left and there were three elephants staring right at us, waiting for us. Maybe about 30 meters away and unfortunately at school in England they don't tell you what to do if you see an elephant. So we didn't know, should we walk past? Should we run? Should we make lots of noise? So we decided to walk. Do nothing, don't do anything suddenly. Just walk and we walked about two or three steps and there was this sudden \"RRRRRRRRRRR\" Boom, boom, boom, boom.\nAdrienne: Oh, my god!\nRob: In one second we looked at each other, \"Run\" I was carrying a rucksack so I was running very slowly. My friend ran very fast. I was running with the rucksack and then I dropped the rucksack and I jumped into a bush. Unfortunately it was a thorn bush so I cut myself lots and three elephants decided I looked, maybe they thought I looked more delicious than my friend. So they came after me and the three elephants came charging over on top of me and I was underneath one of the elephants and it kicked me on the left leg and then I just.. and then went past making lots of noise trying to scare us off.\nAdrienne: Were you OK?\nRob: I was OK that night but my leg was completely black the next day cause I had a huge bruise from where the elephant had kicked me and I have lots of cuts and bruises from the bushes and they broke my rucksack which I was very unhappy about and then we continued walking to the village which was only about 50 meters away and there was a large group of other tourists watching the elephants playing in the lane, and \"How wonderful! Aren't they sweet? Aren't they lovely?\" No!\nAdrienne: Sounds very frightening.\nRob: I don't like elephants.",

        "transcript": "Dai: So Christmas is coming around the corner. How do you feel about that?\nSharron: I love Christmas. I love the time with the family, the time off work to relax and enjoy each other's company and just time at home with everyone.\nDai: So, what do you .... what's like a traditional Christmas for you then?\nSharron: Well, the build-up is a bit of a nuisance really. It's a lot of money, but it's good fun and it's great. The end result, Christmas morning, watching everybody opening the presents that I've bought and things, but, yeah, a traditional Christmas would be rushing around Christmas Eve getting all the last minute things. Probably up till very late, wrapping presents, and then up early Christmas morning, opening presents, a family visit to see our daughter opening her presents as well, and then it's normally shared around some of the family. We do a different Christmas dinner every year. Either we ...\nDai: Christmas dinner? What kind of ... ?\nSharron: Right! Christmas dinner back home is a big roast turkey and all the trimmings: stuffing, vegetables ... \nDai: Stuffing?\nSharron: Stuffing. It's like herbs and bread crumbs and onions and things. All made up and you stuff it under the skin of the turkey and when the turkey roasts it cooks in there as well. It's really, really tasty. So we have sort of a family meal and one year we'll go to one of the parent's houses or they'll come to us. We just change it round every year. And then normally, it's sort of a lazy afternoon after we've eaten far too much, and watching some of the traditional British television: The Queen's speech at 3 o'clock every Christmas Day.\nDai: So the Queen gives a speech?\nSharron: Yeah. Tells everybody how her year has been and what she thinks Britain has achieved in the last twelve months and how she thinks things are going to go for the next twelve months and it's on for about twenty minutes I suppose. Not everybody watches it. Sometimes people, after their large lunch, have fallen asleep in the chair by the time it's on the TV, so ...\nDai: Right.\nSharron: But Christmas night then, it's normally cold turkey sandwiches, pickled onions, crisps.\nDai: Crisps? Like ...\nSharron: Like ...\nDai: Potato chips?\nSharron: Potato chips, yeah, sorry, potato chips, yeah. We call them crisps back home so ...\nDai: OK.\nSharron: Sit in front of the TV again. It's just a generally family time.\nDai: Sounds pretty lazy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Sharron: It is. Very lazy. Boxing Day then is ...                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Dai: Boxing Day?                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Sharron: Yeah, now Boxing Day is the day after Christmas Day.                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Dai: So the 26th?                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Sharron: The 26th of December. Saint Steven's Day, but we have another day's holiday then so ...                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Dai: Why is it called Boxing Day?                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Sharron: I haven't got a clue. Not a clue.                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Dai: Think it's cause everyone gets rids of their boxes?                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Sharron: Could be. After all the Christmas gifts, yeah. But we generally have a busier day the next day. There's a lot of sport activities going on where we live. In Temby, which is a local seaside town, they have a big Boxing Day swim, which is unheard of in the winter. Nobody goes in the sea much in the summer, where we live.                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Dai: Right, it must be really cold.                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Sharron: Very cold.                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Dai: Like, what would that be in degrees?                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Sharron: Oh, I don't know, but people dress up and run in the sea for charity. People give donations for money and it's all in a good cause and it's a bit of fun. But there's also football matches and rugby matches and things.                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Dai: So you generally have a good time.                                                        \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Sharron: Yeah, most people go out on Boxing Day. It's a more active day than Christmas Day. Christmas Day is the day where most people tend to stay in and be with the family and Boxing Day we will go out and meet up with friends generally.",

I was, but now I appreciate it and I know where my parents were coming from.\nTodd: So, it this the standard Lebanese family type culture where daughters are not allowed to work?\nRina: Ah, yeah, my dad had basically believed that if I went out and worked I would, you know, be hit on by guys. It just wasn't a place for his daughter, and typically before, yeah, women don't work. They stay home. They took care of the kids. They, you know, it was a typical patriarchal society and my dad was very, very strict, and I spent a lot of my childhood pushing away my culture because of that.\nTodd: And how do you feel about your culture now?\nRina: I'm very, very proud of it. I love it. It's nice to be different and I'm glad I get that chance to do that. Um, the only thing, when I was in Lebanon, it was hard as well because people didn't see me as Canadian, and they didn't see me as Lebanese You know I was, a lot of people didn't talk to me because of it. I went there and a lot of people shunned me basically, so.\nTodd: So even though you had no language barrier at all cause you speak Lebanese?\nRina: Yep, yep, no, they basically, you know they were mad at me because I was too Canadian, or they were mad at me that I wasn't enough Canadian, and like, it was just, you know, insane.\nTodd: That's pretty tough.\nRina: Yeah, well, they have their, they have their image of what you know, what Western society is like from movies and, you know, because you know I have my tattoos, they thought I was just basically Satan's spawn,and because I wasn't running around like a tramp, they thought well, \"What is she is doing? What is she supposed to?\" it was just the worst of both world's really.\nTodd: Ah, that's terrible.\nRina: Yeah, so because, they do, they have, and actually I have to specify this: I was in a village. Like, both of my parents are from villages \nTodd: Oh, I see.\nRina: In Beirut, it's different, but when I was in the villages, where I stayed the majority of the time, it was like that, but I got, I made my little older ladies love me, but they were talking to me at the end, having coffee with me while I smoked my cigarettes, yep, yep.\nTodd: Oh, that's good to hear.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So you're in law school, Travis.\nTravis: Yes, I'm in law school. \nTodd: Normally, how do you get a job after you finish law school?\nTravis: Well, the law school that I'm at is considered to be a top-tier law school and so my law school has a lot o power to get companies to actually come to my law school and interview with students at the school. And the way my law school does it is every year in the summer, the last week of summer before school starts, they get about 700 firms to come for about one week and interview students on campus and it's called early interview week. So during this early interview week, basically the school rents out an entire hotel and every firm will be there for about one day and so, it's like every day you have about 150-200 firms on any particular day. Each with their own room in the hotel and so the students will wait in a common area and when it's their time to interview they'll go to a hotel room and knock on the door and go inside and interview with that firm and they'll get maybe 20 or 30 minutes with that firm. And then afterwards if the firm likes them the firm might actually invite them to go to lunch or to go to a dinner that night and they'll be selected so maybe every day, a firm will interview as many as 50 candidates but only invite maybe 5 or 6 of them to go out to dinner with them that night. So this lasts about 4 or 5 days and at the end of that, other than being really tired. Hopefully, you've gotten a couple of job offers, well not job offers but basically an offer to come back to a second interview which will hopefully, eventually lead to a job offer. So, for the students it's quite difficult. Over the course of a week some students will interview with as many as 25 firms, over a four or five day period so they can be interviewing anywhere from five to as many as ten firms in a single day. So if you're interviewing 10 firms in a singe day, each 30 minutes long, you're going to be there a long time. At least 5 or 6 hours of straight interviewing, going from one room to the next room to the next room, to the next room to interview with a firm.\nTodd: Sounds pretty exhausting.\nTravis: It's really exhausting and I'm not looking forward to it at all.",

        "transcript": "Todd: OK, Raphael, you were saying you lived in Paris.\nRapheal: Yes, I made my studies there.\nTodd: Paris is just an amazing city. Can you talk about Paris?\nRapheal:Yes! Well, the biggest difference I noticed with Tokyo is the size. Like Paris is nice in that way, you can go anywhere by walking. It might take at maximum an hour and a half if you want to go to a very far place, but basically it's a city like made for walkers and you can really go anywhere just by walking, I mean it's quite pleasant cause you can see many, you know, nice buildings and places and things, just by walking.\nTodd: Wow, that's nice. How many people live in Paris?\nRapheal:Including the suburbs it's 8 million now. Maybe getting increasing, but the inner city is only one million, so it's not overcrowded at all. Yeah!\nTodd: So, what else would you say is different about Tokyo and Paris?\nRapheal:Well, specially, Paris you mean? The Transport is less expensive. This is important. \nTodd: Yeah\nRapheal:Yeah, Yeah.\nTodd: It's more expensive?\nRapheal:No, it's less, sorry, it's less expensive. Anyway, the, I was surprised because Tokyo is not that expensive finally, I mean you can, you can live in a very expensive way if you want but you can save a lot as well. It's really up to you. But in Paris is quite hard to save. I mean, the food is very expensive, and if you want to go out, just, a restaurant or anything, it's really more expensive than in Japan. A restaurant for example, like prices in Japan start from a thousand yen, maybe less, like 600 yen, and in France like the cheapest restaurant you can find is 15 Euro which is around 2000 Yen \nTodd: Whoa! That is expensive.\nRapheal:Yeah, it's more expensive, wherever you go it's more expensive if you want to go out but on the contrary the cinema is really cheap, so so many people go to the cinema, I mean, the cinema is really, it's a part of Paris nightlife, like, people used to go to cinema once a week at least, almost everyone. Yeah, cause it's really cheap. A ticket is 1000 yen, maybe less.\nTodd: So, what about sports, like what kind of sports do you like to do?\nRapheal:Yeah, anything. Anything, yeah! You have a lot of facilities, like gymnasium, swimming pools, clubs, yeah, you can practice a lot. Especially, I was a student so, I had this very easy student life because France has a lot of students, whatever it is, so they give you a bit of money, and you get discount on almost anything, so sport is specially favorized in Paris when you are a student, you canalmost like do whatever you want, as a sport almost free, sometimes, so, it's, you can do a lot of things. Actually, I did Aikido. I did swimming pool, squash, tennis, yeah, uh, basketball, yeah, a lot of things actually.\nTodd: Active guy. And what about the traffic if you want to drive in Paris?\nRapheal:I never tested, because as I told you it's so nice to just walk, that, and I didn't own a car but it's quite tough for people living in the suburbs cause they need a car to come, the train system is not really good. It's not like, there's a lot of delay, trains and things like that, so if you live in the suburbs you need a car, and driving through Paris in the mornings or evening is really difficult, so I just didn't want to test, you know.",

        "transcript": "Joel: So, Michele, you said you are from Canada. Michele: Yeah.Joel: What part of Canada?Michele: I lived in Ontario in a small town called Beaverton.Joel: Beaverton. And so how big is the town?Michele: It was pretty small, about seven or eight thousand people I think.Joel: Wow, that's pretty small. Michele: Yeah.Joel: Did you like that?Michele: I think when I was really little I liked it. It was nice to play outside with your friends and we always felt really safe. When I got older as a teenager, sometimes I thought it was pretty boring being in such a small town, but I think overall it was good to live in a small town.Joel: What would you do for fun when you were a teenager?Michele: Well, there was actually a movie theater in our small town so sometimes we'd go to the theater but it wasn't a great one. We usually went outside of the town into the city to go shopping or see a movie.Joel: And so since then have you lived in any big cities?Michele: I've lived near Tokyo in Japan, so that's a pretty big city. Yeah.Joel: So I guess you prefer that then... to your hometown?Michele: Well, actually I felt that Tokyo was too big of a city.Joel: OK.Michele: Yeah, so..Joel: It's the opposite extreme.Michele: Yeah, it's so crowded and the people aren't as friendly so...Joel: That's probably a big difference between a small town and a big town, huh? Like you know practically everyone.Michele: Yeah.Joel: So, you walk into a store. You walk down the street, you can say 'hi' to almost everyone.Michele: Yeah, well, actually, I've also lived in a really small town in Japan too and I prefered the small town in Japan to the big city like Tokyo. The people in the small town knew my name and were very friendly. If I needed any help then because it's a small town, everybody knows everything about the things in the town so if I needed to find a place or if I wanted to join a club I could easily get the information in a small town, whereas in a big city people don't know the things as well, so.Joel: You also have to be careful what you do because everyone will talk.Michele: That's true.Joel: You can't hide.Michele: In a small town, you don't have as much privacy but I think the friendliness outweighs the privacy issues.Joel: OK, thanks Michele.Michele: You're welcome.",

        "transcript": "OK. So, moving on, if the social media sites can personalise the user experience, to block out things they think we don't want to see, well, begs the question, what else is being hidden from us? Well, in his talk Eli Pariser gives another example. Did you know that if two people type the same word into some of the most popular search engines, the results might be totally different?\n\nI know. Crazy, huh? Well, maybe you can try it one time with a friend. The example that Eli gave in his talk was two of his friends who have very different interests. They both typed the word 'Egypt' into a search engine. One got results from news websites about recent events in Egypt and the other got mainly travel guides. The results were totally different and this is because some search engines record information about what we usually look at, what we like and what our interests are.\n\nSome sites are now starting to personalise what an individual user sees. Now, sometimes, of course, it can be really helpful to have information personalised for us. It can save us time searching and often actually we do want to see the information that we're more interested in. It can make online shopping easier and it helps us to connect with like-minded people. But let's stop for a second and think. Do we really want the internet to offer us only what the internet thinks we want to see? Aren't we going to miss out on a lot of really interesting and fresh information?\n\nWell, whatever you think about the filter bubble, I think we all need to be aware that this is happening. By controlling the flow of information each individual receives, these algorithms mean we don't have access to all the information that is out there. So, aren't we missing out on a lot of really useful stuff?\n\nThe question is, what can we do? Well, I have to say, I agree with Eli Pariser. I think we need to try and step outside of our filter bubbles from time to time to try and get our information from other sources, as well as the internet. And actually you can look for alternative search engines that don't filter the content in the same way. They exist too. There are also ways to depersonalise searches, but I will tell you more about that another day. For now, just try to make sure that you keep your eyes and ears open and learn as much as you can about how the internet actually works. Things change very quickly, but we should all try and keep up to date and learn more about how the wonderful worldwide web works. Thank you very much.",

Yeah…Todd: It’s called Nasi Goreng?Ivan: Nasi Goreng, yeah. Nasi is rice, goreng is fry. Todd: Oh, really?Ivan: So it’s fried rice.Todd: Nasi Goreng.Ivan: And then next one is Mi Goreng. Mi goreng is noodles. It’s fried noodles, Mi and goreng. Mi is noodles and goreng is fry, yeah.Todd: OK, so Mi Goreng and Nasi Goreng. Ivan: Yeah, and last one is maybe Satay.Todd: Oh, I think we call it Satay.Ivan: Yeah, Satay, yeah.Todd: But you say it differently. Ivan: Yeah, Satay.Todd: You say it Satay also?Ivan: Yeah, Satay. Todd: OK, and that’s mainly chicken on a stick right?Ivan: Chicken, you can go for chicken, you can go for meat, you can go for mutton, anything, liver, anything. And we usually have some kind of special sauce, or ketchup or whatever, like mixed with some weird stuff but… basically it’s ketchup, chili, and salt and some ginger or whatever. Sometimes it’s garlic and you just dip it inside and you eat it and it’s really nice. Todd: Oh that sounds really good.",

        "transcript": "Kevin: What were the biggest challenges you faced starting this website?\nTodd: Well, when I first started, I didn't know anything about computers, and I mean nothing about computers. I took a course, teachers and technology and I remember the first day of class, without a doubt, I new the least of anybody in there. They were saying all these terms, and I didn't know what the terms meant. I had never owned a computer before, and I almost dropped out actually. I was just like .... I can't do this. This is way over my head. So I ended up buying a little dictionary and then I struggled through the course, but then I learned the technology, so initially that was the hardest part, since then I would say the technical stuff is probably the easiest thing, so it's kind of funny how it's switched.\nKevin: What's been the most rewarding for you doing this project?Todd: Probably two things. One would be just the people that I've met. So when I first started I had no idea that I was going to meet all these people from around the world, and it's really easy to get people to come in and do interviews. If I meet somebody from another country, I can just give them a business card and say \"I run this website. It's free. Would you be willing to come in and do interviews?\" and then they see the website and they agree, so I've made a lot of friends I would say from people around the world.And also, there's been a lot of students that have written me from around the world to thank me for the website, and that's always really nice and rewarding.Kevin: Where do you see the website going?Todd: That's a good question. So, I think right now we're trying to change ... I say we by the way because I have a partner, Joel Carda. Joel was actually with me in the first class. We took the class together, the technology class. That's how we became friends, and he's been involved on and off since the beginning, and he's been involved very actively for the last three years I think ... so we're trying to change the website to do more ... different types of interviews and to continually make it better. Maybe to do more situation type stuff, and maybe debates and things like that.But actually the biggest thing is we're gonna try to focus on quality. Because when the website first started, I made a decision at that time to worry about quantity, not quality, because I teach full-time. I've always taught full-time, and I never really had that much time to worry about editing and proof-reading and things like that, and people have been pretty lenient but I know that there's a lot typos and things like that, so the biggest thing right now is to improve the quality of the website, and then to also branch out and always push new types and new types of activities and things like that.",

I couldn't remember my phone number and the camp counselors were trying to look it up. Call up: ring, ring, ring. My mom answers the phone, \"Are you OK? Are you OK?\" \"Yes, Ivan, we're OK. Don't worry about it. It's just a rain storm.\" But it was an absolute mess. The next day, the soccer field is completely wiped out. It was.. yeah, they're big angry storms. \nTodd: How long does a hurricane usually last?\nIvan: Usually, about two or three days. \nTodd: Oh, really?\nIvan: Yeah, they just kind of stay in Houston. They like Houston. Something about the weather pattern. They just float to Houston and stay there. \nTodd: Man, that's pretty intense. So afterward everything is just kind of wiped out?\nIvan: A lot of windows are broken. I said a lot of cars are upside down sometimes because the wind is really, really high, plus you got the water that floats the cars but it's fun when it stops cause the streets are flooded  and you can go swimming.\nTodd: You swim in the water?\nIvan: Sure. Sure. It's just rain water.\nTodd: Wow! Cool, thanks",

        "transcript": "In today's lecture we're going to be talking about experiments, and I thought it might be interesting for you all to learn about the world's oldest continuously running laboratory experiment that is still going today. In fact, it holds the Guinness World Record for being the longest-running experiment. This experiment began in 1927 and has been going ever since.\n\nIt's called the 'pitch drop' experiment and it was created by Professor Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, Australia. Parnell was the university's first physics professor, and he wanted to show in this experiment that everyday materials, such as pitch, can have quite surprising properties.\n\nYou see, when pitch is at room temperature, it feels solid. You can easily break it with a hammer. However, it isn't in fact solid. At room temperature, pitch is many billions of times more viscous than water, but it's actually fluid.\n\nIn 1927, Professor Parnell took a sample of pitch. He heated it and poured it into a glass funnel. He allowed the pitch to cool and settle – for three years. He then turned the funnel upside down and cut the top off it.\n\nSince then, the pitch has slowly dropped out of the funnel. How slowly? Well, the first drop took eight years to fall. It took another forty years for another five drops to fall. Today it's been almost 90 years since the experiment started. Only nine drops have fallen from the funnel. The last drop fell in April 2014 and the next one is expected to fall in the 2020s.\n\nThe experiment has a tragic story associated with it. Professor Parnell died without seeing a pitch drop. His replacement, Professor John Mainstone, became responsible for the pitch drop experiment from 1961. He held the job for 52 years, and missed seeing the drop fall three times – by a day in 1977, by just five minutes in 1988 and finally in 2000, when the webcam that was recording the experiment suffered a power outage for 20 minutes, during which time the pitch dropped.\n\nThe pitch drop experiment is something we can all participate in now. There's a live web stream that allows anyone to watch the glass funnel and wait for the fateful moment. A similar experiment to the Queensland pitch drop was set up in Dublin, and the video of the moment the pitch actually dropped went viral on the internet. It's interesting to see how a very slow event can spread news so quickly.",

I was originally born in St. Louis Missouri, but I spent most of my life in Tulsa Oklahoma and in Japan. Todd: Wow. What’s your city like back home Tulsa?Tres: Tulsa’s an amazing city. We have about a half a million people, I think. Don’t hold me to it. There’s a lot of culture. Many people from various parts of the world, who either immigrated to Oklahoma, or their parents immigrated there. And therefore, they’re first generation. So we have lots of foods from all over the world. Oklahoma used to be a part of a Mexican state. So we have a very strong Mexican heritage that still exists. Going into food, of course we have food that’s similar to Northern Mexico, but we also have ribs which are probably the best you’ll ever find in the United States. Todd: The ribs. Why are the ribs so good?Tres: Because they’re so juicy and soft. You don’t need teeth. Todd: That’s pretty good. So when you say ribs, that’s beef ribs. Tres: Beef ribs, we also have pork spare ribs.Todd: What’s the nightlife like in Tulsa?Tres: Night life, I haven’t been back in many years, but when I grew up there, I remember there being many clubs in the area. Majority of adults are single, so everyone’s looking for a spouse. I grew up playing music, so I would visit nightclubs and bars to play in bands when I was under age. So I think people really found ways to enjoy themselves. Todd: Ok, so you say you were in a band and you played an instrument. What instrument did you play?Tres: I’m a drummer. I’ve played drums ever since I was in junior high. And I love music, so I’ve also played violin and I sang in a church choir ever since I was a little baby, growing up until university.Todd: That’s a lot of talent.Tres: It’s a lot of fun.Todd: What would you say is the best thing about Tulsa?Tres: The best thing about Tulsa, I would say, is the atmosphere. Once you go, people are so nice. They’ll invite you in to do anything that they’re doing. It’s just an easy town to fit in. It’s a large city, but it’s not too large. It still has a small town atmosphere like probably most middle-sized cities in the United States. Todd: Is there anything that’s bad about Tulsa?Tres: Well, we do have our share of violent crimes. We have a river that’s pretty much polluted. It would be nice if it were a clean river so that we could swim in it. I would say that’s about it as far as I can remember. Todd: That’s ok. That sounds like two big enough problems right there. Tres: Yeah, pollution and crime. Todd: Thanks Tres.",

It's too dangerous, so I had to look for another travel partner who was a little bit as crazy as I was to do this trip, so when I arrived in Lima, the capitol of Peru, I started looking around for someone else who looked like a tough, good traveller, and one night in my guesthouse, this bald Russian guy came into the guesthouse carrying a big pack, and he had a big pack with a tent, a sleeping bag strapped to it and he had a big machete hanging off his belt, and I said this guys perfect, so went up and talked to him.Todd: He sounds a little bit like Indiana Jones.Jeff: Oh, he was great. He was a great guy, and his wife is Mexican so he spoke perfect Spanish, so I told him my idea and he was gung ho. He was ready to do it.",

One time when I was living in Wyoming, in one weekend we drove from Wyoming through Colorado, New Mexico and Mexico and back in the same weekend.\nTodd: Wow! Well, actually for people who are not familiar with the United States how far is that?\nTim: It's a long way. I don't know. It took.. I don't know, it took probably about 15 hours one way.\nTodd: Wow! \nTim: So, thirty hours all together. But it was fun. We drove down to Mexico \n                          had a good night a good meal, a little bit of drinks\n                          and drove back the next day. \nTodd: So you went to Tijuana? \nTim: No, we went to Ciudad Juarez. \nTodd: OK. Nice. \nTim: That was really fun and a lot of other trips we took when I lived in Oregon, when we'd go down to California and we'd surf.\nTodd: Oh, really?\nTim: Yeah!\nTodd: Oh, you're a surfer? \nTim: A little bit, a little bit of surfer.\nTodd: OK. What kind of car do you drive? What do you use for this road trip?\nTim: Well, typical American a four-wheel drive vehicle. Big vehicle, lots of gas but a lot of fun.\nTodd: Oh man, you're from Oregon you're supposed to be a tree-hugger!\nTim: I know. I know. But they're good. One rule we had on our road trips was any lake or big body of water we had to stop and swim in. It was a good thing to do. \nTodd: Well, you live in Japan now. Do you ever do road trips in Japan?\nTim: I took a road trip from Niigata up around Hokkaido and back, so it was a long road trip actually.\nTodd: OK. Wow! What's the difference between a road trip in Japan and a road trip in America?\nTim: Well, a road trip in Japan..it's a little bit more dificult to get around, it's a little bit more expensive. In America road tripping is sort of.. something a lot of people do.\nTodd: Yeah.\nTim: And in Japan, when we do that it is a little bit strange, a little bit different, not  very normal.\nTodd: Yeah, that's true. OK. Great, thanks a lot Tim. \nTim: All right.",

        "transcript": "Tom: We're both English teachers. Is there anything you hate about teaching English?\nJess: There's actually not much that I hate about teaching English but there is one thing which drives me balmy, and annoys me more than anything else and that's correcting the same mistake over, and over, and over again, and it seems that every country in which I've worked, every nationality in English learners have one mistake that they always make over and over again. In Hungary, when you say how are you to a Hungarian student, they'll reply in English, I'm feeling myself well, which is a direct translation from Hungarian but sounds rather strange and a little bit rude in English, and I must have corrected that mistake millions of times while I was there. The same students again and again and again and again, so the repetition of making the same correction really gets my goat. How about you? What do you hate about teaching?\nTom: I really wouldn't say I hate something about teaching, but I definitely think there are things that waste my time when I'm teaching. After every lesson, I very carefully right up a lesson plan, bring all those materials together, put it in a little plastic wallet and store it away in a folder, and I know full well I will never open that folder to read about that lesson again. I kind of approach every lesson as fresh and new and try and come up with something different and every time I'm writing them all up, doing all this paperwork and I really don't need to. I need to get in control of myself and stop doing that. You told me what you most dislike about teaching, but I'm sure you love this job. What are some things you like about English teaching?Jess: I think the thing I like the most about teaching is what I call the \"Ah-hah\" moment when you're studying a language point with a class or a student and you can almost see physically the moment they understand, they moment they're able to make sense of the language of they can do the task that you've asked them to do, and you can almost see a light bulb go off above their head, \"Ah-hah! Now I understand.\" and I love that. I love the surge of confidence that gives the students and also makes me feel really good that I helped them to reach that point. What do you love about teaching Tom?Tom: The thing I really love is right at the end of the course, when the students come up to you after a long time of haranguing about homework and about being late and about correction and drilling and the students come up and say, \"Teacher, we're all going to dinner at the end of the course. Do you want to come with us?\" and that must makes me smile. Now, I know I saying this to you Jess, but I know there's a lot of people out there listening to this. It really makes my heart warm to go and have some social time with the students at the end of a long course.Jess: So the thing you like most about teaching is when the teaching is finished?Tom: Oh, you've got me on that one, yes.",

It is very difficult for me. At first, I become very much like foreigners and get mad at every mistake, you know, every illegal moves you know, other Iranians are doing, so but after awhile I get the hang of it, so then I learn how to really my get work done.\nTu: Well, actually, one more thing is how do people cross the road in Iran?Amir: Well, actually, the government has built very good infrastructure, so we have this, you know, this pass-way that you can walk, you know, and cross the streets, but well, it really depends on how much these roads are now implemented, and how people really feel like ...Tu: Following it.Amir: Following it. Yeah.Tu: Well, actually, one thing in Vietnam, one thing typical to Vietnamese traffic is people cross the road anyway they want.Amir: Yeah.Tu: We don't go with them. Yeah, what do you call it? The white one? The zebra? Like the crossing line? We don't cross?Amir: Ah, crosswalk! Tu: Yeah, yep, that one. We don't cross the road there. We just cross the road whenever we want and wherever we want.Amir: Oh, I see. So what happens in case of an accident, if the car hits a passerby?Tu: You know, actually, one of the amazing things is we never got hit by that.Amir: Never?Tu: And foreigners look amazed at it. Like, they just can't believe it. They just don't know why? How come people cross the road without ... but actually we just look slowly, slowly, one-by-one, and we even cross in front of a car.

That red lips and white skin and blonde hair. Kind of typical American.\nBen: Albino, yeah. \nHana: When I saw her for the first time I was like, \"Wow, she's gorgeous.\" \nBen: Wait you mean, you saw her picture on the internet or in the news or you saw her in concert? \nHana: No, I think it was on YouTube. Again, YouTube. \nBen: YouTube, okay. \nHana: Yes she was, at that time she was still singing like country music but yeah I thought she's amazing. \nBen: I have an interesting fact about her actually. \nHana: What? \nBen: So apparently, she is from right outside of my hometown actually. \nHana: Oh wow. \nBen: Yeah that's where she was born and then she was doing music around there first and she got kind of big somehow. I don't know how. I'm not really interested in her. \nHana: Okay. \nBen: She's cute but I don't really like her music.

Okay I can't think of anything now but how about you? \nBen: How about me what? \nHana: Do you like romantic comedies? \nBen: No, not really. But there is one I do like it's called My Best Friend's Wedding. \nHana: Okay. \nBen: I believe Julia Roberts is in that one. \nHana: Yeah. \nBen: Do you know who she is? \nHana: Yeah. She is famous, yeah. \nBen: Yeah that's kind of a good ... That's like a 90's classic romantic comedy I think. Have you seen it? \nHana: I think I have. \nBen: Okay. \nHana: Yeah, yeah I think so.",

I guess you might say concert rather than gig.Todd: Well, in American English we'd say gig.Eoin: OK, that's --- to know. OK.Todd: For a rock band. So, what's the gig?Eoin: One of them is in Osaka on Friday night and the next one is in Nagoya on Saturday night. They're both at relatively well-known live houses, which is a main kind of live venue for rock bands in Japan.Todd: Oh, wow. That's pretty cool that you're going to be playing at a reputable place.Eoin: Yeah. I mean, it's not, you know, world famous bands don't tour and play at these places but on the scene, they're decent places with decent sound systems and fairly well established.Todd: Now, when you go to these places do you have to take all of your own equipment?Eoin: Not all of our own equipment. In fact, compared to playing in England, we have to take relatively little. I play base so I will bring my base and just affects but use the base amp that's already there in the live house.Todd: Now base, do you mean... is that the guitar? Eoin: That's right. Base guitar.Todd: OK. So you just have to bring the guitar and the cables?Eoin: Cables and the affects pedals. I use some affects to change the sound of the base guitar when I'm playing and so I just bring that and plug it into the live house base amp that's there. Todd: Well, that's pretty convenient.Eoin: Yeah, and... I mean, on top of that, the PA is all there and normally quite big, the main speakers that all the sound mixed through. If we were to play a gig in England or when we have played gigs in England, the standard is there's only the PA. Those speakers there. Everything else including the drum kit, the guitar amp, the base amp, which are pretty big items of equipment.Todd: Yeah, that's pretty big.Eoin: Yeah, you have to bring all of that with you and normally four or five bands will be playing together on any given night so there'll be an arrangement, Everyone will get in contact beforehand. One band will bring a drum kit. One will bring the base amp. Another band will bring guitar amp. That sort of arrangement.Todd: Oh, that's pretty neat that like one group will bring the drums and one group will bring the...Eoin: Well, in theory if you can get in contact with the other bands in advance, that's the way it would work.Todd: It doesn't sound easy.Eoin: No.",

        "name": "My hero",
        "transcript": "A (Girl 1):\nMy hero isn’t very famous, but she ought to be. She’s Mary Anning, who was only 12 years old and from a poor family when she made an amazing discovery. She found the first dinosaur skeleton, that of an ichthyosaur, on the cliffs of Lyme Regis in the south of England. That was in 1811, and until then people had thought that it was impossible for an animal to become extinct. Because she was a woman and didn’t have enough money for a proper education, she wasn’t able to take part properly in the scientific community of the time. But she read as much scientific literature as she could and continued to search for fossils, often risking her own life to get them by climbing dangerous cliffs. She once nearly died in a landslide which killed her dog. Although she didn’t write famous books about fossils, her contribution to palaeontology, the study of fossils, is said to be enormous. I admire her because she kept on trying to make new discoveries at a time when usually only men, and men with money, were allowed to be scientists. After her death the writer Charles Dickens said that ‘the carpenter’s daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it’.\n\nB (Boy 1): \nMy hero is Kailash Satyarthi, who has been campaigning against child slavery for years. He is from India and first became aware of the problem of children working when he was 6 and noticed that a boy younger than himself had to spend all day polishing shoes and was unable to go to school. When he was 11, he began to collect money to help buy textbooks for other children, and when he was 26 he gave up his job as an electrical engineer to fight child slavery in India, by doing things like raiding factories where children were forced to work, making rugs or glass bottles. He introduced a programme first called RugMark, now known as Goodweave, which puts tags on child-labour-free rugs made in factories. He has saved many thousands of children, over 80,000, from a terrible life of enforced labour in South Asia and helped them to get an education. He has often been physically attacked for helping children, for example for trying to free Nepalese children forced to work in a circus. He regularly risks his life to fight injustice; two of his colleagues have been murdered. I believe that the best thing he has done is to change how people think about child slavery and to make it an international issue.\n\nC (Boy 2):\nI’m really interested in ecology and my hero, or heroine, is Rachel Carson because she first got people thinking about the way we humans are causing permanent damage to the Earth’s ecosystems. She began as a biologist, specialising in writing about the sea, but she gradually became aware of the danger of using pesticides like DDT and the way they can harm the whole of the food chain, from the worm to humans! She wrote her classic book Silent Spring in 1962 to explain this to the general public, to explain how humans and nature are interdependent. The title of Silent Spring refers to the fact that one day all the birds might be dead so they won’t be able to sing in the springtime. The agricultural and chemical industries reacted very badly to the book and said she was unprofessional. But further research by other scientists proved that she was right about the dangers of chemicals used to kill insects. Nowadays there is a growing movement for organic food production, but unfortunately things in general are still getting worse, rather than better. We still need to read Rachel Carson’s book and think about its message.\n\nD (Girl 2):\nMy choice of hero isn’t very original, I’m afraid, but he’s the person I would most like to have met: John Lennon. He died a long time before I was born, and his most famous songs were written long before that, but when I listen to his music I really feel as if he’s speaking to me personally. I love the whole range of the Beatles’ music, from the early pop songs to the very experimental music at the end of their time as a group. John Lennon was the most innovative writer in the Beatles and he continued to create exciting music when he left and went solo. But although I love his music, what I admire about him is his dedication to universal peace. It’s amazing that the song Imagine, written in 1971, is still incredibly popular after all this time. It’s about a world where everyone can be equal, a world with no wars, no divisions between countries, no greed, no hunger, no material possessions ... I’d like to meet him because he was a lifelong rebel, and although he could be a difficult person, he was original, clever and funny. It was awful that he was killed in 1980 when he was only 40. I wonder what he would be doing if he was alive now.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Okay, so, Jen, we're gonna talk about media and technology, phones and music, things like that. So the first one is, how addicted are you to your phone? How long can you go without using our phone?\n                              Jen: That's a difficult question because I'm very, I would say I'm very addicted to my phone because I keep on checking it every five minutes. I feel like without my phone my head doesn't, my brain stops working, you know? \nTodd: Wow.\nJen: I would say the maximum I can stay without it would be one or two hours.\nTodd: You've got to be kidding me.\nJen: I mean, if you asked me in the past, yeah, I could stay without it for while, but nowadays, I don't even own a watch so that would be my time as well, so, I have to keep checking it. What about you?\nTodd: We are polar opposites. Actually, I am so bad about not using my phone, and that's a smart phone, actually I have two. I have an Android Galaxy and I have an iPhone. I set them down and forget where they are, and go days without actually checking them sometimes. I'll go to work and somebody will be like, are you mad at me? I've been trying to reach you and you won't ... And I'm like, no, I'm not mad at you, why? I'm like, oh, I haven't checked my phone in two days.\nJen: That sounds so crazy to me because I could never go without my phone for two days.\nTodd: Well, one, there's a couple things. One, it's old school, right? And two, I get all my information on the Internet on a PC. So I'm working, so I get everything on the Internet, like Facebook, news, stuff like that. The computer, like you said, tells the time. So I actually forget about my phone.\nJen: I think if I have a PC then I would also forget my phone. \nTodd: But your generation, it's all in your hand, right?\nJen: That's right because it's more convenient.\nTodd: Have you heard the term second brain?\nJen: No.\nTodd: Yeah, somebody at some teacher conference was saying that phones are students' second brain, so they use it, you hold it and you have two brains, one in your hands and one in your head.\nJen: I would agree.\nTodd: It's weird. So how about music? How addicted are you to music? Do you have to have music playing all the time?\nJen: Not all the time but then I would have to listen to music at least once a day because it just refreshes your mind and you can relieve from your stress through music. But it depends upon what kind of music you have. What about you? Do you like listening to music?\nTodd: No. I do, but I'm not a music aficionado, and I always listen to the same ten songs. I think a lot of older people, we kind of get into that rut where I listen, honestly, to music. And I'm from the 80s, so I'm 48, I'm almost 50. So I love music from the 70s and 80s and that's all I listen to.\nJen: That's understandable. Actually, I also have a lot of old songs, but I just don't listen, I just, it's not like I just keep on listening to those music. I actually keep on adding more music, more songs to it so that my play list is updated every now and then. I think, if you have good music, you will actually be addicted to it. Maybe you don't have good music.\nTodd: No, the music from the 80s is good. Okay, so what about TV? Do you watch TV every day?\nJen: Not so much because lately I've been so busy at school so I cannot really, yeah, I don't watch much TV. But, during weekends, yeah, I do like to watch new movies or different series.\nTodd: What about, are you one of those people that will stay up till 2:00, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning just watching YouTube videos?\nJen: Not YouTube videos but yes, if I'm addicted to some series then I would just binge watch and watch them till 5:00 in the morning.\nTodd: What shows do you watch?\nJen: Shows. Recently I've been watching Suits, it's like, it's a new series and it's really good. You should try it, too.\nTodd: Okay, I'll have to check it out. Thanks.\nJen: You're welcome, Todd.",

        "transcript": "Paul: Hi, this is Paul from England speaking with Katia from Mexico. First question is do you give money to charity? Katia: Well, Paul, it's a difficult question because you really want to help people, but I always question myself where if the money really gets to where it's supposed to go, so personally I rarely do give money to charities. I'd rather give my time, so I know if it's actually something happening. What about you?Paul: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. If it's a registered charity then I don't see there's a problem really with giving a donation. Katia: Yeah, I guess so, but really I wonder. There are so many charities in the world, and you wonder really how much money do the people actually get, so it's difficult to really know.Paul: How about if you're walking down the street and you see a homeless person asking for money?Katia: Homeless people! That's also difficult because you can see they need money or they need food. Sometimes I feel if you give money, you are supporting their way of life so I would rather give some food so they can eat, but maybe if it's a disabled person, I am more willing to give, rather than just the homeless.Paul: Yeah, I'd agree with you. It's difficult to know what they're gonna use the money for, so usually I never give money to men but if it's like an elderly woman, I'm happy to give a small donation.Katia: Why not men and only women?Paul: Well, going back to what you said about supporting their way of life, I mean, not in every case, but I think that often it can just be man's choice to be homeless on the street and he does have a chance to get a job I think.Katia: So you think the woman really doesn't have a choice, and the man...Paul: I think it's more difficult for a woman.Katia: Possibly. Possibly. That's a difficult question.Paul: For sure. Do you give money if you see children on the street?Katia: Well, it depends, because that's also giving money to children so they can continue asking for money, so I avoid it. I also avoid it. What about you?Paul: I'm a little bit reluctant to give money. I heard in a lot of poor countries that it can actually even be a business, like a parents will send their children onto the street.Katia: Unfortunately, that's true.Paul: OK, so maybe you like what you said before: it's better to donate your time than to donate money.Katia: Possibly. And hopefully things will change.",

        "transcript": "Fred: Hi, this is Fred from Canada and I'm here with Tarta from Thailand. Some people think that cooking should be taught in school. I agree with that idea. I feel that definitely there should be some cooking classes in school. How do you feel about that, Tarta?\nTarta: Well, I don't think that cooking class is supposed to be teaching at school because I learn cooking from my mom and my grandma and it gives me lots of, you know, good relation between mom and daughter and it's kind of a family activity too.\n                              \nFred: OK, that's a good point, but you see, you know, a lot of mothers are working nowadays in this new day and age and so it's difficult for them to find time to teach their kids how to cook, and so what you're finding is more and more children have bad eating habits. They don't eat properly. They don't get the amount of vegetables per day that they should eat, or fruits or protiens for that matter, and so I feel that if there were cooking classes in school then that could also help the situation because it would make them have a better eating lifestyle.\nTarta: Yeah, but why school? I mean, why you want to waste all the time studying cooking at school, not like instead of doing that, then you can learn all the top subjects like science, biology, chemistry and probably you're mom can't teach you all those complicated subjects, you know.\nFred: Yeah, but I'm sure there's a balance. I mean, you have so many hours of class per day. If you only took like one or two hours a week that would be enough for the kids to, you know, maybe find some interest into cooking, and then it would start from there. Then it would just snowball. Alright, like, they could start having some cooking classes, then, the children starts liking cooking this kind of thing, and then he goes back home, and he shares this new cooking recipe with his mom or his grandmother. Don't you think that would also bring the family closer?\nTarta: OK, if you're supposed to cook at school, and then you have to buy all the ingredients, and those ingredients.... why you have to shop, you know? And some ingredients are already at your house and you just do your own cooking, but if you do at school then you have to go shopping outside and look for the ingredients from the textbook, and it's so complicated.\nFred: I agree but, I mean that's just a slight problem isn't it. I mean, there's people working at the school that could be in charge of doing that and then once the class starts, well, all the ingredients are already on the table so there's no problem. They just start cooking, right?\nTarta: And one more thing. Like if you think about all the techniques, like family tastes and all, you can't find in cooking class at school.\nFred: Well, you got me there, Tarta. That's true.\nTarta: OK, Fred, you better come to my house, and I will show you how to cook.\nFred: Really? OK, I take your word on that Tarta.\nTarta: Yeah.",

The last five or six years I've started fishing again.\nDai: Fishing?\nDarren: Yeah, I know it’s got a bit of a dull image but I fished a lot when I was younger. I gave it up for about twenty years and someone got me back into it about six years ago and I really do enjoy it again. \nDai: What is it that, you know, draws you into fishing, I mean ...? \nDarren: Well, it’s quite unusual. We don’t fish as most people imagine where you sit by a riverbank and don’t move. The fishing I do is at night time. The fish come in a lot closer and I fish off the beach. Because they come in closer at night time, it’s the best time to go. So it’s quite exhilarating just being out there. You haven’t got to catch fish to enjoy it.\nDai: Right.\nDarren: It’s great being under the stars and hearing the waves crash in. It’s just a beautiful place to be even if you don’t catch a fish...which is good news really because I don’t catch fish very often. \nDai: Yeah, so if I wanted to have a go at fishing, what would I have to do? What kind of equipment would I have to get?\nDarren: Well I was amazed when I re-started how cheap it was. It was probably cheaper twenty years after I finished than it was when I packed it [in]. For about sixty pound you could go down to the local tackle shop and they’re very, very helpful. They’d kit you out. \nDai: Oh really?\nDarren: And you could start, but what I would advise is that you would find someone who did know what they were doing, just to show you the ropes really. But I was amazed how quickly I got back into it after so long away. \nDai: And what kind of fish are you catching?\nDarren: There’s loads of fish around the Pembrookshire coast. You know, absolutely loads of varieties, but we do target a fish called bass which I know there’s a lot of varieties around the world, but it’s a great eating fish. \nDai: Oh, so you eat the fish you catch normally? \nDarren: Yeah, I would only take a fish from the sea if I was going to eat it. If I wasn’t going to eat it, I would put it back...\nDai: o.k.\nDarren: But the bass is a beautiful eating fish, quite expensive to buy in a restaurant so it’s a lot better to catch them yourself.",

It's quite near Galway, so it's a little bit to the south of Galway, I think.\nTodd: OK, so it's near Galway.\nMarion: Yeah.\nTodd: OK.\nMarion: That's a city on the West Coast of Ireland.\nTodd: What is this place, the Cliffs of Moher?\nMarion: The Cliffs of Moher are, as far as I know, are the tallest cliffs in Europe.\nTodd: Really, the tallest?\nMarion: Yeah. I'm pretty sure. Definitely the tallest cliffs in Ireland, but I'm quite sure that we have that distinction, that they're actually the tallest cliffs in the whole of Europe.\nTodd: Wow. That's pretty cool. (Yeah) So when you go to these cliffs, what can you do? Can you climb down them, or?\nMarion: No, you can't. (What) I think if you tried, you might end up in the water and you may never get up again.\nTodd: You serious?\nMarion: Yeah, it's quite scary. When I went there for the first time, I was quite young, and I went with my mother and brother and uncle, and I remember my mother was holding my hand, and my brother, who was younger than me, was of course more brave than I was, so he was going right up the edge, and looking over and leaning out and I was really, really scared because at that time, there was no barrier to keep you from falling in, so yeah, really, really scary.\nTodd: I bet. So when you go to the Cliffs of Moher is it really windy, does it rain a lot?\nMarion: Yeah, it's quite windy because you're right on the edge of Europe, basically you're facing the Atlantic ocean, which can get quite turbulent, there so you can see the waves crashing up against the cliffs. That's if you lean over of course. There's a flat area of rock where many tourists kind of lie on their stomachs and inch their way up to the edge and then they look over, but I was too scared when I went. I couldn't do it. I thought for sure I'd fall over and die.\nTodd: So assuming that someone goes to Ireland and they go to Dublin, they fly into Dublin, how will they get to the Cliffs of Moher?\nMarion: Um, pretty easily. Actually, from Dublin you have the choice of going either by train, directly across to Galway, then from Galway, you would need to take a bus, so you could go from Dublin to Galway by bus as well, but the train is probably more comfortable and then it would be a shortish bus ride to the Cliffs of Moher, but obviously in Ireland, you're best bet is really to hire a car if you can.\nTodd: OK. Well, sounds like a good place to go. Thanks Marion.\nMarion: No problem.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So I'm here with Shantel and we're talking about stereotypes or about images people have about Americans. We're both teachers in Japan and it's interesting what people think about Americans. So I want to bring up a touchy topic, guns.\n                              Shantel: Guns in America.\nTodd: Yeah, so I have to admit that my students also are shocked when I tell them that pretty much everybody that I know has shot a gun.\nShantel: Yes.\nTodd: (laughs) And every family I know has a gun and it's really shocking when people hear that, but it's kind of true, I think.\nShantel: Yeah, I think especially since you and I both are from rural towns.\nTodd: Rural areas, yeah.\nShantel: But I grew up in a household that had several guns because my father is a hunter, so I think this is a little bit rare, the hunting at least, but I grew up and learned how to hunt along with my brother, and so for me it was, it was really normal to shoot a gun, to know how to be safe with a gun, to know when you can use it, how to clean it, things like this, and I think a lot of people in my town knew, a lot of, a lot of my friends and family members knew how to do it but in Japan, it's ... I if I tell someone that I have a gun in my home in America, the, the look on their face is-\nTodd: Yeah.\nShantel: ... like horror, scared-\nTodd: Yeah.\nShantel: ... very confused, why would anyone have a gun? And, I think I can understand because in Japan that is just not the case, guns are not as common or as readily available to the public in general.\nTodd: Yeah, and I have to admit like I grew up on a farm and we had, you know, rifles and shotguns and we had them for either hunting or we actually had them for, to protect livestock like animals on the farm, but we never really used them. Well, actually I shouldn't say that, we could use them for target practice and we would, if we were bored, sometimes we would go out in the field and have, you know, try to hit tin cans or something. That was kind of how we would pass the time. But I have to admit, I was always freaked out when I saw handguns. I didn't like handguns, I never did.\nShantel: Oh, aha.\nTodd: I don't know why, it just was like, you know, you'd see somebody would have one on a shelf or something like that and I thought, \"Oh, wow, that's kind of weird.\" But the rifles and shotguns never bothered me at all.\nShantel: Yeah, no, I actually with that too I could agree because I also at home we do have a handgun and I, for me ... Well, maybe for me target practice was not so exciting for me, and so with handguns that would be typically what people would use them for is target practice. And I yeah, I don't know, I was never really drawn to them either, I typically I enjoyed using shotguns for trap shooting or clay pigeon shooting. And that, that was really fun because it's like a game, it's a sport, and it's the noise wasn't so loud, so my ears didn't hurt too much so-\nTodd: Okay, so another thing that you know we're both teachers in Japan, so another thing that I think is shocking for the students is I would tell them that I had a car in high school and I drove to high school starting at 16. So I was quite young and I was driving at 15, and what really shocked them ... Well, I'm a, a bit older than you ... is that I actually got my driver's license at high school, I actually had a free class I took and we had a building with like a simulator. We actually got it for free, I don't think they do it anymore. Yeah, so back in the day, and our parking lot was full of cars. I think that's very rare in most places in the world, that high school kids drive to school.\nShantel: Yes, yes, I agree and I, just like you, my students too have been very surprised that when I tell them that I started driving. I started a, a little bit later at 15 and a half, 16, but still that is much younger compared to 20 or in Italy it's 18. So most students or most people have finished high school and then they start driving, it seems and at least in European countries and here in Japan, and so yeah, they're always shocked and some teachers will ask me like, \"Oh, what was it like driving when you're 16? My daughter is 16, I would never let her drive.\" And I say, \"Oh, it was okay, I practiced with my parents and I scared them half to death a few times but we, I'm still alive, they're still alive, everyone's okay (laughing).\"\nTodd: Yeah, I know looking back, wow, especially when you're young. Um, another thing I think that's really different would be just the, the social relationships when you're young. So, you know, kids would hold hands, sometimes kids would kiss if you're boyfriend and girlfriend in public, at school. And I think in Japan that would be very rare.\nShantel: Oh, so rare, oh so rare.\nTodd: That would really be risque, they would really be throwing ... , yeah, so their relationships were definitely different.",

Do you remember?\nBen: The last movie I watched was a science fiction. It was called The Shape of Water. \nHana: Okay. Never heard, never seen, yeah.\nBen: Well, I can you a little about it, if want to hear.\nHana: Yeah, yes. Please do.\nBen: Okay, so it's actually a love story about a janitor and a merman.\nHana: Okay. Yeah. \nBen: A merman, like, you know ... \nHana: Mermaid. Mermaid, yeah. \nBen: Mermaid, yeah, merman. It's actually ... I don't want to give away too much of the story, but this janitor is working at this underground government facility. She cleans the floors next to this giant fish tank. She never knows actually what's inside, but one day, this merman comes up to the glass and she sees him. She instantly falls in love. The beautiful part is, is that he can't speak. He can't speak English, right? But the beautiful part is she's actually deaf. She can't hear, so this beautiful, amazing relationship kind of blossoms from them. She teaches him sign language. Oh, it's unbelievable. I recommend it. \nHana: It's like a modern version of Romeo and Juliet, yeah? Kind of. \nBen: Maybe. I mean, that's not like they weren't ... They weren't star-crossed lovers, per se, but, no, it was definitely an interesting love story. Yeah, that's the last movie I saw, recently. \nHana: What about horror movies? \nBen: I actually like this movie called It. It's based on a book written by this horror author, Stephen King. Maybe you've heard of Stephen King. \nHana: Oh, yes, yes, yes. He's a famous writer, yeah? \nHana: Mm-hmm \nBen: Yeah, this is actually a story about a .... It's kind of a sci-fi horror mix, so it's like, of course it's one of my favorites. It's about this alien that comes to this town and takes a form as a clown, an evil clown, every 65 years. He wakes up from his deep sleep and he's hungry, because he needs to eat. He takes his form as a clown and terrorizes this town every 65 years. The movie takes place in the 19, let's see, I think it's the 1970's. That's the time when the monster wakes up. This group of kids starts figuring it out, \"What's happening in our town?\" It's kind of a coming of age tale in a horror movie. I don't know, it's really interesting. I hope I didn't ruin it. I'm not going to tell you the ending, of course. \nHana: Okay. I'm not a big fan of horror movies. It makes me kind of ... Not to go to toilets or not to go to bathroom. \nBen: Alright.",

Usually when the sales are on, it can be a good time to shop because there's sales but it also draws a lot people and everybody's pushing and trying to get the clothes they want that are on special. Yeah, I don't like that.Todd: Right. Right. Actually, the thing I really don't like about shopping is having - or clothes shopping - is having to try on clothes. You know, like, you go and you find your size and then you put it on and then it doesn't fit, then you have to try it on again and it's just, it takes forever. And you look at the numbers and it's so hard to find the number that fits you.Rebecca: Yeah, it seems every year the numbers are changing sizes. You wear a size ten and then the next year it's not that size so. Yeah. That can be a real problem, too.Todd: It drives me nuts. Now in Australia, when you go shopping in the store, do you normally get a lot of personal customer service?Rebecca: Yes. Yes. They tend to come up to you as soon as you come into the store, and if you say you're browsing then they leave you alone but it can be really good, the shops I shop at. They do help you with the fitting sizes and when you're in the change rooms, you can just say, \"No, I need a new size\" and they will go and get it for you, Todd: Yeah, in the States I think the service is really good as well, but what's really annoying is that now they always want to have you join some club or some membership.Rebecca: The points cards.Todd: Yeah, so you just want to buy your shirt and they ask you, \"Would you like a credit card?\" or \"Would you like a discount card or membership?\" I can't stand it.Rebecca: Yeah, I know. I think I have so many cards in my wallet, and they're like, \"Oh, are you a member?\" and I pull out all my cards and I'm not a member so they join me up.Todd: Right. Right. Usually these days I just say no, but it's just so annoying.Rebecca: Yeah, it can be. Yes.",

My specialty, what I did a lot of was, different varieties of bread. I baked a lot of white bread, whole wheat bread, 60% whole wheat bread, rye bread, sour dough, Italian bread, French bread. So mostly I did breads. Todd: Ok, sounds good. What is the routine of a baker? Do you have to get up early, or how does that work?Alan: Yes. Generally most bakeries, especially bakeries that sell bread, they start operations very early in the morning. With the bread, you want to get the bread out and fresh as early as possible. So bread bakers will start at 3am or 4am. They’ll come in and open up the shop. They’ll get everything going, fire up the ovens and start mixing the bread dough. So if the bakery opens at 8 in the morning, the customers come into fresh baked bread.Todd: I love that smell. So what would you say was the best thing about being a baker?Alan: The best thing about being a baker would be, making all those fancy pastries: Danish, croissants, apple strudel. I enjoyed that part of baking, making those kinds of products. Todd: Was there anything that you did not like about being a baker?Alan: Pretty much everything else. Specifically, I didn’t like the hours. Mostly the hours I didn’t like. The actual work was not bad but it was the hours and the pay wasn’t so good. Todd: Ok well, still though you’d have to have loved that smell of fresh bread everyday. Alan: That I did enjoy yes.",

She's been for so long trying to discourage people and educate people in what deforestation does to the country and how it effects people and the environment in general.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Nitya, now in India, the Ganges river is very famous. Why is the river so famous in India?\nNitya: I guess most reason because, the Ganges River's origin is from Himalayas and it's considered very pure because it's basically by the melting of the ice by the Himalayas, and it's, the whole 12 months and 24 hours flowing river, I mean, it's, there's no time in the whole year that it dries up and people say the Ganges River dries up, it's like throughout the year, the river is there, and water is there, the water level is maintained and it's considered wholly because of the religious reasons I guess because they say in Himalayas, there was a Shiva there and this Ganges river origins from his head, (Oh, I see) Yeah, so this is...\nTodd: And Shiva is a very famous God.\nNitya: Yeah, exactly.\nTodd: In Hinduism.\nNitya: Yeah, religion, yeah.\nTodd: So, you said that the river comes from glaciers or from ice from the Himalayas, so is the river super clean?\nNitya: Super clean I guess, when it starts from there but by the time it reaches the land, I don't think it's super clean.\nTodd: Does the river have a problem with pollution?\nNitya: I guess so, because it's, it's usually, like, like all the cities which are on the bank of this rivers, I guess this problem is all over not only in Ganges River because there no infrastructure about this cleaning environment so much, still not in action. There are so many schemes from the government, but the actions are not taken.\nTodd: Well, that's the same everywhere in the world.\nNitya: Yeah, but it's a little too much in India because, first thing, there are still a lot of standard problems which are to be solved in India, rather than these things, there are people still dying out of hunger, so a country who has, which has still people who don't get one meal a day, I think they got to look at that first, and then look at anything else, so people have very different way of opinions on these issues (right) so, yeah \nTodd: Well, actually, just recently in America, with the hurricane that we had, it was the same thing. It was very eye-opening about many people that are in poverty.\n                                          Nitya: Exactly.\nTodd: Yeah, now back to the river, people bathe in the river, is that correct?\nNitya: Yeah, Yep.\nTodd: Now is it wholly or is it just a routine thing?",

        "transcript": "Katia: Hello, everyone, this is Katia from Mexico and we are here with Paul from England, and today we're gonna have a very interesting conversation about men. What's difficult about being a man and what are the good things about being a man, so we have the right candidate for this. Paul, what are the bad things about being a man? Paul: What's difficult about being a man? Well, I think... the hardest thing I think is working. The man is under a lot of pressure to go to work and to earn money for the family.Katia: But I thought men like to work.Paul: Yeah, men do like to work of course. Like most men want to have a career but along with the work, there's a lot of pressure. They have pressure from their wife, from their kids, from their family, from the bank manager.Katia: Yeah, I guess so. That can be stressful. What else? What else are one of the bad thing of being a man?Paul: Well, I guess, if a man's... has a good job or a job that's taking up a lot of his time, this can sometimes lead to problems with his relationship, especially with his his kids, I think. For example, if the kids are spending a lot of time with their mother, usually they form a closer relationship with their mom, so the father, I think, misses out on his kids growing up sometimes.Katia: Yeah, that is true and now I can that clearly unfortunately it seems that it's a lot of bad things with the job, but I am sure they're very good things about being a man.Paul: For sure, there are a lot of advantages I think. For example, appearance. I think, for a man, he doesn't really... when he's not working, he doesn't really need to worry about his appearance. He can wear whatever clothes he wants to wear. He doesn't brush is hair or he can wear scruffy shoes for example.Katia: Mmm, are you sure about that one?Paul: Would you disagree? Yeah, I think usually that appearance is not so important for a man.Katia: Possibly.I guess women spend more time in appearances but there must be more things than this about good things about being a man.Paul: Good things? I think men usually can have more fun than women. Like in their free time, they get to play sport and do a lot more fun things I think than women.Katia: Well, Paul, I'm gonna have to disagree with that one, but tell me why. Why do you think men can have more fun than women?Paul: Maybe I'm just thinking from a man's point of view, but to me shopping sounds very boring.Katia: OK, well, I do agree with that one, but still you haven't answered my question.Paul: What was your question again?Katia: Why do you think men can have more fun than women?Paul: Just I think that men have a lot more freedom to do fun things and travel. For example, safety and traveling alone. A man can just go traveling by himself, where a woman, she has to think, where am I going, is it safe. For example, this kind of think.Katia: OK. I can understand a little bit. You were getting a little bit nervous, Paul.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Marion, you've lived in Italy. (Yes) Italy has many favorite cities. Can you talk a little bit about them?\nMarion: Sure, well the first city I lived in was Genoa. And Genoa is on the Riviera, so it's a very beautiful place. It's a port city, so my apartment was actually looking out over the port, so I had a great apartment. It was a great view. Genoa has a very old center, so the buildings are hundreds and hundreds of years old obviously but it's quite dirty, well I don't really want to say dirty, but it's not very well looked after, the historical center, which is a pity but it does have really a lot of character. I really liked it.\nTodd: So what other cities have you been to?\nMarion: Well, I've been to Rome of course. I've been to Rome a few times. I think it's one of my favorite cities actually. I love the fact that in Rome, you walk out of your hotel, or wherever you're staying and you're just surrounded by history, by this amazing, you know, the Coliseum for example. Actually the first time I ever arrived in Italy, I came from the airport directly to the Coliseum station and I walked out the door of that metro station and there was the Coliseum in front of me. It was one of those moments. It was \"Ah, my God!\" and there was a full moon up to the left of the coliseum. It was like, almost too perfect, too good to be true. \nTodd: Ah, did you get a chance to go to Venice?\nMarion: Yes, I did. Actually, I went to Venice several times. The first time I went was great. We had a chance to travel around, or walk around, and see the city for ourselves. It's really amazing, you know all these bridges, and if you want to get anywhere you have to hop on a boat, and the second time I went though, it was for Carnival, Carnivale, that was amazing thing, so everybody is dressed up in their costumes, and the costumes are really, really elaborate actually and people were having their faces painted, that kind of thing, and everybody was in really good spirits, you know. It was a great occasion.\nTodd: Sounds fun. And lastly did you get a chance to go to Florence?\nMarion: Yes, I did actually. I went often because I lived an hour away in Pisa, and so Florence is amazing, it's just maybe the most cultural city after Rome as regards art galleries and that kind of thing and just the city itself. It's all that kind of Terra Cotta hues of the buildings, you know, and big piazzas, lots of statues and it has a bit of a rich feel to it actually, so, yeah. It's a really good place to people watch as well.\nTodd: And Milan, did you get a chance to go to Milan?\nMarion: Yeah, I stayed with a friend in Milan actually for a couple of weeks. Just a few years ago, even though I had passed through before, I didn't really like it because it's a big built up city, lots of smog and pollution, but when I stayed there with my friend and got to know it a bit better, I ended up quite liking it.\nTodd: Ok, well, lastly, real quickly, if somebody was going to Italy, and there was only one city they could see, what would you recommend?\nMarion: It would Rome, absolutely. Yeah.\nTodd: OK. Thanks a lot Marion.\nMarion: You're welcome.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Okay, so I'm here with Jen and we're talking about clothing. Now, Jen, I'm a bit older than you, so I probably don't really care about what I wear so much. I always kind of pay the same price for my clothing. So I'm wondering, what's it like for a younger person? How much are you willing to pay? What is your price range?\n                              Jen: It depends upon like what you're buying. For example, if it's a pair of jeans then I would pay around 4,000 yen, that's Japanese yen. $40?\nTodd: Oh really? That's still relatively cheap. Like some people pay like $100, right? Or $200. \nJen: I don't think I would ever pay that much because I'm a student right now,so paying more than that would be something I wouldn't do. \nTodd: Well what about in your home country of Nepal? How much would people pay for pants there?\nJen: In Nepal, like compared to Japan, it's really cheap there. You can actually get a really decent pant in 1,500 yen. \nTodd: That's like $15. \nJen: Yes. \nTodd: Around. Oh that's good. What's the cheapest you would pay? I mean, I guess you could get stuff for free, but what's the lowest you pay for clothes? Or for pants? For pants?\nJen: Okay, so sometimes when there's a sale and especially if there's shorts then you can just get it for like 500 yen. \nTodd: Oh wow. Five bucks. \nJen: Like five bucks, yeah. \nTodd: That's good. Now what about shoes? Do you have a lot of shoes?\nJen: Yes I do. \nTodd: Okay, for some people like shoes they spend a lot of money on shoes. I have a rule, unless it's dress shoes for work, I don't like to spend anything over $100. If it's athletic shoes, like sneakers, never more than $50. Ever. \nJen: Okay. \nTodd: Like how much do you on average pay for shoes?\nJen: I think it's different for girls, because our shoes range from $10 to, you know, a lot of money. \nTodd: What's the most you've ever paid for a pair of shoes?\nJen: $100. \nTodd: Oh really? That's not too bad. \nJen: Yeah, it's not bad at all. \nTodd: Yeah, no, that's good. Kind of good range. How about the cheapest? Five bucks?\nJen: Not five bucks, maybe 10 bucks, yeah. \nTodd: 10 bucks, yeah. All right. I don't even know if I could find shoes for five dollars. They'd fall apart, right? \nJen: You can, though. \nTodd: Oh yeah? \nJen: Yeah. On sale you can even get it in like three bucks. \nTodd: Okay. That brings up a good question because we're talking about shoes. How important is fashion for you? Are you willing to wear uncomfortable clothing to look good?\nJen: Not always, because I really like comfort. I would rather wear pajamas and go out than, like you know, wear something really uncomfortable. But it depends, like if you're going to a party then you would obviously want to look good and wouldn't really care about comfort much. But in a daily basis, I would go for comfort always. \nTodd: Okay. Nice. How about for example, jewelry? Do you like to wear necklaces, earrings, rings, things like that?\nJen: No, I'm not much of an accessories person. \nTodd: Okay. Now in your home country, Nepal, is it common for people to wear a lot of jewelry? \nJen: Yes, they do. \nTodd: Oh yeah? Oh, okay. What do people like to wear?\nJen: Everyone prefers gold I guess, because it's like people think that if you wear gold then you are rich. And yeah, gold, silver, and some wear diamonds. \nTodd: Okay, nice. Nice. I don't have any jewelry, I don't think. Oh wow, I didn't even realize that. I don't have one piece of jewelry. \nJen: Really?\nTodd: Yeah, I have no rings. No necklaces. I have a broken watch. But yeah. \nJen: Don't you ever feel like buying one though? Don't you ever follow a trend and thought about piercing your ears or something?\nTodd: That would be interesting, piercing my ears. You know, when I was your age, which was about over 20 years ago, it was just starting to happen that boys or men would pierce their ears. But it was a bit controversial, it wasn't like it's common now. So yeah. \nJen: What about necklaces?\nTodd: Yeah, I used to have a necklace, yeah. And I just stopped wearing them, it's just not a thing. Yeah. How about you? Would you like to have piercings? Like do you have, you have earrings, right?\nJen: Yes, I do, but I rarely use them because at some point it's just hurts and you just feel like you don't really need it, so yeah. \nTodd: What about in your country, do people have piercings in different places like eyelids or lips or ... ? Like a nose ring?\nJen: Yeah, they have nose ring and then they also pierce their ears, like in so many different places. But I've never really seen anyone really piercing their eyelids or stuff. I would want to pierce my-\nTodd: Belly button? The belly button?\nJen: Yes. \nTodd: Oh my gosh, that looks like it would hurt. \nJen: I know-\nTodd: So much. \nJen: -but I really want to do it. \nTodd: Really? All right, well, just be careful. \nJen: Okay, I will",

What does \"rips\" mean?\n\t                    Roe: Ripping means if you are like a surfer, if you say he rips, he is really good.\n\t                    Todd: Oh, OK. He rips! Wow, so just for surfing?\n                        Roe: And windsurfing, too.\n                        Todd: He rips. Skateboarding?\n                        Roe: Yeah. Skateboarding too. \n                        Todd: Skateboarding, he rips \n                        Roe: Yeah, it means he can make some great moves.\n                        Todd: Great turns, great flips. OK, who rips?\n                        Roe: Just go to the beach, and you see it. Like, you don't even have to talk, you just have to see it, and if you rip then you get respect, and if you talk, if you have a chance to talk to the guy, it's almost always that he is a nice guy. \n                        Todd: Really.\n                        Roe: Well, 99 percent.\n                        Todd: So guys who rip are nice guys.\n                        Roe: Nice guys.

Like open, no attitude, no attitude,it's like a way to elaborate.\n                        Todd: OK, so do you rip?\n                        Roe: No. I'm in progress. I'm trying. It's hard. It's hard to rip though.\n                        Todd: But you said earlier that you are very good windsurfing so you are closest to ripping at windsurfing.\n                        Roe: Man, In my dreams, but in reality, I'm, no, I'm trying.\n                        Todd: Maybe you're being modest. So a modest person doesn't say he rips or he is good\n                        Roe: You got the point, no I was just kidding, I can't rip.\n                        Todd: OK, who is the best surfer in the world?\n                        Roe: Robbie Naish.\n                        Todd: Robbie Naish. What country does he come from?\n                        Roe: Hawaii. \nTodd:  Oh, so he's hawaiian. He's American. \n                        Roe: Yeah, fom Ohahu!\n                        Todd: From Ohahu, so he surfs on waves. -- How big are the waves that Robbie Naish surfs on? \n                        Roe: OK like Jaws, there is a specific point in Maui, Hawaii Maui, and it's called Jaws, cause people say that there are a lot of sharks at the point, but anyway, at Jaws 25 meters or 30 meters in winter.\n                        Todd: Man, that's high. 25 to 30 meters. That's what? Three stories? Maybe! \n                        Roe: That's like from here to the basement.\n                        Todd: Wow! And were on the second floor so that's three stories.\n                        Roe: Oh, right, right, right, right.\n                        Todd: Man, that's high. That's really high. What's the highest wave you've ever surfed on? So you're standing up here. The ceiling!\n                        Roe: Yeah! Probably the ceiling.\n                        Todd: So that's what, maybe 10 feet.\n                        Roe: I don't know the feet stuff.\n                        Todd: So that would be, 3, 4 meters.\n                        Roe: Yeah, 3, 4 meters probably. \n                        Todd: Wow, that's still pretty high.\n                        Roe: Yeah, if you are in the ocean you are like lying down right, so it's quite high actually, yeah, if you're standing up it doesn't seem that high but.\n                        Todd: But, when you're on the ground, you're right, when you're lying flat on your stomach, you're right it would seem very high. So Robbie Naish, does he make a lot of money surfing?\n                        Roe: Yep.\n                        Todd: He's a rich man.\n                        Roe: He's a billionaire.\n                        Todd: Wow, has he ever come to Japan?\n                        Roe: Many times.\n                        Todd: Really!\n                        Roe: Yep.\n                        Todd: Wow.\n                        Roe: For promotion.\n                        Todd: For promotion.\n                        Roe: He owns a boarding, sailing, and what have you. He owns a lot of companies. Yeah, he's smart too. Nice guy.\n                        Todd: Nice guy and he's a nice guy because he rips.",

I was promised that I wasn't going to have to teach any beginners or any little children because it was my first job. I was promptly given the beginner infants. \nMy first day of teaching I was given a book which said, 'Ah! Go into the classroom and say \"Hello\" to the children and they'll all say \"Hello\" back to you and wave. I walked into a class of five four-year olds, followed by all their mothers and grandmothers and I said, \"Hello\" and they all burst into tears. \nI spent half the lesson trying to get them to say,\"Hello\" to each other and stop them from crying while all the grandmothers stood around and stared at me. I finally finished off my singing the whatever Happy Princess Song, all on my own, with crying infants to accompany me. It was one of the worst days of my life. I could identify with all the children though, because I wanted to sit on the floor and cry with them by the end of it. I think that that was when I realized that teaching kids was never going to be my vocation. I had some other classes as well but quick soon after that and moved onto adults who cry slightly less. Yeah, that was my first teaching experience. Not the best.",

You have three main regions?\nAnja: We have four.\nTodd: Four?Anja: Actually.Todd: Could you talk about them?Anja: Yes, we have four regions and this actually concerns the languages, which we have four official languages. It's German, French, Italian, and Romansh. And actually, the last one, Romansh, it became an official language just like twelve years ago, and only a little part the Swiss population can speak Romansh, actually, but it just sort of became a national, an official language some years ago. And yeah, well, the country's really small and we sometimes have some troubles communicating to each other, but usually people talk at least two languages, so it works out most of the time.Todd: So, in your country, you don't have the one uniform language that everybody speaks?Anja: No, we don't. Like we have Swiss, but Swiss is only being used in the German speaking part of Switzerland, which means like we don't actually use German when we talk. It's only for writing, but when we talk to each other, to our parents, to our teachers, we use Swiss.Todd: So Swiss is closest to German? It's Germanic?Anja: Yes, you can say that but it's very difficult for German people to understand us when we're talking actually because it's really fast and a really cute language, apparently. Yes.Todd: Now, what is the percentage breakdown, like what percentage is French, Italian, etc?Anja: I couldn't tell you the percentage but the biggest part is German, followed by French, Italian, and Romansh is only zero point five percent of the population, so.Todd: And just out of curiosity, Romansh, what does that sound like? Does that sound like Italian or?Anja: It's a mix of the three main languages I would say, like a mix of German, French, and Italian and, I can catch a word here or there but, yeah, I don't really understand it.Todd: And lastly, what part are you from in Switzerland?Anja: I'm from the German part.Todd: OK.Anja: Yes.Todd: Oh, thanks Anja.Anja: Oh, you're welcome.",

Who takes care of your dog?\n                              Greg: Well, we have very good friends who love to have him. In fact, sometimes my friends offer before we go. They know we're going, \"Hey, can we take care of Dancer?\" and they take good care of him.\nTodd: So, have you ever actually traveled with your dog?\nGreg: Actually, yes. Well, when we travel in Japan, he travels with us almost everywhere we go. He sits in the car and sometimes we camp and sleep in the car with him or we stay in tents and he travels with us ... but we've also traveled overseas with him.\nTodd: Oh, wow, that's cool, so you've actually ... you've taken your dog on like long trips on the plane?\nGreg: Yes. We moved from Japan to the United Arab Emirates and he came with us there. We lived there for awhile.\nTodd: Wow. You took your dog to the Emirates?\nGreg: Yes, and also we traveled into Oman. In fact we did some serious mountain climbing in Oman with him.\nTodd: So like, how do you take a dog when you travel? What do you got to do?\nGreg: Well, depending on the country, you have to check into the requirements. He needs a lot of vaccinations. Make sure he's doesn't ... he has to be checked by a vet to make sure he doesn't have any illnesses.\nTodd: Oh, really? Like how long does that take? I mean, do you have to take him to the vet and do this like a month before, or is it something you just do right before you travel?\nGreg: Probably a couple of weeks at least is average.\nTodd: So, how do you take a dog on a plane?\nGreg: Well, not every airplane company will allow dogs so you have to check into which do allow them and then you have to have a special nice size container and you have to put a little bit of food in them and you make sure that the airline company tells everybody who's working along ... like if there are any stops on a stopover, they have to make sure everybody knows that there's a dog and then they'll take care ... make sure to check the water and make sure the temperature controls in the back of the plane are at the right setting.\nTodd: When you get off the plane, is your dog kind of freaked out? Is Dancer all stressed?\nGreg: He is so happy to get off. He hates flying.\nTodd: So when he sees the cage, does he act funny? Does he act, you know, like with dread, fear?\nGreg: He looks at me with his eyes and he tries to talk me out of it.\nTodd: Does he ever succeed?\nGreg: He succeeds in a lot of things, but if I have to move, I've gotta move and we're a family so he comes with me.",

It's, the ball's about the size of an American football, but the game, in American football you pass forward, but in rugby you pass backwards. Games are a bit shorter. Their 80 minutes long. Less stopages than American football, but like soccer it's continuous play, how-should-I-say, it's a physically demanding sport, probably the one of the most physically demanding sports in the world.\n\t                    Todd: OK, so you say it's physically demanding. How is it physically demanding?\n                        Shawn: You have to be extremely strong, but at the same time, you have to have, wha-chu-call, an extreme line on stamina to play this sport. Without stamina, you can not continue in this sport.\n                        Todd: OK, just some people may not know, what is stamina?\n                        Shawn: You have to be able to run for 80 minutes in the game. Besides the game rugby has a bit of it's own culture. A bit of a cult in the world. It's a very small following but people do follow it, follow it very devoutly, very seriously, and it, how-should-I-say, I can honsestly say rugby has been a big part in changing me into the person that I am presently.\n                        Todd: Uh-huh. How so?\n                      Shawn: Sort of, how I can develop my leadership skills, my social skills, and how to work as a team player, in such a, how-should-I-say, in that time when you do play rugby, it's so aggressive, and it teaches you how to be a leader in tight situations, and it shows how you can truly push yourself to the limit, and not go, how-should-I-say, not go over the limit.",

        "transcript": "Gyri: Okay. Viyasan, have you\n                      ever overcome any fears. \nViyasan: Okay, that's a good\n                      question. I think there's many fears that I've overcome and I'm sure\n                      everyone has as well, but the one that sticks out to me the\n                      most was attending university after high school. I\n                      think the scariest part of that was meeting all\n                      the different types of people, different people\n                      from different cultures, from different high\n                      schools, from different areas. It was very odd to\n                      see that group all mixed together. I wasn't sure\n                      how to approach people and talk to them. Some of\n                      the classes were very tough. It was just a huge mess of\n                      interacting with people and doing well in school.\n                      But I think the best way to approach it is to find\n                      similarities that you can connect with people. \nFor example, I really liked basketball and so I\n                      tried to hang out with other people who liked\n                      basketball and other people who enjoyed some of my\n                      similar subjects. For example, I like marketing\n                      and so I was a big fan of other students who took\n                      very similar classes and I would talk to them\n                      about my interests. And so, I think that's how I\n                      got through university, was trying to find people\n                      that made similar interests of mine ... or, sorry,\n                      or had similar interests and just grow with them,\n                      learn more, and then slowly meet new people with\n                      similar interests as well. So I think that's how I\n                      overcame the hurdle of first year university. \nGyri: Yeah. \nViyasan: Yeah. \nGyri: And what year are you in? \nViyasan: I am in my fourth year\n                      right now. \nGyri: Okay, so you've been for a\n                      while. \nViyasan: Just one more semester\n                      here at APU and- \nGyri: This is your last\n                      semester? \nViyasan: Yep, and then I'll be\n                      graduating, so it's pretty scary heading into the\n                      real world, the adult world. \nGyri: Yeah, you're gonna have to\n                      find a job. \nViyasan: Exactly, yeah. That's\n                      gonna be a little bit stressful as well. \nGyri: Are you worried about\n                      that? \nViyasan: Finding a job? Right\n                      now, I do have a job when I graduate university.\n                      I'll be working within a marketing context, luckily, it's\n                      something that I'm interested in, in a marketing\n                      context at a consulting firm. So that's solving\n                      problems for different types of businesses within\n                      a marketing context. \nGyri: That sounds cool. \nViyasan: Yeah, what about\n                      yourself? What are some of your interests? Are you\n                      scared about anything when you graduate? \nGyri: Well, I haven't really\n                      been ... I'm trying not to think about now 'cause\n                      I still have so many years left. The degree that\n                      I'm taking, social anthropology, isn't really a\n                      degree that you get work from. Especially, only\n                      with a bachelor's degree. I'm gonna have to take\n                      more years of other stuff. I'm thinking of taking\n                      English literature and then, eventually becoming a\n                      teacher, teaching in high school. But there's a\n                      long way to go, so I'll probably not be done until\n                      I'm like 28, 29 and I'm 23 right now. I'm not\n                      really worrying about jobs yet. \nViyasan: Got it. Got it. Well,\n                      that's a big relief. I know that when a lot of\n                      university students graduate, they go job hunting,\n                      or even in their third or fourth year. It's good\n                      to know that you still have lots of time before\n                      you go job hunting. You're in the clear for now. \nGyri: Yeah, for now. \nViyasan: Yeah. \nGyri: I'll save the stressing\n                      for later. \nViyasan: Exactly, exactly. Gyri,\n                      so how 'bout in the past? Have you ever overcome a\n                      fear? \nGyri: Yeah and it's similar to\n                      what you were talking about. After high school, I\n                      went to Barcelona to study graphic design and I\n                      was supposed to be there for four years, but it\n                      was very scary and I was only 19 years old living\n                      in a foreign country. The university wasn't really\n                      good. They promised us an English class, but they\n                      didn't speak English so we were the only four\n                      people in the English class and they were only\n                      speaking Spanish to us. We couldn't understand\n                      anything, so it was a very stressful situation;\n                      being in a new country, not speaking the language,\n                      and the university not being very supportive. That\n                      was very stressful, but it was a very good\n                      experience and I learned a lot from it, but I\n                      ended up going back to Norway and going to\n                      university there instead. Yeah. \nViyasan: And how'd you like the\n                      change? When you went back to Norway, did you find\n                      things a lot more easier for you to grasp? How were the\n                      courses at university in Norway? \nGyri: Yeah, it was much more\n                      easier. It wasn't stressful at all really. Yeah,\n                      so it kind of made me more accustomed to\n                      university life, I guess. \nViyasan: Got it. \nGyri: Yeah. \nViyasan: That's very cool.",

Shibika: That's right.Fred: Can you tell me what happened?Shibika: Yeah, in fact, as I told you before, I went to India on vacation and I had stopped in Delhi. That's the capital of India for a day, and I was going out with my friend to watch a movie in his car and he was driving, and he just, there was a turn. He took a turn and he just raced across, He surpassed this car that was going and we dashed across the divider so I banged my shoulder into one of the car doors and that is how... so I basically fractured my collarbone.Fred: Oh, so you broke your shoulder.Shibika: That's right.Fred: What happened after that?Shibika: So, we had to immediately rush to the hospital and he panicked. I was like... I was not really unconscious but the pain was... it pained really bad so I needed pain killer. I needed an injection, so I went to the hospital and there they gave me a pain killer injection and after that they took an x-ray and then they found it was a fracture so I had to be admitted in the hospital and I was admitted in the hospital immediately and I informed my parents who were not in Delhi, who were in Lucknow. It's like five hours from Delhi and I informed them the next day so... because I didn't want to panic them that time. They couldn't have come to Delhi so. Yeah, so but it was alright. They tied this bandage, plaster kind of thing across my neck and that time it hurt really bad. Yeah, it took time to for me to recover.Fred: So, after you recovered, what was the process. So you had to go through the hospital and then they put the bandage.Shibika: That's right. I had to be with the bandage on for a really long time, because I couldn't have taken out the bandage because in a bone fracture you can't be given any medicines or you can't be given any external treatment for it to get OK. You know, the only was for it to get OK is it's gonna heal naturally and with the bones with time. The bones are going to get fixed on their own so I had to on that plaster all the time, while eating, sleeping, no matter what I do, and I had to be in the hospital for a really long time after which I got discharged, say after ten days or something, and then I could have been taken home.",

        "transcript": "Jonathan: Jeff, I really don't understand how sometimes you have so much success with girls when we go out to the bar. It often seems like I'm the one sitting there and not really enjoying the conversation with the other girl's friend while you really hit it off with these women, and you're able to just walk up and talk to people. I don't know, maybe I just don't have the ability to go up and do that. How do you do that?\nJeff: I don't know. That's a... there's no special formula I don't think. I think you have to be a little bit open. You've got to be a little bit nice.\n                              \nJonathan: Do you have some lines that you use?\nJeff: I don't think. It all depends on the situation. It depends of the girl and the place and how you're feeling and what the girl looks like, but I think it helps a lot to have a good wingman. You need a good wingman. If you're by yourself you look a little bit strange: Why is this guy here in the bar by himself, so you need a good wingman.\nJonathan: Well, I find when I go out to the bar with you, you've been able to meet and talk to some people, yeah, I guess maybe when I go out alone I don't have quite the same success rate, but then a lot of times, you go out to the bar by yourself and you meet people and then I only hear about it afterwards.\nJeff: Yeah, but I think it's... if you drink enough beer and you go out with the right mindset. Leave all or your parameter at home and everyone is good in their own way.... and if you're open to everyone, open to having a good time, I think girls can sense that and they like that.\nJonathan: Or perhaps you're just strange enough that it doesn't seem all that different when you're out by yourself.\nJeff: Well, it might be that. It might be that.",

        "transcript": "Hello. I’m going to talk about British festivals. I’m sure you’ve heard about the Notting Hill Carnival in London and the Edinburgh Festival, but today we’re going to look at a lot more that you might not know about. Actually, a lot of these are not exactly festivals, but strange races or competitions. Some of them are ancient and some are modern.\n\nSo, let’s start in January in the north of Scotland with the Burning of the Clavie. This is a whisky barrel which is set alight then carried through the streets as a bonfire. It’s an ancient tradition which always takes place on 11th of January, the first day of the year, according to an older form of the calendar. The bonfire brings good luck for the coming year and people used to keep bits of burnt wood as protection against evil spirits. At the end of January, even further north, in the Shetland Islands, there’s another fire festival, the Up Helly Aa. This seems like an ancient festival, but has actually only been going for about 130 years – well, it is fairly old, I suppose. People carry fire-lit torches and a Viking boat through the streets, then set fire to the boat. There’s lots of dancing; it’s good fun.\n\nNow to the north of England. On Shrove Tuesday in February, otherwise known as Pancake Day, a special Pancake Bell is rung in Scarborough. Everyone goes down to the road next to the beach where they skip – yep, they jump over long ropes, up to fifteen people to one rope. And they have pancake races. This is quite common in the UK – running with a frying pan and tossing a pancake at the same time.\n\nAnother kind of race takes place in spring – cheese rolling. In Gloucestershire, in the south-west of England, round cheeses in round boxes are sent rolling down a hill and people run after them and try and catch them. The hill is very steep, so people often fall over – if you take part in this you need to be very fit and wear your oldest jeans. Nowadays this strange custom attracts visitors from all over the world, but the people from the local village are usually the ones who catch the cheese.\n\nFrom people-racing, to animals, very tiny animals. World Championship Snail Racing takes place in a village in Norfolk. The snails have to race from an inner circle to an outer circle and the winner gets a lot of lettuce. There’s a party and barbecue for the snail owners and observers. This custom began in the 1960s after a local man saw something similar in France. In the UK we don’t eat snails, by the way.\n\nMore fun, in my opinion, are the onion-eating contest, also in Gloucestershire – a race to finish eating a raw onion – and the Black Pudding Throwing Championship, in Lancashire. Black puddings are like big sausages made mainly from dried blood. Contestants bowl three black puddings each at 21 Yorkshire puddings set on a six-metre platform; the winner is the one who knocks down the most. Another fun contest takes place in September at the Egremont Crab Fair in Cumbria in the north of England. The World Gurning Championship is a competition to pull the ugliest face. It sounds ridiculous but this is an ancient British tradition and the Crab Fair itself dates back to 1267. The man who won the title of best gurner the most in recent years had all his teeth taken out so he could make terrible faces more easily.\n\nFinally, let’s go back to the south of England. In Brighton there’s a Burning the Clocks Festival to celebrate the winter solstice on December 21st. This custom started twenty years ago and is very popular. People make clock lanterns and time-themed figures of paper and wood, then walk through the town to the beach where the sculptures are set on fire and there’s a massive firework display.\n\nSo, that’s just a taste of a few of our old and more modern traditions. Would you like to take part in any of them?",
