No, no, no.\n\nTodd: Wow, that's amazing. Okay, so who stays up late?\n\nKatie: Probably, me and my brother. We always stay up late.\n\nTodd: Yeah? How late?\n\nKatie: Well, when we were younger, we stayed up until 11:00. Which when you're a five or six-year-old, that's very late.\n\nTodd: That is very late. Wow. What about TV? Who watches a lot of TV?\n\nKatie: My dad. My dad watches a lot of TV.\n\nTodd: Oh yeah, what does he watch?\n\nKatie: He watches sports TV programs. He watches comedy programs. He watches everything.\n\nTodd: Okay, yeah. Sounds like my dad. Now my dad falls asleep in front of the TV a lot.\n\nKatie: Mine too.\n\nTodd: Really?\n\nKatie: Yeah.\n\nTodd: Yeah. Okay, who cleans the house?\n\nKatie: Sometimes, me and my brother will help clean the house. But mostly, it's my mom.\n\nTodd: Oh right. Same. I think it's the same in everybody's house.\n\nKatie: I think so too.\n\nTodd: I know, poor mom.\n\nKatie: Yeah.\n\nTodd: Well, similarly, who cooks for the family? I bet it's your mom.\n\nKatie: Nope. Actually, it's my dad.\n\nTodd: Really? Oh great.\n\nKatie: My dad is a chef.\n\nTodd: Oh nice.\n\nKatie: So he is very good at cooking meals.\n\nTodd: Oh, what does he cook?\n\nKatie: Lots and lots of stuff. Lots of British food, so a roast beef or fish and chips. Lots of British food.\n\nTodd: I lived in England for one year. And I love Sunday roast.\n\nKatie: Oh, me too.\n\nTodd: It's so good.\n\nKatie: I wish it was Sunday roast every day.\n\nTodd: I know. Okay, in your family, who does the shopping?\n\nKatie: Who do you think does the shopping in my family?\n\nTodd: Your mother.\n\nKatie: Of course. Yeah.\n\nTodd: Oh wow.\n\nKatie: I don't think my mother would be happy if my dad did the shopping.\n\nTodd: Why?\n\nKatie: My dad buys too many silly things that we don't need.\n\nTodd: Ah, okay, I gotcha. All right, who makes you laugh?\n\nKatie: Definitely, my dad makes me laugh.\n\nTodd: Oh yeah, how?\n\nKatie: My dad makes me laugh a lot. His sense of humor is very different to mine, so when he says a joke and nobody laughs, that makes me laugh.\n\nTodd: Oh, right, yeah, that's funny. So sometimes, we argue with people. Who argues with you sometimes?\n\nKatie: Not sometimes. All the time, I argue with my brother.\n\nTodd: Oh really?\n\nKatie: Yes.\n\nTodd: What do you argue about?\n\nKatie: Everything. Everything. We're very different people.\n\nTodd: Okay, for example?\n\nKatie: Can be even small things like the color T-shirt that someone is wearing, we will argue about it.\n\nTodd: Right. That sounds like my sisters. So I have two older sisters, I never fight with either sister. Never. But my sisters fight all the time. Yeah. They love fighting.\n\nKatie: I love fighting my brother.\n\nTodd: Okay, so in your family, who helps you out a lot?\n\nKatie: I hoped that we help each other out a lot. I don't think one person helps a lot of people. We all help each other.\n\nTodd: Oh, wow, that sounds great. Thanks Katie.\n\nKatie: Thanks.",

Yeah, sometimes I wake up at 6 o'clock.\n\nWhen I get up early, I like to get ready for the day, take a shower and have breakfast. But other days, I don't like getting up early. Maybe I'll sleep in until 10:00 or 11:00.\n\nSarah: Wow.\n\nJohn: Yeah. I like sleeping in late. So sometimes, I wake up at 11:00. On those days, if I know I won't wake up until 11:00, I'll take a shower the night before, before I go to bed. How about you, Sarah? When do you usually wake up?\n\nSarah: Well, I like everyday to be the same. So I wake up everyday at 8 o'clock.\n\nJohn: 8:00.\n\nSarah: 8:00. And I always do the same thing. First, I make coffee right away. Then I wake up my kids and we have breakfast together at about 8:30.\n\nJohn: Really?\n\nSarah: Yes. We usually have something easy like bread and yogurt and fruit.\n\nJohn: I like to have coffee every morning whether I wake up at 6:00 or at 10:00. I'm still going to have coffee. But I often skip breakfast. Do you always eat breakfast everyday?\n\nSarah: Yes. If I don't eat breakfast, I'm so hungry. What about lunch? What time do you have lunch?\n\nJohn: Lunch is the same everyday for me. I always eat lunch at 12:30 PM. So whenever I wake up, I do some things and then I always have lunch at 12:30 PM, just half past noon. And I always have a simple lunch. Maybe some soup or spaghetti or a sandwich. Something light, and it's always at half past noon. What time do you eat lunch?\n\nSarah: That's interesting. I have breakfast at the same time everyday but lunch is always at a different time.\n\nJohn: Really?\n\nSarah: Because I'm busy in the morning. I go out, maybe I go shopping. Sometimes, I clean the house. So I might have lunch at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock. Sometimes as late as 2:30.\n\nJohn: Oh, that's getting late.\n\nSarah: Yes. But it's always easy lunch like you. Maybe crackers and cheese or a sandwich or a baked potato.\n\nJohn: I see.",

Mondays are busy. Thursdays also are busy. Tuesday and Friday are not so busy.\n\nMeg: Your schedule sounds a little similar to mine.\n\nTodd: Yeah.

I watch the video later on Monday night.\n\nMeg: Is it better that way?\n\nTodd: Yeah.

        "transcript": "Shantel: So Todd, you live in Japan. Do you see your family often?\n\nTodd: Yes. I see them often. I see them usually once a year, but I write to them often, and I call them sometimes.\n\n\nGet the Free Book\nShantel: Okay. And when you see them, do you go to the United States to visit them, or do they come to Japan?\n\nTodd: I go to America, and then everyone goes to my mom's house, and everybody meets me at my mom's house, which is nice. I see my sister, and we talk a lot, and it's good.\n\nShantel: Does your mother miss you?\n\nTodd: Yes. She misses me and I miss her a lot, so it's very nice to see her, and also, I miss my dad. I miss him a lot, so I'm always happy to see him.\n\nShantel: Nice. What about your sister? When you're in the United States, do you have some activities you like to do together?\n\nTodd: Yeah, sometimes we do stuff together. Maybe I will meet her at a café, or I will go shopping with her, so we do something fun each time I go back.\n\nShantel: Nice.\n\nTodd: Also, when I go home, I see my best friend, and that's always nice. I usually meet him for dinner, and of course I call him, and it's always nice to see my best friend. How about your family?\n\nShantel: Well, since I live in Japan, I also call them and write them, but usually, we only Skype about once a month.\n\nTodd: Oh. So, who do you Skype with the most, your mom or your dad?\n\nShantel: I Skype the most with my father, because he wakes up very early, so his time and his schedule match my schedule, so it is easy for us to Skype.\n\nTodd: Do you call him or does he call you?\n\nShantel: I usually call him, but sometimes he calls me. Usually, if he calls me, it's because I haven't called in a long time.\n\nTodd: Uh-oh.\n\nShantel: Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nTodd: So sometimes, you make him mad.\n\nShantel: A little angry.\n\nTodd: Right. That's nice.\n\nShantel: But-\n\nTodd: You have a brother too, right?\n\nShantel: I do have a brother, and I call him less frequently, because he is so busy with his job, so we speak about once or twice a month, by messages or by phone.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's nice. Do you follow your family on social media?\n\nShantel: Yes. I use Facebook.\n\nTodd: Oh, I use it too.\n\nShantel: It is a really easy way to keep in contact with them.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I agree. What about other social media? Do you use Twitter?\n\nShantel: No. I don't use Twitter, and I don't use other social media either, only Facebook.\n\nTodd: Ah, that's good, I think. Too much is too bad.\n\nShantel: I agree, but I do love Facebook, because I can speak with my brother, and my mother, and my father anytime.\n\nTodd: So, with Facebook, do you check it every day?\n\nShantel: I do check it every day. Maybe it's a bad habit, but I do like to check it every day. Do you check your Facebook every day?\n\nTodd: Not every day. I check it maybe three times a week.\n\nShantel: hree times a week?\n\nTodd: Yeah, I don't use it much, and I don't use it on my phone.\n\nShantel: Oh. That's a good idea.\n\nTodd: Yeah. I like my free time.\n\nShantel: Do you use other social media, such as Twitter or Instagram?\n\nTodd: I do use Twitter, but I don't use it on my phone. I only use it on the computer.\n\nShantel: Okay. What about Instagram?\n\nTodd: Oh, I don't use it at all. Do you use it?\n\nShantel: No, I don't use it.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's right. You only use Facebook.\n\nShantel: I only use Facebook.\n\nTodd: Oh, interesting. Well, that's nice that we can talk to our family on Skype and Facebook, because Japan is so far from America.\n\nShantel: Yes, and I think they are very happy too.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I think they are happy.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Meg, you look like a healthy person. Do you eat lots of fruits and vegetables?\n\nMeg: I do eat lots of fruits and vegetables, especially fruit. I love to eat fruit because it's so sweet.\n\nTodd: Yeah? What fruits do you like?\n\nMeg: I love bananas because they're so healthy for you. And so usually, in the morning for breakfast, I'll have a banana. I also love blueberries. Blueberries are my favorite fruit. But sometimes, they're expensive so I can't often eat blueberries.\n\nTodd: Oh, I agree. Blueberries are so good. I love blueberries in oatmeal.\n\nMeg: That's a good idea. I love to have blueberries in muffins.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's nice. Well, you bake. Do you bake blueberry muffins?\n\nMeg: I do bake blueberry muffins, and also blueberry bread, blueberry pancakes, many blueberry things.\n\nTodd: Wow. That's great. So are there any fruits you don't like?\n\nMeg: I don't like kiwi actually because the flavor is okay but the fruits is too soft. So usually, I don't want to eat kiwi.\n\nTodd: Oh well, I love kiwi. I love kiwi and bananas. It's very good.\n\nMeg: Hmm, sounds okay but maybe I'll just have the banana.\n\nTodd: So what about vegetables? Are you a person who eats lots of salad?\n\nMeg: I don't eat a lot of salad but I do like to eat vegetables with my meals, usually lunch and dinner.\n\nTodd: So you cook vegetables.\n\nMeg: I cook vegetables or I eat vegetables fresh. For example, usually with my lunch, I'll cut up a cucumber, and put some salt or pepper on the cucumber and eat with my lunch.\n\nTodd: Oh great. I love vegetable sticks, so I love carrot sticks, cucumber sticks, radish sticks. It's very good.\n\nMeg: Do you like to dip vegetable sticks into any dressing?\n\nTodd: I do but it's not healthy, right?\n\nMeg: No.\n\nTodd: But yeah, I love the dressing like the ranch dressing with carrot sticks or the ranch dressing with cucumber sticks. It's very nice.\n\nMeg: Yeah. It's pretty delicious. But you're right. Not so healthy.\n\nTodd: No. So what vegetables do you cook?\n\nMeg: Sometimes I cook broccoli. I actually like to roast broccoli, which is when you put broccoli into the oven and cook it a few minutes. So it's really delicious. You can add some salt or seasonings and it's easy to make. You can cook some meat or rice while the broccoli is in the oven and then it's ready for your dinner.\n\nTodd: That's great. Yeah. You see some vegetables like on a kebab that are roasted. I guess onions are roasted, peppers are roasted.\n\nMeg: Right, right.\n\nTodd: Do you roast other vegetables besides broccoli?\n\nMeg: Sometimes tomatoes, and sometimes potatoes although, it's that a vegetable.\n\nTodd: It is but it's not a very healthy vegetable.\n\nMeg: So maybe I shouldn't eat potatoes.\n\nTodd: I love potatoes though. So you roast vegetables, do you cook vegetables any other way? Do you boil vegetables or fry vegetables?\n\nMeg: Sometimes I boil vegetables. For example, I like to boil carrots because they're soft and you can add some spices again to have some flavor when you eat carrots with your meal.\n\nTodd: Yeah. Actually, I love carrots but I only like raw carrots.\n\nMeg: Oh really?\n\nTodd: And I hate cooked carrots.\n\nMeg: Oh well, I'll try to remember that if ever you come over for dinner.\n\nTodd: Yeah. Carrots sticks please.\n\nMeg: Okay.",

What about you?\nTodd: I was born way before that. I was born in 1969.\n\nMeg: Oh!\n\nTodd: Yeah, a ways ago.\n\nMeg: Not too long ago.\n\nTodd: Yeah, 47 years ago, but yeah.\n\nMeg: Okay, a long time ago.\n\nTodd: Okay, so when did you graduate high school?\n\nMeg: I graduated high school in 2003.\n\nTodd: Oh my gosh. Really!\n\nMeg: What about you?\n\nTodd: Wow, I graduated high school in 1987.\n\nMeg: Ah, when I was three years old.\n\nTodd: Wow, yeah! Ah, we were probably about the same intelligence level about that time.\nMeg: No, that's not true.\n\nTodd: And when did you graduate from college?\n\nMeg: I graduated from college in 2010. When did you graduate from college?\n\nTodd: I graduated from college in 1993, so like you I took a little extra time to graduate.\n\nMeg: Yeah, I took more time than normal.\n\nTodd: And when did you get your first job?\n\nMeg: I got my first job when I was 17 years old, I think. When I was still in high school.\n\nTodd: What did you do?\n\nMeg: I worked at a wedding shop, a wedding dress shop, so I helped to assist the customers and clean the dresses.\n\nTodd: That's a cool job.\n\nMeg: Ah, it wasn't so great actually.\n\nTodd: Why?\n\nMeg: Because brides can get a little crazy.\n\nTodd: I can imagine.\n\nMeg: What about you? When was your first job?\n\nTodd: Well, my first unofficial job was when I was 13. I was a dishwasher.\n\nMeg: Oh, at a restaurant?\n\nTodd: Yeah, and I think it was illegal because I was 13. But yeah, I was a dishwasher. But then my first official job was at McDonald's.\n\nMeg: Oh, what did you do there?\n\nTodd: I made the filet-o-fish. But I got fired.\n\nMeg: Oh, why?\n\nTodd: Also, again I lied about my age. So actually wait, I was 14, and I lied and said I was 15 and they fired me, but I worked there for three months.\n\nMeg: Oh, and you got paid?\n\nTodd: And I got paid.\n\nMeg: Well, that's good at least.\n\nTodd: It was good times. Good times.\n\nMeg: (Laughter)\n\nTodd: OK, so when did you meet your best friend?\n\nMeg: I met my best friend in 2007, so about 10 years ago. What about you?\n\nTodd: Oh gosh, I met my best friend in high school, so I was a sophomore, a second year student, so that was 1984 or 1985.\n\nMeg: Wow! So you've been best friends for a long time.\n\nTodd: A long time, yeah, yep. So how about phones? When did you get your first phone?\n\nMeg: Hmm! I think I got my first phone when I was also 17, the same year I had my first job. It was my first cell-phone, was that year. What about you?\n\nTodd: Well, I got my first phone also when I was 17, but it was a real phone. My parents gave me my own phone line in my house, so I had a phone in my room. Back then that was common in the 80s, so young high school people would have their own phone in their house.\n\nMeg: Yeah, some of my friends had that when I was growing up also, but I wasn't lucky enough to get my own phone until I could pay for it myself.",

After that, fry the bacon. Then put everything together and add lettuce. Finally, cut the sandwich in half, and serve it with chips or fruit.\n\nTodd: Okay. That sounds great. Let me check. First, slice some tomatoes.\n\nMeg: Right.\n\nTodd: Then get some lettuce.\n\nMeg: You do need to get the lettuce, but after slicing the tomatoes, you should toast the bread.\n\nTodd: Okay. So, slice the tomatoes, toast the bread.\n\nMeg: Right.\n\nTodd: And then spread mayonnaise on the bread, on the toast.\n\nMeg: Uh-huh. Yup.\n\nTodd: And then add the tomato and lettuce.\n\nMeg: Mm-hmm.\n\nTodd: And then, oh. Fry the bacon ...\n\nMeg: Right.\n\nTodd: ... and put the bacon on the lettuce and tomato.\n\nMeg: And the toast.\n\nTodd: And the toast.\n\nMeg: Yes.\n\nTodd: I think I can do it.\n\nMeg: You can do it. What about you? What's your favorite sandwich?\n\nTodd: Oh, my favorite sandwich is really easy but a little unhealthy. It's a peanut butter and banana sandwich.\n\nMeg: Ooh, sounds delicious.\n\nTodd: So, similarly, first, toast some bread.\n\nMeg: Mm-hmm.\n\nTodd: And then spread peanut butter on one piece of toast.\n\nMeg: Uh-huh.\n\nTodd: Then cut up a banana into big slices.\n\nMeg: Big slices.\n\nTodd: Then put the slices of banana on the peanut butter.\n\nMeg: Mm-hmm.\n\nTodd: And then put the other toast over the bananas.\n\nMeg: Okay.\n\nTodd: So, put the sandwich together.\n\nMeg: Right.\n\nTodd: It's so delicious.\n\nMeg: Wow, it sounds pretty easy. Let's see if I can remember. So first, toast the bread?\n\nTodd: Yes.\n\nMeg: Then spread peanut butter on one slice of toast.\n\nTodd: Yes.\n\nMeg: After that was cut the banana into big slices.\n\nTodd: Mm-hmm.\n\nMeg: And finally, put the second piece of toast on top of the sandwich.\n\nTodd: Got it.\n\nMeg: That's it?\n\nTodd: That's it.\n\nMeg: Great.\n\nTodd: It's so good.\n\nMeg: I can't wait to try it.\n\nTodd: And I can't wait to try the BLT.",

Did it cost a lot?\n\nNatalie: Oh, this one? Yeah. It was about $50.\n\nTodd: $50? That's a lot.\n\n\nGet the Free Book\nNatalie: I know. It's an American brand.\n\nTodd: Ah. Do they have that shirt in different colors?\n\nNatalie: Yes, so I actually have this top in six colors.\n\nTodd: Really? What colors?\n\nNatalie: I have it in purple, blue, red, gray, white, and black. Actually, I have two black ones, so that's seven.\n\nTodd: You have two shirts in black? Why?\n\nNatalie: Well, black is such a good color to wear. It matches everything.\n\nTodd: Yeah. So true, so true. What about your pants? Those pants are pretty cool too.\n\nNatalie: Oh, these? Yeah. These were much cheaper than the tops. I bought these in San Francisco. They cost about $40.\n\nTodd: Ooh. Those are cheap. That's a good price.\n\nNatalie: It is, and I only have one pair of these.\n\nTodd: And your shoes? Did you buy those shoes in San Francisco too?\n\nNatalie: No, I didn't buy these in San Francisco. These, I bought online.\n\nTodd: You bought them online?\n\nNatalie: Yes. These sandals are really hard to find, so I had to buy them through Amazon.\n\nTodd: Oh, I like Amazon. I buy lots of things on Amazon. For example, I bought this watch on Amazon.\n\nNatalie: How much did it cost?\n\nTodd: Well, this watch was really cheap. This watch only cost about $20.\n\nNatalie: Whoa.\n\nTodd: Yeah, but I have two watches, and I also bought a nice, gold watch on Amazon. That watch was very expensive. It cost $200.\n\nNatalie: Whoa, $200 on a watch? I think my watch only cost maybe $70, but I really like this watch. It's an Apple Watch. I bought it in Malaysia. I've had it for about two years now, but I think now that I have an Apple Watch, I'll always have Apple Watches.\n\nTodd: Yeah, that is a nice watch. I want an Apple Watch too.\n\nNatalie: Yeah, they're so cool. I spend so much time on my phone, and the watch works really well with my phone. I definitely recommend it.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I like this cheap watch, because if it rains, or if I play sports, or if I am traveling, I can take my cheap watch, because this watch is not important. I can break it. I can lose it. I can do anything. But my gold watch, that watch is expensive, so I keep it at home. I only wear it on nice occasions.\n\nNatalie: Oh, well it's nice to have something a little more expensive, but my watch can tell me what the weather's like, my watch can tell me how many calories I've burned, and my watch can tell me what the time is anywhere in the world.\n\nTodd: You know, I think I need to get a watch like that.\n\nNatalie: This is the greatest watch.",

And it's a really great city.\n\nThere are about 80,000 people. There are lots of things to do. There are three movie theatres. I love to watch movies.\n\nJohn: Me too.\n\nSarah: There's lots of shopping. You can find anything you want there. There are a lot of malls and stores.\n\nJohn: Are there many restaurants?\n\nSarah: Yes. The thing I like is you can eat any type of food. There are Chinese restaurants and Korean restaurants, Italian restaurants. There is a big variety of restaurants, and they're all good.\n\nJohn: That sounds great. What about parks? Are there many places to see nature in your town?\n\nSarah: Yes. We have a lot of rivers, and lakes and hills. My hometown has four seasons. So in summer, it's great because there are lots of lakes to swim in, lots of forests to play in. In winter, there is a lot of snow. So you can go ice skating or ice fishing or even skiing.\n\nJohn: Wow. That sounds really fun.\n\nSarah: Yeah. It's a really nice city. It's also really safe. There are lots of nice people there.\n\nJohn: Good. Is there much to do at night?\n\nSarah: Well, maybe, maybe not. There's not many things to do at night. There aren't any nightclubs. There aren't many bars. So actually, maybe there isn't much night life.\n\nJohn: That's okay. It sounds like a nice place to have a family.\n\nSarah: Yeah. It is. It's a great place to have a family. There's lots of good schools and libraries.\n\nSarah: So John, where are you from?\n\nJohn: My hometown is very small. It's a little town in the countryside, in Wisconsin. There are only 5,000 people there.\n\nSarah: Wow. There aren't very many people.\n\nJohn: No, it's very small. There aren't very many businesses. There isn't a shopping mall. There are a lot of grocery stores. And there are a lot of gas stations. But there isn't much to do there.\n\nSarah: Oh really? Are there any movie theaters?\n\nJohn: Well, there is one movie theater. So that's a nice thing to do. In fact, there are many screens in the theater. There are eight different movies showing.\n\nSarah: How about at night? What's fun to do – how about at night? Is there very much night life?\n\nJohn: Yeah, there is not so much. But there is a bowling alley. It's fun to go bowling with friends. There's a bowling alley and the movie theater. There is one restaurant where you can go for tacos and burritos. And there's one more restaurant for pizza and spaghetti.\n\nBut during the daytime, you can go to the park. There's a river that goes through the town. So in the middle of town, there's a river. And there's a park that goes along both sides of the river. And at the park, there is a tennis court and a disc golf course.\n\nSarah: Disc golf?\n\nJohn: Yeah. I like to play disc golf with my friends. It's really fun. And after we finish playing disc golf, we usually go to the pizza restaurant.\n\nSarah: Oh, I see. How about schools? Are there very many schools?\n\nJohn: Let's see. No, there aren't very many. There is only one elementary school, one junior high school and one high school. That's it.\n\nSarah: Interesting.\n\nJohn: Yeah. There aren't very many schools but the town doesn't need more schools because there aren't very many people there.\n\nSarah: I see. Are there any mountains?\n\nJohn: No. The whole area is very flat. There are no mountains but there are a lot of trees. In fact, there are trees on my town's sign because my town is famous for all the trees on every street.\n\nSarah: Oh wow. It sounds like a great city.",

Sing while cleaning the house?\n\nAbidemi: Yes, I do. I enjoy music a lot. I listen to a lot of music, and sometimes I sing along.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I don't think I do that. I don't like singing. I can't sing. I have a terrible, terrible voice.\n\nAbidemi: Really?\n\nTodd: Yeah. People say I'm tone deaf, so when I sing my voice is flat. (singing). Very bad.\n\nAbidemi: I see.\n\nTodd: Yeah. I want to sing. I really do, but I have a bad voice.\n\nAbidemi: I'm sure there are plenty of other things that you do very well.\n\nTodd: Yeah, maybe. How about cooking? Can you cook well?\n\nAbidemi: Cooking is another activity that I'm not so good at.\n\nTodd: No.\n\nAbidemi: Maybe I should say that again. I'm not very good at cooking.\n\nTodd: You can't cook?\n\nAbidemi: I have a few dishes that I cook really well, but I think I'm too lazy. I don't learn new ones.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I'm the same. I don't cook, so I can't cook. Right? We say, \"Practice makes perfect,\" but I never cook, so I can't cook.\n\nAbidemi: I see what you mean.\n\nTodd: Yeah.\n\nAbidemi: One thing that I do do well, and really enjoy, is dancing.\n\nTodd: You're a good dancer?\n\nAbidemi: Some people have said that I'm good.\n\nTodd: Nice. What style of dancing do you like?\n\nAbidemi: I like hip-hop, dance music. When I was younger, I took some jazz classes, and I really enjoyed those as well.\n\nTodd: There's jazz dancing?\n\nAbidemi: Yes, there is.\n\nTodd: Oh wow. What about salsa dancing? Or tango dancing?\n\nAbidemi: I like those too, but usually you need a partner for those, so unless my husband wants to dance, but my husband doesn't really like dancing.\n\nTodd: I understand.

Usually July or August, it gets hot sometimes.\n\nTodd: Is it interesting?\n\nMeg: Yes, of course. Chicago is very interesting. We have many museums, and things to do, and we also have nature. At the lake, you can go and enjoy a day on the beach.\n\nTodd: Oh, nice.\n\nMeg: Yeah.\n\nTodd: Is Chicago by the ocean?\n\nMeg: It's not by the ocean. It's by a really big lake called Lake Michigan. What about San Francisco? Is it by the ocean?\n\nTodd: Yeah, San Francisco is on the ocean. It's on the Pacific Ocean.\n\nMeg: Right.\n\nTodd: o we have really nice beaches.\n\nMeg: Do you like the beach?\n\nTodd: I do, but the beaches in San Francisco are a little cold.\n\nMeg: Oh.\n\nTodd: In Los Angeles, they're warm, but Los Angeles is not interesting, and it's expensive, and it's not beautiful, so I don't like Los Angeles.\n\nMeg: So we should stick with San Francisco.\n\nTodd: Or Chicago.\n\nMeg: Yeah.\n\nTodd: Okay.",

But, during the weekends, I always cook during the weekends because I really like making food. That’s what I do.\n\nHana: So, do you ever eat out?\n\nDaniel: Only occasionally, because I’m really busy during the week, and I prefer cooking, so not really often. I don’t go out really often to eat. Whenever I’m tired, and I don’t have time to cook during the week, I go and eat out with a friend, so! And you?\n\nHana: Well, I always , so I normally go and eat out during the weekend with my friends or family.\n\nDaniel: So do you ever buy take-away?\n\nHana: No, I never. Normally when I go out to eat, I like to sit and enjoy my food. How about you?\n\nDaniel: Well, that's really nice. Of course, I do like to sit and enjoy my food, but I have to admit that occasionally I have to buy take-away, especially when I'm coming late from work, and I'm driving. I'm so hungry that, most of the time, I don't really make it home, so I have to buy something on my way, and that's a shame, so that's the way it is.\n\nAnd do you usually have people over for dinner?\n\nHana: Yes, I sometimes do. I really like cooking so occasionally I invite my friends over and cook for them or we all cook together. How about you?\n\nDaniel: Not really. I do love cooking, but the problem is my place is really small, so even though I want to invite my friends. I never do it, because my place would only fit one or two people. So unfortunately, I never have my friends over for dinner.",

It's very old.\n\nAimee: How many rooms are in your house?\n\nTodd: My house has four rooms, a living room, a sleeping room, a study room, and a kitchen.\n\nAimee: That sounds big. How about bathrooms? How many bathrooms do you have?\n\nTodd: I have two bathrooms or toilets, and then I have one washing room to take a shower.\n\nAimee: Oh, nice. Do you have a TV?\n\nTodd: I do have a TV in the living room, and I have a big couch and a nice table, and I have cable TV.\n\nAimee: Wow.\n\nTodd: I have cable, but I don't watch TV much.\n\nAimee: Oh, well, what about your kitchen. Do you have a kitchen?\n\nTodd: I do. I have a very small kitchen. My kitchen has one stove, a small stove, a table, and a refrigerator, and a microwave. I can cook, but it's not easy.\n\nAimee: Oh, how many chairs do you have in the kitchen.\n\nTodd: We only have two chairs. It's very, very small.\n\nAimee: Do you have a kettle?\n\nTodd: I do have a kettle. Do you want coffee?\n\nAimee: No. It's an important, important kitchen appliance.\n\nTodd: It is. It is. I like that kettle. I think, in American English, we say \"Coffee pot.\"\n\nAimee: Really?\n\nTodd: Yeah. Do we say, \"Kettle?\" Maybe. I don't know. I don't know American English. I need to learn.\n\nAimee: For me, a kettle is something you use to boil water, so you could be making tea or coffee.\n\nTodd: True.\n\nAimee: It doesn't matter.\n\nTodd: Maybe we do say kettle. We say kettle. Sorry.\n\nAimee: How about books, Todd? Do you have many books?\n\nTodd: No. I have a rule. I only keep two books.\n\nAimee: What?\n\nTodd: Yeah. If I want a new book, I must get rid of a book.\n\nAimee: Wow.\n\nTodd: Only two. Never three. I don't like having three, four-\n\nAimee: hat is so strict.\n\nTodd: It is. It is very strict. My rule, strange rule.\n\nAimee: How about clothes? Do you have a lot of clothes?\n\nTodd: No. I am a minimalist. That means I have few items of clothing. I think I have maybe five shirts and three pairs of pants-\n\nAimee: Wow.\n\nTodd: And two pairs of shoes.\n\nAimee: Wow. It sounds great.\n\nTodd: It is, kind of, but I'm 47. I'm old, so it's okay. I can wear the same clothes every day. It's okay.\n\nAimee: In your house, do you have a patio?\n\nTodd: I do, but it's really old, and it's not safe. It can fall. It's old, so I don't use it, but I have a small area to go outside, a small garden. It's nice.\n\nAimee: Sounds nice. Sounds like a great house.\n\nTodd: It is, it is. Old, but nice.",

Welcome to the show, Doctor Baker. \nDr Baker: Thank you. It’s great to be here. Let’s start with tip one. Don’t go to bed with the television on. Some people think they can sleep well with the TV on, but the noise and lights mean you don’t really sleep well, so turn it off!\nTip two: Don’t think too much before bedtime. Do your hardest homework earlier in the evening. Do easier homework later. If your brain is too busy and full of ideas it takes longer to get to sleep.\nTip three: Don’t play video games for an hour before you go to sleep. They also make your brain too busy and active. \nTip four: Turn off your cell phone when you go to bed. What is so important that it can’t wait until the morning? If possible, leave your phone in another room. \nTip five: Play music if you like. But don’t play it too loud. Turn the sound down low.\nHost: Thank you, Doctor. That is very useful advice for our young listeners.",

I teach English in Japan.\n\nNatalie: Oh, cool. Tell me, what's expensive in Japan?\n\nTodd: Well, Japan is a very, very expensive country. Transportation is very expensive in Japan. Train tickets are expensive. Also, sometimes, taxis are expensive. Even buses are expensive.\n\n\nGet the Free Book\nNatalie: Wait. You don't have a car in Japan?\n\nTodd: Actually, I do have a car. That's funny because in Japan, cars are very cheap. Cars are cheap but taxis are expensive. It's crazy.\n\nNatalie: That's so weird. In the U.K., where I'm from, taxis are really cheap, but to have your own car, it's so expensive.\n\nTodd: Wow. That's strange.\n\nNatalie: I'm really interested in Japan. Tell me, what's beautiful in Japan?\n\nTodd: Oh, Japan has lots of beautiful things. The temples are very, very beautiful. The nature and the scenery are beautiful as well. There are beautiful forests, beautiful lakes, beautiful beaches, and even beautiful buildings.\n\nNatalie: Cool. What is difficult about living in Japan?\n\nTodd: Well, Japanese is difficult. Reading Japanese is very difficult. Writing Japanese is difficult because Kanji is difficult. Kanji is the Japanese character.\n\nNatalie: How many characters are there in Kanji?\n\nTodd: There are about 2,000 characters. It's difficult to learn all the characters, all the Kanji. It's very hard.\n\nNatalie: Wow. I bet that's really tough. Tell me, what's fun about living in Japan?\n\nTodd: Well, there's many things that are fun about Japan. The people are fun. They're very nice. Teaching English in Japan is fun. The students are very nice. Day-to-day life in Japan is fun and exciting. I live in Japan, but you live in Thailand. What about Thailand? What is expensive in Thailand?\n\nNatalie: Well, Thailand is a really cheap place to live, but some restaurants are really expensive. For example, if you go to a American restaurant, that's very expensive, but if you go to street food carts, they're really cheap.\n\nTodd: Yeah. The street food is very delicious.\n\nNatalie: It's amazing.\n\nTodd: Speaking of food, what Thai foods are really delicious?\n\nNatalie: My favorites are Pad Ka Prao. This is pork. It's spicy with rice and chili. I also like Tom Yum Goong. This is like a soup, but it's very spicy. It usually comes with shrimp and mushrooms, ginger. I usually get some rice.\n\nTodd: Yeah. I love Tom Yum Goong. It's really, really good. What is difficult about living in Thailand?\n\nNatalie: I think that transport is a very difficult part of living in Thailand. If you have a car, the roads are very busy. It takes a long time to get anywhere in the city. I usually use the subway or the skytrain system, but these get really busy in the morning. When I'm taking the train to work, there's usually so many people on the train at the same time. Sometimes, it actually makes me late for work.\n\nTodd: Yeah. The trains in Japan are really busy too. What is fun about life in Thailand?\n\nNatalie: Good question. I really like the people here. Thai people are so friendly. They're very fun. They always like to hang out.\n\nTodd: Yeah. Thailand sounds like a nice place to live.\n\nNatalie: Yeah. It's a great place to live, actually.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Abidemi, let's talk about languages.\n\nAbidemi: Sure.\n\nTodd: You are from Nigeria and Nigeria has many languages, correct?\n\n\nGet the Free Book\nAbidemi: That's true, yes.\n\nTodd: How many languages can you speak?\n\nAbidemi: I would say that I can speak one language very well.\n\nTodd: Me too.\n\nAbidemi: And that would be English. But, I speak other languages fairly well. Yoruba, which is a Nigerian language, French, and a little bit of Japanese as well.\n\nTodd: You are Canadian also, and in Canada, students study French, correct?\n\nAbidemi: That's true, yes.\n\nTodd: Do you speak French often in Canada?\n\nAbidemi: While I was living there I spoke it a lot more, yes.\n\nTodd: Do you like French?\n\nAbidemi: I love French. I love learning languages.\n\nTodd: French, I think, is very hard for some people, myself included, because the pronunciation of some words is very different than the pronunciation of American English. I think it's funny that there are some words in French that look exactly the same as words in English but we pronounce them completely differently. For example, I will say the word in English, and you say the same word in French. Okay?\n\nAbidemi: I will try.\n\nTodd: For example. Impossible.\n\nAbidemi: [French 00:01:46].\n\nTodd: Right, so that is so interesting. Again, impossible.\n\nAbidemi: [French 00:01:49].\n\nTodd: And they're spelled the same, correct?\n\nAbidemi: That's true.\n\nTodd: Yeah, how about reservation?\n\nAbidemi: [French 00:01:56].\n\nTodd: That's so cool.\n\nAbidemi: I have never thought of it like that before, Todd, but you're right. They look the same but the pronunciations are different.\n\nTodd: I think it's a trick because we see the word, and we know how to say it one way, but we have to say it a different way.\n\nAbidemi: That's true.\n\nTodd: We just can't do that well.\n\nAbidemi: That's true.\n\nTodd: So, you can speak Yoruba.\n\nAbidemi: Yoruba, yes.\n\nTodd: Yoruba. How do you say, \"How are you?\" In Yoruba.\n\nAbidemi: [Yoruba 00:02:33].\n\nTodd: Oh, that's so cool. Again?\n\nAbidemi: [Yoruba 00:02:35].\n\nTodd: [Yoruba 00:02:37]?\n\nAbidemi: [Yoruba 00:02:38].\n\nTodd: Oh wow. That's so cool.\n\nAbidemi: Thank you.\n\nTodd: Have you ever taught that language?\n\nAbidemi: No, never. I don't think too many people want to learn it outside of Nigeria.\n\nTodd: I think, in the future, more people will want to learn unique languages.\n\nAbidemi: I hope you're right.\n\nTodd: Yeah, maybe.\n\nAbidemi: Maybe.\n\nTodd: What language do you want to learn in the future?\n\nAbidemi: I have many that, if I had more time, I would like to learn. I'm interested in Japanese, of course. I live in Japan now, so I would like to speak it better. I would also like to learn Mandarin, Russian, Hausa, another Nigerian language, Spanish, and maybe a couple of others.\n\nTodd: Yeah, there's so many languages I want to learn. I want to learn Spanish too. I can speak some Thai and Japanese because I lived as a teacher in both countries. But, I want to learn a language that has the same alphabet. I can read Thai but not very well. I can read Japanese but not very well. I want to learn a language where it's easy to read and see what the word is. In Thai, you can't do that. In Japanese, you can't do that.\n\nAbidemi: I know what you mean. It would make it easier to learn the language.\n\nTodd: But in Russian, you can't do that.\n\nAbidemi: That's true.\n\nTodd: It's completely different.\n\nAbidemi: That's true, but they have alphabets that are the same. You just have to decode them.\n\nTodd: A little bit, yeah. We have the phrase, it's all Greek to me, which means you have no idea. Anyway, thanks a lot, Abidemi.\n\nAbidemi: Thank you, Todd.",

We have maybe two dozen eggs. I bought eggs yesterday, so we have enough eggs.\n\nKatie: Okay. How about pancake mix? Do we have pancake mix?\n\nTodd: I don't think so. I think we have some, but it's not enough, so I will buy more.\n\nKatie: Okay.\n\nTodd: How much do we need?\n\nKatie: Maybe two packets.\n\nTodd: Two packets? Okay. Two big boxes?\n\nKatie: Yeah, maybe two big boxes of pancake mix.\n\nTodd: Okay.\n\nKatie: Do we have any sugar?\n\nTodd: I don't think so.

Can we have ham instead of bacon?\n\nKatie: No. It's got to be bacon.\n\nTodd: Okay, so I'll buy some bacon. How much?\n\nKatie: How about six rashers of bacon?\n\nTodd: Okay.\n\nKatie: Or six packets of bacon.\n\nTodd: Six packets? Okay.\n\nKatie: Sounds good. Do we have any coffee?\nTodd: We do, but probably not enough, so I'll buy a big can of coffee.\n\nKatie: Okay. Everyone needs to drink coffee.\n\nTodd: Yeah. Plus, we need coffee for us.\n\nKatie: Of course. How about juice? Do we have any juice?\n\nTodd: We do. We actually have lots of juice. I bought juice two days ago, and it was on sale, so I bought three cartons of juice.\n\nKatie: Three cartons?\n\nTodd: Yeah. We need to drink the juice.\n\nKatie: Okay. That's not a problem, then.\n\nTodd: Yeah, we have enough juice.\n\nKatie: Do we have any syrup?\n\nTodd: I think we also have a lot of syrup because we had breakfast a while ago, and we didn't use that much, so there's enough syrup.\n\nKatie: Okay. How about when it's time for washing up? Do we have any dish soap?\n\nTodd: I think there's some, but not enough, so we need to buy some more.\n\nKatie: We're going to have lots of washing up to do.\n\nTodd: Okay. I'll put that on the list.\n\nKatie: Okay.\n\nTodd: All right. I think the list is complete. We should be okay.\n\nKatie: Okay.\n\nTodd: I'll buy everything, and then we should have enough of everything for breakfast tomorrow.\n\nKatie: You buy it, and I'll make it.\n\nTodd: Oh, sounds good.",

Do you teach Physics?\n\nTodd: No, I don't teach Physics, but I teach Math. I teach Math fourth period.\n\nNatalie: Oh. What do you teach in fifth period?\n\nTodd: In fifth period, that's the sports period. I am the cross-country coach.\n\nNatalie: Oh. I have sports, too, but I'm the coach for swimming.\n\nTodd: Oh, really? Are you a good swimmer?\n\nNatalie: I think I'm a really good swimmer. How about you?\n\nTodd: I can swim, but I'm not a good swimmer. I like running.\n\nNatalie: Oh, I hate running. How far do you run?\n\nTodd: Well, for the class, usually we run 5K every day.\n\nNatalie: Wow! 5K. Sixth period, I hear that's our teaching hours.\n\nTodd: Yeah. Sixth period, we are in the classroom, but the students are free. They can do what they want. But students can come to class and ask questions.\n\nNatalie: Oh, cool. Do lots of students come and ask questions?\n\nTodd: Yeah. Some students come, but not too many.\n\nNatalie: Oh, okay.\n\nTodd: Well, this is your first day and your first week, so maybe the job will be a little crazy. But I think after your second or third week, the job will be very, very easy.\n\nNatalie: I hope so. I'm really excited to meet the students. They seem great.\n\nTodd: Oh, I think the students will like you a lot.\n\nNatalie: Oh, I hope so, too. Maybe if you have some time, you could give me a tour of the school?\n\nTodd: Sure. I'd love to.\n\nNatalie: Great. Thanks.",

How was your weekend?\n\nKatie: It was really great.\n\nTodd: What did you do on Saturday?\n\nKatie: On Saturday, I went to the library with my friends.\n\nTodd: Okay.\n\nKatie: I read lots of books and I had a really, really relaxing time.\n\nTodd: Wow. Sounds like you took it easy.\n\nKatie: Yeah, I did.\n\nTodd: Yeah, we need to take a break sometimes.\n\nKatie: For sure.\n\nTodd: Did you do anything else on Saturday?\n\nKatie: On Saturday evening, I went to a restaurant with my co-workers.\n\nTodd: Oh, nice. What kind of restaurant?\n\nKatie: It was a restaurant that sells only chicken wings.\n\nTodd: Really?\n\nKatie: Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nTodd: Was it good chicken?\n\nKatie: It was so good. It was very delicious.\n\nTodd: Oh, okay. I think I know that place.\n\nKatie: Yeah?\n\nTodd: Yeah, it has the very spicy chicken.\n\nKatie: Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nTodd: Oh, that place is crazy.\n\nKatie: It's my favorite.\n\nTodd: I ate there once. The chicken was too spicy.\n\nKatie: Too spicy.\n\nTodd: Yeah.\n\nKatie: Did you eat it?\n\nTodd: I did and it hurt. It burned my mouth.\n\nKatie: Oh, no.\n\nTodd: Yeah. I definitely burned my mouth. So what about Sunday? Did you do anything on Sunday?\n\nKatie: On Sunday I went shopping with my friends.\n\nTodd: Oh, did you buy anything?\n\nKatie: Oh, I bought lots of stuff.\n\nTodd: Yeah, what did you buy?\n\nKatie: I bought some new shoes and I bought a new dress?\n\nTodd: Oh. Why did you buy a new dress?\n\nKatie: It was cheap.\n\nTodd: Okay.\n\nKatie: It was on sale.\n\nTodd: No special plans?\n\nKatie: No, I just like buying clothes.\n\nTodd: Oh, that's good. Yeah, I'm the opposite. I don't like buying clothes. So did you do anything else on Sunday?\n\nKatie: After I went shopping, I went to a café with my friend.\n\nTodd: Okay. Oh, cool. Nice.\n\nKatie: And we drank some coffee.\n\nTodd: What café did you go to?\n\nKatie: I went to Starbucks.\n\nTodd: Oh, everybody goes to Starbucks.\n\nKatie: I love Starbucks.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I love Starbucks too.\n\nKatie: How about you though, what did you do this weekend?\n\nTodd: Well, I had a great weekend. I took it easy also. I didn't do too much. I saw a movie on Saturday night, that was fun.\n\nKatie: Oh, really? What movie did you watch?\n\nTodd: I finally saw the new Star Wars movie, Rogue One.\n\nKatie: You saw the new Star Wars movie.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I loved it. It's so good.\n\nKatie: Wow, sounds good. I haven't seen it yet.\n\nTodd: Oh, it's really good. I hated the first Star Wars movie, the last one, The Force Awakens.\n\nKatie: Oh, really?\n\nTodd: No, I didn't like it.\n\nKatie: Why?\n\nTodd: It's just boring. It wasn't that interesting. But the next one Rogue One was so good.\n\nKatie: Oh, I see. Why did you think so?\n\nTodd: I just liked the characters. The story was interesting. It was fun, it was a good movie.\n\nKatie: I see. Did you go with anybody?\n\nTodd: No, I went alone.\n\nKatie: Oh, really?\n\nTodd: Yeah. I often go to movies alone. So I like to go to movies alone, actually.\n\nKatie: Oh, why?\n\nTodd: Because I rarely see movies and if I see a movie, I just want to watch the movie.\n\nKatie: I see.\n\nTodd: Yeah, I know, it sounds boring, hm?\n\nKatie: I don't like it when people eat popcorn in movies either.\n\nTodd: Oh, I know. Yeah.\n\nKatie: : I don't like the noise that people make.\n\nTodd: Oh, I know, it's so annoying.\n\nKatie: So I can understand why you want to see movies by yourself.\n\nTodd: Yeah.\n\nKatie: How about Sunday? Did you do anything on Sunday?\n\nTodd: Yeah, I had a good time. I went to the park. There's a beautiful park down by the bay and I went jogging. And I took a bunch of photos because the weather was beautiful.\n\nKatie: What did you take photos of?\n\nTodd: Oh, I just took photos of the water, of people at the park, of the mountains. It was a clear day and the sky was really, really beautiful.\n\nKatie: Sounds nice.\n\nTodd: Yeah.\n\nKatie: You'll have to show me afterwards.\n\nTodd: Oh, yeah, you have to go there. It's a great, great park. Well, it sounds like you had a good weekend.\n\nKatie: You too.",

Let's make a list, and I'll buy some stuff today and bring it back for breakfast.\n\nKatie: Okay. Well, how about eggs? Do we have eggs?\n\nTodd: Oh, yeah. We have plenty of eggs. We have maybe two dozen eggs. I bought eggs yesterday, so we have enough eggs.\n\nKatie: Okay. How about pancake mix? Do we have pancake mix?\n\nTodd: I don't think so. I think we have some, but it's not enough, so I will buy more.\n\nKatie: Okay.\n\nTodd: How much do we need?\n\nKatie: Maybe two packets.\n\nTodd: Two packets? Okay. Two big boxes?\n\nKatie: Yeah, maybe two big boxes of pancake mix.\n\nTodd: Okay.\n\nKatie: Do we have any sugar?\n\nTodd: I don't think so. We have some, but again, I think it's not enough, so I'll buy-\n\nKatie: I like to make a lot of pancakes.\n\nTodd: Okay, so I'll buy a lot of sugar.\n\nKatie: Okay.\n\nTodd: I'll buy a big bag of sugar.\n\nKatie: That sounds good. Do we have any milk?\n\nTodd: We do have a little, but it's not enough, so I'll buy some more. Maybe two cartons of milk? Two liters?\n\nKatie: Sounds good.\n\nTodd: Okay.\n\nKatie: Do we have any bacon?\n\nTodd: We don't have any bacon.\n\nKatie: No bacon?\n\nTodd: No, but we have ham. We have lots of ham. Can we have ham instead of bacon?\n\nKatie: No. It's got to be bacon.\n\nTodd: Okay, so I'll buy some bacon. How much?\n\nKatie: How about six rashers of bacon?\n\nTodd: Okay.\n\nKatie: Or six packets of bacon.\n\nTodd: Six packets? Okay.\n\nKatie: Sounds good. Do we have any coffee?\nTodd: We do, but probably not enough, so I'll buy a big can of coffee.\n\nKatie: Okay. Everyone needs to drink coffee.\n\nTodd: Yeah. Plus, we need coffee for us.\n\nKatie: Of course. How about juice? Do we have any juice?\n\nTodd: We do. We actually have lots of juice. I bought juice two days ago, and it was on sale, so I bought three cartons of juice.\n\nKatie: Three cartons?\n\nTodd: Yeah. We need to drink the juice.\n\nKatie: Okay. That's not a problem, then.\n\nTodd: Yeah, we have enough juice.\n\nKatie: Do we have any syrup?\n\nTodd: I think we also have a lot of syrup because we had breakfast a while ago, and we didn't use that much, so there's enough syrup.\n\nKatie: Okay. How about when it's time for washing up? Do we have any dish soap?\n\nTodd: I think there's some, but not enough, so we need to buy some more.\n\nKatie: We're going to have lots of washing up to do.\n\nTodd: Okay. I'll put that on the list.\n\nKatie: Okay.\n\nTodd: All right. I think the list is complete. We should be okay.\n\nKatie: Okay.\n\nTodd: I'll buy everything, and then we should have enough of everything for breakfast tomorrow.\n\nKatie: You buy it, and I'll make it.\n\nTodd: Oh, sounds good.",

Some things stay there forever.\n\nCharlie: That's really scary, Mum.\n\nMum: Don't worry, but you must learn how to stay safe.

Just for an hour.\n\nRobert: Good idea, Cara.\n\nCara: When are you free?\n\nRobert: I can always do mornings before 10.\n\nCara: Robert … Uh …\n\nSelim: I'm sleeping before 10!\n\nRobert: OK! OK, so when are you two free?\n\nCara: Wednesdays are good for me. But not very early, please!\n\nSelim: I can't do the mornings on Wednesdays but I have 3 till 5 free.\n\nRobert: I can do 4 o'clock, just before my maths class.\n\nCara: Great, 4 then. Where shall we meet?\n\nSelim: The library?\n\nRobert: I don't know. The library isn't a good place for a planning meeting as we can't talk in there.\n\nCara: How about the university café? It's near the library. We can talk in there. And eat cake.\n\nSelim: Cake is good.\n\nRobert: OK, so Wednesday at the café. I need to leave at ten to five to go to my maths class.\n\nCara: No problem. Planning will take less than an hour.\n\nSelim: OK! See you Wednesday for cake.\n\nRobert and Cara: See you, Selim!",

        "transcript": "Todd: Hey, Darcy. Let’s talk about stative verbs.\n\nDarcy: Okay.\n\nTodd: So I will ask you five questions or questions about stative verbs and you answer them.\n\nDarcy: Sure.\n\nTodd: Okay. First, what smells good?\n\nDarcy: Sweet things smell good.\n\nTodd: Yes, that’s true. I think fresh coffee smells good. I love fresh coffee.\n\nDarcy: I hate the smell of fresh coffee.\n\nTodd: Oh, really? It doesn’t smell good for you?\n\nDarcy: No, it’s so like bitter.\n\nTodd: Oh, really? Oh, wow. I think it smells so good. You don’t think it smells good.\n\nDarcy: No. I think hot chocolate smells good.\n\nTodd: Okay. Okay, there we go. Alright. So next, what feels good?\n\nDarcy: A hot bath feels good.\n\nTodd: That’s true. A hot bath feels really good. I think a warm sweater on a cold day feels really good. Like right after the sweater comes from the dryer, it feels really nice.\n\nDarcy: Yes, I love that warm feeling you get when it comes out.\n\nTodd: It’s so nice. Also, puppies. Puppies feel really nice, right, when you pet puppies?\n\nDarcy: Yeah, I like the fluffy ones. They feel really nice.\n\nTodd: They do. They feel really, really nice. Okay. So now, how about taste? What foods taste really good?\n\nDarcy: Um, I think spicy food tastes really good.\n\nTodd: Oh, really?\n\nDarcy: Yes, I love… Like Thai food tastes really good because it can clear your sinuses and it just gives you like a kick on your tongue.\n\nTodd: That’s true. It does taste good. I have a sweet tooth so ice cream tastes really good. I love the taste of ice cream. Also, I love pizza, so pizza tastes good.\n\nDarcy: That’s because cheese taste the best.\n\nTodd: That’s right.\n\nDarcy: Something nice and melty.\n\nTodd: That’s true. How about foods that don’t taste good? What food doesn’t taste good?\n\nDarcy: Natto definitely does not taste good.\n\nTodd: So natto is a Japanese food that’s bitter, right, so it tastes bitter?\n\nDarcy: Yeah.\n\nTodd: That’s true. I think… Actually, pineapple doesn’t taste good.\n\nDarcy: I think pineapple taste great. I mean, it’s nice and sweet, but then the taste kind of burns the back of your mouth eventually.\n\nTodd: A little bit, yeah. I just like it on pizza. Anything on pizza taste good.\n\nDarcy: I love pineapple on pizza. It gives it that sweet flavor.\n\nTodd: True, so true. Okay. So we’ve done tastes, we’ve done smells, uh, feel. Okay. Now how about look? So who looks good? Who looks beautiful? What famous person looks gorgeous?\n\nDarcy: I think anyone that’s over six feet tall looks gorgeous.\n\nTodd: So everybody in the NBA looks gorgeous.\n\nDarcy: Between 6’ and 6’5” looks good.\n\nTodd: Really?! Oh, man. I’m bombed. I’m 5’10”. I’m too short.\n\nDarcy: Just a little. I always notice, like my eyes peels to people that are about six feet tall. I’m like, “Oh, they look nice. They look good.”\n\nTodd: So tall people look good, they look handsome.\n\nDarcy: Yes, I think so.\n\nTodd: How about celebrities? Any celebrities that looks beautiful, over six feet tall?\n\nDarcy: I don’t know how tall they are. They all look tall in the movies.\n\nTodd: Right.\n\nDarcy: Tom Cruise looks handsome but he is not actually that tall.\n\nTodd: No, he’s not six feet.\n\nDarcy: He looks taller in the movies.\n\nTodd: Right. That’s true. All actors look taller in movies. Okay. So then we have one more and that would be, what sounds fun? So when you think of an activity, something you want to try, what looks fun or sounds fun?\n\nDarcy: I think like a big musical festival sounds fun. Like going out to a dance party sounds really fun.\n\nTodd: Oh, that sounds fun. I think bicycle trips sound fun. So you do a bicycle trip across country for maybe one week or two weeks.\n\nDarcy: That sounds not fun. That sounds very tiring and exhausting.\n\nTodd: Oh, really? I think that sounds energizing and exciting, and adventurous and healthy.\n\nDarcy: It sounds like I need to take a nap and take a hot bath to restore myself.\n\nTodd: Well, we definitely have different interests.\n\nDarcy: Yes!",
