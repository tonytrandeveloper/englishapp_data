        "transcript": "Todd:               So, I'm here with Olga who is a health coach and I thought we would talk about learning, so people have to learn all these new things to be healthy. It might be a big change in their life. What type of advice would you give people for completely adapting to new change and learning new things?\n                              Olga:               Well, I discovered that the most important things that people can do to be healthy and happy is to educate themselves. So what I do, I call VITA Academy, the Academy of Life, and there are four H's that the cornerstone of this learning concept. \nTodd:               Okay. Oh, that's great, so what are the four H's? \nOlga:               The first H is head, so first you upload a lot of information that is maybe logical, brainy, and you get knowledge, you kind of understand things. \nTodd:               Okay, right. So you ... Basically you take in the information and ... Okay, then the next step? \nOlga:               The next step is to check with yourself if the message that arrived into your head resonates. Do you feel it in your heart? \nTodd:               Wow, that's pretty good. So also you could probably use your heart to see if it's true, right? Like intuition. Is it something that's believable? If it's something that's true? \nOlga:               Exactly. You know, you can call it gut feeling, intuition, talking to angels. I teach bioresonance, based on that it's how to raise your intuition to pretty much the brain level and understand yourself, but it's not ... Gut feeling is not an H, so I just stick with heart. \nTodd:               I like that. Okay, so then after the heart you said it's hand? \nOlga:               Yes. The third level of learning is experiencing it, so using your hands and bringing all this knowledge into your life and seeing how it works. \nTodd:               Alright, so basically like put something into practice, right? Use it or lose it. If you don't do it, then you're not going to really know it. \nOlga:               Exactly. Lose it and use it work on all levels. Is there muscles if you don't lose goes into atrophy, same goes for your memory or anything else in your life. \nTodd:               Oh wow, that's great. Okay, so then the last one is help? \nOlga:               Yes, so once you understand what to do, you feel that it's the right thing to do, you experience and you saw the positive results, then it's only natural to share your success story and help other people. For me, the best way to learn is by teaching, by helping. \nTodd:               Oh wow, that's really nice. So recap, so it's head, you take in the information; heart, you know if it's true or not, like does it resonate with you?; hand, you put it into practice; and then help, you actually give. \nOlga:               Yes, exactly. \nTodd:               Wow, that's some really good advice. Thanks a lot. \nOlga:               Most welcome.",

I didn't expect to see Greece and Portugal make it to the final. I was a little bid disappointed with England's performance, but I think they were beaten by a better team. \n\t\t\t            Todd: Yeah, really, you think so!\n\t\t                Lois: I think on the day Portugal probably played better than we did and even though we were unlucky because we had a goal disallowed in the last minute, but yeah, at the end of the day, I think at the end of the day, they probably deserved to win. \n\t\t                Todd: Mm, so what happened in the match? \n\t                    Lois: So I think if I remember correctly, the match was 2-all, but I can't remember exactly now. No, 1-all because at the last minute England scored to make it 2-1, but that goal was disallowed so then it went to extra time and then I think Portugal scored first, then England scored again to make it 2-all and then it went to penalties, and David Beckham missed, uh a terrible terrible goal, missed a penalty, and then I think Portugal missed one and then England missed again and then Portugal's goalkeeper scored and then it was all over. \n\t                    Todd: Ah, well, maybe next time. \n                        Lois: Maybe, maybe World Cup in Germany in 2006.\n                        Todd: So who do you think is going to win it all?\n                        Lois: So in the first match, it was Portugal against Greece and Greece won 2-1, so although Greece are the underdogs, I think maybe they can win, but it is in Portugal, so maybe Portugal will win with the home crowd.\n                        Todd: Are you going to watch it?\n                        Lois: I would love to watch it, but in Japan it's on at 3:45 in the morning, and so I don't think I'm going to miss my sleep to watch it.",

        "transcript": "Todd:               Hello, I am here with Olga, she is from Russia. Olga, can you go ahead and introduce yourself?     \nOlga:               Yes, sure. I do a lot of things that concern health and happiness. I am concentrating on modalities that allow you to help yourself, so I do a lot of courses of self-healing, so I have a lot of different alphabet soup after my name. HHP, which is Holistic Health Practitioner. NC, which is Nutritional Counselor. But I like to refer to myself as health coach. \nTodd:               Okay wow, that's cool. So, what's your advice for staying healthy? \nOlga:               Well, I was very excited to find out that while I thought I was studying different modalities, some oriental healing systems like Chinese and Ayurvedic and Japanese. And then I thought, \"Oh, I'm studying something totally different in US\" when I went into American Indian healing systems. Or when I was in Russia, we have our own traditions. But then I discovered that all of them, even though they use different words, have something in common. \n The deeper you understand the principles, the closer they become, and in the end they converge into three points. So any successful healing system addresses three health problems and turns them into three healing opportunities. \nTodd:               Wow, that's so interesting. What are these three principles? \nOlga:               Sure. One of them is toxicity. So what I call toxic is anything that is too much. Even something good can turn into bad when you have too much of it. Toxicity doesn't come in the physical form only. We can have toxic food and air, but we also can have toxic thoughts or toxic emotions, so when I say toxicity, I say that it's on all levels of existence, body mind and spirit. \nTodd:               Oh that's so fascinating. Can you expand on that a little bit more, give some examples? \nOlga:               Absolutely. When I say that something good can turn into bad, I can give you example of water. Everybody knows that to drink water is very important, and dehydration causes a lot of diseases, especially nowadays. But if I ask you to drink 20 liters of water, what do you think will happen? \nTodd:               You would get sick, right? \nOlga:               You die, because the 20 liters of water rushing through your system will wash out all your electrolytes and you will not be able to sustain life. \nTodd:               Wow, I've read of people actually dying like on marathons and stuff because they overhydrate actually. It can get risky if you drink too much. \nOlga:               If you drink too much of the wrong stuff, because we don't need only water. If you drink distilled water that's very risky because distilled water is extremely aggressive and acidic. Distilled water, let's reserve it for fountains and cars, it's not for human consumption. \nTodd:               Wow, so interesting. What other tips do you have about wellness and health? \nOlga:               We just covered one of the routes, which is too much of something what they call toxicity, but there are two others. So root number two is deficiency, which is the mirror opposite of toxicity. \nSo what are you lacking in? Is it nutrients? What do you need to bring into your life? Maybe it's self-love, maybe there is a deficit of self-love and acceptance and respect. Or maybe it's a deficit of knowledge. \nTodd:               Oh, that's so interesting. We're in Bangkok and that actually reminds me of a time that I was not eating that many vegetables and I felt really sick, andI was walking and in my brain I felt like my body was talking to me. It was saying, \"Go eat a salad. Like you need to eat a salad immediately\", and I went and ate a salad. I was 23 years old at the time, and I felt immediately better. I remember thinking, \"Wow, my body literally was talking to me, telling me to go eat my vegetables.\" \nOlga:               I believe that our bodies do it all the time. But if we ignore the voice, the voice becomes so low, it becomes a little whisper and then it nearly disappears. To resolve that problem of not listening to yourself, I actually teach a class on bioresonance, that brings the voice back up again. \nTodd:               That's interesting. So what is bioresonance? \nOlga:               Bioresonance is an umbrella term for a lot of different modalities, and how to use vibration, their resonance, their energy, to understand something about the universe or yourself. \nTodd:               Oh, that's fascinating. So, you said that we have toxicity, and then we have deficiency. What's the third problem? \nOlga:               The third root of pretty much any disease, physical and mental, is stagnation. So when something is stuck, like let's say water doesn't move, it becomes to stink. Yeah, so stagnation is death and movement is life. It works on cellular level, it works on planetary level, on the level of our whole organism. So everything should circulate, there should be circulation of oxygen, of blood, lymph, of thoughts, emotions. When you block the flow it usually manifests as pain. Pain is either stuck or broken flow of energy. \nTodd:               Wow, that's so true. You know, that reminds me of one of my favorite sayings, \"Variety is the spice of life.\" Basically we always should have some change, we shouldn't always be stuck in a rut, so to speak. And we should be trying to do new things. Correct? \nOlga:               Yes. A lot of my clients in this health coaching business call my approach to diet with the rainbow diet, because I am always about full spectrum: full spectrum of emotions, full spectrum of nutrients, full spectrum of life. \nTodd:               Wow, that's great. Thanks so much.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Travis, this summer we have the Olympics. Are you going to watch the Olympics on TV?\n\t\t\t            Travis: I will probably get suckered into watching the olympics I'm sure. It will be on every channel. It will only be on one channel but it will be on the whole day I'm sure. \n\t\t\t            Todd: Yeah, they kind of go overboard. It's on too much. \n\t\t                Travis: Well, I think it was the last winter Olympics, where, I don't know which channel in the Unites States was covering it but whatever channel was covering it most of the olympics was just people's background and personal stories and profiles and a lot of America got really fed up with it, and I don't know if you were still here in Japan or if you were in the Unites States at the time of the last olympics, but \n\t\t\t\t                people didn't watch he last olympics in the states. They just tuned out completely. The reason that they tuned out is because the coverage was so poor. The station that was covering it was basically just doing profile after profile of athletes, about how they had to overcome hardship, how they had to eat one meal every two weeks , and you know run five hundred miles back and forth, you know, some school in Russia and those sort of profiles, stories drown out the actual events, and it was covered very poorly, but maybe this year will be different, maybe there will be a backlash against that sort of poor coverage, and we'll get to see more of the actual olympics this time. This is the summer olympics right. (Yeah, exactly) It shows how little I know about the olympics. I'm not sure if it's the winter of the summer. \n\t\t                Todd: Well, of the Olympics, what's your favorite event? \n\t                    Travis: Running. \n\t                    Todd: Running\n                        Travis: Just straight running. It seems like a very pure athletic event. There's no guess work in it. There's not five judge panel trying to decide who won, and then the Canadian judge and the France judge get in a fight and they have to decide. Nothing like that happens. It's just run, clock, stop and whoever got through the finish line the fastest wins. It seems very pure athleticism, so I like running: 100 meter dash,\n\t\t\t\t                        200 meter dash, all of that, and long runs too. I used to run when I was in high school so that helps a little bit. Not short distances. I used to run cross country, three and five miles. \n                        Todd: Ooh, that's a long ways. Are you still a runner?\n                        Travis: Well I went running tonight but I don't consider myself to be much of a runner. No, I only say that some day I am going to train and run a marathon but I have yet to train and run a marathon. Maybe someday. Yeah, I did it when I was in Bangkok and it about killed me. Yeah, running in Bangkok, running a marathon in Bangkok was not the smartest thing. It was terrible because they had, they have pollution right, Bangkok's a great city but they have a lot of pollution right. They have to have marathon at 4 o'clock in the morning before the cars start running, and then when you're running the marathon some of the policeman that are officiating have to wear like masks because of the pollution in the air, so when you're running a marathon through that it's not that fun. But anyway, you should do it. You should run a marathon. \n\t\t\t\t                            I think maybe I will but perhaps after I finish school this year.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Kevin, I thought we would talk about money today, and you have many interesting stories about being broke.\n                              Kevin: Yes.  I have been broke a number of times.  Anything in particular that you would like to hear?  I've got quite a bunch.\nTodd: So tell me when was the first time you were really broke?\nKevin: The first time I was really broke was, I was 19, and I moved to New York City.  I followed a girl that I met in Glacier National Park, I was working out there as a singing waiter.\nWent out to New York, followed her, and I ended up living in an apartment with three other people and the share of my rent was $500 a month.  Now that was 20 years ago, and $500 a month 20 years ago to a 19 year old kid with no education, no experience... that was a lot.\nSo I worked three jobs.  I worked from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. at the George Washington Street Bus Terminal and subway station handing out flyers, American Express Moneygram flyers, then I would take the subway to Midtown, to FAO Schwartz, you know the big toy store...\nTodd: Oh yeah, right.\nKevin: ...from the movie, \"Big\"...\nTodd: Yeah, it's really famous.\nKevin: ...where he dances on the piano.  Yeah, and I was... I would wrap presents there.  And then I would work there from 11 to 4, and then I would take the subway back down to The Village where I was living, and I would work from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. as a waiter and bus boy.\nTodd: That's brutal.  That's pretty harsh.\nKevin: Yeah, it's really brutal.  Well, how I ended up being broke was, the restaurant was a New Orleans style restaurant, and I got fired for talking to the customers too much. Truth is, the customers were interested in the fact that I was from New Orleans and it was a New Orleans style restaurant.  And for... I lasted two more months.  And I only had enough money everyday to buy a slice of cheese pizza and a pack of cigarettes.  And...\nTodd: That's it? \nKevin: That's it.\nTodd: One slice of pizza and a pack of cigarettes.\nKevin: Well, and a Hostess Fruit Pie lunch.  But one time, during lunchtime at FAO Schwartz, I went down to the vending machine and I got my Hostess Fruit Pie and I took a bite in it and it was hollow.  There was no fruit in it and I really had a small panic attack, and I called the toll free number on it, and I complained, \"You just don't understand how much of my daily nutritional intake that pie represented\", and all he did was apologize and I was hoping they would send me a case of pies, but they didn't.\nTodd: No such luck.\nKevin: That's right.  When I went home, I was probably about 30 pounds lighter than before I left.  And I was really poor.  So that's the first time I was really broke.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So I'm here with Olga, and\n                      she's a health coach, and we were talking about\n                      the difference between modern trends in nutrition\n                      and traditional health and things like that. I\n                      thought I would throw out some idioms, and you ...\n                      age-old idioms, words of wisdom, and how they\n                      apply today. \n So the first one is: variety\n                      is the spice of life. \nOlga: I totally agree with that,\n                      and I see it in clinical practice to be true. You\n                      don't really need to be Ph.D in healing or\n                      nutrition. If you throw into your diet variety,\n                      and it would change with the season, it would\n                      change with location, it would change with your\n                      mood and how your body feels, then that's it. A\n                      variety can really give your body everything, and\n                      your body has all the knowledge, all the wisdom,\n                      and knows what to do with that. \nTodd: So basically when we eat\n                      we shouldn't just eat one type of food, we wanna\n                      make sure we have a very varied food supply of\n                      vegetables, fruit, even meat, things like that? \nOlga: That is correct, and our\n                      ancestors used to have a variety that is not two,\n                      not five, not 10, but 100 times more than what we\n                      do now. Our ancestors would have 3,000 different\n                      food items that they would rotate. \nTodd: Wow, that's fascinating.\n                      Okay, how about the next one, common one: an apple a day keeps the\n                        doctor away? \nOlga: That is actually very\n                      interesting, because the more I was looking into\n                      this particular fruit, the more respect I got for\n                      it. And when I designed liver detox systems, we\n                      have a special apple day, and we use malic acid\n                      and apples as a preparation to dissolve\n                      gallbladder and liver stones, and you can go on\n                      and on and on about all the components of an\n                      apple. It's so complicated, and yet so simple. You\n                      just grab an apple, bite, chew, swallow, done. \nTodd: Wow. And I think also it's\n                      kind of like basically if you just eat unprocessed\n                      foods, if you eat natural foods, right, then you\n                      will probably stay healthy and you won't need to\n                      see the doctor. \nOlga: Well, this is exactly what\n                      the proverb says, and it's very literal. \nTodd: Okay, so how about one not\n                      related to food: all work\n                        and no play makes Jack a dull boy, which\n                      I guess means if you just work all the time and\n                      you don't rest and relax and have fun, then you'll\n                      just be a boring person. \nOlga: Well, actually any kind of\n                      extreme has health consequences. We talk a little\n                      bit about toxicity and deficiency as roots of any\n                      health problems, so when you don't have enough of\n                      something, or too much of something, both cause\n                      problems. \nTodd: Wow, that's fascinating.\n                      Okay, so let's talk about sleep. The early bird gets the worm.\n                      So I think it means that people that go to bed\n                      early and wake up early, they're more productive?\n                      Do you think that's what it means? \nOlga: Well, I'm not sure.\n                      Honestly, I've seen people really individualize\n                      their life, and some people go to bed late and\n                      wake up late, and they're still productive. And in\n                      different times of our lives we have different\n                      periods when it's better to go to bed early and\n                      wake up earlier, and other times it's okay to go\n                      to bed late and wake up late. But in general, yes,\n                      Chinese medicine talks a lot about their times for\n                      the different meridians that represent organs. \n For example, from 11:00 in the evening until\n                      3:00 in the morning, it's liver and gallbladder\n                      time. So if you're up during that time, these\n                      organs do not rejuvenate, they don't repair, and\n                      it's tremendous stress for them. \nTodd: Wow. Okay, so let's talk a\n                      little bit about medicine and seeking help. How\n                      about a stitch in time\n                        saves nine? \nOlga: Well, I think it's true\n                      for a lot of things in the healing world. It's\n                      much, much easier to prevent disease than to\n                      reverse it. So a lot of times if you get the\n                      disease, the best-case scenario in modern medicine\n                      is just to control the symptoms and to slow down\n                      the progression. But if you use the natural\n                      preventive medicine, it's actually much less\n                      effort, and you can enjoy life and you can enjoy\n                      that first stitch without ever thinking or needing\n                      the nine that would be needed if you didn't do\n                      something preventive. \nTodd: Okay, wow, fascinating.\n                      And the last one, I think this is ... you've\n                      talked about this before. Too much of a good thing is a\n                        bad thing. \nOlga: Yes, again, I can refer to\n                      Oriental wisdom of yin and yang. If you can\n                      visualize the symbol of yin-yang, usually it's two\n                      half-circles, and there is a seed of the opposite\n                      color right in the middle of it. So in the white\n                      you would have a seed of black, and in the black a\n                      seed of white, and they constantly turn into each\n                      other. So too much of something turns into its\n                      exact opposite. \nTodd: Wow, fascinating. Thanks a\n                      lot. \nOlga: Most welcome.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Eucharia, you are into drama so I thought we would talk about Shakespeare.Eucharia: Cool!Todd: First of all, who is Shakespeare?Eucharia: Well, Shakespeare is one of the most famous playwrights of the world. He was born in 1564 in Stratford on Avon in England which is a really pretty town and he opened the Globe theatre in London I think at some stage but the main thing why Shakespeare is so famous… he had a really short life. Back in those days to make it to 40 was considered old age but in his relatively short life he produced an enormous body of work. He produced historical plays, tragedies, comedies, poetry, sonnets… So he was an extremely prolific writer and I think the reason that he’s so famous even today is because the themes he chose for most of his work were universal. They’re themes that touch us whether we speak English, whether we speak Spanish or Russian, whether we’re in the 21st century or in the 16th century. They’re themes that are eternal and they concern humanity, and have concerned humanity for such a long time.Todd: How much of the English has changed since the original Shakespeare to the Shakespeare we have today, I mean the English we have today?Eucharia: Well if Shakespeare suddenly appeared in the 21st century he would be almost illiterate because back in those days English had a vocabulary of about 150,000 words, whereas now the vocabulary of English is one of the highest in the world. I think 300,000 now, probably more, so Shakespeare wouldn’t be able to make himself understood if he came back today, so in a way the vocabulary he’s using is really easy. But of course English has changed from that era from middle English until contemporary, English keeps changing even if you talk to your grandparents, well not just English, all languages change and develop over time so even if you talk to your grandparents they’re going to use a slightly different variety of the language you’re speaking.Todd: But wait a minute. You’re saying that his English is easy? When I read it it doesn’t seem easy, it seems pretty tough!Eucharia: Well that’s because his English was used in a different way. So some words and some grammatical structures are no longer in English, they’ve fallen out of usage except when we read stuff like Shakespeare and then for us it seems almost like a foreign language because we don’t have these grammatical structures any more and we don’t use English in this way anymore.Todd: Ok thanks.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Kevin, you were saying that you've been poor, broke, a couple of times.  You talked about being in New York, and being broke.  When else have you been broke?\nKevin: Wow.  Well, after New York, the following year, when I came down from New York, I was determined to be my own boss.  I had not been in control of my life while I was in New York.  It was all depending on other people to let me have a job.  And when I lost the job, that really, that really hurt.\n                              \nAnd so when I went home I decided that I was going to own my own business, and I opened my first business which was a Karate school, and I put a lot of money into it that I had worked for almost a year saving up and then, well I also had a small inheritance from my grandmother.\nTodd: Oh okay.\nKevin: Yeah.  But I ended up losing all of the money in the Karate school.\nTodd: Now did you actually know Karate?\nKevin: Yes.\nTodd: Oh you do?\nKevin: I do.\nTodd: I did not know that about you.\nKevin: That would have been a strange business to start if I didn't know it.  But yeah, yeah, I'd done it, I started when I was a kid.  And, at the time, I was 20, I think 20, just about to turn 21 when I opened it.  And I was ni-dan at the time, second degree black belt, and I had been teaching at my instructor's school for a while and he had encouraged me, you know, to go ahead and do it.  But it was the wrong location, and the wrong town, the town was really poor.  And I lost about $20,000 in 6 months.\nTodd: That's a lot of money.\nKevin: That is a lot of money.  Especially to a 21 year old who, you know...\nTodd: Yeah, $20,000 when you're 21, you can live for like 3 years.\nKevin: Right, and not a year and half earlier I was flat busted broke in New York, and then, you know, things picked up and I thought that I could really try and make something of it.  But you know, nothing ventured, nothing gained, and that was the attitude that I had, and, you know, found myself broke again.\nTodd: So that fact that you've been poor, but you were poor both times when you were very young, do you look back and are you glad that you had those experiences?\nKevin: Sure.  Sure, I learned a lot.  Those experiences were valuable.  You can't buy that kind of experience, you know, I carry it around with me now.  I listen to other people who have business ideas and, you know, one thing that I gained from it is I can tell if they are going into a business, if they're gonna try and start up a business and, you know, they haven't considered all the things that they really need to consider, I can see the pitfalls that I fell in.  And, you can try and suggest people to, you know, make other arrangements or to be more careful about this or that, but it doesn't always work out.  Sometimes they just have to go out and learn the hard way like I did.",

And, I don’t know if you know but that means … basically taking control or monitoring our borders and checking what comes in and out of the country. \nRay: Well that sounds pretty interesting.Shirley: Yeah, it had its moments.Ray: Like for exampleShirley: Well, Australia has very strict quarantine regulations so we’d often get people trying to smuggle in prohibited food or seeds or plants and I remember one time there was a man who had an entire sapling, a small tree strapped to his body. He had the roots kind of in his shoe and it was strapped to his leg all the way up his body and along his arm and of course his clothes on top so that we couldn’t see them.Ray: Well that’s a, are now you sure he was a person and not an “ent”?Shirley: I don’t know. He was doing a good disguise if he was in fact a walking “ent”. Ray: That’s true, so what’d you do to this poor guy? Shirley: We didn’t do so much to the poor guy, I think he probably Ray: so what did you do to his poor tree then I guess. Shirley: Well his tree was confiscated and would be destroyed. Probably he was fined and went to court and would have to pay a fine.Ray: What other things do people smuggle?Shirley: All sorts of strange things. Sometimes they smuggle things that they don’t even realize are prohibited. So for example canned foods like pate or canned meats are also completely prohibited Ray: Oh boy Shirley: Yeah, I mean a lot of those things they can hold, for example foot and mouth disease, I think, is resistant to very high temperatures and it’ll last for about seven or eight years. So those things are also prohibited. Birds, which is pretty sad because when people bring in something like birds or small animals the death rate for the animals is extremely high so Ray: Goodness, yes. Shirley: Usually only about ten percent (10%) survive and if they get caught, then they can’t have them anyway.Ray: Can’t imagine how, if you were trying to smuggle a bird I have visions of somebody anasthetizing the poor thing and, stuffing it into their backpack or something of that sort and Shirley: Yeah Ray: that can’t be goodShirley: there’s lots of imaginative ways to do that but all in all, none of them are very good for the birds.Ray: Any reptiles?Shirley: Yeah well, people do smuggle them in, although actually in the case of Australia I think we have a bigger problem with them going out because Australia has, I think, the highest number of venomous reptiles in the world and also different types of reptiles so people taking them out illegally is a big problem. I personally never saw any, fortunately. I actually quite like snakes but I have a healthy respect for them so I don’t really want to be, you know, engaging with them on a one-to-one personal level.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Hey, Eucharia can you give us a brief history of Ireland?Eucharia: Sure well, I think most people know of St Patrick’s day and that it is an Irish festival which celebrates being Irish. Well, St Patrick was brought to Ireland in 460 as a slave from Wales and then he left and went to Italy where he was converted to Christianity and then he went back to Ireland to bring Christianity to the Irish Celtic people. So, skipping ahead a few years. The Celtic people were always quite unique within Europe because we… the Celtic people always believed in equality between men and women and therefore there were women warriors in Ireland which used to frighten many of the potential invaders away because a lot of men didn’t like to be beaten by women back then and maybe it’s still true today. Then the next biggest thing in history was the colonialisation of Ireland by England, starting in the 16th century until the early 20th century. And it wasn’t taken to readily because of the nature of the Celtic warriors. It was probably the bloodiest period in history because the Celtic people did not like to be colonised, so there was a lot of fighting and battles between the English and the Irish even though the English had, to all intents and purposes, colonised, it was not an easy colonisation. But the single most effective tech that the Eng used in the colonisation came in 1822 when the English implemented a national education system. Before this the Irish people used to go and learn in schools called ‘hedge schools’ ,so they were outside and they were given by people who wanted to teach, so genuine academics and people learned stuff like ancient greek, latin, so most people have this tradition of speaking other languages, mathematics… So when the education system was changed in line with the English colonial system it became illegal to speak Irish in the classroom and it became illegal to speak Irish in many places. Now in my city there’s a lovely trading area called ‘The Old English Market’ and its called ‘The Old English Market’ because there is a sign inside the door: ‘Anyone who will speak… who will speak in Irish and not in English will be sent to jail’. So it was really strictly enforced and it was a very… I can’t say laudible technique but… it was a very effective way of colonisation. Nowadays in Ireland people spk English and people speak Irish, both, and it’s considered bilingual. All documents, all street names are written in Irish and English.1922 there was what was known as the civil war and that was the beginning of the end for the English so the firstt Irish constitution was written in 1935 and it stated that Ireland is a neutral country so therefore Ireland did not enter World War 2 and it was declared a Republic in 1949.Todd: Thanks. That was a good history!",

Who was your favorite character?\n\t                    Travis: My favorite character was Darth Vader.\n\t                    Todd: What? You got to be kidding me!\n                        Travis: When I used to play Star Wars as a kid with my friends we used to always fight over who had to be Luke Skywalker, and who got to be Darth Vader. Who ever got to be Darth Vader always got to kill Luke Skywalker.\n                        Todd: Wow. Why do you think that Star Wars is such a popular movie?\n                        Travis: Well, I think of the time that the original Star Wars came out it was unique in a way that no other movie had really been, and so that was part of it. It used special affects in a way that no other movie ever had, andI think America was looking for a feel good fantasy movie that basically, while simple really made peoplefeel like there are good things out there and good sides out there and you could be on a good side. You know,you have the evil empire, which apparently were the British Empire, and, since all the actors had a British accent. And then you had the rebels, who were apparently, according to the director. What's his name again? \n                        Todd: George Lucas\n                        Travis: George Lucas. I was about to say Luke Skywalker, but I was pretty sure he didn't direct it. According to George Lucas were the Americans, so it seemed like it was a replay of the revolutionary war, in some senses, though he also borrowed from some Japanese movies too. Notably he borrowed from KitaKurasawa's \"The Hidden Forstress\" I'm not really sure what the Japanese title is of \"The Hidden Fortress\" but in English it's translated as 'The Hidden Fortress\" and in that movie, it's a movie where, what's his name, \"Nufume?\", the actor, he is actually protecting a princess who has to go in hiding because an enemy samurai clan has destroyed her family, and then the whole movie is told, that movie, \"The Hidden Fortress\", is told from the point of view of two bumbling idiots who sort of go around, provide slap stick comedy almost for the whole movie and are a basically the role models for CP30 and R2D2 in the movie Star Wars cause in Star Wars the whole movie is sort of in a way shown from the point of view, beginning with these two characters, CP30 and R2D2, and they progress most of the movie, until the end when Luke Skywalker sort of becomes more important and Obi One Kanobi enters the scene, but at every point it's always CP30 and R2D2 sort of gluing the scenes together in a lot of way.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So I'm here with Olga,\n                who's a health coach and a life coach. You've\n                talked a lot about things we should do, but what\n                about stopping doing things or breaking bad habits?\n                That's the hardest thing, right? What's your\n                advice for giving up sugar or alcohol or obsessive behavior,\n                things like that?\n                Olga: Well, actually, I am not\n                  suggesting that people fight with themselves, and\n                  they avoid or break anything, because that would\n                  constitute violence against yourself. I am a\n                  student of Marshall Rosenberg, who developed a\n                  nonviolent communication system. Instead of taking\n                  away the bad, you add something good. You find\n                  exciting, fun, new habits that will naturally\n                  substitute. \nTodd: Okay, so for example,\n                  let's say you watch too much TV, or you're\n                  addicted to your smartphone. You would try to\n                  maybe play outside or do something like that. \nOlga: Well, you can develop a\n                  lot of new habits and see what works for you. One\n                  of the things that I discovered for myself is that willpower is a\n                  very finite resource. We don't have infinite\n                  amounts of willpower, so we need to use it very\n                  sparingly on short distances. It's not for\n                  marathons. What I suggest, when you're\n                  establishing a new habit that you feel that is the\n                  right habit for you, you need to use a little bit\n                  of willpower to repeat it enough times. Usually\n                  magic number is 21 days. \nTodd: Really? 21 days, why 21? \nOlga: I have no idea, but this\n                  number keeps popping up from different traditions in East and West and\n                  also psychology. I saw it in my own practice that\n                  it works. \nTodd: Fascinating. Let's say you\n                  want to give up sugar, or you want to give up smoking or something\n                  like that, a physical substance. Do you have any\n                  tips for that? \nOlga: Yes. One of their easiest\n                  things to do is incorporate fermented foods that\n                  break up chemical dependency on sugars, alcohol,\n                  and some other addictive substances. When I work\n                  with people who are recovering from any kind of\n                  addictions, they don't have to be substance\n                  addictions, fermented foods help a lot. \nTodd: Okay. Can you give some\n                  examples of fermented foods? \nOlga: Absolutely. If you just\n                  chop up any kind of vegetable, let's say it's\n                  cabbage and carrot, so you cut it up. You massage\n                  it with salt and some spices until their juice\n                  comes out. You press it down so all the vegetables\n                  are covered with its own juice. Three days later,\n                  you have perfect fermented sauerkraut. \nTodd: Wow, that's great. Could\n                  you just buy sauerkraut or vinegar or something\n                  like that? Would that work? \nOlga: Well, unfortunately, it\n                  wouldn't, because most of their krauts that you\n                  buy is pasteurized,\n                  which does not give you their probiotic activity.\n                  A lot of it is fake sauerkraut. What I mean by\n                  that, if there was no bacterial activity and their\n                  taste comes from vinegar, you do not get this\n                  benefit. \nTodd: Wow, that's good to know.\n                  I think though part of the problem though is even\n                  myself thinking like, \"Oh, I'm not going to cut up\n                  a bunch of cabbage and carrots, and wait three\n                  days.\" It seems like it's too much work. \nOlga: Well, it might be. Maybe\n                  you can visit a friend who is doing that, or if\n                  you have access to farmer's market or some natural\n                  organic stores, they may provide something that is\n                  not pasteurized and prepared the right way. \nTodd: Oh, that's a good idea.\n                  Okay, well, thanks a lot. That was some really\n                  good advice. \nOlga: Very welcome.",

And most people in Canada are Christians, they're Catholics or Protestants and my parents are Catholic but I've done a lot of traveling in my life and now I'm interested in the Buddhist religion, Buddhism. It's a very peaceful religion and it has some philosophies that I believe in, for example, it talks about detachment. You should not get attached to money or you shouldn't get attached to fancy cars and fancy clothes. You should try to simplify your life and have as little as possible. Be comfortable but don't have too much. Don't have.. don't be excessive with what you have and I believe in this philosophy.\n\n                                The Buddhist religion also has a philosophy of karma, of the cycle of good behavior, brings you good behavior in return and if you act bad, bad things will happen to you and I think this is kind of true because if you do good things for people, most of the time good things happen to you. People treat you well. If you treat people poorly and badly, people will treat you badly, so I believe in this Buddhist philosophy of Karma and good things will happen to you if you do good things for others. \n\n                                Canada is a very peaceful country and I'm a peaceful guy. I don't believe in fighting and I don't believe in war and my neighbor, across the border, the United States of America is at the moment at war with Iraq and for me this is a very senseless or sort of silly thing to be doing. I think it wastes money and it wastes lives and I think there should always be sort of.. some sort of peaceful way to end an argument. So I believe in peace and I don't think war should be.. I think war is a waste of time and a waste of people and a waste of lives.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Eucharia, why don’t we talk about what is our favourite Shakespeare play and actually what is the story about?Eucharia: OK, I love the story of Romeo and Juliet (I know, I’m a girl!) which is a tragedy. It’s about a boy and a girl who fall in love but unfortunately their families are sworn enemies of each other and it ends up with both of them killing themselves, so it’s quite a sad play.Todd: So that’s a tragedy, right?Eucharia: That’s a tragedy. I also like Hamlet. Hamlet the play opens and we see Hamlet talking to the ghost of his father and the ghost explains to Hamlet that he was killed by his brother who has now become Hamlet’s stepfather because he married Hamlet’s mother.So hamlet has to avenge his father by killing his stepfather slash uncle. And Hamlet procrastinates throughout the play: he keeps on putting it off and putting it off and putting it off, and at the end, because he has put it off the situation just gets worse and worse and the reason I like Hamlet is I’m exactly the same. I procrastinate if I don’t want to do something, for example if I don’t want to correct homework my appartment gets cleaned, my car gets cleaned, I clean out the computer… I’m like Hamlet but eventually I do correct the homework!Todd: You’re not going to go and kill your uncle?Eucharia: NoTodd: Oh, just checking!Eucharia: No, no, nothing like that. I could kill some of the journals that I get sometimes (the homework). But I also love Shakespeare’s comedies. They have this timeless quality: they’re funny now and they’re funny to many different cultures even though humour is a culturally related issue, but I think Shakespearian comedy might.. er ..are accessible to all. I like The Taming of the Shrew and I don’t know if you remember an American soap opera called ‘Moonlighting’ with Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd and they did a version of The Taming of the Shrew and I saw it when I was a child and I thought ‘wow that’s a really funny story for that particular soap opera’ .And then when I went to junior high school and senior high school I realised ‘oh it’s a Shakespeare play’ so I really like that, I really like A Midsummer Nights Dream and I’m not sure if can tell the story any more Erm and I remember in school I had to study the sonnets and I really liked them which surprised me because I’m not a big poetry person but I really found Shakespeare accessible.Todd: Oh thanks",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Greg, we're talking about controversial issues and one of the issues in your book is income disparity. So, what do you think about minimum wage?\nGreg: Minimum wage. Minimum wage I think is very important to have otherwise employers are going to take advantage of people; pay them too little. The society, society itself must decide what is the proper minimum wage and that in itself is an issue. What should it be?\nTodd: You know, actually I disagree. I am actually against a minimum wage. I think that you know, basically all markets find equilibrium and that the wage goes too low people just won't do the job, and so basically, it you don't have a minimum wage eventually the society will come to a wage where people fell comfortable doing that work. That basically things will work out.Greg: In theory maybe you're right, but in reality you're really wrong. I mean take a look at some of these countries around the world where there are sweat shops, where you have children, cause there are no rules regulating labor, and you have children who have never been educated, spend their entire lives working almost like slaves in unhealthy conditions. That's what happens when there are no rules to protect workers.Todd: But I think that's somewhat true but you said the key word that they're not educated. I think the problem there is that people aren't educated and that's what leads the abject poverty that they might do a job like that. So don't you think that if people were educated more, they would not be willing to work such meaningless jobs, such jobs that pay so little.Greg: Many of those people, those children, who are working like slaves, don't have a chance for an education and often maybe they're being exploited, not always but sometimes, by people who've had good education.Todd: Right.Greg: Take a child in some very poor country has to work just to find food.Todd: So basically, you're saying they should have a living wage. That they should make enough money that they can have a decent standard of living.Greg: Everyone should have a decent standard of living I believe.Todd: I just think that it's really hard to arbitrarily set a price. I mean that number is always going to go up and down. That even a minimum wage is somewhat skews the reality that if you just let markets take their natural course eventually people won't be willing to work.Greg: It doesn't work that way because when you just have a complete free market, you have corrupt people who take advantage of other people.Todd: Well, you know, that actually I do agree with but I think ... I do believe in a free markets but one thing that is true is that free markets cannot work where's there's corruption. I do agree with that. So we agree about something.Greg: Yes. Good thing.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Greg, you have a new book out, and you're book has lots of controversial topics, and one of the topics is organ donation. So first can you explain what organ donation is?\nGreg: Sure. Organ donation is when a person living or dead allows his or her organs to be used in another person.\nTodd: So for example like you donate a liver, or kidney or something like that.Greg: That's right.Todd: And usually they have to get it... the person who dies, they have to get it soon.Greg: Yes, that 100% right.Todd: So is this something that's common in most countries?Greg: Well, actually some countries do not allow organ and tissue donation, or they allow only some organs, some tissues and not allow others.Todd: You know, your book is about controversial topics. What is controversial about organ donation?Greg: Oh, there's a lot of controversial aspects to organ donation. Again, as I mentioned there are differences in every country. Some countries do not allow organ donation. Some allow some organs and won't others and there are also cases where say maybe a thousand people need a kidney but there's only fifty kidneys. Who is gonna get it? Should the kidney go to the sickest person but who might die? Should it go to the oldest person? Should it go to the youngest person? Should it go to the richest person? How do you decide? What's a fair way to decide?Todd: Now, also I think in your book you were talking about medical tourism. Can you explain what that is?Greg: Medical tourism is when people go to a country for the purpose of medical treatment which they can't get in their country either cause the treatment is not allowed or it's too expensive. You know, relating back to the question of controversy, there are lot of countries in the world which are very poor, and people are willing to sell their organs actually, so you have rich Arabs, rich Americans, rich Japanese, rich British people, people from any rich country, can't get an organ in their own country, and they'll go to a poor country to buy organs from poor people. Is that right? In some places it's illegal. There are also laws in many countries that say someone must, before they die, give permission for the body parts to be used, but those body parts are sometimes taken from people after their death without permission.Todd: Yeah, that's pretty controversial stuff. That's pretty deep.Greg: Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Greg: Hi, Todd.\nTodd: Hey, Greg.\nGreg: Hey, thanks a lot for interviewing me and letting, I don't know, the world know about my book.Todd: No, problem. It's a good book.Greg: Yeah, I've noticed you don't have any topics like these on your web site. Why not?Todd: Right. I don't have too many controversial topics. There's actually technical reasons. One is it just takes too long for people to talk about a controversial topic, so for example if you really want to get into controversy, you know, it leads to long conversation and people expressing their view and arguing and the way that the audio is set up on elllo, it's kind of short. I try to keep it under three minutes, so that's one reason. But actually the main reason is because, you know, when people come in, I don't know them a lot of the times I don't know the speakers very well and so they're not really comfortable arguing with me or arguing with somebody else they don't know about something that's controversial, so we tend to not do that.Greg: OK, alright, it's something you might want to think about. I mean, I think there are lot of people in the world who are really interested in controversial topics.Todd: Well, I think there are some, like with you we talked about some like income disparity and medical issues, and I'm comfortable talking about that but I am not comfortable talking about let's say homosexuality, religious beliefs, abortion, politics. Things like that I just don't feel comfortable doing.Greg: OK, it's your site: your right to do whatever you want, but I just think maybe ... maybe some of your listeners would appreciate that and maybe you could have ... my suggestion is that you have a little one page, controversial page, or something. Just, you know, try it out, and if you get a lot of good reaction, you might want to continue and if it doesn't work out stop it.Todd: Well, actually, I'll give you an example of one I did recently. I had a woman come in, Stella, she did a great job on the videos, and one of her videos was about an usual sport in your country and hers was on cock fighting, and she explained cock fighting, or hen fighting, in Kenya, and right off the bat I knew that was going to be a problem because that's illegal in some countries and some people - animal activists - would be offended, but on the other hand, it's her culture and I don't feel comfortable saying - you know - what's right or what's wrong about someone else's culture so I just ended up not putting it on just because I didn't want to have to take a side. You know, I think you can kind of see the problem, that sometimes you can put stuff up and it's so easy to alienate maybe a small portion of your audience and I just don't want to do that. You know, I don't have a side about the issue but I just don't want to alienate people. I don't want people on one side of an issue to feel upset so I just play it safe, and I don't talk about it.Greg: OK, well, you seem to have a lot of listeners who are very happy so don't worry about changing it.Todd: I hope so. I hope so.Greg is the author of Stimulating Conversations. You can learn more about his book here or contact him.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Greg in the last one we were talking about minimum wage, and this is one of the topics in your book and it's about income disparity. One of the chapters is about income disparity. Now the opposite would be should there the a salary cap, which would mean that basically you could only earn so much, like let's say you can only earn five million dollars, ten million dollars. Nobody could earn more than that. What do you think about that concept?\nGreg: I personally agree with a salary cap. I'm not sure how much it should be, but definitely the discrepancy in wages is way to great. There's too many people who have to ... a husband and a wife work hard forty hours or more, both of them. They're barely, barely getting by, and then you got all these other people who are just buying Rolls-Royce cars and Mercedes, and country clubs and it's just not fair.\nTodd: But, well, for one, though I mean, Mercedes and Rolls-Royce and those are products that provide jobs, so I would argue with that. Actually, as you can probably tell, I'm against the idea mainly because, you know, I think that hurts innovation. You know, you look at people like the CEO of a very powerful internet company or software company, and you know, take google for example, I'm sure that they make more than ten million, but they're service is used so much around the world, that they should get that money, and if people couldn't ... hang on ... if people couldn't get ... couldn't earn that salary then maybe they wouldn't have the same motivation and drive to be successful and that people would lose out as a result.Greg: I think that there's not proof to say that these people are making these products because they're making such tremendous amounts of money. What came first: the product and then they got the money in most cases. There's ... these people could be ... society can have all sorts of wonderful products and still have a fair income system, and I have nothing against people becoming rich or making a good salary, a very good salary, but not such an incredible gap. You have executives of some major international corporations that are making more money than millions of people in the world make combined. The opposite side of not having a cap is that you have people who are making too little, and those people are also working hard. Those people deserve validation. Those people deserve a good life standard which millions of people across the world are not having.Todd: Well, I think ... well, I agree with you about that. I agree with you about that. That there's people who work hard and that they're under compensated, but ... and they're a lot of people that get grossly overpaid but I think that's just a problem of management and that in some cases so people do deserve millions and millions, perhaps billions of dollars is they have really contributed to the product or the outcome. So, basically we're gonna disagree on this one.Greg: Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So I'm here with Dan, and he lives in Bali, Indonesia. And he’s talking about slow travel, which is the concept of living in a foreign country for a long time to experience the culture and the lifestyle. \nDan, can you talk a little bit about the cost, like if somebody wants to really do this, how much money do they need for housing, transportation, food, things like that? \nDan: Well, when I quit my job four years ago, I had a mantra in my head. And I always said, all I need to be happy in life is a thousand bucks and a backpack. And I thought, if I could really simplify my life and take away all the overhead cost of car payment or a mortgage on a house or student load debts, credit cards, things like that, all I would need is a thousand dollars of income a month in order to own my time and to spend my time going to anywhere I wanted. \nI think realistically in places in Southeast Asia, if you want to move around every two or three months or go visit friends at another city, you're going to want at least $1,500 to $2,000 a month. And that’s going to give you, I would say, a quite luxurious lifestyle. \nObviously, you could come here to Bali and live for $700 a month and you could do the same in Nha Trang like we’re talking earlier, maybe even easier in Vietnam. But the real cost come in is when you want to explore and move around internationally. So if you’re living in Nha Trang and you’d like to visit a friend in Bangkok every three months or something like that, you’re going to want more like 1,500 to 2,000 a month. \nTodd: So could you like break down the cost? So what kind of cost are we talking here? Like how much would you pay for housing? How much would you pay, you know, for food every month? How much would you pay for health insurance? Things like that.\nDan: Sure, I mean, if we can make like a vast generalization across Southeast Asia in general. I know it’s a huge place but in most places for a furnished apartment, for a solo traveler, you’re going to look at anywhere from $250 to $750 a month. So let’s just ballpark it and say $500. You know, in a place like Manila, you’re going to get a great apartment for $500. In a place like Bangkok, you’re going to get even better apartment for $500. And again, you have to commit to a month at least to get these kinds of rates. But if you’re willing to do that, stay for few months, you’re going to get really good advantage there. \nLet’s take Bangkok as an example. $500, you’re going to have a great apartment. For another $500, you are going to eat like King Midas. And then let’s say your internet is $30 a month and your health insurance in $120 a month. We’re at about $1,200 a month now. And I’d say, on top of that, it's all about the most dangerous habit for your wallet on the planet, and it is travel. So if you decide that you want to go home for Christmas and you want to go home for Thanksgiving as well for Americans, you know, that’s going to kill your piggy bank. But if you don’t travel so much, you could easily stay in a place like Bangkok for $1,000 to $1,500 a month.\nTodd: So, what about like a, you know, going out having beers and thinks like that? Like are there certain habits that you have to kind of curtail or keep down so that you save money?\nDan: Well, it really depends where you live. So, in the Philippines you could go out and party every night and it won’t make a dent in your wallet. Whereas in places like here in Bali, you had to be really careful because beers can be $7 for one cocktail. So if you go out to the club and you order 4 cocktails, and you meet a cute girl and you buy her 2 cocktails, that could easily turn into a $50 evening, and that’s going to kill your traveler’s budget. \nSo generally in Southeast Asia going out for social drinks isn’t a big impact on your wallet because booze here is relatively cheap. But definitely that can have a big impact.\nTodd: Alright, thanks for the advice.",

What excites you about drama?Eucharia: Well I find it’s a very communicative way to study things and study about people and  you learn how to read people in drama, so usually I can understand what people are saying even though they might be lying, which comes in handy sometimes.Todd: That would be useful!Eucharia: Yeah, so erm, I think it’s very useful for me as well. I am an English lecturer so I use a lot of drama in my classes such as role plays. And I ask my students to create little plays, little mini dramas so they really respond well because it’s a semi-controlled version of English learning in so far as they can rehearse but it has to sound reasonably natural. So, at the moment I’m hoping to get on to a PHD course which will investigate about drama in the English… in English as a foreign language classroom, so especially I would like to concentrate on a lot of…I would like to concentrate a lot on Asian drama and try to bring Asian theatre to the world’s attention. I don’t know how successful I will be but here’s hoping!Todd: Oh, I’m sure you will be successful! Now, Eucharia, you are into drama. Can you tell…what do you do for stage fright?Eucharia: Ah, stage fright! Well, usually I get stage fright still, it’s just… many actors get stage fright, many famous actors get stage fright. I get stage fright every time I’m going to teach a new class. The night before I’m usually throwing up my dinner in the toilet, I can’t sleep…Todd: What, for teaching?Eucharia: …I’m sweating, yes!Todd: No?Eucharia: Yes! I get really bad stage fright but the minute I step into the classroom or the minute I get onto the stage it just all falls into place. I just feel like ‘Yeah this is what I’m made to do’ but the night before it is always the worst case scenario so I am always thinking of what can go wrong. So that’s my particular brand of stage fright but once I get on stage or once I get in front of the class I will be fine. I know this.Todd: Wow, that’s cool",

But I'm very interested in culture, and Japanese traditional culture is fantastic. So, little by little I got interested in butsudan. Now butsudan are Buddhist family alters which the Japanese use in two ways. They pray to Buddha by kneeling in front of them, butthey also keep family memorabilia. That's like, wedding certificates, or graduation certificates, photographs, post cards from interesting places. They keep all these in the butsudan and they communicate with the ancestors this way. So they have a kind of dual purpose. And, but truthfully, I'm not particularly interested in Buddhism, and I'm not interested in the finished butsudan because it's a little bit garish, and not at all the way I imagined the understatement of Japanese culture. But, the making of them is fantastic and the traditional old-fashioned ways of craftsmanship are going out because Japanese craftsmanship is very expensive. And it can be made in China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Korea much cheaper than they can be made in Japan. So, a lot of the traditional craftsman are just not finding the work anymore. No new apprentices are training for the job, and it's difficult to find butsudan that are made in a traditional way. The traditionally made butsudan could cost as much as twenty to thirty million yen. A butsudan made in China and imported into Japan and sold here could be, could sell for about three million yen. That just gives a ratio of the relative price. So, there is, there are three wood working crafts, two metal working crafts, and two lacquering crafts that go into the making of the butsudan. So, my aim really, is to document the traditional craftsmanship before it's completely gone. And no one has ever done this in English before. And it's hardly been done by the Japanese because it's one of these things that Japanese craftsman really don't talk about amongst themselves. So it's all kind of, it's not as if it's secret it's just that they have different vocabulary for the same thing. They do things in slightly different ways. They just never talk about it. When they train an apprentice they don't say do this do that the way we do in the West. The apprentice just has to watch the master and copy. So for many things they don't even have words for them. So it's been quite interesting to document that. Todd: Well, sounds good. We'll have your URL on the bottom. And people will have to go and check out your website. Carla: Ya, that would be good. I'd like that. It's being made now, it's not quite finished yet. Todd: Oh ok. Carla: But, little by little it will be and if anybody is interested it's more of a resource than something that you would sit and read. But you might be interested in the drawings. A friend does the drawings, and I did the photos and the text, and you know it's quite ambitious I think. Todd: Ok, well thanks.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Anthony we're talking about\n                      bitcoin. Now you've invested in bitcoin before?\nAnthony: Yeah, yeah, a bit.\nTodd: Do you still invest a lot now?\nAnthony: I haven't recently.\nTodd: Okay, so why did you stop?\nAnthony: I stopped because I was\n                      getting a little anxious about seeing my portfolio swing\n                      up and down by 5, 6, 7 thousand dollars in a day. I kind\n                      of decided that I would take out the money that I\n                      invested in it and just let my profits ride, basically.\nTodd: Right, so basically originally\n                      then, you were using bitcoin for speculative purposes.\n                      Not to actually buy things. You weren't using it as a\n                      means to actually make transactions.\nAnthony: That is correct. I've only\n                      bought one thing with bitcoin, and that was, it's called\n                      a hardware wallet, which is basically, it looks like a\n                      USB stick, but it's a way to secure your funds.\nTodd: Do you think that in the future\n                      we will have people using bitcoins more, like it's going\n                      to become a viable alternative to actually, for commerce\n                      to pay for things?\nAnthony: Yeah, that's a good question.\n                      I don't think bitcoin will be what we all use, but it's\n                      definitely, in my opinion, the archetype for what is\n                      coming.\nTodd: It's the pioneer.\nAnthony: Yes, the pioneering\n                      technology. There's going to be something that is\n                      similar to bitcoin that we use as a digital payment\n                      system.\nTodd: Yeah, so a lot of people are\n                      freaked out about bitcoin. What are some reasons people\n                      are skeptical against it?\nAnthony: That's a good question. One\n                      question that I've been asked before is, who controls\n                      it? Everyone always wants to know who's in charge.\n                      Right. Who's the CEO? Right? Because we're so\n                      conditioned to this kind of system, but that is the\n                      thing. It's kind of scary for some people, but there is\n                      no control over it. It's a program at the end of the\n                        day. And there's no governing body. There's no\n                      government organization that really has a say. I\n                      mean governments, specific governments, will try to\n                      regulate the markets to a certain extent. But at the end\n                      of the day, the power is in the hands of the people that\n                      use it, really. And as long as people use it there will\n                      be some kind of value to it. Just as long as we use\n                      paper money, there's value to it. As long as it's\n                      exchanged, right?\nTodd: Right. And some people have made\n                      some good points. For example, nobody foresaw the use of\n                      ecommerce or smart phones, or social media. But these\n                      things adopted and ramped up quickly. So, do you think\n                      this could happen with these crypto technologies?\nAnthony: I think-\nTodd: Is that the right way to say it?\n                      Crypto technologies.\nAnthony: Cryptocurrencies.\nTodd: Cryptocurrencies.\nAnthony: Or block chain technologies.\nTodd: Block chain technology, okay.\nAnthony: I think it's very rapid right\n                      now. It's kind of becoming a household word.\n                      Whereas, when I first got into it, if I talked to\n                      someone about bitcoin, they would look at me like I was\n                      crazy. They would look at me like I had a hole in my\n                      face or something. But now people know. Even older\n                      people who aren't really so in touch with technology,\n                      know what it is or have at least heard about it.\nAnthony: I think the biggest hurdle to\n                      mass adoptions is as it stands now, it takes a lot of\n                      knowledge and a lot of know-how in order to safely,\n                      because the reason why I say safely, is because if\n                      you're dealing with bitcoin, you're in charge of\n                      securing your funds. So, if someone hacks into your\n                      funds, or something, then it's your fault. You don't\n                      have anyone to blame. Where as if you have your money in\n                      a bank-\nTodd: You can't call customer service.\nAnthony: Exactly. You can't call\n                      customer service, so there's a big hurdle as\n                      far as the knowledge you need to safely and effectively\n                      maneuver in that space. So I think until some second\n                      party or third party comes about and makes it more user-friendly,\n                      I don't really think it's going to be ready to really\n                      take over until that happens. Either more people need to\n                      be educated and know how to use it and how to purchase\n                      it and how to store it, etc. Or there needs to be some\n                      huge company that going to say, \"Look, we'll manage it\n                      for you. You just need this app, or something.\" I don't\n                      know, something like that.\nTodd: Yeah, it's going to be\n                      interesting in the crossover. They always say be careful\n                      what you wish for, you might just get it. If bitcoin or\n                      some crypto-\nAnthony: Currency\nTodd: Currency becomes the primary\n                      source of transactions, I think a lot of the ills and\n                      the dodgy stuff we have with banks, will seep into it.\n                      It'll be interesting if they could keep it out. If you\n                      know what I mean. But one thing that's interesting about\n                      the currencies is that, I think a lot of old people will\n                      go for it. I think a lot of old people usually are\n                      hesitant about technology and change, but the thing,\n                      they have a lot of money that they're sitting on,\n                      usually, older people. They also don't trust the\n                      government. They've been around a long time and so I\n                      think these cryptocurrencies are going to be very\n                      attractive to a lot of tech un-savvy people. What do you\n                      think about that?\nAnthony: I think you have a point. I\n                      think that probably more so than young people have money\n                      to invest, but I think that's, like I said before, I've\n                      spent so many hours reading about these kinds of\n                      technologies and just really obsessing over it,\n                      and I still feel like there's so much I don't know. So.\nTodd: Well, I guess we all got to\n                      learn.\nAnthony: Yeah. Alright.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Okay. So, Anthony, I thought we\n                      would talk about bitcoin.\nAnthony: Okay.\nTodd: So, you are kind of the expert\n                      about bitcoin.\nAnthony: I wouldn't say I'm an expert,\n                      I just, maybe a hobbyist, bitcoin hobbyist.\nTodd: How long have you been involved\n                      with bitcoin? \nAnthony: I first heard about bitcoin\n                      in probably 2012, and I really, I'm really kicking\n                        myself that I didn't buy some then because it was\n                      about $20, but when I-\nTodd: So $20 per bitcoin-\nAnthony: Yeah, per bitcoin was about\n                      $20.\nTodd: Okay. So how much is it worth\n                      now? \nAnthony: Right now, it's about $8,500,\n                      somewhere around there.\nTodd: You've got to be kidding me.\nAnthony: No. I wish I was, but- \nTodd: Wow. \nAnthony: I got into it as a hobbyist\n                      around 2014, a little before I moved abroad, and I got\n                      into what is known mining. To briefly explain what that\n                      is, is miners, people who call themselves miners, they\n                      buy special computers which are called ASICs, and that\n                      stands for application-specific integrated circuit. The\n                      application-specific part means that the chips that\n                      you're using in that computer can only be used for one\n                      purpose, and that purpose is to solve cryptographic\n                      problems thus creating bitcoin. So that's what I was\n                      doing, I was running a mining computer. \nTodd: So you say mining, like mining,\n                      you're getting little bits of bitcoin- \nAnthony: Yeah, exactly. \nTodd: And it's tiny, tiny fragments. \nAnthony: Exactly.\nTodd: You have this chip in your\n                      computer. Your computer finds this cryptographic\n                      problem, so your computer, you get the reward by getting\n                      a small bit of bitcoin. \nAnthony: Exactly. It's called solo\n                      mining. You can do solo mining where you're only working\n                      with your, with whatever computers you have, but what's\n                      a lot more popular is pool mining where you join a pool\n                      and you work together with a group of miners to solve\n                      one problem. Once the block is discovered, as they say,\n                      each block contains 50 bitcoins. So depending on the\n                      computing power that you were giving the pool, you get\n                      paid out in equal measure. For people, that's a lot more\n                      profitable than solo mining because you could solo mine\n                      for years and never find a block. \nTodd: Yeah. For somebody who has no\n                      concept of this, the first thing they're going to ask\n                      you is, well, who creates these blocks of ... Who makes\n                      this? \nAnthony: That's a good question. \nTodd: It's like a \"Where are we from?\"\n                      It's like a chicken and an egg thing, so- \nAnthony: Exactly, and that's a very\n                      interesting point to bring up because allegedly the\n                      creator of bitcoin is someone called Satoshi Nakamoto.\n                      And he is the alleged creator, as I said, but the reason\n                      I say alleged is that no one has ever met this person.\n                      He's kind of a mystery, so no one knows his real\n                      identity. Some people have had made theories that it\n                      could be a group of people. It could be a specific\n                      person that, and that's just an alias, but no one really\n                      knows who this guy is and where he came from. Yeah, it's\n                      this really interesting concept. \nTodd: So, then how did this take hold?\n                      How did this get a foot in society? You know what I\n                      mean, like get a foot in the door, I should say. \nAnthony: Yeah. \nTodd: So somebody creates this system.\n                      This person is a mystery, but then the internet grabbed\n                      onto it and said, \"Hey, this is a really cool thing. I\n                      want to buy this.\" It's just it's quite interesting that\n                      this market came out of nowhere and now it's\n                      challenging traditional currency systems. \nAnthony: Exactly. This was before the\n                      internet was even really what it is now, but I think in\n                      like 2007, I think, 2007, 2008, there was a group of\n                      people called the Cypherpunks, and they were kind of\n                      like anarchistic programmers that were\n                      anti-establishment. They ran this email mailing list,\n                      and they were just collaborating together talking about\n                      creating some kind of digital cash. Satoshi Nakamoto was\n                      a member of that mailing list, and that's where it kind\n                      of gained the underground movement and ...\n                      Really, I think there's what is called the white paper\n                      and that's the document that details everything about\n                      bitcoin, and it's really big. I'm not sure exactly how\n                      large, but it's like a book, and a lot of the reason it\n                      took off is people would read it and they would believe\n                      the technology, and they would try to sell it to other\n                      people because they believed in it really. \nTodd: Wow. That's an interesting\n                      history, and so basically this community read this white\n                      paper and then it took off- \nAnthony: From there. \nTodd: And gained momentum and then\n                      that here we are today. \nAnthony: Yeah, but I think a big part\n                      of it, as you mentioned, is really just convincing\n                      people because really fiat currency, I mean, if you break\n                        \n                        \n                        it down, it's just paper, right? \nTodd: Yeah. \nAnthony: It's just paper that the\n                      government makes. \nTodd: It's an illusion. \nAnthony: Yeah, and the only reason\n                      that it has any value is because we trust in it. So, if\n                      I give you a $100 bill or whatever, you're going to\n                      trust that you can spend that to buy something. It's the\n                      same thing with bitcoin. It's a process of convincing\n                      people that because this technology makes something that\n                      is scarce, it cannot be replicated, it cannot be ...\n                      Without the proper means, it cannot be moved or taken,\n                      that it is a valid way of transferring value digitally.\n                      So that's a really big part of it and a lot of people\n                      have bought into it. \nTodd: Wow. Very interesting.",

        "transcript": "Ray: I remember watching a television documentary in the United States a few years ago that at one point they brought up the subject of these toads that live in Australia that supposedly have some substance that is for humans a hallucinogenic, does that ring any bells with you?\nShirley: Well, I don’t know about those ones specifically but I know that in Australia for example we have a huge Cane Toad problem. Cane toads are very big toads they are about the size of a small cantelope probably, and someone brought them in at the turn of the 20th century and they got loose in northern Australia and now there’s thousands and thousands and thousands of hectares covered with Cane toads and every year it costs the government a huge amount of money trying to control them and they’ve become a pest. And that’s one of the reasons why we have such strict quarantine regulations.\nRay: That makes sense. Of course, I guess we all know about the rabbits.Shirley: Yes, rabbits were first brought into Australia from Britain, and probably just as someone’s pet and one got out …Ray: You weren’t on duty that dayShirley: I wasn’t on duty that day probably because it was maybe about a hundred years ago Ray: You did say “previous life” soShirley: That’s true. Anyway, the rabbits got loose and there was periods in Australian history where there were millions and millions of rabbits and huge control programs and one of the things that they did to control them, which I think eventually did control them was they gave them a disease called “myxomatosis” which doesn’t kill the rabbit but makes them go blind … so they get infected with it. I think that it’s transmitted by a small flea and they go blind and I think, rather horribly, they either starve to death or they, you know, they just can’t survive. And that was what controlled them in the end.Ray: Uh huh, until they come up with an immunity to it.Shirley: Yeah, they don’t seem to have done that. I mean they’re still around a little bit, but not in the numbers, not in the plague numbers that they used to be in the past.Ray: So now it’s toads that are the big problem.Shirley: Yeah well, there’s other things as well but … yeah, toads are an ongoing problem.",
