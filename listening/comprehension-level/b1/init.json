        "transcript": "Morning, everyone. Quiet, please. Right, OK. So, today I’m going to give you some advice to help you prepare for the exams next week. So, make some notes as I’m talking, please. Everybody ready?\nNow, while you’re studying, eat food that gives you energy. Don’t be tempted to eat sweets or drink cola. Sugar won’t help you study but fruit and cereals will. Apples, actually, are especially good.\nFind a comfortable place with plenty of light when you study. But not ‘too’ comfortable or you’ll fall asleep!\nTry and keep a positive mind. It is easier to study when you are positive and relaxed. Now, if you start feeling anxious, have a little break. Go out for a stroll around the block.\nDon’t try to learn everything. There isn’t time. Just choose the ‘important’ things, the things that’ll get you the most points in an exam. And if you aren’t sure about this, ask me.\nFirst, learn the main ideas and don’t worry too much about the details. If you have time, you can come back later and read the details.\nMake notes of these key points and read them, then cover them up and try to remember all the points. Now, it might be boring, but repetition helps you to remember.\nUse past exam papers to study. They will help you understand what kind of questions come up. There are plenty of past exam papers in the library. You can photocopy them and take them home.\nTake regular breaks while you’re studying. A five-minute break every half hour is usually enough. Get some fresh air and stretch your arms and legs. Drink a glass of water too. It’s important to keep hydrated.\nAnd, last but not least, good luck! I’m sure you’ll all do your best.",

Well, we know all about that from biology lessons.\nA: No, we didn’t learn much at all at school! They’re discovering loads more things all the time. Really amazing things! Did you know that only about one tenth of the cells in your body are really you? The rest are bacteria.\nB: What? I’m not really me?\nA: No, of course you are you, but you also have millions, or trillions, of bacteria in you.\nB: Eeeeuuugh!\nA: No, they’re mostly really helpful. Someone did an experiment to see if animals can live without bacteria, and he found that a lot of them died or had to have a special diet. Animals need bacteria to digest food, you see. So we’re better off with bacteria.\nB: Unless the bacteria are bad.\nA: Unless they are bad, but they’re nearly all good. Oh yeah, and going back to cells, do you know how many cells you have in your body?\nB: Quite a lot, I’d say. A good few.\nA: Yeah, but how many?\nB: I don’t know. I’m not mathematical.\nA: 7 octillion! That’s 7 plus 27 noughts.\nB: I knew it was a lot.\nA: OK, that’s an amazingly huge number, almost impossible to imagine. But the really weird thing is that most of the atoms are empty space, just air or nothingness. And if you took out the empty space, you could fit your body inside a tiny cube which measures one 500th of a centimetre on either side. That’s a box measuring 0.002 of a centimetre on each side. You’d be much too small to see.\nB: Mmm, I can imagine that. It sounds like something that would happen in a really bad Hollywood movie. You know, a mad scientist goes: (funny voice) ‘I’m going to extract all the air from your body’. OK, enough facts for one day.\nA: Don’t go! One last thing, did you know …\nB: No.\nA: Did you know that you probably have mites in your eyelashes?\nB: Mites in my eyelashes? What are mites exactly anyway?\nA: Yeah, they’re very small creatures, like insects, only not insects. They’re about a third of a millimetre long, so you can’t really see them. These particular mites live in eyelashes and eyebrows.\nB: But in mine?\nA: Well, maybe not. Only about 50% of people have them, and more older people. So you might not have any. Anyway, they’re completely harmless, they just eat dead skin.\nB: Yeah, right, harmless. I really would have preferred not to know that.\nA: Sorry.\nB: I mean, really!",

It’s a really expensive course. I’m not sure we can afford for you to take it again. Things are difficult enough as it is.\nBoy: I know, Mum. I’m sorry.

Why’s that?\nGirl 2: Well, something terrible happened this morning … (voice trembling)\nGirl 1: What? Sorry, take your time, and tell me when you’re ready.\nGirl 2: Well, I was playing with Bonzo in the garden with a ball, and the ball went over the hedge into the road, and …\nGirl 1: Yes?\nGirl 2: And Bonzo jumped over the hedge after it and he got hit by a car.\nGirl 1: Oh, no! And is he … ?\nGirl 2: Yes. We took him to the vet’s immediately, but there was nothing she could do.\nGirl 1: Oh, poor Bonzo. And poor you. I know how much he meant to you.\nGirl 2: We’d had him since he was a tiny puppy. He was like one of the family.\nGirl 1: I’m really sorry. At least he had a happy life.\nGirl 2: His life was too short!\nGirl 1: Well, yes, OK. I’m sorry, that was a really insensitive thing to say. I’ll come round and see you later, OK?\n\nC\nBoy: Hi, Dad.\nFather: Hi, how’s it going?\nBoy: Did you have a good day at work?\nFather: Same as usual, really. What about you? Good day at school?\nBoy: Yeah, pretty good. Except for one little thing …\nFather: Why do I have a sinking feeling in my stomach?\nBoy: Do you remember you lent me your phone?\nFather: Yes?\nBoy: Well, I was standing just outside school, texting Jack, and somebody ran past and grabbed it.\nFather: You let someone steal my phone?\nBoy: I didn’t let them.\nFather: No, I suppose not. But did you know that that might happen? Is that a dangerous spot?\nBoy: Well, I had heard of that happening, but I’d forgotten. Anyway, I didn’t think it would happen to me.\nFather: No, OK. Did you see who it was?\nBoy: No. It was someone in a blue tracksuit, and there are loads of people who wear those. But there’s a CCTV camera on the entrance. It might have got a shot of the thief’s face.\nFather: You reported it then?\nBoy: Well, not yet, but I will tomorrow.\nFather: All right. Don’t forget to report it tomorrow.

        "transcript": "A (Girl):\nShe lives next door and she’s always been really important in my life. When we were little and my mum was working she used to look after us. She’d tell us stories about her childhood. It was like listening to fairy stories, life was so different when she was a child. In her kitchen she used to keep a special dish with sweets for us, and she was always baking cakes and pies. Now she doesn’t bake so much. She’s started eating more healthily in her old age, salads and vegetables and things. It’s funny how she’s changed. She also goes to this special gym class for old people, it’s amazing. I don’t see her so often now, but she’s always the same person however much her lifestyle changes.\n\nB (Boy):\nHe’s four years older than me and that seemed like a huge amount when we were children. When we were at the same school we’d never talk to each other during school hours. But now we’re older it’s a lot better, although I’ll always be the little one, and that’s annoying sometimes. He’s taken me to rock concerts that I wouldn’t have gone to otherwise and when he was at uni I went to stay with him sometimes. That was really cool. It was great to see what real student life was like when I was still at school. Now that he’s working he’s really busy, but we still hang out sometimes. We go to football matches together because we both support our home team. It’s always good to see him.\n\nC (Girl):\nWe’ve known each other since we were five and we’ve always got on really well. Well, apart from that time when we fell out because we both liked the same boy. But he went off with Heather Jenkins, so we made friends again quite quickly! We both like the same kind of music and going dancing at the weekend, and when we were younger we went out on our bikes together. At school we’re good at different things. I’m good at languages and Laura’s good at maths. That’s good though – it means that we can help each other with our homework. Next year I’m probably going to study in London and she’s going to Manchester, but I’m sure our relationship won’t change.\n\nD (Boy):\nHis family moved in just a few houses down from us when I was about ten, and I still remember how excited I felt when I found out there was another boy on the street. I’d been the only boy, you see. The others were all girls. We were good friends from the beginning because we were into the same things: computers and football, mostly. But we had quite a few of the same hobbies for a while. I remember making lots of models of aeroplanes one year. Another year we took up fishing. We had all the equipment and everything and we’d spend ages down by the river. I never go fishing now. His family moved away a couple of years ago. We’re still friends on Facebook but we don’t really have much contact.\n\nE (Girl):\nI can remember all the details of when we met. I was wearing a red dress and I’d just had my hair cut. I can even remember what music was playing the first time I saw him. I knew he was special from the beginning, and I was right. We’ve been together ever since. Well, it’s only been eighteen months, and some people say that isn’t very long, but it seems like ages to me. We’ve got such similar personalities and so much in common. I’m sure we’ll stay together forever.",

        "transcript": "Zoo guide: OK, are we all together? Right, next we’re going to look at the llamas, but actually here we have four different animals which are all from South America and all related to camels. Llamas, which you have probably heard of, over here. And over there alpacas, vicuñas and guanacos.\nLlamas and alpacas are both domesticated animals and vicuñas and guanacos are wild. Llamas are the biggest animal – they can grow up to 1.8 metres tall and in the past they were used to carry things. Llamas are very sociable animals and live together in groups, in herds.\nTeenager 1: Don’t they spit at people, though?\nGuide: Well, yes, they can. All members of the camelid family sometimes spit. You don’t want to mistreat a llama; it might even spit some of the contents of its stomach at you.\nGroup of teenagers: Uuuugggh!\nGuide: But if you treat them properly they are not likely to. They respond well to being trained and they are usually gentle and curious.\nOK, over here we have the alpacas. As you can see, they are smaller than the llamas. They’ve got smaller faces and they always look as though they are smiling. Look at this one’s face.\nGroup of teenagers: Aaaah!\nGuide: The alpaca is famous for its wool, which is softer and warmer than sheep’s wool. There’s a big demand for alpaca wool from the fashion industry.\nRight, next to the alpacas we have the vicuñas. As I said before, these animals are wild and they are thought to be the ancestors of the alpacas. Vicuñas are very elegant and graceful creatures. Look at this one. She’s beautiful.\nGroup of teenagers: Mmmm. She’s lovely. (etc.)\nGuide: Have you heard of the Incas? The ancient rulers of Latin America who lived in the Andes? Well, they wore clothes made from vicuña wool – only the royal family were allowed to wear the wool. It is even softer than alpaca wool but vicuñas can only be shorn of their wool every three years. For that reason the wool’s very expensive.\nAnd, lastly, we have the guanacos. They are similar to the vicuñas, but larger and stronger. They are capable of surviving at over 4,000 metres in the Andes. When they are in the desert they survive by licking the water off the cacti and other desert plants. Right, any questions?\nTeenager 2: I think I can hear this llama making a noise.\nGuide: Ah, yes. That could be the llama humming. They don’t open their mouths, they just make this strange noise. They hum when they are stressed, or the opposite, feeling relaxed.\nTeenager 1: Can llamas live in the UK?\nGuide: Yes, there are quite a lot of llamas and alpaca in the UK. They adapt very well to our climate. They make good pets and sometimes they’re used for trekking. You go on a picnic and use a llama to carry your food.\nTeenager 3: Cool! I want to do that!\nGuide: And sometimes farmers use them as guard dogs, I mean guard llama. The adult males will protect sheep and hens from animals that might attack them, like dogs or foxes. They’re really useful animals.",

        "transcript": "Host: On ‘Star Students’ today we’re speaking to Peter, who is going to tell us about the Pomodoro Technique, a system to help manage your time. It was invented by an Italian man called Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. Now, he called it the Pomodoro Technique after a tomato-shaped timer that his mother used to use when she was cooking. Pomodoro is Italian for tomato. And this tomato has helped Peter become an A-grade student. So, Peter, welcome to the studio.\nPeter: Thanks.\nHost: Tell us about the Pomodoro Technique. What’s it about?\nPeter: It’s about getting maximum productivity from your available time. I use it for studying, but professionals use it at work.\nHost: Is it difficult to follow?\nPeter: No. It’s actually very simple. It’s about breaking down your work into separate jobs and then using a timer to separate your time into periods of intensive work and short breaks.\nHost: OK, well, that sounds sensible. So, how do you start?\nPeter: First of all, you should think about the task you need to complete. For example, writing an essay for homework. You need to think about all the stages of the task and write a clear to-do list on a piece of paper. When you are ready to start you set the timer to 25 minutes and you start working on the first item on the list.\nHost: OK … but what happens when the timer goes off?\nPeter: When the timer goes off you must take a short break of between 3 to 5 minutes. One 25-minute session is one ‘pomodoro’ so when you have completed this, you deserve a short break. You should try to move about a bit during the break.\nThen, set the timer for another 25 minutes and keep working. At the end of the next ‘pomodoro’ you have another short break. As you complete the items on the ‘to-do’ list you should tick them off, to give you a feeling of satisfaction that you’re getting the job done.\nHost: OK … I get it. Can you use any timer? Most people have timers on their phones these days. Could you use that?\nPeter: You could, but the danger is that then you can check messages on your phone or you start looking at apps. I use my dad’s kitchen timer and I make sure I switch off my phone when I’m studying. I get so much more done. In the breaks I sometimes check my phone but only if I’ve completed some of the items on my to-do list.\nHost: Three to five minutes isn’t long for a break. Is that enough time?\nPeter: Well, when you’ve had four or five short breaks you can take a longer break, and then you start again.\nHost: And it works?\nPeter: Yes, it works for me! It stops me wasting time. My work is much more effective when I use the timer. It’s like short, intense periods of work. I actually get my homework done a lot quicker now, which leaves me more free time, so for me it works really well.\nHost: Oh, I think I’ll give it a try. Thanks so much for coming in, Peter.\nPeter: You’re welcome. Thanks for inviting me.",

        "transcript": "A\nHi, come in. I’m Maya. Hello everybody. Welcome to the Grange Park Sports Centre. I’ll just show you round the centre and explain what we offer here, and then you can ask me questions. Well, as you can see, this is quite a small centre but we offer a lot of different activities at different times of the day. If you’d just like to come through here, you can see the main rooms. These are nice and light and airy and we have a very good air-conditioning system so they are warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Here we have classes of yoga, tai chi, Pilates and Zumba at different levels. We also have different types of dance class: jazz dancing, Indian dancing and Latin dancing. Oh, and we’ve just started offering flamenco. All our teachers are fully qualified and experienced. We have beginners’ classes up to advanced. Some of our students have been coming since we opened, ten years ago.\nSo, if you could follow me through here - mind the steps here - we’ve got the sauna and massage rooms. We have very reasonable prices for massages. And over here we have the gym with exercise machines. It’s quite a small gym, but usually there’s plenty of room for people to move around without any problems. OK, that’s about it. Over there we have the changing rooms with showers. You do need to bring your own towel if you want a shower, but you don’t need to bring a mat for the yoga and Pilates classes. Oh, and I must mention the café. It’s just off the main entrance. That’s very popular with our clients; we have a great selection of teas, fresh juices, sandwiches and cakes.\nRight, the prices. You can join for three months, six months or a year and that gives you the right to use the gym and go to two classes a week. If you want to go to more classes or use the sauna, there’s a small extra charge. For three months the fee is …\n\nB\nOK, let me show you the gym. My name’s Bill and I’m the main sports trainer here, but we have a team of four specialists who are always around to help you with exercise programmes and give advice about lifestyle and diet. We strongly recommend that you talk to one of us as soon as you sign up and set up your personalised training programme. So, through here we have the main gym. As you can see, it’s enormous and we have lots of brand-new machines. You can do everything here, running, cycling, rowing, weights … you name it. Although we have a lot of clients, it’s very unusual to have to wait for a machine. Over there is the area for weight-training. If you want a closer look at the machines, you can come back later. Oh, by the way, you can only come in here with trainers on. No outdoor shoes, please.\nOK, through here we have the swimming pool. It’s great, isn’t it? We’re very proud of it. You can use it most of the time without booking, but there are certain times of day when we have swimming classes and water aerobics. There is always a lifeguard in attendance who will also offer informal swimming tips. OK, just over there you have the changing rooms and lockers, and on the right are the bathrooms and showers. We have our own shop, here, where you can buy our own brand of sportswear and sports drinks and supplements. Right, I can see you’re impressed, and as I said, we’re very proud of our centre. However, I should warn you that we are slightly more expensive than other gyms in the area – but then we offer a much higher level of services and a very wide range of activities. Here’s a brochure with the timetables of the extra classes that we offer, such as boxing, taekwondo and capoeira and quite a few others, besides swimming activities: swimming classes, diving classes, water aerobics and water polo. OK, so have a look at the brochure, then you can speak to one of the secretaries in reception about the best combination of activities for you.",

It’s a new centre; it sounds great. We’re going to go dirtboarding …\nGirl: What’s that?\nBoy: It’s like skateboarding or snowboarding. You have a board, or deck, to stand on and wheels. They’re pretty strong because you go down rough mountain tracks on them. Steep, rough mountain tracks.\nGirl: Sounds a bit risky. Have you done it before?\nBoy: No, but I’ve done similar things. Anyway, we’re also going to go canyoning. Before you ask, that’s when you jump and swim down a river canyon. You have to use ropes and special equipment. And maybe we’ll go white water rafting too.\nGirl: Phew. It sounds far too difficult to me.\nBoy: They have lots of things that you could do too. Like zip-wiring, you know when you go along a wire through the trees or down a mountain.\nGirl: Go down a mountain on a wire!\nBoy: It’s really easy, and exciting too. You just have to hold on and enjoy the ride. Or there’s bungee jumping.\nGirl: Jump off a bridge on a long elastic band! Me? You’ve got to be joking! Anyway, I’m going away this weekend too, thank you for asking.\nBoy: I was going to ask. So where are you going?\nGirl: Paris! I’m so excited!\nBoy: Paris, wow!\nGirl: Yeah, it’ll be brilliant! We’re going to do all the sights, like go up the Eiffel Tower and take a boat along the River Seine and see the old parts of the city. It looks so beautiful in the photos. And then there are all the art galleries. You know how much I like art. I can’t wait to go round the Louvre and see all those famous paintings.\nBoy: I think the famous Impressionist paintings are somewhere else.\nGirl: Yeah, I know, they’re in the Musée d’Orsay. We’re going there too. And then I want to go to the Rodin Museum and see that famous statue, you know, The Thinker. And of course, if we’re in Paris, we’ll have to go shopping. Or look at the shops, at least. And then there’s the restaurants. Just think, French food!\nBoy: You’ve got a lot planned for one weekend.\nGirl: Oh, we’re going for four days, actually.\nBoy: Oh, four days, very nice. And who are you going with?\nGirl: Oh, just a friend.",

        "transcript": "Interviewer: Good morning. Today we’re going to talk about theme parks and we’re going to hear from Andy Wells who has written a guide to theme parks around the world. Welcome to the programme, Andy.\nAndy: Hi, it’s good to be here.\nInterviewer: You really have a dream job, don’t you, Andy? Flying round the world all the time, visiting adventure parks ...\nAndy: Well, yes, it’s pretty exciting. But it’s really hard work too, you know.\nInterviewer: I bet. So, what’s the number one theme park in the world?\nAndy: That all depends what you’re looking for. In terms of numbers, it has to be Magic Kingdom at Disney World in Florida, the most famous theme park. But the most popular park for people who like adventure rides is Cedar Point in Ohio, USA. It has the biggest number of rollercoasters in one park, 17, and three water rides. There are lots of other attractions too. Last year they introduced 50 animatronic dinosaurs. You know, life-size models that move and look real.\nInterviewer: Cool! Have they got anything lined up for this year?\nAndy: Yeah, there’s a new rollercoaster called the Gatekeeper. Well, actually it’s not a rollercoaster, it’s a wingcoaster. It’ll be the biggest in the world.\nInterviewer: What’s a wingcoaster?\nAndy: With a normal rollercoaster you are sitting on a seat with the track under you. With a wingcoaster the seats kind of stick out at the side so the passengers have nothing below or above them. You feel as if you’re flying.\nInterviewer: So it’s more frightening?\nAndy: More exciting! Way more exciting.\nInterviewer: What other attractions have you seen recently?\nAndy: I’ve just been to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at the Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida. It’s great! You know those shops that sell magic sweets and things in the Harry Potter books? Well, they have those, just like you’ve imagined. There’s a fantastic tour of Hogwarts School where you meet characters from the books. It’s so well done.\nInterviewer: Right, sounds interesting. In your book you have a lot of theme parks in Asia too. Can you tell us about them?\nAndy: Sure. Tokyo has had a Disneyland for quite a long time, which attracts a lot of people. Ocean Park in Hong Kong has also been going for a long time – that has a lot of marine animals as well as rides. Lotte World, a huge park in South Korea, has the world’s biggest indoor theme park. And then there’s Universal Studios in Singapore. That’s expanding with additions to its New York street section. There’s going to be a Sesame Street dark ride. A dark ride’s a ride inside a building.\nInterviewer: I see. New York in Singapore?\nAndy: Yeah, it’s weird, but it works. But the place to watch at the moment is China – they’re really expanding. Lots more parks will open in China in the next few years, including another one with dinosaurs in the north, and Ocean Kingdom in the south. That will have the world’s longest roller coaster and tallest Ferris wheel, as well as boat rides and a night-time zoo.\nInterviewer: Wow, so that’s opening soon?\nAndy: Yes, this year. I’ll be there!\nInterviewer: Have a ride for me, then.",

I'm calling about the invoice and the payment terms. I need a favour.\n\nJunko: A favour? What do you need?\n\nAndrea: This is a little, er ... difficult, but I need an extension on the payment terms. I know they're usually 30 days, but we're having some cash flow problems. You'd really be helping us out if you could extend it to 60 days.\n\nJunko: I'm not sure if I can do that, Andrea. We've got regulations at our end, and also have to manage our own cash flow.\n\nAndrea: I promise this won't become the norm, Junko. Actually, I also want to place another new order. The same size order as last time. It's for an important customer and they pay on delivery.\n\nJunko: I see. So your cash flow problem will be solved after this new order is delivered.\n\nAndrea: Exactly.\n\nJunko: That sounds good. Hold on, Andrea. Let me see what I can do. Yes, I think we can make an exception this time.\n\nAndrea: That's great, Junko. I appreciate your help.\n\nJunko: And we appreciate your business, Andrea. It works both ways.\n\nAndrea: Thanks again, Junko. Can you send me a quick email confirmation of the payment terms extension?\n\nJunko: Sure, no problem. We're happy to help you.\n\nAndrea: Great. And I'll email you the new order.\n\nJunko: Thanks. I'll keep an eye out for it. Talk to you soon.\n\nAndrea: You too. Goodbye.",

We've got a really diverse team here – people of different nationalities, backgrounds, religions, ages … and sometimes I don't feel we make the most of this.\n\nStefano: Yes, and even if it isn't specifically challenging, many people are simply unaware of the isolation that some team members may feel because they are different.\n\nBrenda: So, what does this mean? What are we going to do?\n\nNina: Well, we need to create a workplace charter. You know, one that promotes equality, diversity and inclusion.\n\nBrenda: That sounds like a good idea. But will people just see it as something the management team has created? Maybe they won't even pay attention to it.\n\nNina: I know. That's why we're going to involve everyone in creating it.\n\nStefano: That's a good idea. We could run some workshops and get ideas from the employees about how we can create a more inclusive workplace.\n\nNina: Exactly. I was thinking that before that we could run some team-building sessions so they can experience the value of diversity for themselves.\n\nBrenda: Yes, I like that. Many people see diversity as something negative, often because there are different opinions or ways of doing things.\n\nNina: Yes, I know, but if there's no diversity, then the risk is that we all work in the same way, think the same and see the world the same. This makes it hard to be creative and to innovate.\n\nStefano: I completely agree, Nina. OK. So, what do you want us to do?\n\nNina: Stefano, can you look for a successful trainer who specialises in running workshops and team-building sessions on diversity and inclusion?\n\nStefano: Sure. I'll be happy to.\n\nNina: And Brenda, can you find a fun venue? Somewhere that is quite diverse itself. Something that's not the usual seminar-style environment?\n\nBrenda: Sure. That'll be fun.\n\nNina: And I'm going to do some further research into how other organisations are benefiting from their diversity. I can share this with the whole team.",

        "transcript": "Hello and good morning! Well, we're off to a good start in the south this week, as most of the rain from the weekend has disappeared – just a few patches of cloud and maybe some showers here on the east coast. They'll all clear up by lunchtime, though. Over the next day or so, London and the area around Kent can expect a couple of isolated showers, but mostly dry through until Thursday.\n\nIt's not such good news for the north-west this week, I'm afraid: more wet weather, and not a lot of sunshine. Some of today's showers will be heavy – and even thundery in Manchester and across the Pennines. Leeds will escape the thunderstorms, with drizzle and light rain only throughout the rest of the day and tonight.\n\nElsewhere it becomes dry today, but with some foggy patches towards Wales. In England, tomorrow morning will see a dry, bright start in most places, with high temperatures throughout the week. We might see one or two thunderstorms appearing as the week goes on, with temperatures everywhere at 29 to 30 degrees. \n\nBy the weekend, unfortunately, the dry weather will make way for mostly cloudy skies and rain. The rain will move from Scotland, down towards the north and reach the south coast by Saturday afternoon. Temperatures, at least, will stay mostly warm at around 21 degrees for the weekend. It might feel like a nice change from the high twenties and early thirties we'll see in the week. That's all from me until tomorrow. Enjoy the mini-heatwave while you can!",

        "transcript": "Presenter: So, today's expert teacher is Gabriella, a university English teacher from Leeds. Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.\n\nGabriella: Thanks for having me!\n\nPresenter: So, I have to confess today's topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn't so bad. At least I'm in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it's like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.\n\nGabriella: No, you're not strange. In fact, it's really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can't ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it's gone.\n\nPresenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, 'Sorry, can you repeat that, please?', especially if I still don't understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don't do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I'm still lost!\n\nGabriella: They do, don't they? In real life, you've got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.\n\nPresenter: Yep, sounds familiar!\n\nGabriella: But, obviously that's not going to help if it's a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you're just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn't matter. But imagine you're at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?\n\nPresenter: I hope you've got the answer, Gabriella, because I'm coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!\n\nGabriella: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.\n\nPresenter: But how can you do that if you didn't understand what they said?\n\nGabriella: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, 'OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?' and make it a question. Or, for example, 'And which office is that again?' Break it down into smaller questions and the other person will naturally start answering them. That way you're controlling the conversation a bit more.\n\nPresenter: I get you ...",

        "transcript": "Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the first lecture of our new course in Positive Psychology. While some people may associate psychology with looking at what's wrong with us, and at what problems we have, there is much more to psychology than that. Positive psychology, for example, looks at how to help people become happier.\n\nThis lecture begins with a question: what makes a happy life?\n\nNow, I'm going to give you one possible answer. A happy life is a life in which you are completely absorbed in what you do. Now, how does this compare with what you and your partner said? \n\nThis answer comes from the work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and the theory of flow. Csikszentmihalyi is a psychologist who has spent much of his professional life on the study of what makes people happy and how we can find happiness.\n\nCsikszentmihalyi suggests the theory that happiness is not caused by external events or things that happen to us. Our perception of these things and how we see these events either makes us happy or sad. In other words, if we want happiness, we have to actively look for it. However, this does not mean that we should always look for happiness! Csikszentmihalyi believed that our happiest moments happen when we are in a state of flow.\n\nThe theory of flow can be summarised like this: when we are totally involved in, or focused on, what we are doing, we are in a state of flow.\n\nCsikszentmihalyi got the inspiration for this theory when he noticed how artists worked in a studio. They completely lost track of time, they didn't notice they were hungry or tired, and they could work for hours, even days, without stopping. Anyone I have spoken to who has experienced this state of concentration has said it's difficult to explain. The best way to explain it is that it is like being in a river and the flow of the water carries you away.\n\nFor the rest of this lecture, I will explore this theory of flow in more detail. First we will look at Csikszentmihalyi's life, and how it influenced his ideas. Then we will look at the conditions that go with a state of flow. What creates flow, exactly? Finally, we will look at activities that can help us achieve flow in our everyday lives. Will this course make you happy for life? Well, maybe. Maybe. \n\nRight, let's get started. If you look at the next slide …",

The dragon at the end and all the special effects in that final scene were amazing.\n\nWoman: I loved that part! But I still don't think this series was as good as the others.\n\nMan: Really? But you said you wouldn't want to miss it?\n\nWoman: I know, but still … it's a lot more predictable than it used to be.\n\nMan: But that's because the story has been told so well that all the characters are reaching their destiny now.\n\nWoman: I don't know … before, anyone could die at any time so it was exciting! But, this series, no key characters died and we all knew they wouldn't. When Jaime fell in the water after the dragon attacked him, we knew he would make it somehow. And … oh, surprise, Bronn jumps in and saves him.\n\nMan: They did kill some characters in this series, though. What was that one's name …?\n\nWoman: Exactly, see! You can't even remember who died!\n\nMan: Hmm. The only thing I didn't like about this series was that it was shorter than the others. Seven episodes instead of ten. Maybe they spent all their money on that dragon!\n\nWoman: Right! I don't understand why they did it, as all the fans would happily watch ten episodes.\n\nMan: I reckon that now they're not using the story in the books any more, they don't have as many ideas.\n\nWoman: That would explain why they're not being as brave with the story too. It's more like a Hollywood film than a TV show now.\n\nMan: So, is Tyrion still your favourite character?\n\nWoman: You know … surprisingly, I think my favourite might be Cersei.\n\nMan: What?!\n\nWoman: She's so interesting! All the awful things she's done and the way she's just aiming for revenge, even though it won't make her happy. She still surprises us because we're expecting her to have a happy ending where she sees her mistakes and becomes a good person. But she never does, no matter what it costs her. She's unpredictable because we just can't believe anyone would be like her.\n\nMan: I guess. You don't have to like a character for them to be your favourite!",

What do you need from us?\n\nEmiko: Hold on a moment. I think we need to decide between us what to do, to make sure it works for all departments.\n\nJani: Yes, exactly, don't worry. We're going to discuss this and make a decision together. Let's first think about the scheduling of each project phase. What do you think, Emiko?\n\nDavid: Can I interrupt? I think we should first be clear about the process we'll use to make the decision. How are we going to do it?\n\nJani: Ah, yes. Good point. Well, I think the best way is for each of you to give your opinion and then we can discuss and make a decision.\n\nDavid: OK. That sounds good.\n\nEmiko: Yes, that works for me too. I know we're still planning the structure of the later phases of the project, but I think we should begin phase one as soon as possible. We can work out the rest later, as we go along.\n\nDavid: I'm sorry, I don't think so. How can we start phase one if we're not fully clear on where the rest of the project will take us? We might make a wrong decision and waste time.\n\nJani: I agree with you on that point, David. However, we'll waste too much time if we wait until everything is planned before we actually start working on the project. I think we should take an agile approach.\n\nDavid: Agile approach?\n\nJani: Well, it means that we start quickly and then adapt as we go along.\n\nEmiko: That's right.\n\nJani: Carolina, you've been very quiet.\n\nCarolina: Um … I'm sorry. I didn't want to interrupt. I'm listening … and thinking.\n\nDavid: Do you agree we should get the plan right first, and then start with phase one?\n\nCarolina: I'm sorry, David. I don't think I agree with you. It's important to have a good plan. But plans can change, even the good ones – and business changes often. We need to be flexible, and we also need to move quickly.\n\nJani: OK. So should we take a vote?\n\nEmiko: Well, you're the project leader. Let's go with your decision.\n\nCarolina: Yes, I'll follow your lead, Jani.\n\nDavid: Well, I guess that's decided then. We'll follow your agile approach, Jani. Start quickly and keep planning the later stages of the project.\n\nJani: Yes, that's right.\n\nDavid: I still don't think this is the right decision, but I'm happy to go with the majority. We should add some space into the schedule later for additional work this 'flexibility' will need.\n\nJani: Don't worry, David, we will. OK, so it's decided then. We'll start phase one as soon as possible, and in the background we'll continue planning the later phases and adapt them as we go along.",

Wow.\n\nPatrick and Selina: So, what are you doing here?\n\nSelina: Sorry, you go first.\n\nPatrick: OK. What are you doing here? I thought you'd moved to London.\n\nSelina: I was in London for a couple of years. But it didn't work out.\n\nPatrick: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you ... OK?\n\nSelina: I'm fine! The dream job wasn't really a dream, you know? Um ... and London is great but it's so expensive. I mean, just the rent on a flat is ... uh … crazy expensive.\n\nPatrick: I see.\n\nSelina: So, I came back. I've been back now for almost five months. Living back home with Mum and Dad. Which is err ... interesting. Um ... but anyway, what about you?\n\nPatrick: Me? Oh, nothing new. You know me – 'Patrick the predictable'. I never left here.\n\nSelina: Oh. And is that ...?\n\nPatrick: Oh, I'm very happy. I'm married now. We've just celebrated our tenth anniversary.\n\nSelina: No way! You? Married? To …?\n\nPatrick: I don't think you know her.

        "transcript": "Presenter: Good morning, everyone. On today's show, we've got Chris Svensson with us, the author of No more nine to five, the new best-selling book about work–life balance in the current working world. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for coming.\n\nChris: Thanks for having me, Anna.\n\nPresenter: So, Chris, tell us about your book and how the concept of a work–life balance has been changing?\n\nChris: Well, in the more traditional workplaces, people's working lives and their private lives are, or were, clearly divided. People often work from nine in the morning until five or six in the evening. People sometimes stay late in the office and work in the evenings. This is called working overtime.\n\nPresenter: OK, and what else?\n\nChris: Well, in these environments it isn't common for people to work at the weekend or while they're on holiday. They can clearly separate their working lives and their private lives. And the evenings, weekends and holidays are free to focus on non-work areas of life, such as hobbies, interests, sports, spending time with the family and friends, and so on. It's important and healthy not to spend all your time just working, right?\n\nPresenter: Right! So what has changed? How are things different now?\n\nChris: Well, for a start, most people can now access their work emails from their mobile phones. So they are more likely to quickly reply to an important mail in the evening or at the weekend. The same goes for laptops. It's easier to access your work in the evenings from home or even from your hotel when you're on holiday.\n\nPresenter: That doesn't sound like much of a work–life balance. It sounds like all work.\n\nChris: Exactly, but this new mobility brings a lot of advantages with it. More people are now able to work flexibly, so if they need to leave the office early one afternoon to be with their family, they can catch up on work that evening from home or somewhere else.\n\nPresenter: That sounds good. So, what you're saying is that although traditional divisions between work and life are fading, many employees now have more freedom to do their work from different locations and at different times.\n\nChris: Yes, that's it.",

How far is it from London?\nCat: About 70 miles so that's about two hours by train. \nTodd: OK.\nCat: From Central London.\nTodd: So when you go to London you go by train?\nCat: Normally yes because you can't drive, there's nowhere to park. \nTodd: OK.

No biting, no fish-hooking, no groin striking. \nAnn: What is the fish-hook?\nNobu: The fish-hook is a kind of illegal movement that you use two fingers. Point finger and middle finger hooking your nose or eyes. Like that!\nAnn: Sounds dangerous. \nNobu: Yes!\nAnn: Do you ever compete?\nNobu: Yes, I compete a lot.

I mean, British people are renowned to be very polite as Japanese people are too. Japanese people are very helpful as well, probably more so than British people I would say. Mm, what else? \nTodd: What about the weather?\nClare: The weather? Well, it's been raining a lot in Japan recently so we could say that it's quite similar, although actually, when I was e-mailing my parents they've been going on about how there hasn't been much rain the past couple of months and how they think there is going to be a drought. That typical British stereotype of the weather is not true at the minute and it's probably wetter in Japan. But yeah, I think that climate wise it's quite similar in terms of temperature. It's definitely much more humid here than at home.\nTodd: OK. Thanks a lot.",

So even if I like the genre, if like whether it be science fiction or historical drama, if the story isn't good then I don't like it at all.\nTodd: OK. Off the top of your head, what's a movie that you really liked?\nTenn: Well, the Lord Of the Rings they've been doing I really have enjoyed.\nTodd: Uh-huh.\nTenn: They did a good job.\nTodd: Did you read the books?\nTenn: Oh, yes!

It's just very cold in the wintertime. It is.. it has four seasons and the nicest season is the summertime because it's really warm and people play a lot of sports. Tthere are some parks in Montreal and you can go swimming and hiking and biking and rollerblading. It's a very interesing city.\nTodd: Wow! Were you born in Montreal?\nAnn: I was born in Montreal and I can speak two languages. English is my first language but I also studied French in high school.\nTodd: So, were you in a submersion program, or all your subjects in French.\nAnn: No, I went to an English high school but a lot of people in Montreal are in immersion programs.\nTodd: OK. Since you learned French, what do you think is the best way to learn a language?\nAnn: I think that you have to like learning another language and if you have a positive attitude then you can find learning another language fun rather than stressful so I think that I had a few French friends and we would practice. They would be very patient and I liked the fact that I could communicate using another language because then you have another identity.\nTodd: You have your French identity?\nAnn: I do.\nTodd: OK. So what's your name in French?\nAnn: \"Mono e Ann\"\nTodd: Wow! I need to get myself a French name?\nAnn: Todd.\nTodd: OK. Thanks a lot Ann.\nAnn: You're welcome. Nice speaking with you.",

So when you had a teleconference for example, how many students would be on the air at the same time?\n\n    Annili: I guess around eight, in two different locations.

What can I do to lose weight?\nDevon: Well, I exercise a lot. I go running at least three times a week. More than that, I enjoy playing sports. Different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained.\nTodd: Yeah. Actually, one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot.\nDevon: Do you?\nTodd: Yeah, so maybe it's my diet.\nDevon: It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat. Maybe, I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between. No potato chips. No popcorn. No candy bars. \nTodd: That's pretty tough!\nDevon: It is tough but......Well, I must admit that I cheat every once in awhile but... \nTodd: Ok, I'll give it a try. Actually, you see my problem is that I like junk food. I have to choose, either I eat less or I eat a better diet. What do you think is more important?\nDevon: I think that if you are exercising then you should just eat what you want and eat less. \nTodd: Eat less. OK.

I was an international student and I studied education at the University of Sydney. Lliving in Sydney was fantastic becuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney. There are lots of great clubs. People were very, very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people  living in Sydney.\nTodd: How long were you there?\nAnn: I was there for almost a year. \nTodd: Oh, OK. \nAnn:  I travelled a little bit in Australia. I went up the east coast, up to Frasier Island which is a world heritage site.  I saw dingos running along the beach and sharks in the water. We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the West Indies, which is a bit further north. The further north you go in Australia, the hotter it gets. We were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky because I didn't have a diving license. I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really  spongy purple inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly. \nTodd: So, did you lose your finger?\nAnn: Almost. \nTodd: Almost. Ah, you're lucky. It's funny, you go in the water and you worry about sharks\n                          but not clams. \nAnn: Exactly. \nTodd: Will you be going back to Australia soon?\nAnn: I'd like to go and live there for at least another year. Probably I'll go back to Sydney or I may go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city. They have lot of museums and parks. \nTodd: OK. You got to choose real quick. Only one city, Montreal or Sydney, which do you choose?\nAnn: Sydney, without a doubt.\nTodd: OK. All right. Thanks a lot.\nAnn: You're welcome.",

It's quite different from Western style flower arrangement because in Ikebana's theory you can decorate one flower, only with one flower.\nAnili: Oh, really?\nReiko: The flower arrangement in Japan is not only decorating flowers but it's an art with flowers and space. \nAnili: I see.\nReiko: The air between the flowers and also the room and everything, it shows the space or even the universe in it. \nAnili: What's another Japanese art?\nReiko: Japanese art? Ikebana...tea ceremony! \nAnili: Tea ceremony?\nReiko: Tea ceremony! \nAnili: Tea ceremony. Tell me about tea ceremony. \nReiko: Tea ceremony. There's certain ways you have to make tea. Not only make tea, there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl.\nAnili: I see. \nReiko: Yes, with one piece of cloth and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that  you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl.\nAnili: OK.\nReiko: Yeah, so it's a complicated traditional procedure in a sense but..\nAnili: How do you learn that? Is that something that your mother would teach you?\n                          How do people learn that? \nReiko: There's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony. So you need to go to a school, yes, and learn from your teacher and their heirarchy and the organization. You need to pass each test to go climb up the ladder in the heirarchy. \nAnili: I see. Fantastic. Thank you.\nReiko: You're welcome.",

So first of all how many people live in Australia?\nMichael: Australia? Oh, there's about 20 million people in Australia right now. A little bit under but close to twenty. \nTodd: OK. What are the biggest cities?\nMichael: The biggest city? The biggest city is Sydney. Then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth. Most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia.  Perth is on the west coast but sort of of out there by itself.\nTodd: OK. If you had to live in one place where would you live?\nMichael: I like Brisbane. I had my teenage years in Brisbane, growing up in Brisbane. Maybe Sidney because it is a big city, but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine. \nTodd: Oh, nice. Actually, what is the capital city of Australia?\nMichael: Ah, Canberra is the capital city but it's not the biggest city. Sydney is the biggest city. Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get too crowded. It's a separate territory.\nTodd:  Have you been to all the major cities in Australia?\nMichael: I have been to Melbourne when I was young. Yeah, I have. Only a short time in Perth.\nTodd: OK. What is the best thing about Australia?\nMichael: The best thing about Australia? Ah, probably the friendly people. The relaxed attitude and we like visitors from other cultures. \nTodd: Oh, cool. How are Australians different than other people? How are they unique?\nMichael: How are Australians unique? I would say that we're more fun-loving maybe or accepting of other people. We don't mind making new friends  actually and conversing with other people.\nTodd: Yeah, that's good. That's nice. OK. Thanks a lot Micheal.\nMichael: No worries.",

My father is very much completely opposite that. He is a very big man, very loud, very funny, very boisterous. \nHe makes friends no matter where he goes. For example, sometimes he goes to Florida and makes all sorts of new friends. He'll just go by himself. He's a kind of a magnet to people. So my parents are completely opposite and they complement each other very well. My dad has a very good sense of humor. My mom is very gentle. Very nice. \nTodd: When was the last time you talked to you parents?\nJessica: I talked to them probably about two weeks ago. Yeah, everything is going well with them. \nTodd: Are you going to see them soon?\nJessica: I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February. Yeah, depending on when my brother can come in.\nTodd: OK. Who are you more like, your mother or your father?\nJessica: I think I have traits of both, actually.

My family actually raises dogs for helping blind people.\nTodd: Oh, really?\nMatt: Yeah. \nTodd: Wow, like how do they train the dogs?\nMatt: How do they train the dogs? Well, I mean it's a long process right? We get them when they're puppies and so we train them basic. You know, sit, come... really basic things. Then after they're about two year old they go to a different training school.\nTodd: Oh, wow. That's great!\nMatt: Yeah!\nTodd: Well, how many dogs do they usually train at a time?\nMatt: Oh, just one. We have our own dog and then we have a dog that we have that we are training.\nTodd: Oh, OK.\nMatt: Yeah, just one dog at a time.\nTodd: Do you ever see the dogs you trained like out on the street or anything?\nMatt: Sometimes we see them. They'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets. Yeah, you get to see them every once in awhile.\nTodd: Oh, wow! That's cool. Why do people keep pets?\nMatt: I guess the most important thing is companionship, right? So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what. \nTodd: Yeah, that's true. OK. Besides cats, dogs and fish, what are some other pets people keep?\nMatt: Well, I guess if you are Siegfried and Roy you can keep a tiger or lion. I guess all types of things don't they?\nTodd: Yeah.\nMatt: I mean, my friend has a snake. I don't know if you mention that snake, ferrets and insects, spiders...\nTodd: OK.\nMatt: All kinds of things. \nTodd: All right. Yeah, like there is so many. What are some costs associated with keeping a pet?\nMatt: Food is probably the biggest cost. But also if you keep the dog, particularly a dog in your house when they are puppies and we have a lot of puppies they'll chew up everything they can so we're constantly replacing shoes and you know, cleaning up pee from the carpet and things like that. It can be a hassle.\nTodd: Yeah, OK. Thanks a lot Matt. By the way, where are you from?\nMatt: I'm from the U.S.A., from Minnesota.",

In fact, I know this bus is from London because I can see the names: Chelsea, Sloane Square, Victoria, Charing Cross. These are all areas in London.Obviously, the bus is in London. \nTodd: OK. Have you ever been on a double-decker bus?\nSteven: Yeah, many times. When I was younger, you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities. \nTodd: Oh, really? How much is the fare?\nSteven: Well, it depends on the journey. It's..I guess it's not too expensive but the minimum price you would pay is -- for a short journey is about a pound. \nTodd: Yeah, who can you see on the bus? Can you pick out anybody on the bus who looks interesting?\nSteven: This girl here at the back that's leaning on the door, she looks really bored actually. Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go.\nTodd: Yeah. Is that how you feel on the bus?\nSteven: No, not really because I haven't worked in England for a long time so I haven't taken a bus for a long time. \nTodd: So,  you're British, do you missing them?\nSteven: Yes, sometimes. \nTodd: OK.

So actually\n                          this is really silly, I've never made one before. How do you make an\n                          omelet?\nKeri: Well, I can teach you how I make them,\n                          which is the same way my father and grandmother make them so it is a\n                          little special.\n\nTodd: OK. Yeah! Yeah! \nKeri: First you take some eggs and crack them in a\n                          bowl. Whisk them up,  so they're quite high and fluffy. In a hot pan, and you need a pan that's that's kind of small that the\n                          sides go up at an angle. You put some oil and heat it up, so it's quite\n                          hot. Then you take your whipped up eggs or whisked up eggs and\n                          pour them into the pan. As it's cooking, if you take a spatula and\n                          push the bottom layer of the egg to the sides and then to the middle so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan.\nTodd: Oh, OK. Wow!\nKeri: OK. And keep doing that until most of the\n                          egg is cooked. You should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it\n                            over. You'll only have to cook that side lightly. Put your fillings on\n                          the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the\n                          cheese. \nTodd: Wow. That sounds really good. \nKeri: Mm, it is. \nTodd: Wow. What fillings do you recommend? \nKeri: Well, if you want to do a real simple\n                          one, you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese. That's easy\n                          or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese, onions,\n                          tomatoes, mushrooms, anything that you like. If you want to make a\n                          spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg\n                          mixture. It's actually cooked in it. It's inside bacon and sour\n                          cream is nice and Jack cheese.\nTodd: Oh, OK. I'll have to give that a try. Thanks!\nKeri: OK. Sure.",

Hisa, you were telling me that you have a concern about Japan. \n                        Hisa: Yes.\n                        Todd: And what is your concern?\n                        Hisa: It's vending machines.\n                        Todd: Vending machines\n                        Hisa: Yes.\n                        Todd: OK. Can you talk a little about that?\n                        Hisa: Yes, as you already noticed, how many vending machines do you come across a day if you are on the street?\n                        Todd: Many, many.\n                        Hisa: I really do not think we need that many and then each one is really consuming energy, so that is my big concern.\n                        Todd: OK, so what would you like to see happen in Japan with the vending machines?\n                        Hisa: Sorry, what? where?\n                        Todd: Like, what would you like to happen with the vending machines?\n                        Hisa: Yes.\n                        Todd: Would you like more laws or..?\n                        Hisa: Number 1, it really aggravates the scenery. Yes, and then if each one of us take drink with us, we really don't need that many, each corner, or even one corner you really see so many kinds. And then that is, we can really evacuate so many and then we will have a safer, more space on the road, because even without vending machines, imagine how narrow our roads in Japan, even the walking path so narrow, it's dangerous.\n                        Todd: And you were saying that you can actually can see vending machines in very strange places in Japan, like very, very far places in the countryside? \n                        Hisa: Yes.\n                        Todd: Wow.\n                        Hisa: So, just one example is on the summit of Mt. Fuji. Yes, it's a shame. \n                        Todd: All the way on the top of Mt. Fuji?\n                        Hisa: Yes. So those mountain climbers are talking that don't make our mountains like Mt. Fuji. In other words, they are not to put another vending machine on the top of other mountains, because why we need it.\n                        Todd: Yeah, that's crazy.\n                        Hisa: It's ridiculous.",

Actually in Kenya, what's different from other countries, we used to make our own soccer ball to play. So, it's very easy.\n                        Todd: Wow. How do you make the soccer ball?\n                        Alex: We used to collect like plastic papers and bind them with string, around them to make something round. So it was like, you didn't have to spend any money.\n                        Todd: Wow, that's ingeneous. That's great. So were you a good soccer player?\n                        Alex: Not really. I used to like playing soccer but I was not very good, actually to tell the truth\nTodd: Yeah, me too. I wasn't a very good athlete. I mean I like sports but I was never any good. Um, so do you play soccer in Japan?\n                        Alex: Sometimes, until last year when I was in school I still played soccer. Right now, actually I'm not playing anymore because I'm like busy.\n                        Todd: Yeah.\n                        Alex: Yeah. You can't play soccer without a big group of people and everyone is busy right now so I'm not playing anymore.\n                        Todd: Yeah, that's a bummer. Like I always want to play sports but it's hard as\n                          you get older. When's the last time you played soccer?\n                        Alex: About one year ago. I think November of 199?,...2003, November.\n                        Todd: OK. Actually in Kenya do you call it soccer or football?\n                        Alex: In Kenya you call it football.\n                        Todd: Football. I'm sorry.\n                        Alex: Actually, I've been in Japan for sometime so I'm used to calling it soccer. In Kenya you call it football.",

Well, who's a better player?\n                        Dianna: I am for sure, but I told him that if he gets better than me while I'm away that he has to teach me everything he knows.\n                        Todd: Oh, that's only fair. OK. Can you play any songs?\n                        Dianna: Yes, I can play \"Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee\" and just the last part of the \"Star Spangled Banner\".

My dad's name is Robert and he's an interesting guy. He's retired now and lives in Oregon and in his free time he's building an airplane (wow!) Yeah!\nTodd: So can he fly a plane as well?\n\t\t                Kerri: Yeah, he has a private pilot's license.\nTodd: Wow, that must be pretty difficult. He's actually making a plane from scratch.\nKerri: Yeah. Well, he used to be an airplane mechanic, so quite awhile ago. But yeah, he's doing all the riveting, building all the different parts of the plane and assembling it.\nTodd: Wow! So when do you think he's going to be finished.\nKerri: I don't know. I got an e-mail from him recently that said he's just putting the tail section on soon. But I haven't seen a picture of that yet.\nTodd: Wow. So are you going to go in this plane with your father as soon as it's finished?\nKerri: I hope so. He's having someone else test fly it which made me happy when I found out. Although I trust his work cause he's meticulous but it made me feel good that someone else is going to try it for the first time, but yeah, after it's finished, when he's ready to take up passengers.\nTodd: Cool. Sounds fun.\nKerri: Yeah. I think so.",

It's the highest point in Java. One of the biggest island, well the most highly populated island in Indonesia. Ah, last fall, around November, I made it to Bromo and, there's a very high mountain there, over 3,000 meters tall, called Mt. Semaru and I decided to hike this with my girlfriend, Sara. Let me tell you, it's quite a hike, 17 kilometers from the base camp, through a park, very beautiful park, lots of trees, good swimming hole really really nice area, especially in Indonesia, it's so developed, there's a lot of pollution there. \n\t\t\t            It was really nice to see some nature there, but when you get to the park, we started out around 2 o'clock in the morning, camped for the afternoon, because the best time to go to Semaru is at sunrise. So we started off around 2 o'clock with a few Indonesian fellows and about an hour into the trip one of those boys hurt their ankle so our friends were stopped but we didn't want to end our hike so we continued up the mountain, it's still pitch black, we have one flash light between the two of us, and the path starts to get very narrow, and as you approach the actual volcano, you start to see all these markers of where people have fallen off and died, so it's a little unnerving and you make sure you stay on the path and then you hit the volcano, and it's all primus stone, all ash, and you're walking at about a 45 degree incline. \n\t\t                It took us about 4, 3 to 4, hours to walk all the way up this mountain, and our oxygen was getting short. It's hard to get your footing because it's all ash, so you fall down, you're gasping for breath, you walk another 20 meters, you fall down, you gasp for breath more and more. Finally, we got to the top, and as it turned out, it was a really cloudy day and we couldn't see anything.\n\t\t                Phil: Ooh! That's too bad. Sounds like a good trip though.\n\t                    Todd: Yeah, it was an experience.",

Can you recommend anything to me?\n\t\t\t            Phil: The best thing I did in China was go through Zhang Jia Jie National Park. That's Hunan Province, and if you like nature, that's really highly recommended. It's an UNESCO cite. It's easy to find on the internet, but it's just craters, gorges, trees sticking out of really strangely shaped hills, lots of caverns and very very few people there. It was empty when I was there. I had never heard of it before. I had just been recommended by a tour guide. It was spectacular. If you like nature and like hiking it will definitely give you a workout and you'll take a lot of pictures.\n\t\t\t            Todd: Wow, well, how big is this park?\n\t\t                Phil: Good question. I didn't see the whole thing, and I spend three days there walking different parts every day, so I really don't know the size of it except that it's massive. So you just went hiking and then you camped overnight, or did you just hiked for the day?\n\t\t                Phil: Just day hikes, the tour I had been organized with had rented us a hotel, just stayed in the hotel, slept there at night, and walked most of the day.\n\t                    Todd: Uh-huh. Did you see any wildlife?\n\t                    Phil: Some insects and some butterflies, but no, nothing, no mammals, nothing like that.\n                        Todd: Was the, were the trails steep?\n                        Phil: Yeah, but most of them do have stairs so, regardless of your fitness level I don't think it would be very difficult for anybody to, some people might be a bit slower than others but you should be able to make it up alright.\n                        Todd: So, where is this again? You said in Hunan Province!\n                        Phil: I believe it's North-Western Hunan Province.",

Just joking OK. I like windsurfing. That's my number one hobby, and surfing I'm in progress, and I like skateboarding but I'm getting old, so it is kind of tiresome. What else do I like? I like going to restaurants, going out, bars, restaurants, bar hopping.\n\t\t                Todd: Cool, yeah, I like to bar hop. Let's go back to the windsurfing, um, how long have you been windsurfing?\n\t                    Roe: Since 26, so that's 4, 5, 7 years.\n\t                    Todd: 7 years! Yeah, where did you first begin windsurfing?\n                        Roe: Kamakura.\n                        Todd: Oh, in Kamakura. That's a beautiful place. \n                        Roe: In winter, yeah, but in summer, it's, I don't know, it's questionable. \n                        Todd: Really? Why? \n                        Roe:Oily.\n                        Todd: Oh, cause the water is polluted.\n                        Roe: Yeah, cause people, a lot of people come from the city. They put oils right oil, and they go swimming into the ocean.\n                        Todd: You mean suntan lotion from people's bodies gets in the water and makes it oily. That's disgusting.\n                        Roe: Isn't it. You see the oil floating around in the ocean. It's kind of sick in summer, so I really don't windsurf in summer.\n                        Todd: Wow, it must be hard to, if there is so many people in the water.\n                        Roe: Yeah, but there is a swimming section and a windsurfing section, but anyway.\n                        Todd: So, did somebody teach you to windsurf?\n                        Roe: Yeah, my brother. Oh, your brother. OK. Did it come easy for you, or was it difficult?\n                        Roe: It is really difficult to explain windsurfing cause, I show you. Can you stand up?\n                        Todd: OK, so I'm standing up?\n                        Roe: And your holding your rig, and go back, you are like 80 kilometer and your body is more closer to the ocean and your body is like down here and like 80 kilometer and waves are like 4 meters and on a good day so that is really radical.\n                        Todd: Yeah that sounds difficult. I don't think I'm ready for windsurfing.\n                        Roe: It's pretty interesting though. It's free too.\n                        Todd: But the equipment must be very expensive.\n                        Roe: The first time yeah, but once you buy and have everything down it's free to go surfing to the beach so.\n                        Todd: How many windsurfing boards do you have?\n                        Roe: Two.\n                        Todd: Two. And do you have to do a lot of work to maintain them, to keep them clean?\n                        Roe: Not really cause out in the ocean just wash with the water, clean water, that's about it.\n                        Todd: How far do you live from the beach?\n                        Roe: It takes me about, about an hour from my house.\n                        Todd: One hour. Boy. That's dedication.\n                        Roe: It's like, how can I explain this, what are your hobbies there?\n                        Todd: I like running so yeah I run all the time.\n                        Roe: Right, but it's not, you feel like you are dedicating your energy to the running.\n                        Todd: No, No. Yeah\n                        Roe: You do it because it is fun. \n                        Todd: Yeah\n                        Roe: Exactly.\n                        Todd: OK, yeah, maybe I'll have to try windsurfing one of these days. I've always wanted to try that and surfing. It look like a lot of fun.\n                        Roe: Come. I have my board and my surfboard too.\n                        Todd: Oh, that's right, you have two boards, so, hey OK. Thanks and we have to go before it's summer. Now it is spring, and all the oil in the water, that's disgusting. I can't. I thought you meant like oil from ships or sewage from the city. OK. Oil from people's bodies.

What was China like?\n\t\t                Phil: China was an eye-opener. It's a very old culture, but there's not many new, there's not many old things around in China, through wars, through the cultural revolution, a lot of stuff's been burnt, a lot of stuff just's been knocked down. One of the few old things that is there is the Great Wall of China. It's very famous this wall, very big. They are doing some efforts to try and build the wall up again, but when I was there, I believe it was August, 2002 it was still mostly old stuff.\n\t\t                Todd: Yeah, what else did you see in China?\n\t                    Phil: Ah, I went to Xian and I saw the Terra-cotta warriors. Terra-cotta warriors were discovered shortly after Mao died in the late 70's by a farmer who was digging a well, and he was digging this well and he found all these stone warriors,literally hundreds of them, and it's a national treasure now.\n\t                    Todd: Wow! That's fascinating.\n                        Phil: Yeah, it's really an impressive thing to see. Those are the two really old man-made things that I saw in China.\n                        Todd: Was there anything else that was really spectacular?\n                        Phil: The Three Gorges tour was really good. Sadly they are all under water now because of the dam project, but I was able to go shortly before it was flooded and really, really enjoyed it. Saw a lot of beautiful things. Surprisingly enough the water was a lot cleaner than I thought and I actually went swimming in it.\n                        Todd: Oh, cool. \n                        Phil: Yeah, for, this is the Yangzhe River in China and if you've ever seen the Yangzhe, most parts of it, you certainly wouldn't want to swim in it, but these parts were pristine.",

Lao is a very poor country. There's not much industry, a lot of it's still mining, fishing, on the Mekong you still see women panning for gold, but my favorite place in Lao is a place called Luang Prabang, and it's, we really didn't do very much. There's lots of things to do. You can go to caves. You can take inner tubes and go down the river, basically we just ate. The food is really good, a lot of French cuisine, the Lao cuisine is good as well, but we just hung around, read books, and enjoyed our days because it was really, really hot, and really, really dry. This was in February.\n\t                    Todd: Actually, I've been to Luang Prabang and I remember joggin along the river and, just right outside the city and we would jog for miles and miles, on this little trail.

It's not so much, it's not as cultural as say Luang Prabang is, but a lot of people like to go there to relax, hang out. That's where a lot of people take the tubes and go down the river so, but once again it was so hot we didn't really do any of that either.",

I'd recommend going, flying in to Denpassar, and getting down towards Dreamland beach. That's at the southern most tip of Bali. The waves there, I'm a beginning surfer too, the waves there aren't very big, 5, 5, 4 - 5 feet, and just really nice people there. The locals are willing to help you. You meet a lot of Balinese young kids, 12, 13 years old. They're singing in the water as they surf. They're giving each wave names, so It's a lot of fun and there's no attitude, and people are there just to have fun. It's a good time.\n\t                    Todd: Wow, that sounds nice.\n                        Phil: That area of Indonesia is really nice. Lombok is nice too. If you are more wanting to relax, I would go to Lombok, and then go up to Gili Trawangan, which is a small island off the east coast of Lombok. There's no cars on the island. The electricity is a little dodgy. It might flicker on and off. Food is great. You get fresh fish all the time. Snorkeling's nice if you like scuba diving. You can arrange tours through several companies there. But, yeah, I really like Gili Trawangan and I would recommend that to anyone who wants to relax for a couple of weeks.",

The first stop, we went there from Singapore, just taking a bus and we ended up in Malacca. Stayed about five days in Malacca. Malacca's nice. There's a lot of history there. We learned a lot about the colinization of Malacca, the Portuguese and then the Dutch, and then the English and then the Japanese, and, yeah, it was a really interesting place. There was old St. Peter's Church. There's several Mosques. It's a good place to spend for a few days. From there we went to Kuala Lumpur. We didn't really spend much time in Kuala Lumpur. We had spent a week in Singapore and were pretty tired of cities. so we only spent I believe two or three days in Kuala Lumpur, just visits from shopping malls, the KLCC, the Petronas Towers, and yeah, that's basically what we did in KL, and then we went to the Cameron Highlands, and if you like hiking, the Cameron Highlands is a great place for you. I don't know, they might have 16, 17 different marked trails. There's a whole lot of unmarked trails. We spent a month there. I think I only went on only six hikes maybe during that month but once again we were being lazy, and yeah, if you're an avid hiker then you're certainly going to enjoy the Cameron Highlands.\n\t\t\t            \nTodd: Yeah, actually, I did the hike in the Cameron Highland once, and foolishly I started my hike at about 4 o'clock and I thought I could make the loop of the trail at the time, and the sun started to go down, and I was in the jungle, and I was worried about getting back, and I just made it back, but I was pretty scared for awhile.\n\t\t\t            Phil: You were lucky. Some people don't make it back. \n\t\t\t            Todd: Really? \n\t\t                Phil: Well, Jim Thompson.

I think he was maybe based in Hong Kong, but I'm not sure. Maybe it was based in Malaysia. He went hiking. I believe it was 1967, in the Cameron Highlands, and no one has seen him since. He's just vanished from the face of the earth. So, be careful if you go hiking there. Watch your step.",

But either way, they're doing it, so I think it would be really neat, I mean I've always wanted to say to my, you know, one day my kids, \"Ok, let's go to vacation on the moon...I feel like going out to the suite hotel you know.Let's go look at the stars\" you know a few meteors passing by, wouldn't that be neat..to say that and really be able to do that someday.\n                        Todd: Gosh, it must be really, really beautiful on the moon.

How about that?\n\t                    Roe: OK. That was right after graduating university. I became a salesman. \n\t                    Todd: Oooh, salesman! Nice. \n                        Roe: Yep, salesman. \n                        Todd: What were you selling?\n                        Roe: I was selling nothing. \n                        Todd: Nothing\n                        Roe: Nothing. Well, basically I was selling a membership. So, that's, it's not something people can see or visualize, but it's like just membership, so. \n                        Todd: Was it like a membership to a country club? \n                        Roe: Yeah, actually a private resorts and golf clubs.\n                        Todd: Nice. Was this in Japan or in the US?\n                        Roe: In Japan. \n                        Todd: Wow. What was the best thing about your job? \n                        Roe: Troubles! Cause I have to knock on people's houses.\n                        Todd: Oh, wow, it was door to door \n                        Roe: Exactly without any appointments and membership costs 5 million yen. Starting, starting costs. \n                        Todd: 5 million yen to start and you must have been in very rich neighborhoods. \n                        Roe: No, actually we just go to any areas. We just stop off at a station and we start from there.\n                        Todd: Really. Were you successful? \n                        Roe: It's a long story but to be honest with you, how many memberships do you think I sold in a year? \n                        Todd: Wow, I don't know. I will take a guess. In one year, maybe one, two a week, so my guess is, I don't know, a hundred. \n                        Roe: One! \n                        Todd: One! One! \n                        Roe: Can you believe it! \n                        Todd: So you must, so you remember the lucky person? Probably still remember that person\n                        Roe: And you know what, the person who bought my membership, is who? My father. \n                        Todd: Ooh, that's a tough job. \n                        Roe: It was rough, really. It was really rough. \n                        Todd: That's a lot of rejection, every day. No, no, no \n                        Roe: I know, I mean if you think about it, that's natural though, I mean 5 million yen. and I can't really show the place, cause I can't take the person to the place. all I can do is show the picture and speak and that was right after the bubble economy bursted, so nobody had really, nobody had money, so. \n                        Todd: Wow, man so were you depressed? Were you sad?\n                        Roe: It was very interesting. It was hard to motivate myself. The people would call the police, and call me like a robber Yeah, yeah, cause I had to like open the gate and run to the door and stick my leg so that they won't shut the door. \n                        Todd: Seriously\n                        Roe: Yeah, that's how you do it. Door to door sells. \n                        Todd: Wow, that's, that's a tough job. I don't think I could do a job, what's your job now? What do you do now? \n                        Roe: I am, I work for Yokohama city and I am in a place called Yokohama Convention Bureau. It's a city job. \n                        Todd: OK, so the Yokohama Convention Bureau.  OK, so you deal with foreigners, naturally cause it's in English. \n                        Roe: And travellers and visitors and what have you.\n                        Todd: Do you like your job now? \n                        Roe: Interesting! Like I said I meet talk to about over 2,000 people a day, so it's kind of tiring though. \n                        Todd: Wow, 2,000 people a day. \n                        Roe: About 200 people an hour. My office is at the station. Yokohama station. Right out of the gate of the JR, so people are going to stop by. \n                        Todd: You, that's a lot of talking. You must be tired of talking. \n                        Roe: I am tired.",

Does the meat have to\n                                go on a tortilla or something? \nAnna: Yeah, on the tortilla. \nTodd: Oh, OK. \nAnna: And you can add on top. \nTodd: OK, what kind of\n                                tortillas do you use, flour or corn? \nAnna: I like corn, but my\n                                husband John, he likes flour.

        "transcript": "Hi! I've lived in Spain and Japan and so I'm just\n                                going to talk about a few differences between the\n                                two countries that I've found. In Spain, when you\n                                meet somebody you give them two kisses, first on\n                                the left and then on the right cheek, and in Japan\n                                there is definitely no public kissing at all, so\n                                that is definitely a faux pas, here. In Japan you\n                                just bow or you hand shake which is normal. \nIn Spain, also the people are very caliente,\n                                which means they are very warm and very open and extremely loud, extremely loud. In fact, when I\n                                was living in my host family's house, the first\n                                few months when my Spanish wasn't the best, I\n                                thought my host mom was mad about everything. I\n                                thought she was just ... I thought she was at the\n                                  point of just leaving the entire household for\n                                    good, and then when I realized what she was\n                                saying, it was just like, \"When are you going to\n                                take out the dog?\" but screaming this mind you, or\n                                \"Let's do your homework!\" or even just like, \"Pass\n                                me the salt!\" Everything was screaming. Japan\n                                people are very quiet. They definitely don't\n                                scream about things like that.\n\nThe food - Spanish food is the best in the world.\n                                I really like Japanese food, but Spanish food -\n                                they use a lot of olive oil, a lot of beans, a lot\n                                of vegetables and fruit. It's a Mediterranean diet\n                                and lots of fish but it's heavier food. In Japan\n                                they also eat a lot of fish, but it's lighter and\n                                rice and seaweed, but Spanish food is the best.\n                                The best in the world, definitely.",

        "transcript": "One of the things that I really like about Japan is Japan has a really good train system. I take the train to work every morning and I take the train home every night. I like the trains because on the trains I can do what I want to do. I can read a book, read the newspaper, listen to music, study Japanese. It's really nice. I see my time on the train as my free-time, to do things that I like to do. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      Also, the train saves me a lot of money. In Japan it's quite common for companies to pay for their employees train ticket, so I don't have to pay for commuting to work. And because I get to take the train every day, I don't need a car so I don't have to, for example pay, for gas, car registration, car maintenance, things like that. Also, I don't have to waste time for parking.  The worst thing about the trains is that they're very crowded - very, very crowded, and sometimes it's hard to get a seat so you have to stand for a long time, and sometimes it smells a bit, but overall I like the trains and I'm really, really fortunate that Japan has such a good system.",
