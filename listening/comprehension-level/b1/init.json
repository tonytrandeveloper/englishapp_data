All you do is you buy some meat like ground beef, or ground turkey, and you cook it in a skillet until it's finished. You can add some chopped\n                                onion, or any spices, like cumin or chili powder\n                                and then you just serve the meat on tortillas or taco shell with cheese, tomato, lettuce, onion,\n                                guacamole, or anything. They're delicious. \nTodd: Sounds pretty good. So\n                                what do you put the meat in? Does the meat have to\n                                go on a tortilla or something? \nAnna: Yeah, on the tortilla. \nTodd: Oh, OK. \nAnna: And you can add on top. \nTodd: OK, what kind of\n                                tortillas do you use, flour or corn? \nAnna: I like corn, but my\n                                husband John, he likes flour.

It's\n                                like too hot. Like if I eat a piece of chocolate, I need\n                                to drink a lot of water. \nKatie: Wow. \nGilda: It feels – I don't like it. Yeah. \nKatie: I will gladly eat all your chocolate. If\n                                you have chocolate you don't want, I'm here. \nGilda: Yeah. It's weird because when, you know,\n                                chocolate is very popular as a gift. Somebody is always\n                                giving you chocolate and I take it because I don't want\n                                to say to everybody like, \"I hate chocolate actually.\"\n                                But yeah, what about you? What's something you don't\n                                really like? \nKatie: Well, I have something I don't like that\n                                I think is really popular. And every time I say I don't\n                                like it, I always get the same like, \"What?\" kind of\n                                reaction, but I don't like ice cream. \nGilda: What? \nKatie: I don't like ice cream. I don't think\n                                food should be that cold. I don't like it. Food\n                                shouldn't be too cold to eat. \nGilda: Really?\nKatie: It's just not…\nGilda: You don't know what you're missing. Ice\n                                creams are really, really good especially in summer. \nKatie: Chocolate is really good. Chocolate, I'll take chocolate over ice cream any day.\nGilda: Well, you can try chocolate ice cream. \nKatie: Oh, chocolate ice cream is the worst.\n                                Chocolate ice cream is the worst. No, thank you. \nGilda: What about a second one? Do you have any\n                                second food that you don't like? \nKatie: I don't like tomatoes. Which is strange because I eat lots of\n                                pasta with tomato-flavored stuff in it. But just\n                                tomatoes by themselves is not something I enjoy.\n                                Whenever I have like a hamburger with a tomato, I always\n                                have to take it out and give it to someone else. Just, I\n                                don't like it. It's just juicy and not in a good juicy way. \nGilda: I don't like garlic. \nKatie: You don't like garlic? \nGilda: I like garlic in food but I don't like to\n                                see it or eat it and have this, the taste of garlic, I\n                                don't like it. \nKatie: Once you've got the taste of garlic, you\n                                don't get rid of that for about three days. \nGilda: Exactly. That's another thing. Yeah. So\n                                when my mom is cooking and using garlic, she ... after that,\n                                she had to remove it. She cannot leave any evidence that\n                                she was using garlic in her food. Yes. \nKatie: Is there another food that you don't\n                                like? \nGilda: I would say sprouts, Brussel sprouts. \nKatie: Yeah. No one likes sprouts. \nGilda: Yes. It's bitter and even though some\n                                people say it's good for your body, I don't like them. \nKatie: I think, yeah, sprouts are just universally hated. No one like sprouts. \nGilda: Yeah. But when you are a child, your\n                                parents, for some reason always giving you that.\nKatie: Yeah. Cruel.\nGilda: Yeah. I don't like it. It looks like – I feel like a cow eating those things. Yeah. \nKatie: Yeah. I can imagine. It's just—ugh!\nGilda: What about you? Any other? \nKatie: I have one more but it's really strange.\n                                I've never actually eaten them but looking at them makes\n                                me really uncomfortable, and that's olives. I hate\n                                olives. \nGilda: No. I love them. \nKatie: I can't stand olives. Just looking at\n                                them makes me want to scream.\nGilda: Really?\nKatie: Like I think it's the hole. I don't like\n                                the hole in olives. I'm like scared of olives. It's\n                                really strange, but no. \nGilda: I like them. \nKatie: You can have my olives.\nGilda: Very tasty green, black.\nKatie: No. If I see them in a jar at the\n                                supermarket—\nGilda: Better than chocolate. \nKatie: Just no. No. No, no, no. I don't like\n                                them. Scared of olives. It's the craziest thing ever but\n                                no. I don't like olives. Keep them away from me. \nGilda: Good.",

So how long did you last at this job?\n                        Lois: I worked all together I think in three different shoe shops, so the first one I worked in for a year and then that one closed down, so then they moved me to another one, the same company, and then from that one I moved to another one , but then I had to leave my job when I had to do my exams at school cause I needed to study.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Tres, you said when you were younger, you took many family car trips. Tres: Oh yes. You can say I grew up in the car. We’d take road trips from Oklahoma (state of Oklahoma) to say Florida or Georgia, Mississippi. We’d even drive up north to New York, and I’ve taken road trips to Colorado, and Seattle Washington. Inside the car, when I’m with my brothers and sisters, sometimes we’d fight but most of the time we’d play various games. For example we’d count the license plates.Todd: So license plates are the, like I.D. on the back of a car.Tres: Right. I.D. on the back of a car, and depending on the state, the license plate changes. So we try to see, how many states we can count. And who every got the most states by the end of the trip of course would win. We’d do other things, for example, my parents always made sure that we visited historical sites to learn about the local culture of the area. And we’d also try the local foods that existed. So whenever we’d drive to the south, for example, if we drove through Louisiana, we’d try Cajun food. Which is full of gumbo (which is another word for okra), and rice, and Cray fish (which is sort of like a lobster).Todd: Sounds good. It’s spicy?Tres: Oh yea it’s very spicy. Very very spicy. So we had a lot of fun times in the car. Todd: So did you have some bad times in the car? Did you fight with your brothers and your sisters?Tres: Occasionally we would fight. I was the youngest of three, so I always lost. So it was very hard. And I had the middle seat. So if my older brother fought with my older sister, then I was stuck in the centre. Todd: Not fun.Tres: Not fun at all. But we hardly every fought and I would say the road trips were a lot of fun.Todd: Yeah. I took a lot of road trips with my family I remember them very fondly.",

        "transcript": "John: So we've been talking about women's roles in society. And are you a stay-at-home mom or a working mom?\nSarah: Well, I guess I'm both. Right now, I'm on maternity leave and I'm on month six of maternity leave. \nJohn: What does that mean?\nSarah: So maternity leave is when you have a job but then you become pregnant or you're going to have a baby, maybe adopt, too. So you're going to have a baby, and so you take time off of work to stay home with the new baby. \nJohn: Oh, I see. Do you still get paid?\nSarah: I do. I get about half of my wage. So I do still get paid and I'm very grateful for that. So I've been at home with the new baby for six months. And I'm going to go back to work next month. \nJohn: Oh. What will happen with the baby? \nSarah: So I have two kids actually. I have a toddler and a baby. And both of them will go to daycare during the day. \nJohn: I see. \nSarah: So I signed up for the daycare before the baby was even born. It's really hard to find good daycare that you can afford, that's near your house. So you have to start planning before the baby is even born if you're the type of person who wants to go back to work. \nJohn: I see. I don't think many men worry about getting good daycare for their children…\nSarah: No.\nJohn: When they think about their jobs. \nSarah: No. Even when there's a family, and the mother and father both work, still it's the mother that has to do everything with the kids, usually. Usually, the mom has to for example, get the bag ready for the kids to take to daycare. They have to arrange the daycare. They have – the daycare has the mother's phone number, usually. \nAnd so, the mom has to do a lot of extra work even though mom and dad both have full time jobs.\nJohn: I see. Are you saying that things should be different?\nSarah: Yes. I think things should be different. I'm so lucky my husband agrees with me. And my husband, he drops the kids off at daycare and he picks them up and he does the laundry and the dishes. And it helps me to be – and it helps me focus on my career so that I can stay late at work if I need to. I can go to an extra meeting on a weekend. And it makes me feel more fulfilled that it's not my husband's job that comes first. \nA lot of times women make less money than men and they put their job second to their husband. And it's not equal, and it's not fair. And so, I think that people should work on making things more equal.\nJohn: Well, I agree with you. \nSarah: Thank you.",

What should I do for my chest and shoulders? Mike: Well, the first basic chest work-out is the bench press, where you use the straight bar, and you should probably do three sets, if you're starting out: three sets, doing ten reps each set. Todd: OK, three sets would mean I do it three times with rest in between, correct?Mike: Yes.Todd: And how much time should I rest between each set?Mike: Maybe a minute-and-half, two minutes.Todd: OK, and then when I do each set, so you say I do ten reps, that means I lift the weights ten times?Mike: Yes.Todd: OK, and I should do heavy enough weight that I can only do it ten?Mike: Yeah, you should lift weight that is heavy enough to where you can only do it ten times.Todd: OK, so, that's gonna build my chest and my shoulders?Mike: That will build your chest.Todd: OK and then what about my shoulders? What can I do for my shoulders?Mike: Well, a good one is the military press which, there's usually good machines for that, where you sit down and you just press the bar above your head.Todd: OK, so you think it's better that I do this on a machine than free weights?Mike: Yeah, if you're just starting out, I think you should do it on a machine. It's probably safer. You can get the motion down and then it puts less strain on your back.Todd: OK, and when I do this, again I should do it about ten reps?Mike: Yeah, about the same.Todd: OK, now when I lift should I do it like really quick and fast or like slow?Mike: You should bring weight down slow and explode up.Todd: Oh, so I lower the bar slowly and then push up as quick as possible?Mike: Yeah, and you do that ten times.Todd: OK, so we've got my chest workout, we've got my shoulder work-out. What about my arms? I want big arms, Mike. I want guns.Mike: Well, for arms, there's a lot of good exercises, usually for your biceps, the basic would be dumbbell curl, or straight bar curl, which you use the large straight bar, so you just stand and hold the bar in front of you, and just bring it up towards your chest.Todd: OK. Is there any dos and don'ts about lifting the bar, like things I should be careful of?Mike: Just make sure that your back is straight and that your stomach muscles are tight so that it keeps you solid.Todd: So, I need to keep my torso, my chest, very straight and not move to much?Mike: Yes. Yes.Todd: OK and the same as before: ten reps?Mike: Yep, that's the same as well.Todd: OK, so do the curls. Alright. I'm set. I hope I'm gonna get pumped, MIke.",

I think I used to make the most of my free time, well in fact I didn't make the most of my free time. I was a very lazy person. I was an incredible time waster, so I would have all of this free time to make use of and I would probably just sit in front of the TV, or I'd probably go to a pub and drink, but anyway I took my time for granted. I thought I have this time. It wasn't such a precious thing for me. I had so much of it.\n\t\t\t\t                Once I became a father, suddenly my time disappeared but strangely enough, now that I've become a father and I've, it's taught me to appreciate the time I have. My time is now very limited. My work has become busier but I actually make much more use of my time now than when I did so much of it. It's kind of strange.\nTodd: And how many children do you have?\nSteven: Ah, two. BOys, \nTodd: Oh, two boys. \nSteven: Yep, they're both still very young. They keep us very busy. The eldest is four and the youngest is three.\n\nTodd: Wow!\nSteven: So they need, they still need quite a lot of attention.\nTodd: Yeah, so when you first have kids do you lose a lot of sleep? I'm always worried that I won't be able to sleep. \nSteven: Well, something that carried over from my previous lifestyle was an ability to sleep very well, and, um, fortunately I have a very understanding wife so if the children woke up, yeah, well because I had to work my wife was, my wife tended to be responsible. She would look after the children if they woke up during the evening, during the night, sorry, and I'm such a good sleeper that even if they were crying incredibly loudly I could just go back to sleep. I don't think there are many fathers like me. I've spoken to some other fathers and they don't have the same talent as I do. \nTodd: Oh, well, thanks Steven.",

Not always the job that you want is available but ultimately it's , you know, it's a pretty good place.\n                        Todd: OK.

It's much better for me.\nTodd: Right, so like if you're swimming, you can increase your time.\nSanti:Yes. That's true.\nTodd: What about yoga?\nSanti: I yoga just for relaxing and just release my stress.\nTodd: See, I love team sports, you know, there's something about team sports. It's so fun. Like you have camaraderie. You have friendship, you know, like you share the thrill of victory or you share, you know, when you lose, the pain of the loss. I just love that. When you do something individually, you just don't have that.\nSanti:Yes, sometimes, it's true ... your opinion about that, but in my opinion, I think when I do sports, I'm very competitive, so if I get into a group, that is full of my friends, sometimes when we got lost, sometimes I feel angry.\nTodd: You want to put the blame on your friends?\nSanti: Sometimes I put the blame on mine, if it is my fault, but sometimes, yeah, it's just like not going so well at the end.\nTodd: Right. That's true. That is true. I kind of see your point.\nSanti: And I feel disappointed in them sometimes, so I'm not very good at teamwork when doing sports.",

Now a lot of people think that is might just be really easy to make, but let me tell you, mine is the top of the top. It's, I can make a mean spaghetti. So first, I take and I cut up garlic. Garlic is essential. As much garlic as you can possibly stand to cut, and then I cut some onion and put that all together, and fry it with olive oil. Then basically after that point, it kind of varies. It just depends on whatever vegetables I have around. Usually I put in like green peppers, definitely mushrooms. Mushrooms are a must. Um, let's see, and then basically it depends on the time of the year, so if it's summer I'll just put in like squash and, so I saute all the vegetables up, and get them to the point where they are just right and then I put oregano in hopefully, hopefully, the best is if it's fresh but, you know, you can't have it all so, you put in oregano, and then from there, I put in, and I hope my dad's not listening because he'll never eat it after this point, but I put in tofu ground beef, so you can't really taste it, um, I mean you can taste it. It tastes like beef, but nobody knows that it's tofu, just because I don't particularly like raw meat, so Tofu I think is the way to go, so then, um, so I put that in there, and you don't really have to cook it, you just warm it up, so I just cook it all together, warm it all together. And then I put in some fresh tomatoes, and then I usually use like a half a can of whatever tomato sauce is on sale, whatever pasta sauce, and then again a little more oregano, and just let it simmer to absorb all the flavor. That's it.",

I have a\n                                three-year old and a one-year old. \nJohn: Are they ever naughty when you're out in\n                                public? \nSarah: Yes. They are naughty out in public. And\n                                I think that you shouldn't discipline your children in\n                                front of other people. So if I'm out in public and my\n                                three-year old starts to be naughty and she's crying\n                                because she wants a toy from the store or something, I\n                                will pick her up and I take her somewhere quiet until\n                                she's calm. Like I might take her to the family bathroom\n                                or a quiet hallway, so she can stop crying and stop\n                                making noise. \nJohn: I see. So you wouldn't just give her the\n                                toy she wants. \nSarah: No. I don't think you should do that sort of\n                                thing to make your child be quiet, just give them\n                                something until they are quiet because then they'll be\n                                bad more in the future. If they know they can cry and\n                                scream, and mom and dad will give them what they want,\n                                they'll just be worse and worse. \nJohn: Oh, I see. They'll learn that it's okay.\n                                They can get what they want by crying. \nSarah: Yeah. \nJohn: But don't you think you'll – won't you\n                                lose more time if you have to take your kids to some\n                                quiet place to calm down? \nSarah: Yeah. You lose time but I think it's\n                                worth it because I think of the future and the time I'll\n                                save by making sure that my child is better behaved in\n                                the future. And the other thing too is I'm always trying\n                                to think about other people. So I don't want other\n                                people to have to listen to my child scream and cry. And\n                                I also don't want them to see me talking sternly to her\n                                because they'll maybe be annoyed or feel uncomfortable.\n                                And maybe my child will scream more because she can feel\n                                that. So I try to go somewhere quiet. \nJohn: Oh, I see. \nSarah: Sometimes that's impossible though.\n                                Sometimes, if you're on the plane or on a train, you\n                                can't go anywhere or do anything. You have to stay in\n                                your seat. \nJohn: What if you're on an airplane, then do you\n                                give your child whatever they are crying for as soon as\n                                possible? \nSarah: Yes, I do. I try to plan ahead and I\n                                think, okay, I need to have enough toys. I need to have\n                                lots of snacks, lots of fun things so that I prevent\n                                them from becoming naughty or crying or screaming. But\n                                sometimes, you can't help it. And if you're child or\n                                baby starts to be loud at that point, I will. I'll give\n                                them candy or food or toy, whatever they want. \nJohn: Oh, I get it. So I think you're saying,\n                                you think there might be a different reason why kids\n                                become naughty. Besides what they want…\nSarah: Yeah. \nJohn: For example, they're hungry or bored. \nSarah: Yeah. I think a lot of the times,\n                                children are naughty because maybe they're tired or\n                                they're hungry, or they want to play and stretch their\n                                legs but they can't because they're on the plane or\n                                they're in a stroller at the shopping mall. \nJohn: So instead of waiting for bad behavior and\n                                then doing some discipline like yelling at your kids or\n                                grabbing their arms, maybe it's better to prevent bad\n                                behavior by making sure the kids sleep enough and don't\n                                get bored. \nSarah: Yeah. That's what I'm saying. And, you\n                                know, my kids are young. Just three and one. So a\n                                one-year old can't really be naughty. They're just a\n                                baby. So if they need something, I give them food or\n                                what they need. But a three-year old, they can throw a tantrum. And so, they can be very naughty. \nJohn: A tantrum? \nSarah: Yeah. When they scream and maybe they\n                                fall down on the floor, and they kick their legs.\n                                Sometimes they try to hit you. It's really bad. But I\n                                think all two-and-three-year-old children sometimes they\n                                do them. \nJohn: Oh, I've heard of that. It's called the Terrible Two's. \nSarah: Yes. But it also lasts into three. \nJohn: Well, it sounds like you're a good parent. \nSarah: Oh, I try.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Lois, I noticed that you have a poster of David Beckham by your desk.\nLois: Yes, I do. I think that David Beckham is quite a handsome man. I also think that he is a very, very talented footballer. Although, his recent performance in Euro 2004 was maybe not quite what it should have been. He did miss two penalties but I think in the past he has been a very good role model for people in England and a very good footballer. \nTodd: So what is it about David Beckham that everyone thinks is handsome?\nLois: Everything about him is perfect. He's got a lovely body, great hair, when he has hair and then when he doesn't have hair, he has a great shaped head. The only thing I don't really like about his body is his tattoos. He's just had a new tattoo on the back of his neck and I think it is a cross with some angel's wings on it and I don't think that is very nice but apart from that I would say that he is perfect. \nTodd: Well, what color are his eyes? \nLois: I have no idea what color his eyes are. No, I'm guessing brown but I don't know. \nTodd: OK and how tall is he? \nLois: How tall is he? Taller than me but I don't know how tall he is either. \nTodd: No details, details. So do you think David Beckham is a better football player or a better model?\nLois: Ugh, Tricky. Possibly at the moment a better model and maybe he should spend less time concentrating on that and more time on his football. \nTodd: Well, how old is he now? \nLois: I think he's about 29. Yeah, because his wife just turned 30 a couple of months ago and he's one year younger, so he's 29. \nTodd: Does he have any children? \nLois: He has two children. I don't know how old they are. One is called Brooklyn and the other one is called Romeo, not really sure where they got their names from but yeah, two young children.",

What do you think about that?\n\t\t\t            Ebony: OK, about people on the moon, I think it's really cool! I say that as a natural reaction, but I know they've tried it before. I think it would be maybe a good idea economically, but then again not. \n\t\t\t            Todd: Sure\n\t\t                Ebony: I mean, because first of all, how are we finacially in the US? What are they doing? I think they are trying to pick up spirits or distract right now with all the other underlying issues!\n\t\t                Todd: Yeah!\n\t                    Ebony: Honestly, when I heard that, I was like, is this some kind of propoganda, some kind of billboard distraction in my opinion, I mean, it's an awesome idea though if you really think behind it, but I don't know if that's what we should be looking at right now.\n\t                    Todd: Sure, so do you think it is a waste of money or do you think it helps science?\n                        Ebony: I think eventually it's a great thing, and it does help, and I think it's a wonderful thing to be paying attention to, but I don't know whether it's the right moment for it. But either way, they're doing it, so I think it would be really neat, I mean I've always wanted to say to my, you know, one day my kids, \"Ok, let's go to vacation on the moon...I feel like going out to the suite hotel you know.Let's go look at the stars\" you know a few meteors passing by, wouldn't that be neat..to say that and really be able to do that someday.\n                        Todd: Gosh, it must be really, really beautiful on the moon. Well, actually, you are very young. I think 20! 20 years old?\n                        Ebony: Yes.\n                        Todd: So, do you think that is going to be possible, that...\n                        Ebony: Yeah! Yeah!\n                        Todd: Really?\n                        Ebony: Since I was 10. Since I was 10 years old my father would always say to me, you know, he's about 62 right now, and so, he said, I've seen everybody go from cars to everything and all the advances in technology is so fast, he said, 'I can't imagine when your are my agewhat's it's going to be like for you at the rate technology is advancing.\n                        Todd: Yeah!\n                        Ebony: So I thought, \"Wow, that's really cool!\" I'll be able to do that and I always did. I always thought that and so, in a way too I'm saying, \"What took you so long guys?\"\n                        Todd: Wow, so that's amazing. You could actually be going for vacation to the moon in forty years\n                        Ebony: Wouldn't that not be cool! \n                        Todd: Yeah!\n                        Ebony: Just sit there.\n                        Todd: Or Mars.\n                        Ebony: Mars. \n                        Todd: Yeah! Lot of rocks.\n                        Ebony: The red planet. I don't know about mars. I think the moon sounds kind of cooler not as far.\n                        Todd: Yeah!\n                        Ebony: It depends on what they do with travel.\n                        Todd: Yeah. You definitely would need a round-trip ticket.\n                        Ebony: OK, thanks a lot Ebony",

Ikebana...tea ceremony! \nAnili: Tea ceremony?\nReiko: Tea ceremony! \nAnili: Tea ceremony. Tell me about tea ceremony. \nReiko: Tea ceremony. There's certain ways you have to make tea. Not only make tea, there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl.\nAnili: I see. \nReiko: Yes, with one piece of cloth and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that  you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl.\nAnili: OK.\nReiko: Yeah, so it's a complicated traditional procedure in a sense but..\nAnili: How do you learn that? Is that something that your mother would teach you?\n                          How do people learn that? \nReiko: There's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony. So you need to go to a school, yes, and learn from your teacher and their heirarchy and the organization. You need to pass each test to go climb up the ladder in the heirarchy. \nAnili: I see. Fantastic. Thank you.\nReiko: You're welcome.",

Have you ever actually ever lived on a farm?\nMonica: I haven't lived on a farm as such, but I've visited family friends who have lived on farms.\nTodd: Did you like it?Monica: Yeah, I remember loving visiting my family friends on farms. Yeah, especially riding horses. I loved riding horses when I was young.Todd: So are you good? Are you an equestrian professional?Monica: I wouldn't say that. I do remember one time. My mother always seems to tell people this story about when I was young, and we were at her friend's farm. I was on a horse, and the horse took off, and I was only about, I think ten at the time and I was hanging off the side of this horse and my mother was really worried for me, and then when the horse finally stopped she ... you know ... she came running up and asked me if I was OK and things, and apparently I said to her, \"Oh, it's OK. I wanted it to go fast.\"Todd: That's cute. You're lucky you didn't get hurt though.Monica: Yeah, well, I guess I just didn't sense the danger.Todd: Actually, I kind of grew up on a farm. My grandfather had a ranch growing up so I spend every summer on his ranch, so I have quite the ... I don't know ... I guess I have a lot of experience on a farm. Yeah, it's good. I remember when I was young I thought the life on a farm was just the best. I mean I had it so good, and I loved everything about living on a farm and I thought when I was gonna get older, I would want to be on a farm, but now that I'm older, I couldn't image doing it every again.Monica: What can't you imagine doing?Todd: I don't know, I guess, I just couldn't imagine all that work, and I think I'm just so addicted to city life or suburban life and living in a house and just doing work on computers and things like that. I couldn't go back to that lifestyle, but when I was young, I have to admit, I enjoyed it a lot. So how about you? Could you see yourself moving and living on a farm?Monica: Well, yeah, I think my thoughts are similar to yours in that I'm very used to being inside using a computer, and I'm used to a very different lifestyle to one that involves being on a farm, but yeah, I've never had a long period of time where I've stayed on a farm like you so yeah maybe it's a bit different for me.",

Me, too.What's your favorite episode of the old series?\n\t                    Simon: Of course, that would have to be number two, The Empire Strikes Back.\n                        Lesie: Really, mine is the original Star Wars.\n                        Simon: Oh, really! Why do you like it so much? Why is it the best?\n                        Lesie:  I think it's the best because the characters are really, really different. In the second and third one they're kind of, they begin to mellow, but in the first one, they're really different.\n                        Simon: Oh, you mean that each character is distinct from the other characters.\n                        Lesie: Right!\n                        Simon: Yeah, I like the second one better because it's a little bit darker and cooler and the bad guy, Darth Vader, of course one of the most famous bad guys in movie history, plays a bigger part and you know there's the drama and plus the, you know, the fighting, and the space scenes are all a little bit better and cooler. \n                        Lesie: I see.

Do you know why? \n                        Simon: Well, I'm sure you'll tell me.\n                        Lesie: Well, because she was the first positive strong female character I saw in the movies. She was take charge, told everybody what to do.\n                        Simon: Well, she was popular with both girls and boys.\n                        Lesie: Right! Hey, did you have any Star Wars toys when you were a kid?\n                        Simon: Yeah, of course, I had the Luke Skywalker action figure.\n                        Lesie: Oh, I see.\n                        Simon: How about you?\n                        Lesie: Ah, I can't remember.

How is Mexico City in terms of real estate, landscape?Katia: Well, Mexico City is one of the biggest cities in the world and it's in a valley, so it actually had to stop growing even though it has a big population, but basically there was no room. It was surrounded by mountains so the actual structure of the city is not very well designed but however we can all fit there and somewhat live comfortably.Enam: What about the people there?Katia: What do you mean, what about the people?Enam: Like how are they? Are they cordial enough? Katia: Well, I think in every big city there's always a tendency to have some kind of survival skills. When there's a lot of people, you have to make sure you're the first one to get in the bus, the first one in line, so there's a little bit of that feeling. However, everybody's, most everyone is kind and they will be helpful, so there's all kinds of people. It's a big city so it's very hard to say.Enam: Really, tell me about the transportation system?Katia: Transportation system? Well, we have a Metro. We have bus, taxis, but it is quite bad. It's too many people in a small space, so yes you can get around but it's better to live close to your work and just move in one particular area otherwise it will take you a long, long time to get from one place to another.Enam: Really, that's common like to our place. And do you enjoy shopping in Mexico City?Katia: Ah, shopping! There's a lot of shopping in Mexico City, especially for the last few years. Big Malls have been constructed and especially the young generation like shopping and inside the shopping malls there's always movie theaters, so shopping is very, very popular in Mexico City.Enam: Really. Do you go to theaters more often, like in Mexico City? Katia: Actually, it's a part of the culture. Every weekend, movie theater, or a theater ... you go to a theater to watch a show so it's very common. That's part of the culture of the Mexicans in Mexico City. There's always things to see.Enam: Is there any difference between the food you eat in Mexico City like commonly, and the food you like outside the city?Katia: Well, definitely yes. Mexico City is so big, and the people that live in Mexico City came from the rural areas or other cities from Mexico City so in regards to food, variety is wide. There's many things ... that I go back to Mexico City and there's always something new that I haven't tried, so it's very interesting the food, and it also ... we have food that backs to the Mayas or the Aztecs time that Mexicans have been able to keep it and we still eat it.",

        "transcript": "Tom: Jess, you were talking before about getting your hair done.\nJess: Every month, I have my hair done. Well, every four to six weeks I have my hair done. I have highlights which is one color. They take small strands of the hair and color that so overall it looks like it's more sunkissed, like it's bleached in the sun. But then I also get a low-light put through it, which is less harmful to the hair and gives more volume to the color if you have two colors, and that takes a long time to do. They wrap the hair they're going to color in foil and it takes about half an hour for it to take effect and during that time they put a big ... I don't know how to describe it really. It's like a big helmut which releases hot air onto your hair, which speed up the process of the coloring, so it's quite long and drawn out. I usually get through two or three magazines while that's happening. And then they wash out all of the color, and I have a treatment to protect the hair because the color often makes it dry, so the colors kinds of ... the treatments nourishing and moisturizing and they leave that on for about twenty minutes again so usually I fall asleep at that point, and then they'll rinse your hair and then cut it and style it so anything between two and a half and four hours, so much more complex and longer than you're half-an-hour short-back and sides. \nYeah, I have a whole monthly beauty regime. I also go and get my nails done and I have a manicure and a pedicure simultaneously to save time. And I love that. It always feels decedent to have one person working on your hands and another scrubbing away at your feet, and sometimes I'll have like a matching polish which always makes me feel good. What else do I have done every month? I try to go for a massage and a facial once a month. At the moment, I'm doing like a workout regime so I'm working out every day, so my muscles are aching a lot, especially when I stand up and sit down, so I'm going for special ... what's the word ... ayurvedic. I'm not sure what the right word is: special massage where they really push down on your muscles and then I have a facial afterwards. Yeah, I think that's about it. I think that's enough, no!Tom: Well, I don't envy all that time you spend! But you do look great.",

So it would be the Sunday after March 23rd. \nEaster is a Christian holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That means the rebirth of Jesus Christ, when he was born again after his death. If you ask children, however, what Easter is all about, they will say that it is about Easter eggs and the Easter bunny. It’s interesting this tradition comes from a non-Christian source. \nA long time ago when non-Christians would celebrate the springtime, there is a story of a bird who had a broken wing and a magician turned him into a rabbit so he would be able to survive the winter better. And this rabbit was still able to lay eggs like a bird. So now they celebrate the Easter Bunny during springtime and we—children paint eggs and adults hide them and the children have to go find the eggs and put them in their Easter basket.",

I've been playing for many, many years since I was a little girl and everyone in my family plays an instrument so it's part of what we do together as a family. \nTodd: So when you were little you practiced every day?\nAdrienne: I did. My mom made me. I didn't have a choice. It's good for discipline though, or at least that's what she told me. \nTodd: So, how would you practice? Did you have a tutor come over to your house?\nAdrienne: No, I had a violin teacher once a week and when I was really small I went to group lessons also, so it was once a week with a private and once a week with a group. \nTodd: Wow! That's a lot. What did you think about the violin when you were little?\nAdrienne: I don't remember thinking about it. I don't even remember learning how to play. I was only two so (so young) I know. I was still in diapers, but my mom said that when I had my first recital that I really wanted to play in the recital and she said I absolutely could not play on stage in a diaper so that's basically how she got me out of my diapers. So she says!\nTodd: When did you stop playing?\nAdrienne: I haven't stopped.\nTodd: Oh, you still practice.\nAdrienne: I still play although I don't have my violin here in Japan, right now. I'm kind of on a break I guess. I just don't like to carry it around overseas.\nTodd: Is it hard to be away from your violin?\nAdrienne: It is sometimes. I miss it. I miss playing with my family too, cause we're kind of like the Van Trap family, which you know from the movie The Sound of Music.\nTodd: No, no, I don't. I've never seen the movie. \nAdrienne: Oh, you haven't? The Sound of Music is about a family in, I think it's Austria and they all play an instrument or sing and it's a World War II movie and that's how they escape the Nazis, from singing or something. It's kind of like that, except for without the war.\nTodd: Well, I have to see the movie so!\nAdrienne: Yeah, you should. \nTodd: So are you going to play the violin for me sometime?\nAdrienne: Sure! If you can find a violin I will.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, how was your trip to Thailand?\nGloria: Oh, I spent about six weeks in Thailand and had a really, really great time. I spent three weeks in Northern Thailand and then three weeks on the beach in the southern part of Thailand but my last night I was packing up and I had a suitcase in the corner with the warm clothes from Northern Thailand and I saw something dark in the corner and I'm thinking,\" Oh, it's just some clothes that fell out of my suitcase so I reached out to grab the clothes and something dark rose up and spread out and it was the weirdest feeling because at the same time I felt like a hand grab me from behind and yanked me out of the cabin and I didn't feel any fear until I was in the middle of the clearing and I screamed twice and got everybody's attention, \"What? What? What?\" and I said \"snake\" and of course a few people started laughing, thinking,\n  \"Oh, well, this little bitty green, harmless snake\" Ah, no big deal. So one of the little bitty Thai girls, walks into my cabin and she comes running out, \"Aah, snake!\" and so it was a black king cobra which is the most poisonous snake in the world and this is really kind of scary because my little brother had been killed by a snake and so it's frightening to me to think how close I came. After I left Thailand, two things happened: I found some photographs in which in the photographs that I took of my cabin you could see the snake crawling into my cabin and the other one is an e-mail from the owners of the resort that they found two more cobras underneath my bed.\nTodd: Wow, oh man! So normally do they have king cobras on that part of the island?\nGloria: No, they don't. They say they may come in when they transport.. the building, they're making a lot of new buildings so they brought in wood from Northern Thailand and maybe it came in there. Also the envirorment's being upset and they're chopping down a lot of trees and they're finding more and more snakes that they didn't know were there. \nTodd: Wow. Well, you're very lucky. \nGloria: Yeah, I've been told that.",

        "transcript": "A (Girl):\nShe lives next door and she’s always been really important in my life. When we were little and my mum was working she used to look after us. She’d tell us stories about her childhood. It was like listening to fairy stories, life was so different when she was a child. In her kitchen she used to keep a special dish with sweets for us, and she was always baking cakes and pies. Now she doesn’t bake so much. She’s started eating more healthily in her old age, salads and vegetables and things. It’s funny how she’s changed. She also goes to this special gym class for old people, it’s amazing. I don’t see her so often now, but she’s always the same person however much her lifestyle changes.\n\nB (Boy):\nHe’s four years older than me and that seemed like a huge amount when we were children. When we were at the same school we’d never talk to each other during school hours. But now we’re older it’s a lot better, although I’ll always be the little one, and that’s annoying sometimes. He’s taken me to rock concerts that I wouldn’t have gone to otherwise and when he was at uni I went to stay with him sometimes. That was really cool. It was great to see what real student life was like when I was still at school. Now that he’s working he’s really busy, but we still hang out sometimes. We go to football matches together because we both support our home team. It’s always good to see him.\n\nC (Girl):\nWe’ve known each other since we were five and we’ve always got on really well. Well, apart from that time when we fell out because we both liked the same boy. But he went off with Heather Jenkins, so we made friends again quite quickly! We both like the same kind of music and going dancing at the weekend, and when we were younger we went out on our bikes together. At school we’re good at different things. I’m good at languages and Laura’s good at maths. That’s good though – it means that we can help each other with our homework. Next year I’m probably going to study in London and she’s going to Manchester, but I’m sure our relationship won’t change.\n\nD (Boy):\nHis family moved in just a few houses down from us when I was about ten, and I still remember how excited I felt when I found out there was another boy on the street. I’d been the only boy, you see. The others were all girls. We were good friends from the beginning because we were into the same things: computers and football, mostly. But we had quite a few of the same hobbies for a while. I remember making lots of models of aeroplanes one year. Another year we took up fishing. We had all the equipment and everything and we’d spend ages down by the river. I never go fishing now. His family moved away a couple of years ago. We’re still friends on Facebook but we don’t really have much contact.\n\nE (Girl):\nI can remember all the details of when we met. I was wearing a red dress and I’d just had my hair cut. I can even remember what music was playing the first time I saw him. I knew he was special from the beginning, and I was right. We’ve been together ever since. Well, it’s only been eighteen months, and some people say that isn’t very long, but it seems like ages to me. We’ve got such similar personalities and so much in common. I’m sure we’ll stay together forever.",

        "transcript": "Todd\nOK, I'm going to talk about my one wish. I think everybody has one or two things they wish they could change about themselves and for me I really wish I could sing. Unfortunately I have a terrible voice. I cannot sing at all, and in Japan, this is very embarrassing because Japanese people love to go to karaoke, and karaoke is when you go with a bunch of friends to a place, a karaoke bar, I guess, or center, and you get a small room and inside the room there are TV's and songs are on the TV's. You can choose what songs to watch and then one person sings the song and everyone listens and it's very popular in Japan and it's a lot of fun but it's really embarrassing because I can't sing and everybody always says, \" No, no, no, you sing. Oh, no, it's OK. It's OK. Don't worry. Don't be embarrassed,\" but after I sing, my singing is so bad that everybody doesn't want me to sing anymore, so it's also really hard for me because I teach children and I love teaching children and\nwhen you teach children you need to teach songs, and so I sing many, many songs with my students, for example, \"Itsy-Bitsy Spider\" or \"Row-Row-Row your boat!\" or many many songs, but I can't sing and so luckily the kids really don't care so usually it's alright that my voice is really bad but sometimes they tell me, they say, \"Sensei, Sensei!\" in Japanese, \"You're singing is terrible!\" so it's really embarrassing but I have to do it. Songs are very important for children when they're little. I think the reason I cannot sing is because unfortunately in my country we don't sing as children and I really would like this to change. It really bothers me. I've noticed in Thailand, in Japan, in other countries that I have taught, children sing in elementary school a lot and in the United States you don't do this and I think's it's terrible because you need to sing when you're little to train your voice so it can learn tones and so it can learn how to sing properly and because I never learned to sing when I was little it's almost impossible to learn how to sing when you're older, so yeah, I really wish I could sing but I just don't think that it's ever going to be a reality.",

        "transcript": "Eli\nAt the moment I'm living in Japan and life here is pretty different to anything I've really experienced before. I think just because the daily routine is so different. In England, in England, basically I was really lazy. I'd probably get up at you know 8:30 in the morning. Leave ten minutes later, cause I always brush my teeth at work, eat breakfast at work, get to work for 9 o'clock, come home from work at 5:30, probably lie on the sofa, watch the Simpsons, cook some food, go to bed, and that was the sort of daily routine in England, a very lazy one. I mean, even if I needed to get to the supermarket which was probably what, like 3-400 meters away, I'd get on my scooter to do it. Walking anywhere would be just a massive hassle and so it was a bit of a shock when I got to Japan and all that changed, I mean, the one thing you have to do a lot of in Tokyo is walk. You have to walk everywhere. I mean the train systems are absolutely amazing but you need to walk to get to the train. You need to walk between the trains and like when I first arrived, I walked my feet into the ground. After a week they were aching so badly after two weeks. They were just I don't know, it took me at least a month to like wear my feet in. They're still, still like now, after long walks, but it's just apart from the walking, you just, it's just a business of life here, I mean cause no one actually lives in Tokyo cause it's so expensive.\nWe all live out sort of in the suburbs in what we call bed towns, and so actually getting into school every morning, I'm studying Japanese here, I have to get up pretty early just to get onto the train, to then travel, commute, an hour in, to get to school on time, which of course I never do. I'm meant to be at school at about nine, which would mean, sort of leaving my house at about 8, getting up at 7. I know this is not shocking for a lot of people, but after the routine I had, it's a pretty shocking experience for me, especially the hour of commuting on the train where you're kept in like sardines, you just would never have in sort of London and London underground in England where I'm from. On the London Undeground if the trains full people wait for the next train. Here if the train is full, people just push and push until they get on so you can end up being stood, never get to sit down, just standing for an hour, like squashed up, like sardines, so by the time you get to school you're totally tired and then there's a school until lunch time and after lunch I always say I'm going to come back and study but I never do I always come back and fall fast asleep.",

The United States is for using genetically modified foods, (I see) but Europe is against it. (Oh, right) So you're from Canada, what do you think?\nAkane: Well, I think it's a great idea. to have genetically modified foods.\nTodd: Why?\nAkane: Well, I think that especially for countries like China research shows that the people in China, the quality of their life is going to be of the level of the people in America within the next thirty years, and if this world is going to support that kind of population, we definitely need more resources in order to make food to support the population.\nTodd: Do you worry more that maybe there haven't been enough tests on genetically modified foods, that there might be side effects that could lead to cancer, or could maybe ruin the naturally life cycle of the plants?\nAkane: Uh, definitely, I think there is lots of reasons to be concerned and that's why the research has to be taken carefully and slowly and there has to be laws and procedures in place so that the research is controlled and that foods are tested before people can use them.\nTodd: So, you're saying that they should do research but it's OK to go ahead and try to use it now?\nAkane: Well, if there is reason to think that it is safe after many tests then, then I think we should start using it for the future.\nTodd: Mm, I mean, I can understand why people would want to use genetically modified foods because in terms of drought or insects eating the plants or feeding really impoverished areas like Africa and parts of Asia (Right) it's useful but we really don't know, I mean, aren't you a little bit worried that if you rush it you don't give enough time for the tests, you know, if it's really harmful to the environment or the people.\nAkane: For sure, so I don't think we should rush it, but at the same time I don't think we should completely stop the research, either because the fact is the population is growing and these people are going to have to eat food so if genetically modified foods can help people to eat and survive and for the human population to survive then we're going to have to continue with the research.\nTodd: That's a pretty solid argument. I pretty much agree with you on that.\n\nAkane: Thanks\n\nTodd: OK, thanks, Akane.",

We have a castle called... it's called the Rock Castle. It's called Sigirya, so it's very beautiful.Todd: This is the Rock Castle.Mini: Yeah, it's... the castle is on the rock itself, so you can see the ruins there. It's really beautiful, with pictures, paintings, arts and stuff.Todd: Oh, really. That's really cool, so this rock castle, how old is it?Mini: I'm not sure, but maybe around two thousand. I'm not sure. Sorry.Todd: What else should people you see?Mini: The second thing should be beaches. We have beautiful beaches all over the place, blue, clean. You can swim. You can surf. It's very beautiful. That's the second thing.Todd: Surfing is popular in Sri Lanka?Mini: M-hm. I mean, not popular amongst Sri Lankans but most of the... many tourists come, especially the Germans, they come to my country and surf because the hotels near the beaches are very cheap and it's very beautiful hotels and very cheap. Food is cheap. It's nice.Todd: OK. So, we've got the Rock Castle, surfing on the beach. Anything else? Mini: And then a third thing should be the Tooth Temple. It's like the tooth of a Buddha, so we got it from I guess India, King Ashoka, so it's one of the things that you can see there. It's a really beautiful temple.Todd: OK, I'm sorry. Can you say the name of that again?Mini: Temple of Tooth Relic.Todd: The Temple of Tooth Relic.Mini: Yeah.Todd: OK. Mini: It's in Kandy. A place called Kandy.Todd: Kandy. OK.

Christophe: I don't care. I love running in the rain, and I have to run because I am training for a marathon.Aiste: A marathon! Isn't that like some 100 kilometers of running?Christophe: Oh, no. A marathon is a race where you run 42 kilometers. It's a long distance, so you need to train every day for it.Aiste: So do you actually run 42 kilometers every day when training for it?Christophe: Oh, no. Actually, a good preparation for a marathon is about 12 weeks of running, and you never run for 42 kilometers in one training. You never do this because it's actually very, very bad for your body if you would do that, so you run a maximum, like 32 to 34 kilometers.Aiste: Every day?Christophe: Not every day of course. I think, right now, I run about 80 kilometers a week, but that's almost every day, 10, 15 kilometers that you have to run.Aiste: And how many marathons have you done already?Christophe: I've already ran about four marathons, and now I'm preparing for my fifth marathon.Aiste: What is that going to be like?Christophe: Well, actually, I hope to run less than three hours. It's quite fast. It's like fourteen kilometers average during forty-two kilometers.Aiste: Whoa! That sounds difficult. I'm not really into sports very much, so I think for me, even a five-minutes run seems kind of difficult and requiring lots of endurance.Christophe: Well, in the beginning, it's hard maybe, but once you try running a little bit longer, you really start liking it, so I would recommend you to do one training with me and you start slow and then you build up slowly until you can run five, maybe ten kilometers, and then you will see, you will get addicted and you will love it too. I think in a couple of years, you will run your first marathon.Aiste: Oh, that sounds great, but ... I really don't think it's for me.",

And also let's say one thing that I don't like is that cities are too big, you know, and if you get lost, if you travel to Bogot·, it's huge so I don't like cities in Colombia because they're so big, they're huge and you get lost.Katia: What about in Ecuador? Quito, is it also a big city?Felipe: Well it is a big city but it's not as big as Bogot·. If you think, you can travel from the south to the north in a couple of hours, maybe two hours, it's not that huge as Bogot·.Katia: That is so interesting. What about something that you would like to change perhaps of Ecuador or Colombia?Felipe: Well, the only thing I would like to change is something about tourism because you know that people overseas outside of Colombia and Ecuador, they don't know too much about Colombia and Ecuador. So I don't know, I think the government should, you know, make people overseas know more about Colombia and Ecuador so that we can attract more tourists to our countries.Katia: That is so true.

        "transcript": "John: So Sarah, I was wondering, what kind of sports do you like to play?\nSarah: Well, I love riding horses. And actually, when I was in college, I took a lot of classes about horseback riding. So I can do all sorts of sports on horseback. \nJohn: Wow! That's amazing. Don't you think riding horses is scary?\nSarah: I think, it's part of the fun. For example, I used to be in the rodeo and I did a sport called saddle bronc riding. And the way you do this is they put the saddle on the horse and then they let the horse just go crazy. And the horse runs, and bucks, and tries to get you off, and you try to stay on.\n                                And it's really scary but it's also really exciting. \nJohn: Wow! That's what's called a bucking bronco, right? \nSarah: Yeah. And it's really hard to stay on. In fact, you win if you can stay on 8 seconds. \nJohn: Oh, that doesn't seem very long. \nSarah: It's really, really long. When I was – it's really long when you're on the horse. My first time, I only stayed on about 4 seconds and then I fell off in the middle of ring and I got knocked out.\nJohn: Whoa!\nSarah: Yeah. And the rest – yeah, and I had a big black eye for about two months.\nJohn: Wow! From falling off a horse. That's why it seems scary. Isn't it really dangerous?\nSarah: It is. It is really dangerous. And they don't make you wear helmet or any safety gear. I didn't wear a helmet my first time. I think it was pretty stupid. \nYou start – so the horse starts in a metal cage. So the horse can't move. And then you sit on top of the horse, on the horse's back in the saddle. And then you say, I'm ready and they open the door. And the horse explodes and just starts jumping, and turning and twisting. And the horse did about three or four jumps and I fell off. \nJohn: Wow! How many seconds did you make it?\nSarah: Three. \nJohn: Three? \nSarah: Probably about 3 seconds. \nJohn: So you would have to do that more than twice as long to win.\nSarah: Yeah. I got better at it, but I never could stay on for 8 seconds. \nJohn: Did you try any other rodeo events?\nSarah: Yeah. I tried to do calf roping. \nJohn: What's that?\nSarah: This is a sport where you have your horse and your horse is trained. It's not the wild horse from before. And there's a calf, and you try to throw your rope so that you catch the calf. And a calf is a baby cow.\nJohn: Wow! And so, what do you have to do if you get your rope around the cow?\nSarah: Then you have to run up to the cow and you have to tie the cow's legs together. And when you finish tying the cow's legs together, the timer stops. So you want to do it as fast as you can. \nJohn: That sounds really fun. And it doesn't sound as dangerous as the saddle bronc competition. \nSarah: No. It's not as dangerous. But after a while, I started to feel bad for the baby cow. \nJohn: I see.\nSarah: It's just he's a small little baby and he's really scared, and he's trying to run away. And I started to feel bad about catching him with the rope and tying him up. So I stopped doing it.",

        "transcript": "Adam: Hi Sarah. Today we’re talking about lifestyle options. So my first question would be would you rather live with a roommate or live by yourself?\nSarah: This one would definitely depend on who the roommate is. I have lived alone many times and I’ve also had lots of different roommates, and I found that any roommate that’s extroverted does not work well with me. I find that like if I come home and they’re there, like I don’t want to be there. So I leave again, or I just go in my room, close the door.\nI think the worst situation was when I lived with my sister. She is very extroverted, and we were working the same types of jobs and spending a lot of time together. When I came home, I just wanted to be alone. And so I would go in my room and she thought that I didn’t love her, I didn’t want to spend time with her. But really, you know, I just needed my space. \nSo in that case, living alone is better. But if I have someone who is more similar in personality to me, then it works well to have a roommate. I currently have a roommate and we get along really well because we have similar temperaments. And so, yeah, it works well for us.\nAdam: So would you say that opposites don’t attract?\nSarah: When it comes to living together, absolutely not.\nAdam: Hmm. How about your living situation in terms of a house or an apartment, which one would you prefer?\nSarah: Definitely an apartment because to me a house seems permanent. And I love change. So I also move a lot. I have moved to a new place every two years or less for like the past 12 years of my life. So the thought of having a house and being stuck in one place doesn’t really appeal to me.\nAdam: I can understand that. This apartment of yours, would you prefer it to be in the city or in the countryside?\nSarah: I would naturally say city, but ironically, most of the places I have lived have been more countryside or rural because that’s where I found work. But in the future, I think I would like to live in a larger city.\nAdam: Any cities in mind?\nSarah: Not right now. I’m still trying to decide about what country I want to move to next.\nAdam: How about this apartment of yours in the city, would it be furnished or unfurnished?\nSarah: Interesting you ask that, because the apartment I’m currently in is unfurnished. And when I moved here, it was really complicated to try to furnish it because I live on the fifth floor and there is no elevator. And it became quickly very problematic when I moved in trying to get things.\nBut when I was coming, the apartment agency that I was dealing with told me that there weren’t any furnished apartments in the area where I lived. So I thought it was the only option when really it wasn’t.\nAdam: Yeah, the fifth floor, you must have got some good exercise carrying all that stuff up there.\nSarah: Definitely.\nAdam: How do you feel about pets?\nSarah: I love animals. I would love to have a dog or a rabbit. When I lived in China, I had a rabbit. But it’s just not practical for my life because I live overseas and I go back and forth between the States visiting family. And it’s just not practical to have one. So maybe one day if I ever settle down.\nAdam: A dog, a rabbit?\nSarah: Probably a dog. Dog would be first option definitely, a Dachshund. My favorite animal is Dachshund.\nAdam: Those are cute.\nSarah: Yeah.",

It’s a new centre; it sounds great. We’re going to go dirtboarding …\nGirl: What’s that?\nBoy: It’s like skateboarding or snowboarding. You have a board, or deck, to stand on and wheels. They’re pretty strong because you go down rough mountain tracks on them. Steep, rough mountain tracks.\nGirl: Sounds a bit risky. Have you done it before?\nBoy: No, but I’ve done similar things. Anyway, we’re also going to go canyoning. Before you ask, that’s when you jump and swim down a river canyon. You have to use ropes and special equipment. And maybe we’ll go white water rafting too.\nGirl: Phew. It sounds far too difficult to me.\nBoy: They have lots of things that you could do too. Like zip-wiring, you know when you go along a wire through the trees or down a mountain.\nGirl: Go down a mountain on a wire!\nBoy: It’s really easy, and exciting too. You just have to hold on and enjoy the ride. Or there’s bungee jumping.\nGirl: Jump off a bridge on a long elastic band! Me? You’ve got to be joking! Anyway, I’m going away this weekend too, thank you for asking.\nBoy: I was going to ask. So where are you going?\nGirl: Paris! I’m so excited!\nBoy: Paris, wow!\nGirl: Yeah, it’ll be brilliant! We’re going to do all the sights, like go up the Eiffel Tower and take a boat along the River Seine and see the old parts of the city. It looks so beautiful in the photos. And then there are all the art galleries. You know how much I like art. I can’t wait to go round the Louvre and see all those famous paintings.\nBoy: I think the famous Impressionist paintings are somewhere else.\nGirl: Yeah, I know, they’re in the Musée d’Orsay. We’re going there too. And then I want to go to the Rodin Museum and see that famous statue, you know, The Thinker. And of course, if we’re in Paris, we’ll have to go shopping. Or look at the shops, at least. And then there’s the restaurants. Just think, French food!\nBoy: You’ve got a lot planned for one weekend.\nGirl: Oh, we’re going for four days, actually.\nBoy: Oh, four days, very nice.

        "transcript": "Abidemi: So Rory, talking about schedules, do you ever think that life is too busy or too much that we’re trying to fit too many things? \nRory: Maybe for some people. Not for me, actually. I take life quite slowly. But I noticed with my daughter that we’re always sort of rushing her to do things. So when she comes home from school, she has to do her homework. And then one night a week, she has to go to swimming then she has piano, then she has like an acrobat lesson. \nWhen I was a kid, we did nothing after school, you know. We went to the park by ourselves and played. But nothing was scheduled, so we just did what we wanted. \nAbidemi: I see. \nRory: So do you think like kids today, we try and make them do too much or they try and do too much. \nAbidemi: That’s a really good question. And I think, yes, you’re right. It feels like a lot – that we expect a lot more from kids these days. Whereas similar to your background too, when I was growing up, I thought sometimes that I was bored out of my mind because there was just nothing really much to do except for maybe going to the library and borrow some books to read. And I had all the time in the world to read them. \nBut these days, you see kids running around trying to do it all. Play soccer or some kind of sports or do some club activities or just something. They are always busy, the kids I see around me. So…\nRory: Yeah. Yeah. I think we’re trying to make them maybe grow up too quickly or do too much too soon. When I was kid, you could sort of find your own path. You know, when you became a teenager, when you start to get to university, starting to make these choices. \nBut now, parents seem to – okay, the kid is going to do piano and they’re going to do soccer and they’re going to study hard for, you know, exams, do extra math tuition. I don’t know if kids can handle it. \nAbidemi: I don’t know either. It also seems that it comes with our world today. It’s a lot more competitive. And what I’ve heard is like people are trying to prepare their kids as much as possible. I’ve heard, for some universities, you need to show that you can handle a lot. \nRory: Right. \nAbidemi: And because everybody is the same place, they’re all racing for the same positions that if you don’t distinguish yourself in some way, you can’t make it. So in response to that, parents are trying to pile as much on the kids as possible. \nRory: Yeah. I was reading something that said that employers really look now for extra-curricular things that kids do. So not just their grades but what clubs were they members of. Were they acting in the theater, were they a member of a sports team and these things seem to be becoming more important now. \nAbidemi: Than just school work. \nRory: Yeah. Yeah.\nAbidemi: I think it’s a shame. I like the way I grew up. Yeah. I’ll like if my kids could have a bit more freedom but I can also see that with the way the world is going, I would probably be anxious for them to do as much as possible so that they can have the best in the future. \nRory: Yeah, because it’s a balance between giving them the freedom and then giving them the opportunities to excel at various things. \nAbidemi: There you go. That’s it. Yeah.",

It was a very, very hot day, so all the windows in the house were open, and we decided to play hide and seek, so my brother, Daniel, he goes upstairs and he sits by the window, on the window ledge, and he's waiting for us to come and find him, so he leans back, but not realizing the window's open he falls out of the window, so he falls about 15 feet and he break both of his arms and all we hear is this screaming and we think, ah you know, he's just kidding around and them my mom goes out and sees that he's lying on the floor, one bone sticking out of one arm, the other one's all twisted, so we call the ambulance and everyone's crying. My mom is being sick with the shock, and he goes to hospital. We were really, really worried, you know, is he going to die, or whatever, and he was fine. He broke both his arms but he was in hospital for about two weeks I think. Yeah, it was really nasty. He's got a horrible scar now.",

What's the best way for a student to get into a Canadian University? \n\t\t                  Steve: Well, it all depends on your nationality, and your level of English, in terms of your TOEFL score. If you have a very low TOEFL score then probably your best bet would be to first go to Canada for three to six months and study in an English college there, and try to improve your English. While in Canada you can take practice TOEFL tests, and you can find tutors to help you write essays, then when you return to your home country, if it's Japan, there's lots of good English schools, English tutors in Japan, Korea as well. I'm not too familiar with other countries but basically you have to apply for a student visa. It's usually not that difficult to get. Along with your student visa, you'll have to take a TOEFL test, which requires you to understand grammar. \n\t\t                  There's a listening portion, um, there's a reading comprehension portion, and the most difficult portion for non-native English speakers is the essay question, because you have to write an essay during the TOEFL test, so I recommend that you practice writing essays and if you want more information I would ask the Canadian Embassy in your country or do a search on the internet where there's lots of information.",

I have my sister and my mom and my dad and my friends, but Valentine's day is more of a holiday for people that have a boyfriend or a girlfriend, or a wife, or a husband, or children as opposed to being a single person with nobody to share it with.\nAdrienne: But could you share it with your sister, or your mother, or your father?\nTrina: I could. I could, and we do. We send each other gifts. We, well this year, I won't be with anybody, but I get to celebrate it with my sister this weekend. \nAdrienne: Well, that sounds fun.\nTrina: It is.\nAdrienne: So what kinds of things have you done on Valentines day in the past?\nTrina: Ah, gone out to dinner, gone to a movie, had dinner at my parents house, had dinner at my grandparent's house.\nAdrienne: That's interesting. Why your grandparent's house?\nTrina: It was their wedding anniversary.\nAdrienne: Wow! That's a great day to have a wedding anniversary.\nTrina: It is and it was a lot of fun. I got to spend some of their last few years together having dinner with them.\nAdrienne: That sounds lovely. So are you looking forward to maybe having a Valentine next year?\nTrina: Maybe!

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Steven, where did you go to college?\nSteve: I went to the University of Wales, um, the College of Cardiff there, so it the United Kingdom, obviously we have England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland and so I spent three years over in Wales. \nTodd: Wow. Sounds fun. So what's university like in Wales? Is it different than University life in Britain?\nSteve: Yeah, it is. Um, for example Wales has it's own distinguished, distinctive language and culture as well, so if you go to Wales you'll see street signs written not only in English, but above that you'll have the Welsh language there and Welsh people are very, very proud of their language, and their heritage and there culture and it made it just a slightly different experience from studying over the border in England.\nTodd: So they speak Welsh? Is that the language?\nSteve: That's correct. Yeah. Yeah, they do. It's not spoken by everybody in Wales. Since the middle ages, the usage of the language has declined somewhat but there has been a revival over the last 30 or 40 years, and now about, maybe about 40% of the Welsh population speak it as either as their first of second language.\nTodd: Did you learn it while you there?\nSteve: No, no, I didn't, no. Everybody speaks English there. but there is a lot of good music coming out in Welsh now. There's lots of cultural festivals and when I was at Cardiff, there's lots of pubs where it's Welsh speaking only and it was quite good fun to go in there and try to order a beer and stuff in the Welch language, but that was about as far as I got. \nTodd: Could you say that there's any, it's a stereo type, that's there's any difference between the Welsh people and the British people?\nSteve: There is yeah, because they've had a different history and obviously that affects how people have evolved over many centuries. They like different sports for example. They're more into rugby than they are into football. They tend to look slightly different than they do to English people. They tend to have sort of redder hair and darker eyes than English people, but also they're very, very loyal, they're very, very fierce, they're very passionate people. They're very nice people.\nTodd: Well, it sounds like a nice place to go. I'd love to go someday.\nSteve: Yeah it was nice!",

And if you complete all three then you can go to Buckingham Palace and he gives you your award.\nAdrienne: The award is for what kind of job?\nIan: OK, well it's for young people between the ages of.. I think it's 14 to 21, but I'm not quite sure and you have to do different challenges for each award. Now, for the gold award you had to do community service and I visited an old man. I had to do a sport and I played badminton. You had to do an expedition and we went hiking in the Breton Beacons in Wales for five days and you had to do a skill and I did driving and you had to do each one for a year.\nAdrienne: So what was it like getting the award?\nIan: It was exciting and disappointing at the same time because my friends and I, we were waiting at Buckingham Palace for quite a long time and we had all our best clothes on our ties, our shirts, our trousers. We had very clean shoes. It was quite hot and we were waiting and we were waiting and in came the Duke of Edinburgh and he gave us our award. He asked us maybe one question each and then he went, so we only actually met him for about five minutes. \nAdrienne: So it wasn't the most exciting time, meeting him a famous person. \nIan: No, he was a very busy man but you know, I shook his hand and that was it but it was nice to see  Buckingham Palace and it was a good day out in London. \nAdrienne: Sounds like it.",

Well, it is my brother's birthday in a week so.\nTodd: Oh, no kidding.\nRuth: Yeah.\nTodd: So, what did you get your brother for his birthday?\nRuth: Well, it was quite difficult to find something that I thought he would like, but I got him some cakes in the end, some Japanese cakes.\nTodd: Japanese cakes?\nRuth: Yeah, they're in like a special presentation box.\nTodd: So, how are you going to get the cakes to your brother? Just through the post office?\nRuth: Yes, I sent them in the post this morning.\nTodd: Oh, did you send them express or just regular mail?\nRuth: No, regular mail because it was cheaper.\nTodd: But, don't you want it to hurry and get there for his birthday?\nRuth: I've got one week. I think it will get there in time.\nTodd: So, what do you think you're brother will think of the cakes?\nRuth: I don't think he'll like them actually.\nTodd: No?\nRuth: Well, he likes chocolate cake, and they look like they've got kind of chocolate inside but it's bean paste. I think he'll be disappointed.\nTodd: So what did you brother get you for your last birthday?\nRuth: That's a good question. He always gives me money, and he often gives me chocolate as well. He's very generous. \nTodd: Actually, I'm the same way. Guys like to give money. Money is so easy. No shopping involved.\nRuth: It's practical, though, it's good.\nTodd: Now, I've been told that when you give money for a gift, it's actually very impolite. \nRuth: Really?\nTodd: Is that true? Yeah!\nRuth: Why is that?\nTodd: I don't know. Some people say it's just really impersonal. That you should take the time to get a gift.\nRuth: Really! I really think if anybody gave me money I would be so pleased. It's a good present.\nTodd: Exactly, that's what I think. (Pause) Hey, um, actually, when are you going to see your brother next?\nRuth: Probably, I will see him in August of September.\nTodd: Oh, that's quite a ways away.\nRuth: Yes, about four months is that.\nTodd: So is this a younger brother or older brother?\nRuth: He's older. He's twenty-six. \nTodd: Oh, he's twenty six.\nRuth: He's going to be twenty-six soon.\nTodd: Ok, well, if you happen to e-mail him, tell him happy birthday. \nRuth: Oh, certainly will do. Thanks.",

Todd: The last frontier.Asako: I'm an unusual one.Todd: So, yeah, cause usually when people go and live in America for a long time, they don't choose Alaska.Asako: Yeah, that's right, but Alaska is such a beautiful state.Todd: Why did you choose Alaska?Asako: Well, I went to university there. There was a university. I wanted to go. That is the reason.Todd: And then you stayed for six years.Asako: I fell in love.Todd: Wow!Asako: Just beautiful. That's it. Just beautiful.Todd: So what do you remember most about Alaska?Asako: Wilderness. Mountains. Glaciers. Mosquitos.Todd: Mosquitos?Asako: Mosquitos. Big ones. Really big. You can't see such a big mosquito anywhere else on this island, not on any other place, but huge mosquitos. Some people say mosquitos are actually the state birds of Alaska.Todd: The state bird. Really. So obviously there's lots of beautiful things and the mosquitos, but what else? Like what was the city like? I mean, was it a big city or a small city?Asako: Well, the biggest city is called Anchorage, and... but it's not really big-big. In the middle... the biggest street in Anchorage you can see moose. Todd: You can see moose?Asako: Yeah.Todd: Just walking around.Asako: Walking around. Exactly.Todd: In the city there's moose?Asako: Yes. Exactly.Todd: Now can you go up and pet them like....Asako: No, never. Never. They are wild things. You can't pet them, but, I mean, they are very, very calm and nice animals but if you meet a mother moose and if there are children, her children are around, they can be really mean. So you don't really pet them. You can look at them and admire them, but that's it. Beautiful things.Todd: Well, that's good to know.",

They, it's very cool to be around all these women. It's a very good experience, it's, how-should-I-say, it's, I'd say it's made me a better person, maybe a bit more sensitive to their feelings, I'd say and...\n\t\t\t            Todd: So you still must get special attention though!\n\t\t                Shawn: Still, must get special attention, um! Just because I'm the only guy in the class, it doesn't matter. You can float around that classroom and talk to anybody you want. Some girls cannot float around the classroom and talk to other girls because I'm the only guy in that class it seems that they want the attention regardless if they don't like you or not. They just want the attention. So it's never, it doesn't get lonely in the class because as a guy in the class you'll never stop talking, because they want your attention, but it's a very cool experience.\n\t\t                Todd: OK, well as a teacher, do you think that men teachers think differently that female teachers?\n\t                    Shawn: I'd say, not so much in the classroom setting but in terms with fellow coworkers, I'd say that men are very, more composed, they don't, how-should-I-say, what I've noticed in my program with women having their infighting in the class, not that they always come to me, it's just that, I'm very composed, I'm able to, how-should-I-say, not lose my head, not lose my patience right away, so, but in terms of teaching skills, um, I don't see any difference, like they're both doing the same type of job, trying to educate young minds, so in terms of teaching strategies, it's how-should-I-say, women have, I'd say more of an artistic touch than I do, it's, um, I put that as the main difference, they're more relaxed singing around the class, whereas I'm just nervous as can be and I don't like doing it, so.\n\t                    Todd: OK, I agree.

Maybe because the sands look like marble?\nDanu: Exactly. When you get in the sea, the sea bed looks like exactly like marble. \nWiduri: Wow. \nDanu: It's so blue, it shines when the sun is bright. You can see even from far away the blue sea bed of Marble Beach.\nWiduri: Wow. \nDanu: And the best thing about the Marble Beach is for about 1 kilometer, the depth of water is the same. It's really, really shallow. \nWiduri: Oh yeah? \nDanu: So nobody drowns if you swim in Marble Beach. You can swim even if you cannot swim. \nWiduri: Oh really? \nDanu: Yes. And since Sri Lanka is a tropical country, if it is not the rainy season, Marble Beach will be filled with people from outside Sri Lanka as well as with the people from Sri Lanka, local people and foreign people because tourists, they love to do sun bathing. \nWiduri: Yeah, they are. Have you visited that Marble Beach? \nDanu: Yes, so many times. Usually, my friends and we do road trips to this place because the road to Marble Beach is very beautiful and especially, there is no police in this area so you can drive freely. \nWiduri: Oh I see. So you mentioned that Kandy is in the middle of Sri Lanka and this one is in the southern part. \nDanu: No. Kandy is in the central part of Sri Lanka and Marble Beach in northeastern part of Sri Lanka. \nWiduri: Is it far? \nDanu: It is roughly 170 kilometers from my city.\nWiduri: Oh, not so far. Interesting. Any other famous place near those two places? \nDanu: Oh yes, sure. Near Marble Beach, there's another Hindu temple. \nWiduri: Okay. \nDanu: And the landscape of this temple is very interesting because in Sri Lanka, usually, around the beach, around the coastal area, there are no highlands or mountains. But this exact Hindu temple is situated on a little mountain right next to Marble Beach. And if you look down from the Hindu temple, it's like a cliff. It's like a straight fall into the water. \nWiduri: Wow. \nDanu: So there had been people jumping off from here and trying to suicide as well. \nWiduri: Oh really? \nDanu: As an offering to the god. \nWiduri: Wow. \nDanu: Yeah. \nWiduri: That's a bit scary. But it's so interesting. So near that Marble Beach, we have the beautiful cliff plus the Hindu temple. \nDanu: That's true. \nWiduri: Very interesting. Wow, I definitely want to go there. I will stay at your house and then we go to both…\nDanu: Temple of the Tooth Relic…\nWiduri: Yes, and then…\nDanu: And the Marble Beach.\nWiduri: The Marble Beach and then to the Hindu temple. \nDanu: Definitely, I'll be your guide. \nWiduri: Oh thank you, Danu.\nDanu: Thank you, Widuri.",

I mean I like to play sports more than I like to watch sports but sometimes a good game on TV or watching it live can be really good, um, you know, everybody, or many people like to watch the olympics or the world cup of soccer, I mean those kinds of sports are really, really exciting. I like to watch them too. I like to watch a good game on TV, you know, it there's lots of buildup and tension for the match, it's even better. \nOne sport that I've been really getting into recently is Japanese Sumo wrestling, yeah, it's, you know, it's quite a spectacle. Many westerners think that it's kind of a joke, you know, a bunch of fat guys in tiny underwear, you know bashing their bodies against each other, but there's really a lot more to it than that, I mean, these guys are incredibly athletic. They also are quite strong and they have a repertoire of martial arts and wrestling ability. It's pretty amazing to watch. I mean the matches are really really short so sometimes the uninitiated don't know what going on but basically the rules are stay on your feet and stay in the small circle and, you know, try to get your opponent to fall down or to go out of the circle. That's why they only take about 10 or 20 seconds to finish a match because they do everything they can, but finally, before you know it, the match is over, you know, they do wrestling throws, they do martial arts, they do all kinds of things. It's really fun, and there's the whole ritual with it as well, I mean it's pretty amazing.",

So actually\n                          this is really silly, I've never made one before. How do you make an\n                          omelet?\nKeri: Well, I can teach you how I make them,\n                          which is the same way my father and grandmother make them so it is a\n                          little special.\n\nTodd: OK. Yeah! Yeah! \nKeri: First you take some eggs and crack them in a\n                          bowl. Whisk them up,  so they're quite high and fluffy. In a hot pan, and you need a pan that's that's kind of small that the\n                          sides go up at an angle. You put some oil and heat it up, so it's quite\n                          hot. Then you take your whipped up eggs or whisked up eggs and\n                          pour them into the pan. As it's cooking, if you take a spatula and\n                          push the bottom layer of the egg to the sides and then to the middle so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan.\nTodd: Oh, OK. Wow!\nKeri: OK. And keep doing that until most of the\n                          egg is cooked. You should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it\n                            over. You'll only have to cook that side lightly. Put your fillings on\n                          the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the\n                          cheese. \nTodd: Wow. That sounds really good. \nKeri: Mm, it is. \nTodd: Wow. What fillings do you recommend? \nKeri: Well, if you want to do a real simple\n                          one, you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese. That's easy\n                          or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese, onions,\n                          tomatoes, mushrooms, anything that you like. If you want to make a\n                          spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg\n                          mixture. It's actually cooked in it. It's inside bacon and sour\n                          cream is nice and Jack cheese.\nTodd: Oh, OK. I'll have to give that a try. Thanks!\nKeri: OK. Sure.",

It's a very Irish name. \n                        Jessica: Wow, so now what was it like having Irish grandparents in England? \n                        Kate: I think initially for them it was difficult when they first came over because there weren't many jobs for the Irish and there as quite a lot of prejudice against the Irish, but it's wonderful having Irish heritage because there's such funny warm kind people. Really interesting. They can tell a good story so it was great to have that.\n                        Jessica: Yeah, so have you been to Ireland?\n                        Kate: Oh, yeah. Many times. Yeah.\nJessica: Did you go and see where they grew up and...yeah\n                        Jessica: Cool.\n                        Kate: It's a beautiful place. I've been there lots of times. I want to go back. Definitely. Really lovely country and the people are so friendly. It's so beautiful there.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Abidemi, you were talking about living with the Inuits in Northern Canada. What were some things that they do differently, like for example food or games or traditions?\nAbidemi: Food was a big thing that was different there. They eat a lot of meat, I could say, if I can say that from the sea, so because they're surrounded by the sea, they have access to a lot of food from there. They eat beluga, seal, whales. Anything that's found in the sea I think they basically eat it, and they eat just about all the parts of the animal, so that was quite interesting.\nTodd: That's so interesting. What does it taste like, seal and whale?\nAbidemi: Very ...?\nTodd: Is it cooked?\nAbidemi: Sometimes they cook it, yeah. They also freeze it. They have different ways of preparing it. Sometimes to do eat it raw. They say that is the best way to eat it to get the most amount of energy from it, and sometimes they freeze it, and they eat it frozen. They eat a lot of fish, frozen fish like that. Attic char - delicious, and sometimes they boil it, but I don't think that's their preferred method of eating it. One thing to note is that the younger generation, they seem to prefer more the meat - beef - and the meat that more of everybody eats now, whereas the older generation, of course, they still prefer their traditional way of cooking and eating. Also, they eat caribou, like land animals, caribou, rabbit and one or two other animals that I can't remember.\nTodd: Now did you try all these foods?\nAbidemi: I tried as many as I could. I love eating, and if everyone else is eating it, I'll eat it too, so I try them all. I have my, the ones I like more, but I didn't find anything disgusting. I enjoyed it.\nTodd: That's so cool. Did you learn how to prepare it or cook some of it? \nAbidemi: No. I'm laughing because I'm not a huge cook anywhere, so I just do the eating and cleaning up. \nTodd: Yeah, OK cool. You mentioned that they played some games. They have their own style of games. Do you remember any games that they play?\nAbidemi: They have games, where one was like wrestling. They have a lot of body contact games where they would wrestle on the ground, or you had to hold up your leg a certain way for how many minutes, just really games that had to deal with strength and endurance is what I would say, and then they played a lot of games using dice where you would win prizes. I think a lot of these things were designed for the long winter months, so they could stay indoors and still keep themselves entertained, and because in those days, in the past they didn't have TV or have the kind of entertainment, Internet, which they do have there now, so they have a lot of games that they still try to play sometimes to keep them entertained.\nAnd music is a large part of their life too. A lot of people play different instruments and they square dance. They're really good dancers. They can dance all night, so that was fun as well.\nTodd: Oh wow, sounds like a great place. \nAbidemi: Yes, it was. \nTodd: So do they have their own type of instruments? Their own traditional instruments? \nAbidemi: I would say no. The instruments that I saw were more things that had been brought up to them, for example the fiddle, guitar, stuff like that. Thinking back on it now, maybe there were one or two things that they had made, but I didn't feel like, I can't really remember the name. I didn't really remember the names, so.\nTodd: Nice, anyway, thanks for sharing. \nAbidemi: My pleasure.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Heidi, we're talking about demographics and population. Now we actually both live in Japan. So you are from Mongolia. I'm from the U.S. and we go to the same university. You're a student. I'm a teacher. Now in Japan, have ever heard the term 'parasite child'?\nHeidi: Yes, I heard. Yeah.\n                              \nTodd: Can you explain what parasite child is?\nHeidi: Well for me, parasite child is even if you get older, you're still living with your parents and not paying for anything. Just getting money from your parents probably. That's the term of the parasite child.\nTodd: Right, exactly. And in Japan, it's also quite a big issue because they have a population that's shrinking, and so they want people to get married and have children, but lots of children actually get a job, are professionals, like doctors and lawyers even, and they still live with their parents, so they don't move out and start families and these are often called a parasite child cause they continue to stay at home. Now do you have this in your country in Mongolia? \nHeidi: Well, I don't know if it's called parasite or not, but then in Mongolia, the young couples are still living with their parents, and not paying anything as well, and they're just working and making money for themselves and not paying for the family. Well, the reason why is in Mongolia the apartment cost is really expensive and for the young couples it's really hard to afford for the apartment, so that's probably the reason they are still living with their family.\nTodd: Wow, that's interesting. So you're saying they're actually together, like a married couple and they still live with their parents.\nHeidi: Yes, that's right.\nTodd: And you said the main reason is because the apartments are really expensive?\nHeidi: Yes, that's really expensive and even if they get the loan from the bank, they can't pay like less than ten years, so it's kind of hard to like afford for it, so...\nTodd: Actually, that's really surprising because as you mentioned earlier, you're country is really big. Like you don't have a problem with land, so you would think that housing would be very cheap?\nHeidi: Well, the problem is people are living in the capitol city. Even if you have big land, but the capitol city is really small, and there are so many people who wants to live in the capitol city, and the capitol city land is really expensive, and even if you want to build your own house, it costs a lot so there are not many people who wants to live in another city than Ulon Bator, which is the capitol city of Mongolia.\nTodd: Now because it's a big city, is it also hard for people to actually get houses, like they have to live in apartment buildings.\nHeidi: Yeah. Mainly Mongolian people are living in the apartments. Yeah.\nTodd: Wow, that's really interesting to find out about. It's actually I think quite similar in America surprisingly these days where some people, young people, are starting to live at home.",

        "transcript": "It was interesting as well while\n                                we were out on the farm. There were thousands of\n                                trees, I think, on the farm. So, we saw lots of\n                                different insects and little animals as well. The\n                                most exciting thing I saw was a redback spider\n                                because the redback is one of the most poisonous spiders\n                                \n                                \n                                in Australia. So, I had been traveling there for\n                                over a year, I think at\n                                  that stage, and I'd never seen a\n                                redback spider. But, I'd seen lots of colorful\n                                spiders, so that, every time I saw a new colored\n                                spider, I'd go and have a look and maybe play with\n                                it a bit or take a photo, something like that. \n\nSo, while I was picking the macadamia nuts with\n                                my friends, I saw a really brightly colored\n                                spider, so I decided to get a stick and kind of turn\n                                  over a leaf and see what it was doing, and\n                                then, I was kind of looking at it for a while and\n                                then suddenly I realized, \"Oh, my God! It's red\n                                and black. It's a redback spider!\" So. I thought,\n                                okay, I'd better stop playing with this guy and leave him alone. So, after over a year in Australia, I saw my first\n                                redback on this macadamia farm. And then, later\n                                on, that night, just before I was going to bed, I\n                                walked into the room I was staying in with my\n                                friend, and there on my bed was baby redneck\n                                spider... redback spider, sorry and I couldn't\n                                believe it. After one year, no redbacks and then\n                                two in one day. It was a bit crazy really, so I\n                                had to get someone to help me to get rid of it, cause it was a bit scary.",

It's a little quirky habit of mine but I always like to have backup whenever I need it so I've got into the habit of stockpiling batteries and keeping them in the fridge.\nAdrienne: Well, it's very practical but why do you keep them in the frigerator?\nMary: I read somewhere a long time ago that that's how you extend the life of batteries by keeping them cool, that and film too so I also have several canisters of film in there, too, no room for the butter but.\nAdrienne: Do you have any food in your frigerator?\nMary: Some but it's mostly batteries and film.\nAdrienne: What kind of food do you keep in your frigerator?\nMary: Right now because it's winter time, I have some oranges and actually some grapes and things so those are kind of coveted at this time of year, otherwise just the standard things. I have yogurt, milk, and some bread and I think six brusselsprouts.\nAdrienne: Just six.\nMary: Just six.\nAdrienne: Why do you have brusselsprouts?\nMary: Just got in the habit of eating them. They're really very good, so I thought well I'll keep on, just handfuls so they don't spoil.\nAdrienne: How so you prepare your brusselsprouts?\nMary: Um, I steam them for about 10 minutes or so and eat them just perfectly plain, a little salt and a little pepper, that's about it.\nAdrienne: Really, I find them a little bitter.\nMary: I find them a little bitter too, but the longer you steam them the bitterness kind of goes away and of course there's ways you can dissipate the bitterness with a little bit of butter or salt or seasonings too, so they're not so bad.\nAdrienne: Well, I'll have to try that.",

T. do?\n\nCat: Occupational therapists work with people who have had accidents or disabilities, help them regain function and so that they can be independent in the activities that they enjoy doing, so the occupation and occupational therapies, the activities people enjoy doing every day and it looks into, instead of physiotherapy works with just the muscles and building muscles, so they just do repetitions, but occupational therapy incorporates things that people actually enjoy doing into the activities for therapy, if that makes sense. It's kind of broad but yeah!\n\nNicola: So, it's kind of getting them back into their own life, their normal life? So, for example, if they've had an accident, is it or, for young people or old, or?\n\nCat: Yeah, it's the whole span of people, but um, yeah, people, for instances if a child has had an accident their main occupation is play so, you want to get them back into as much play as they can, and get them as strong as you can, so you can do that through play, but an adult you want to try and get them back into, say if they enjoy sewing or riding or surfing or those kinds of activities, as the O. T. you try to incorporate that into the therapy that you do with them, as much as you can. It depends on their injury. \n\nNicola: OK, so where are you working now as an O. T.?\n\nCat: Right now, I'm working in hospital at Lismore, and it's more of an acute care setting so people who have had major injuries or accidents and it's pretty much just helping them move on to the next step, either going home or going to another hospital and organizing the things that they need to be able to get back to the activities of daily living. (Wow) It's kind of complicated, but that's the basics of it, but it's a little bit more than that.\n\nNicola: That sounds pretty challenging.\n\nCat: Yeah, it's good. \n\nNicola: OK, so thanks for talking to us and all the best in your work.",

What is it about hockey? \n\t                      Steve: Well, hockey is a really exciting sport. It's played on the ice. It's really fast. It's aggressive. Also, it requires a lot of skill. It's a really good sport for spectators to watch because there's lots of action. You can watch it at home with friends. Drink beer, eat pizza, and have a really good time. I also like it because I'm Canadian and it's Canada's national sport, and Canada is the best hockey team in the world right now. \n\t                      Todd: Now Canada has the best hockey team. \n                          Steve: That's right.

You have to be a really good skater, but I played street hockey and floor hockey. \n                          Todd: OK, what's the difference between street hockey and ice hockey? \n                          Steve: Well, it's pretty much the same thing. Street hockey you play on the road or on a tennis court and instead of using a puck you use a hockey ball or a tennis ball.\n                          Todd: OK, and do you run or?\n                          Steve: Yeah, you run.\n                          Todd: Oh, you run!\n                          Steve: Yeah.

We had no air conditioning. We actually slept in tee-pees like the native Americans. It was a great time. Everyday we took swimming lessons. We went to arts and crafts. We had to help cook the meals. We made breakfast, lunch and dinner. We learned how to canoe, ride in a canoe, and we also, what did we do? We rode horses, too. We got to ride horses. At first, maybe the first three days, I was really homesick, and I cried and I wanted to go home but after one week I loved it and I didn't want to leave.",

Right, there was no paper. All of the students' assignments were posted on a web page, so for each of their papers that they had to write, each of their essays, they could just go online and read the description of the assignment and all their requirements, and then they had two options for handing in their essays; they could either type them up and e-mail them to me or they could type them up directly in like a text format screen on the web, so that I could, I would do all of the grading for the papers like online.\n                          Todd: OK, did you like it as a teacher? \n                          John: It was a bit difficult cause it takes a lot to get used to reading everything on the screen, and it's, actually as far as like marking papers and grading them, it's easier for you because you can just highlight something and make it red and be like, you know, red needs spelling or whatever, and it's much quicker than like circling it and writing \"spelling\" once you get in the habit of doing it with the mouse and have your color skeem worked out, it goes very quick, and if you want to do a comment you can just, you know, change the font or the size, and type directly in the text, and they know, \"oh well, here's John's comment.\" \n                          Todd: Did the student like it?\n                          John: Most of the students liked it, but there was a small majority that, you know, usually when they were late, or whenever they wanted to just like slip a paper under my door, and they couldn't do that, because you know they would, I would know if their paper was late because you know, it wasn't, the computer doesn't lie. It was logged in at this time and you know sent to me, so \"yes it was late!\" They couldn't, you know get around that kind of paper trail.\n                          Todd: So, you're a writer, do you think it actually helps students to do this stuff on computers or should you go back to the pencil paper method?\n                          John: I think it is important to be able to do both. I think that's the most important thing about being a writer is being able to be versatile and go in different directions and write in different forms, but probably as far as tools go these days, it's more important for students to be able to compose on a computer, because most likely that is what they'll be doing most of their writing.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Mark, when I was in London I saw so many people from New Zealand and actually everywhere in the world I meet so many people from New Zealand, but you have such a small population. Is anybody still in New Zealand?\nMark: Yeah, I think the Kiwis and Aussies that you see in London and in other parts of England and Europe, many of them are young Kiwis doing what we call ‘the big OE’.\nTodd: The big OE? What’s that?\nMark: ‘The big overseas experience’ or ‘the big overseas excursion’. So, a lot of people, when they finish school or finish university, they take a year off and because New Zealand is located a long way from anywhere, instead of taking a trip from one country to another for a week, like many Europeans do, when young New Zealanders travel they tend to go backpacking a lot, get a part time job working in a pub or a restaurant in London to make more money and then they will travel for 3 or 4 months through Europe. They may go back to England and work a bit more and then see a few more countries, and then maybe after a year or so they’ll start heading back towards home. That’s ‘the big OE’. \nTodd: So did you do ‘the big OE’?\nMark: Sort of, yeah. After I’d finished work at…after I’d finished university I worked for a few months and yes, I did go to England. I’d applied for a job and then hadn’t heard back so I started my OE and I did it for a few months and then I actually found out I’d got a job, so I cut the OE short to join the working world.\nTodd: Ok, what countries besides London are popular for Kiwis to go and visit?\nMark: Um, now…\nTodd: Or what cities or places?\nMark: Now I think they’re getting more adventurous. Before it used to be very euro-centric, but now a lot more people are going through Asia and going to more exotic locations: maybe South America, some people travel to Africa. The old ties to England are still there; I think that’s still the first location for many people: save a bit of money and then see the rest of the world.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Steven, if I go to England, and I can choose between Manchester, and Liverpool, (right) and London (right) those are the only three major cities I know, which one would you say is the best?\nSteven: Out of those three, well I would have to say London. I've never actually been to Liverpool so I can't comment on Liverpool. I have spent a short time in Manchester before. Uh, I enjoyed Manchester. It's a very lively city. It has lots of good clubs and it has some interesting shopping, there's some interesting shopping in Manchester, uh, there's some good markets, but I've actually lived in London and I feel like my heart is in London. I feel like a Londoner, and London has everything to offer. Again if you, I'm not particularly into clubs but if you're interested in clubbing then there are great clubs. There are some good pubs. Um, it has the theatres, hundreds of cinemas. The architecture is fantastic.\nTodd: Well, what about in London there's many parts, right, so if I do go to London what part of London is the best place to go and stay.\nSteven: Um, it depends on what you want to do. If you want to, if you want, if you want to see the sites then well you'd want to, you'd obviously want to stay centrally, I'd have thought. Um, most of the famous landmarks are in the center. However, if you're going to spend some time living in London, and if you want to experience maybe a more, just an ordinary side of London, then you can live a bit further out. I actually lived in the south of London, just below Brixton, maybe you know Brixton. I lived in an area called Strettom, and the atmosphere there is very lively, also very lively. I enjoyed South London. In the past South London had a bad reputation. People didn't think South London was a very nice place to live, but over the last few years the quality of life in South London is improved, has improved a lot. More and more people are moving in to South London and, well, consequently, as a result the prices are going up and up and up, but it's actually a nice, a nice area to live in, in South London I think. \nTodd: Oh, sounds good. Thanks.",

I'm so tired in the mornings.Ruth: So, you're tired in the mornings (Mm-hm) so don't you sleep at night?Akane: I do.

Akane: Yeah. Yeah. So it runs in the family.Ruth: So have you ever done that? Have you ever fallen asleep at work?Akane: Actually, well, I don't fall asleep when I'm teaching, cause its such a busy job (Yeah) but when I was working in an office, when I was doing medical research, it was such a boring job that I did used to fall asleep in front of the computer sometimes. It's really embarrassing.Ruth: So have you ever had an embarrassing moment when you've fallen asleep?Akane: Actually, yes. One time we went to watch the symphony orchestra  and it was beautiful music and I was enjoying myself but I just fell asleep in between.Ruth: Oh, no, Akane.Akane: Yeah.Ruth: So how many hours sleep do you normally get Akane?Akane: Well, I try to get at least nine.

One, it's famous for curry. Indian curry because in Bradford we have a lot of Indian and muslim people but also it's famous for riots because Bradford had major riots in England. It's had maybe the two worst riots in England for the past 10 years and that's due to racism basically.\nTodd: Really?\nMark: Yeah.\nTodd: Oh, no! Is it a rough area?\nMark: Yeah, it's very working class. Yeah, not so much money in Bradford, pretty poor. \nTodd: What was it like growing up there like, what did you do as a kid?\nMark: What did I do as a kid? It was.. it was tough. I lived on a government. Well, we call it councilor estate, maybe in America it's called maybe government assisted housing. So my area was pretty tough but always there were lots of kids around so we were always playing  football, cricket or riding bikes or sometimes causing mischief.\nTodd: How would you cause mischief?\nMark: It depends, maybe sometimes there's an old guy who nobody likes who lives near us so we go and throw maybe eggs at his windows and as we grew older we started throwing rocks at his windows, yeah.\nTodd: What would you do if you had a house now and some kid threw eggs at your house?\nMark: If some kid threw eggs at my house I'd probably buy a big dog and set the dog off the leash and the dog can chase the kids away.",

You don't like American football?\nMelissa: I'm more of a basketball fan cause when I watch it, I can easily understand what's going on, and when I'm watching football, everyone around me just screams and they don't really tell me what's going on.\nTodd: Right. But the Super Bowl - that's like the biggest game of the year right! So you go to Super Bowl parties, right?\nMelissa: Yeah, my sister's crazy about football and she has Super Bowl parties but I haven't really lived in America for the past three years, and before that I was in college and I never really went to one. How about you? \nTodd: Oh, yeah, I'm huge .... it's the biggest day of the year for me.\nMelissa: What's your favorite team?\nTodd: Well, my team is terrible now ... the 49ers, so they're never, ever in the Super Bowl.\nMelissa: Yeah, that's cool. San Francisco.\nTodd: But the thing I think is great about Super Bowl Sunday is it's really ... it's like the silent American holiday.\nMelissa: Yes.\nTodd: You know what I mean? Like it's the one day where everybody gets together and watches the game and has a good time.\nMelissa: Well, I'm from Philadelphia and Philadelphia fans of all sports are totally wild and crazy, and they just go all out, so a lot of my family members and friends go crazy about the Eagles' games.\nTodd: So have you ever been to a professional game?\nMelissa: I haven't. I haven't been to a professional football game.\nTodd: Now, what about college? Did you have a big college team?\nMelissa: No, I don't think so. We had a good basketball team at the University of Arizona - The Wildcats, but ....\nTodd: Oh, right.\nMelissa: Football, I don't really recall having a good football team.\nTodd: So when you watch the Super Bowl, usually the best part is the commercials, right? So, they have the commercials, so you watch those, don't you?\nMelissa: To be honest, I can't remember watching the Super Bowl in recent years.\nTodd: Wow!\nMelissa: Yeah.\nTodd: Here it is. I'm saying it's the biggest day of the year, and you don't remember ever seeing it?\nMelissa: I mean, I remember watching it, but they're just ... I remember like being more into the food that was all around me.\nTodd: Right, right. Fair enough.\nMelissa: Sorry. But if you invite me this year I'll come.\nTodd: Oh, cool.",

Is that right?\n                              Mark: Yeah, I started studying Aikido when I was about 15 years old.\nMike: And what got you interested in Aikido?\nMark: Well, I saw a demonstration at a church one time and I immediately fell in love with it, and it works out great because I'm not that big of a guy and Aikido is a kind of martial art where small people can throw big people.\nMike: Do you get a lot of chances to throw big people?\nMark: Well, not recently, but definitely when I was practicing, when I was studying, it would be interesting because some big guys would come into the class and they wanted to show that they were very tough, and, but usually they were the easiest to throw.\nMike: Because they have the extra weight?\nMark: Well, yeah, because they attacked and they, in their lives, they're so used to using lots of strength, so their attack would be very hard and in Aikido, the harder you attack, the easier it is to throw.\nMike: Now, what interests you, or what do you like the most about Aikido?\nMark: Well, I guess at first, like any martial art, I just like the idea of I can defend myself if someone attacks me, but later, I just really enjoyed the exercise of it, and you learn some really cool techniques that, how to take someone off balance or to throw them and it's really easy after you study it for awhile. \nMike: Interesting.

        "transcript": "Sarah: Okay, John, let's talk about fashion. You know, I have students and I think sometimes they don't, they don't dress appropriately for the classroom.\nJohn: Oh yeah. Sometimes, it looks like students are wearing the clothes which they will plan to wear at night, to go out and go to a party with friends. \nSarah: Yeah. So actually, I think school uniforms are great. I would make the teachers wear the school uniform, too. \nJohn: I agree with you. \nSarah: Because I think when we talk about appropriate clothing, I think girls very often take most of the blame for that. But I think it's our society, and we can fix the problem by having a uniform for girls and boys and teachers, and we can feel like part of a team. \nJohn: I know there are a lot of problems of school uniform. First of all, students don't want to all dress the same. \nSarah: Hmm. \nJohn: But there's other problems. Usually, when schools have a uniform, the boys wear pants and the girls have to wear a dress or a skirt. I don't think that's fair. \nSarah: I agree. I don't think that's fair either. I think a lot of schools these days they can let the girls choose. And so the girls can wear shorts or pants. \nJohn: Well, that's good. I think even beyond the pants or a skirt issue, there should be some flexibility to customize your uniform, whether you want to wear shirts that are a different color, even if they're in the same style. Or you want to have some pins or patches or some other accessories. \nSarah: Do you think as a teacher, would you say something to your student if your student if your student came to class and maybe, for example, it was a boy and his pants were very low and you could see his underwear. Or maybe it was a girl and you thought, \"Oh no, her shorts are a little too short.\" What do you think you would do? \nJohn: Hmm, wow, that's a difficult question. I have to say, I don't think I have been in that situation. I guess I'm lucky enough my students haven't pushed the limit too far. But I feel that I would say something if a student came to class in clothing that was, in my opinion, too inappropriate. I would ask them to, probably to, if not leave the class, at least don't wear clothes like that next time. \nWhat about you?\nSarah: Well, I had a student, and he came to class with a jacket. And it looks like a very expensive jacket but it had a very bad word written on the jacket. \nJohn: Oh. \nSarah: And after class finished, I told him to, \"Wait, please.\" And I told him that he probably shouldn't wear that jacket to class, or maybe, he shouldn't wear it anymore at all. It just isn't very appropriate. And he came to class next time and he had the jacket but he had taken it to a shop and they had taken the bad word off of the jacket. \nAnd so, I was very happy to see that, that he changed his behavior and now he could dress the way he liked but also be appropriate. \nJohn: Well, that sounds very good. That's very effective.",

It was one of the first European cities I went to, and it was so different from America, and I thought the architecture downtown was really beautiful.Anita: So what was your first impression when you got there?Todd: Well, when I first got there, I had no place to stay, and this young kid came up to me and convinced me to live in his house.Anita: Wow!Todd: So they... his mother was renting rooms to foreigners, so I lived with a Czech family for about ten days.Anita: Really, so did you eat Czech food?Todd: I did, but you know I don't remember anything about it. It was so long ago. It seemed really good though.Anita: I guess. I like it. So what did you do in Prague? What did you see there?Todd: Well, of course I went to the downtown area which had the castle and the bridge and lots of the old buildings, and I just took local transportation. I took the... I guess it's not a subway or...Anita: It is. You can call it a subway. We call it the Metro.Todd: Yeah, I took the Metro to different places and I took buses and just walked around the city and I had a good time.Anita: Did you find it cheap or expensive compared to the States?Todd: Well, it was really cheap, but at that time I was working in Europe and I had no money, so I still was very poor.Anita: Hmm, I see.Todd: Yeah, so now... I was in Prague, you know, 12 years ago. Do you think the city changed a lot since I was there?Anita: It's changed very much. I guess since the fall of Communism in 1989, the city started changing at that time and it's still changing. It's become very modern. Of course the historical parts are still preserved. You're not allowed to build skyscrapers or very tall buildings. It's good because after the fall of Communism a lot of the buildings were renovated, so the whole city looks like it's new. It's old new.Todd: Yeah. Anita: It's very colorful. It's just beautiful. Yeah.Todd: Yeah, I remember, the city almost looked like a museum because the buildings were just so pristine and perfect.Anita: Yeah. It's... I personally just love walking through the streets. You can never get tired of that.Todd: Well, hopefully I can go back again someday.",

So first of all how many people live in Australia?\nMichael: Australia? Oh, there's about 20 million people in Australia right now. A little bit under but close to twenty. \nTodd: OK. What are the biggest cities?\nMichael: The biggest city? The biggest city is Sydney. Then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth. Most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia.  Perth is on the west coast but sort of of out there by itself.\nTodd: OK. If you had to live in one place where would you live?\nMichael: I like Brisbane. I had my teenage years in Brisbane, growing up in Brisbane. Maybe Sidney because it is a big city, but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine. \nTodd: Oh, nice. Actually, what is the capital city of Australia?\nMichael: Ah, Canberra is the capital city but it's not the biggest city. Sydney is the biggest city. Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get too crowded. It's a separate territory.\nTodd:  Have you been to all the major cities in Australia?\nMichael: I have been to Melbourne when I was young. Yeah, I have. Only a short time in Perth.\nTodd: OK. What is the best thing about Australia?\nMichael: The best thing about Australia? Ah, probably the friendly people. The relaxed attitude and we like visitors from other cultures. \nTodd: Oh, cool. How are Australians different than other people? How are they unique?\nMichael: How are Australians unique? I would say that we're more fun-loving maybe or accepting of other people. We don't mind making new friends  actually and conversing with other people.\nTodd: Yeah, that's good. That's nice. OK. Thanks a lot Micheal.\nMichael: No worries.",

What are three or four places that you must see in New Zealand?Monica: Oh, OK, three or four places you must see. Well, it depends what you're looking for really. I think a lot of people that come to New Zealand enjoy an outdoor lifestyle, so there's lots of outdoor activities and places you can go to to enjoy in New Zealand. Personally, I find the South Island of New Zealand very scenic in comparison to the North Island, so for me, a must-do is the West Coast of the South Island. It's very pretty.Todd: The West Coast.Monica: Yeah. In particular, there's two glaciers. Franz Joseph and Fox Glaciers, which are very stunning to look at, and you can either have a look at them by foot, or you can pay for a helicopter ride that takes you up and shows you an ariel view of them.Todd: Now, do people ever walk across the glaciers?Monica: There are guides that can walk you across. Yeah, I haven't done it personally, but it is possible.Todd: So what else would you recommend for New Zealand? What other places should people see?Monica: I think if you want to see ... let me think ... rural New Zealand. It's quite a nice idea to drive the length of the country and then you can see the interesting farming that is taking place, in particular in the South Island. The lower part of the South Island, and a lot of the North Island as well. There's a lot of sheep in New Zealand and there's a lot of cattle as well, so I think it's interesting to go for a drive to see that firsthand.Todd: So, you just start up in Auckland in the north and drive all the way down south?Monica: Yeah, well, there's many ways you can do it, but I recommend one way of doing it is too arrive in Auckland and to have an experience of a big city, well a big city for New Zealand, and then drive down the center of the North Island and maybe have a farming experience somewhere. There's a lot of farm stay opportunities available for tourists who come to New Zealand, so depending on how you do it. You might want to stay two or three days with a family and experience a farming lifestyle. So that's, yeah, one thing I'd recommend. And another is to maybe go to a city like Rotorua which is really in the center of the North Island, and experience Maori culture. There's a Maori village there near the Whakarewarewa forest which hosts a lot of tourists, and you get to experience Maori waiata which is Maori songs and you get to see the hot springs in New Zealand and thermal mud pools, so, yeah, Rotorua is a nice city to go and visit, and then work your way down to the capital of New Zealand which is Wellington, and I think if you want to experience the cafe lifestyle of New Zealand that's a good place to go.",

You already got the guy back to your house. Very forward.\nMelissa: Well, pizza and a movie sounds like pizza delivery and video rentals, so I see what you mean. I could always go out for a pizza.\nDoron: I like doing that but then on the other hand, I also like to do something totally strange and different, like when I was living in Berlin in Germany a couple of years ago, I met a girl I liked and I invited her out for a date, and she surprised me by saying yes, so I had to find something to do and I was bored of movies and pizza so we went to a restaurant near my apartment, but the restaurant was really, really cool because it was totally, totally black. There were no lights.\nMelissa: Wow!\nDoron: You just go in there and order from a menu in the foyer and then you get taken to a table by a blind waiter and you can't see anything.\nMelissa: No way!\nDoron: I think they're quite famous. There's two or three around the world. One in New York I think, and also in London and it was the craziest experience because you just have to talk, and I think that's really cool because you don't look at the person. You don't care if they're cute or whatever. You just really get to know them.\nMelissa: That's cool. Were there lot's of people there?\nDoron: It was packed. You had to make a reservation. It was really, really packed.\nMelissa: How could you find your way to the restroom?\nDoron: You had to ask. You had to ring a little bell and then a blind waiter would come and take you.\nMelissa: What do you mean a blind waiter?\nDoron: All of the waiters and the waitresses, and the waiting staff, they were all blind or partially sighted.\nMelissa: Oh, really.\nDoron: Not the chefs. I think the chefs could see.\nMelissa: Oh, OK.\nDoron: But the staff there, they were partially sighted.\nMelissa: Oh, that's interesting.\nDoron: So they learned the room really well because they could see and they were your guides. It was a really interesting date, just ...\nMelissa: It's interesting just from the view point of experiencing what it would be like to be blind because I think people don't get to experience that enough.\nDoron: Exactly, and to know that maybe when you see someone blind in the street, you think, ah, poor guy, poor girl, but then all of a sudden, they're the ones that know their way around and you rely on them.\nMelissa: Yeah, that's really cool.",

You got nice kids?\nMarion: I have a mixuture so, but mainly they're quite good children. They're mostly very nice, but there are always going to be a few who are a bit naughty.\nTodd: So what do the naughty students do to be naughty?\nMarion: Well, in my class naughty students don't pay attention when I speak sometimes, or they talk to their friend next to them when they should be listening or writing or doing something else. I don't mind if they talk to each other about what we're doing but if they are talking about what was on TV last night so something like that I don't like it, unless they do it in English. If they can that's fine.\nTodd: Well, what do you do if your students are bad, are naughty? How do you discipline them?\nMarion: I hit them....No, I don't.\nTodd: You do not.\nMarion: I'm joking, I'm joking. Well, I have quite small classes, so it's quite easy. I'll just either call their name or walk down to their seat and if everybody is working on something, I'll talk to them about their work and see what they're doing, if they have any problems, that kind of thing and then if it gets worse, then sometimes they have to stand up, or if they are really, really naughty, and don't do any work, they'll have to come back and see me after school, and finish their work, then.\nTodd: So are you a strict teacher or a friendly teacher?\nMarion: I'm more of a friendly teacher, but with a couple of classes, I've become a strict teacher because I have to be, but mostly a friendly teacher I think.\nTodd: Who are easier to teach, the junior high students or the high school students?\nMarion: Probably the junior high because their more enthusiastic about English. They get quite excited about coming to our classes, and like I said they are small classes so it's easier and better for them to because they have more chance to speak and to use English.",

        "transcript": "Erina: So Mike, you know the other day my friends and I were talking about ideal hotels. What is your ideal hotel?\nMike: Well, there are many hotels that would appeal to me but I'd say my ideal hotel would number one have to have a gorgeous view from the room. And if we're talking about idealistic, I would choose a hotel that is suspended over the water, just off the beach. And my ideal hotel would be not a hotel where the rooms are all connected but rather rooms being separate villas or bungalows and those villas to be situated just above the water so when you wake up in the morning, you're literally above the water already. You're already on the beach and to get from your room to the beach you have to walk out and you wade in the water until you get to the beach, so a place like that, definitely my ideal hotel would be, you know, something like that. \nMy ideal hotel would have to be situated in nature and I would really love it to have a location that would provide me with opportunities to do a lot of cool activities. You know, perhaps adventure stuff in nature dealing with animals that type of thing, being able to see the local color of the area. So that would probably be my ideal hotel. One other point I would like to make is that the hotel would have to have unbelievable food and I think a hotel with good food and not just good food but a lot of options for food. So when you wake up in the morning and you go for breakfast buffet, you have a choice of virtually any different type of food that there is. A lot of good hotels are limited to what kind of food they offer even if the food is high quality so that would be another aspect for me that would be quite important for my ideal hotel.Erina: Yeah, it sounds like a nice hotel what you just described.Mike: Yeah, absolutely.",

It’s a great place but it’s really cold this time of year.\nMary: It is, but if you’ve lived here a long time you get used to it. A lot of people from the South get really chilly when the temperature gets around 50 and right now that’s, that’s actually sounding pretty good because a Minnesotan will probably just be wearing a lightweight jacket when it is about 50 degrees, but we’re OK with that. You know it gets to be kind of fun when you have a big snow fall and you go outside with all your neighbors, pushing cars out of the snow drift and kind of enjoying it that way so we have a lot of fun with it being cold and snowy and you have to make some fun on the inside of your house too, you know. A lot of people have fireplaces, so there’s a way to enjoy being inside for long stretches of time and opposed to just kind of, I guess, being locked in and not being able to enjoy house or that kind of thing.\nAdrienne: What do you do to warm up in the winter?\nMary: Well, there’s always sweaters. You know we like our sweaters here, that keeps us warm. Actually, you can get pretty warm outside. A lot of people enjoy cross-country skiing which I do from time-to-time and the more you exercise outside, you can actually get pretty warm doing it even though the temperature is cold, but as far as being indoors, that’s when, I think that’s when people start really kind of researching their hobbies, things they like to do, that’s activity that will keep you busy while you are inside the house for such long stretches and things.\nAdrienne: Yeah, that’s true. I like to drink hot chocolate when I get cold. Do you like hot chocolate?\nMary: Yeah, that will always help, and tea, really enjoying my tea as well, but there’s nothing like, you know, hot chocolate and maybe roasting something in the fireplace and making smores.\nAdrienne: That sounds great.\nMary: Yeah, that would be kind of fun.\nAdrienne: Very cozy.",

And I was very, very pleased because I found a parking space immedately which was rather unusual. I did my shopping, which only took half an hour and I went back to my car, and to my absolute horror it was no longer on the ground but it was suspended in the air. I really did not know what to do at this point so I walked back into town and I went to the police station. \n\t\t              The police were very kind to me and I was very grateful for that and they interviewed me.  They asked me what had happened and I said 'I'm really sorry, I didn't buy a parking ticket' and they said 'We hadn't even noticed that!', they said 'Do you realise where you had parked?' and I said 'Well no, I have no idea' and they said 'Well actually you parked into the entrance to a car park and as a result nobody could get out of the car park because you were parked in the entrance'. So I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time then. It was very embarrassing: I hadn't seen the sign, I hadn't noticed the car park which was rather silly. Erm, but now my friends think it is really funny when I tell them the story. I also think it's funny but it was an expensive mistake!",

It was\n                                really, really interesting because you had the\n                                different cultures. \nIt was slightly Westernized but mainly\n                                not and you'd hear the call to prayer five times a\n                                day and there was so much to see and do and they\n                                were  really friendly there. The weather\n                                was great and then, after our 7 days in Istanbul,\n                                we went right to the middle of Turkey to a place\n                                called Cappadocia, which was basically a place\n                                where everyone lived in caves because it was so\n                                hot and that was so interesting to see their way of life.\n\nAnd mainly I think they just made their\n                                money from carpets, so we went into a lot of\n                                carpet shops. They tried to get us to buy the whole tourist thing,\n                                but they were such friendly, welcoming people. And\n                                I really liked Turkey and I want to go back and do\n                                  the coastline and more things but Istanbul\n                                and Turkey in general is a place I'd recommend.",

        "transcript": "Eli\nI have a few main ambitions at the moment. I think the first and foremost ones, seeing as I'm in Japan at the moment studying Japanese, would to be actually to be able to speak the language, but I think that's pretty far-fetched ambition at the moment at the rate I'm going. I think to actually learn this language properly you'd have to live here and be studying at least a year to get to know the language and then another year to get fluent, get the speed up, get the slang in, so I mean I think that's one of my life ambitions is to learn Japanese. I can't speak any other languages so just to be able to speak another language would be amazing. I think English, English speaking people have, well, a sort of bad arrogance that everyone else speaks English and so why bother to learn another language. It's not like people in other European countries where, like from a very young age they learn English. They can speak English, maybe French, Spanish, and Italian. Once you got one language under your belt it seems to be a lot easier to pick up other languages. So that's one of the things I'd like to do. My other main wish at the moment, which I hopefully I'm going to turn into a reality when I return home is to actually get a job in the animation industry. I did my degree in that and it's been something that I've, you know, I've been waiting to actually get to the job stage, the job stage for so long now. Before I came to Japan, I was working, but in a graphic design job which is not what I'm actually wanting to do, so I think my, you know, number one wish at the moment, apart from the Japanese, is to actually be there in the industry I want to be working in, working the way I want to work, you know doing what I do for fun, as a job. That's my sort of number one ambition. I mean obviously making money is nice but I think at the moment the most important thing in a job is, you know money shouldn't be the first thing, you should really enjoy what you're doing. I've always said I'd never want to work in an office where you have to wear a suit, where you have to be constricted and constrained. You know I want to have my offices, sort of I mean, the environments I've, the work environments I've seen so far through friends and what I've worked in myself is pretty similar to how I think it should be: a group of more friends than colleagues working together on something they're passionate about. I think that has to be my main aim in life.",

So, in your house what is the one room you hate cleaning?\n\nAdrienne: Probably the bathroom, which includes the shower, the sink, toilet. (Yeah) All together.\n\nTodd: Yeah, so, why?\n\nAdrienne: I just think it's the grossest part of the house. It always seems to accumulate the most dirt and grime (Yeah) pretty disgusting.\n\nTodd: Yeah, it's hard to get the stuff off the tiles. (Right) You got to scrub and scrub and it's still brown or green or whatever color it is.\n\nAdrienne: Exactly. It's just a difficult place to get into to clean, and there's lots of small spaces to get into and.\n\nTodd: Yeah! In Japan it's weird because they have these little portable bathrooms, you know, they're all plastic so,\n\nAdrienne: It's easy. You just take the sprayer and spray the whole room.\n\nTodd: Yeah! I'm convinced that they drop those bathrooms in a, with a helicopter. They just drop them right in there. You got everything, you know. \n\nAdrienne: Easy! Convenient! Efficient!\n\nTodd: What about laundry?\n\nAdrienne: I don't like really doing any type of manual labor, but I don't mind doing laundry from time to time. \n\nTodd: Yeah, I like laundry actually. I like the smell of the clothes when you finish. \n\nAdrienne: Yeah, that's a good part of it, but I don't like to actually to do the work, washing!\n\nTodd: Yeah, actually, I like to clean. That's why I have this question. (Mm) I'm a clean freak. Like, I like washing dishes. I like doing laundry. Yeah!\n\nAdrienne: Yeah, that's not fun for me. (No!) I'd rather sleep given the choice. \n\nTodd: Like you can pay me and I'll clean your apartment.\n\nAdrienne: Oh, sounds good. Perfect!\n\nTodd: How much? How much would you pay me?\n\nAdrienne: Um, see, going rate for a maid these day, Todd?\n\nTodd: Maid! That's a sexist comment!\n\nAdrienne: It is a sexist comment! But it is, the going rate for a maid,\n\nTodd: Male cleaning attendant!\n\nAdrienne: I don't think that's what they're called. They'd still call them a maid service. Um, I don't know.I think it's about 15 dollars an hour. \n\nTodd: Ooh! You'd pay me 15 dollars an hour?\n\nAdrienne: No, that's the going rate. That's not what I'll pay you.\n\nTodd: I thought I was going to make some money!\n\nAdrienne: Well, I thought I was going to get a discount.\n\nTodd: This web site's expensive.\n\nAdrienne: Oh, right, right, right!\n\nTodd: So I need the money.\n\nAdrienne: Oh! OK, 15 it is!\n\nTodd: OK, but how dirty is your place?\n\nAdrienne: Pretty, pretty dirty!\n\nTodd: Ah, well, I'll take a look at it.\n\nAdrienne: You'll me working for the money, for sure!",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Abidemi, you were a teacher in Canada. correct?\nAbidemi: That's true Todd.\nTodd: Now, where did you teach?\nAbidemi: I taught in Northern Canada in a province called Nunavut.\nTodd: Nunavut.\nAbidemi: Nunavut.\nTodd: Nunavut. Wow is it like a native Americans  type ..?\nAbidemi: Yeah, and except we call them Inuits.\nTodd: Inuits?\nAbidemi: Aboriginals and First Nations.\nTodd: So what was it like?\nAbidemi: I really liked it. It was great. Very different from other parts of Canada. Very cold obviously because it's in the far north, and the communities are very isolated. Very few people live there. In the particular community were I lived, there were about a thousand people, maybe less living there. So everything has to be shipped in, or flown in by ship that comes in the summer when the oceans melt, and then in the winter, they usually fly them in, so food was quite expensive, housing expensive. Yeah, it was a different experience for me.\nTodd: Wow, what's life like that far north?\nAbidemi: Life happens, and it's interesting how similar it is to what we have down south in Southern Canada, the other parts of Canada. Like they have TVs and similar housing, but you do have to be careful when using water because the infrastructure is a little different. The ground is frozen, so they don't have indoor plumbing. They have plumbing but they don't have running water. The water has to be brought to each house almost every day and sewage also has to be taken away, so you have to be careful how you use water. That's one part. Also, you don't get access to all the things that you want to buy. Sometimes you go to the supermarket, and maybe all the bread is gone, or the milk has not been flown in yet, so you have to be patient with that as well, and you don't get the same variety of products as you would get in larger places, so yeah, and as winter ... As you get more and more into the winter months, it gets darker earlier, so maybe around four o'clock in the afternoon it's already dark outside, and by the time you go to work in the mornings too, when you're going around seven, eight o'clock, it's dark outside, so you're like ... it's dark a lot.\nTodd: Wow, what was it like being in an environment where you had so little sunlight?\nAbidemi: It was hard, but I kind of feel like, I'm used to it. I took vitamin D tablets to help with that. So, yeah, but because I was working for the most part, I didn't feel like it was too hard, and then during the holidays, I would come back down south to my family, so I wasn't there too much during downtimes. I did spend part of Christmas vacation there, and that was nice. They had a lot of activities outside for community members: ice sculpturing, winter games on the ice, Inuit games, different things like that. So it was fun. It was really an experience that was culturally enlightening. If I could say that for me. I really enjoyed it. I really, really enjoyed it, though there were challenges as well. The isolation and the fact that if you wanted to go to other places that weren't in the community, you had to fly out, so it's very expensive to go there.\nTodd: Oh, what an experience. Sounds cool.\nAbidemi: Yes, I loved it and I would like to do it again someday.",

        "transcript": "Cheryl: So, Nick, let's talk about touching and holding hands and physical touch with your significant other. Do you and your partner hold hands when you go out in the street?\nNick: We hold hands all the time. Initially, we ... when we first went out, holding hands was the first thing we did, and then progressively moved on from there to kissing, but holding hands was certainly the first thing we did in our relationship.\nCheryl: Do you remember when you first tried to hold her hand, or did she try to hold your hand first?Nick: I made the first move. We were sitting on the couch watching a movie, and I was getting a bit nervous, and I couldn't quite concentrate on the movie, so I moved my hand over to hers, and she reciprocated, and it moved on from there, so ...Cheryl: You know, that's funny that you bring that up because on of the most common moves that is made fun of in movies as well is when the guy takes a big yawn, a fake yawn, and he opens his arms wide and places it around the girl's shoulder, and thus embraces her, but he had to do it because he yawned.Nick: My experience, like my first hug was like that as well, so it was just a bit of an excuse for us reaching for something, and then suddenly my hand went around, and she didn't mind so.Cheryl: That's very good. And what about kissing? Do you kiss a lot in public, in the streets? Nick: Rarely in public, cause we find it makes other people uncomfortable.Cheryl: Yeah, that's true. I find that when I see couples kissing, or making out in public, I usually think to myself, Why don't you get a room?Nick: Yeah, you don't want to see that. You just want to be having a conversation with them or ... you don't want them to be constantly distracted.",

Anita: I am from the Czech Republic.Todd: Oh, and what city?Anita: Ah, from the capitol city, Prague.Todd: Oh, that's a beautiful city.Anita: Yes, it is. Todd: Can you talk a little bit about your city?Anita: OK, Prague is a very historical city. It's got many, many old buildings. It's very popular among foreign tourists, especially. The main attraction is the Prague Castle, which is right in the city center. That's where the President has his office.Todd: Inside the castle?Anita: Yeah, in the castle.Todd: That's really cool.Anita: Yes, yeah, it's really beautiful. Of course you can't go into his offices, but you can go into the premises of the castle and walk around and there's a very big cathedral right in the middle of the castle and it's absolutely gorgeous.Todd: Now, actually, I saw the castle many years ago, about 12 years ago, and if memory serves it was built by the Romans? Or am I wrong?Anita: I'm not very good in history, so I'm sorry.Todd: OK, I...Anita: I'm not sure.Todd: I'm probably very wrong.Anita: But, one of our late last kings. He was an emperor of Rome as well.Todd: Oh, I see.Anita: A Roman Emperor.Todd: Ah, so maybe that's it.Anita: Something to do with Rome. Anyway.Todd: Somebody will probably write me now and tell me the history. And there's also a really famous bridge correct?Anita: The Charles Bridge. Exactly.Todd: Right.Anita: The Charles Bridge.Todd: So, it must be nice to be living in a city with so many beautiful buildings and history.Anita: It is. You know, I mean, of course it depends where in the city you go because the city center is the historical part but when you go to the outskirts of the city, that's where it is... that's where you get buildings from the Communist era, so it's not colorful. It's all grey. It's all one style and it can get pretty ugly in some parts, but if you stick to the city center it's gorgeous. It's like a fairy tale.Todd: So would you say then that your city is a mix of new and old?Anita: Um, I probably wouldn't say a mix of new and old because they're not mixed in one place.Todd: Right.Anita: It's old in the center and then new, not modern... I wouldn't say modern, but new, Communist new in the outskirts, so it's separated. It's not mixed together, which is good because when tourists come they don't get to see the ugly parts as much.Todd: It's like in the States. Believe me, every city has it's ugly parts.Anita: Yeah, I guess.",

Norwegian people speak such good English. Why is that?\" \n\t\t\t\t\t          Personally I think it's because we get a lot of exposure to English, through TV, music, media, everything, and we don't dub movies and TV programs like they do in many other countries. We get subtitles. And the same with music. English music is very, very popular. Probably more popular that Norwegian music, and I guess as well the education system provides us with really good, you know, teaching so, I mean all those combined together, you know, creates, how to say.                              \n\t\t\t\t              Todd: Super speakers!\n\t\t\t\t              Christian: I don't know super speakers.

I hope in the future I can be a math teacher. \nSarah: That sounds interesting. \nJohn: Yes, I think so.

Do you study online?\nJohn: That's exactly right. I study online from various websites and these websites connect you to free online courses from real universities around the world. \nSarah: Oh wow. \nJohn: Yeah. So I signed up for a free algebra class from a university in the United States. \nSarah: Will you get a degree when you finish? \nJohn: Well you can. For every course you finish you can get a certificate that says you passed this course. And if you sign up for a series of courses, you can get a certification in a field like math or science.\n                              Sarah: Oh really? And it's all online?\nJohn: Yeah. And it's not only math or science, you can choose any field you want. I've been thinking of studying Spanish language there and you can study computer programming or history or law. \nSarah: Oh, interesting. Maybe I'll try it. \nJohn: You should. They have different types of classes. You can study by yourself by watching videos or you can even have an interactive class with a real teacher and you can meet through video chat. \nSarah: Wow.

We've been married a lot of years, now.\nTodd: How did you meet actually?\nMike: Oh, gosh, we back when we were both students, at Arizona State University in Tempe Arizona, and I had volunteered to be one of the tour guides for new students, foreign students who just coming in for that school year, and it was the end of August, and it was very steamy, a very hot day, and I remember I met the students, there were maybe four or five of them at the Student Union for this walking orientation tour of the campus. It's a beautiful campus, by the way, and so, you know, I remember she was sitting on this bench and I went and, you know, she smiled at me and I smiled at her, and there was some kind of spark.\nTodd: Yeah, yeah, like a connection.\nMike: There was a connection. There was a connection there, and I, you know, we went on this walking tour of the campus and when we were you done, you know, I kind of reluctantly, sort of said goodbye to her and the rest of the group, and you know, kind of said, see you around, and I think the next day even, she went found out who I was and where I worked and she dropped in my office.\nTodd: Wow, that's pretty cool. That's pretty romantic.\nMike: It was very cool. Very romantic. You know the funny thing is, that particular bench, where we met, on our anniversary, 20th anniversary, we went back to the campus (no way) where we met and we took a picture of ourselves on the same bench because this is where we first met.\nTodd: What a great story.\nMike: It was very cool to go back there.\nTodd: So, in terms of your personality, how are you guys similar?\nMike: How are we similar? Oh, man, I think we're more different than anything. I think our biggest similarity is that we're both so different, in other words that we're both very tolerant (yeah) of people who are different and so we, you know we kind of get along. We have an understanding that's we're going to misunderstand each other most of the time.\nTodd: Right, right.\nMike: But we sort of approach that with a kind of humor and flexibility so I think that's what makes our relationship work is that we got that kind of agreement.\nTodd: So you think that's the key to any successful marriage?\nMike: Is not getting so upset at misunderstanding each other or kind of using misunderstanding as a way of getting to know each other. I think that is one of the keys.\nTodd: That's nice. Thanks.\nMike: Sure.",

It's good though.\nNicola: Is it ice-creamy or creamy or?\nCat: It's got, um, what is it? It's that dish. It's a custard, with a, they put the heat. A hot, like a flare gun. What is it? It's a heat gun over the custard and it makes the sugar harden and then on the inside it's all custard. If that makes sense. It's really good. It's nice, though.\nNicola: It sounds really good. \nCat: Yeah!\nNicola: Oh, so you'll have to meet yourself a Frenchman and get him in the kitchen.\nCat: I'll have to find one in the kitchen.\nNicola: Well, good luck.

Three from Japan.Todd: Who else did you have come to stay with you?Kate: The next one was interesting. She was from Kanto.. Kansai, near Osaka in Japan. And she actually…she was in a band, a brass band, an orchestra. She actually came to New Zealand to just play in this orchestra. She was a very lovely girl. She spoke fluent English so we had no problems in communicating.Todd: How long did she stay?Kate: She stayed for 3 weeks actually. A bit longer.Todd: You said there was one more…Kate: One more was Ayako. She was older, she was actually more my brother’s age so she spent a lot of time with my brother rather than with me ‘cause I was going to school every day.Todd: Oh, I see.Kate: But we still got on very well.

        "transcript": "Todd: Hey, Melissa, we're talking about big events this week and what are some big events that you really enjoy?\nMelissa: I like doing community events. I'm trying to get more involved in community events. There's a flea market this weekend.\nTodd: A flea market?Melissa: Yes.Todd: Oh, yeah.Melissa: At the beachside, and there's going to be lots of different eco-friendly stuff going on there, so it's kind of a mix of a reuse, resell your old stuff. Get new stuff for cheap.Todd: OK, so for people who might not be familiar with the term flea market, can you explain?Melissa: A flea market is basically a place where people can take old clothes, old utensils, forks, spoons, knives, things like that from the kitchen, and other housewares either sell them or give them away at a cheap price, and it's fun because the customers ... a lot of them like to come and look at all the different stuff and even maybe haggle some prices, so try to get you to give a lower price, or if you're trying to get rid of a lot of stuff you might try to get the customer to take two things for the price of one. Things like that. Todd: Yeah, right. Like when I was a kid I used to always go to flea marts, or flea markets with my grandparents, and what I thought was great is that you can haggle.Melissa: Yeah.Todd: Right? Cause in the U.S. you can't haggle at a store.Melissa: Yeah, exactly. And I like doing that when I'm travelling ... haggling. Trying to get a good deal, so it's fun to do it at a flea market when you're selling your own stuff.Todd: So, this weekend, are you selling or buying?Melissa: Well, I actually don't have that much stuff to sell cause I've recently moved so I've gotten rid of a lot of stuff I don't need, but I do plan bring some old pieces of clothing and things like that that I want to get rid of, and yeah, I'm really into flea markets and old thrift stores and stuff like that, so I just like to see what people have. If there's something cool, I might buy it.",

So if you wanna go to China I think the best season should be summer.\nBrian: Summertime.\nFanny: Summertime. \nBrian: OK, so maybe like June or July is a good time?\nFanny: I think July is the best time to go, because August there will be a lot of tourists there ... so July will be the best time because you can see the best view and there will not be that crowded.\nBrian: Now does it rain a lot in July? I've heard there's, like, rainy seasons?\nFanny: In the north part ... it doesn't rain that much but in the south part it does.\nBrian: So I should probably bring an umbrella and a raincoat?\nFanny: Oh yeah, I think so.\nBrian: OK.\nFanny: Which city do you want to visit?\nBrian: Well that's actually a good question. You know I've never been to China and I don't know so much about it. What would be the most interesting place that you can recommend?\nFanny: It depends on what kind of view you want to see, what kind of ... you know, especially in the north part, there are a lot of historical cities like Beijing, Xian you can visit. You can see the old China because there are other ... for example there is the Summer Palace. Have you ever heard of that? \nBrian: I've heard of it but I don't actually know what it is.\nFanny: Yeah, it's just a palace which the old Chinese king lived there. It's a very good place to visit because you can see the long history you know because China has a long history, so you can see that kind of thing.\nBrian: So this is a pretty popular tourist place ...\nFanny: Very popular. And also there is the Great Wall in Beijing \nBrian: Ah, I do know the Great Wall, I've heard of that one.\nFanny: Yeah, so I think a lot of foreigners are very interested in the Great Wall, so maybe you can go there and see ...\nBrian: OK, that sounds pretty good ...\nFanny: .. then maybe you don't need the umbrella then\nBrian: Fair enough.",

You have so many microclimates because you have the Andes ranges, you have the coast and then you have two ranges, mountains, it's got actually, it's called the avenue volcanoes. It's got key mountains. It's very beautiful. You have these subtropical valleys and then you have, you go to the amazon basin. You have the jungle. So you have the jungle from the coast, the jungle also going to the Amazon, and you have this beautiful area in the Andes, so it's very, very nice. \nTodd: Oh, I want to go! \nJose: Please, please come!\nTodd: OK, when is the best time of year to Ecuador?\nJose: Also, as I said the micro climate, that means that it depends on where you want to go. You want to go to the Galapagos the best time is from November to April probably. \nTodd: I don't want to go there now because you scared me because you said about the people going there.\nJose: Yeah, yes! But it's a very beautiful place. I mean if you go just like tourist, you're going to, it's fantastic, it's a unique place. You can actually swim with the sea lions and they are chomping next to you, very beautiful. But I can not separate nature and from the people, so that is my problem. I think Ecuador is a very interesting place to be. \nTodd: Well, I would like to go. I'd like to go Ecuador and learn Spanish actually. \nJose: Yeah, there are so many schools actually. There is a big business. Lots of music and culture. Mm, very pretty girls. That is the part that you like. \nTodd: Maybe!",
