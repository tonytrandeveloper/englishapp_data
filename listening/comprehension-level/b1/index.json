        "transcript": "Morning, everyone. Quiet, please. Right, OK. So, today I’m going to give you some advice to help you prepare for the exams next week. So, make some notes as I’m talking, please. Everybody ready?\nNow, while you’re studying, eat food that gives you energy. Don’t be tempted to eat sweets or drink cola. Sugar won’t help you study but fruit and cereals will. Apples, actually, are especially good.\nFind a comfortable place with plenty of light when you study. But not ‘too’ comfortable or you’ll fall asleep!\nTry and keep a positive mind. It is easier to study when you are positive and relaxed. Now, if you start feeling anxious, have a little break. Go out for a stroll around the block.\nDon’t try to learn everything. There isn’t time. Just choose the ‘important’ things, the things that’ll get you the most points in an exam. And if you aren’t sure about this, ask me.\nFirst, learn the main ideas and don’t worry too much about the details. If you have time, you can come back later and read the details.\nMake notes of these key points and read them, then cover them up and try to remember all the points. Now, it might be boring, but repetition helps you to remember.\nUse past exam papers to study. They will help you understand what kind of questions come up. There are plenty of past exam papers in the library. You can photocopy them and take them home.\nTake regular breaks while you’re studying. A five-minute break every half hour is usually enough. Get some fresh air and stretch your arms and legs. Drink a glass of water too. It’s important to keep hydrated.\nAnd, last but not least, good luck! I’m sure you’ll all do your best.",

Well, we know all about that from biology lessons.\nA: No, we didn’t learn much at all at school! They’re discovering loads more things all the time. Really amazing things! Did you know that only about one tenth of the cells in your body are really you? The rest are bacteria.\nB: What? I’m not really me?\nA: No, of course you are you, but you also have millions, or trillions, of bacteria in you.\nB: Eeeeuuugh!\nA: No, they’re mostly really helpful. Someone did an experiment to see if animals can live without bacteria, and he found that a lot of them died or had to have a special diet. Animals need bacteria to digest food, you see. So we’re better off with bacteria.\nB: Unless the bacteria are bad.\nA: Unless they are bad, but they’re nearly all good. Oh yeah, and going back to cells, do you know how many cells you have in your body?\nB: Quite a lot, I’d say. A good few.\nA: Yeah, but how many?\nB: I don’t know. I’m not mathematical.\nA: 7 octillion! That’s 7 plus 27 noughts.\nB: I knew it was a lot.\nA: OK, that’s an amazingly huge number, almost impossible to imagine. But the really weird thing is that most of the atoms are empty space, just air or nothingness. And if you took out the empty space, you could fit your body inside a tiny cube which measures one 500th of a centimetre on either side. That’s a box measuring 0.002 of a centimetre on each side. You’d be much too small to see.\nB: Mmm, I can imagine that. It sounds like something that would happen in a really bad Hollywood movie. You know, a mad scientist goes: (funny voice) ‘I’m going to extract all the air from your body’. OK, enough facts for one day.\nA: Don’t go! One last thing, did you know …\nB: No.\nA: Did you know that you probably have mites in your eyelashes?\nB: Mites in my eyelashes? What are mites exactly anyway?\nA: Yeah, they’re very small creatures, like insects, only not insects. They’re about a third of a millimetre long, so you can’t really see them. These particular mites live in eyelashes and eyebrows.\nB: But in mine?\nA: Well, maybe not. Only about 50% of people have them, and more older people. So you might not have any. Anyway, they’re completely harmless, they just eat dead skin.\nB: Yeah, right, harmless. I really would have preferred not to know that.\nA: Sorry.\nB: I mean, really!",

It’s a really expensive course. I’m not sure we can afford for you to take it again. Things are difficult enough as it is.\nBoy: I know, Mum. I’m sorry.

Why’s that?\nGirl 2: Well, something terrible happened this morning … (voice trembling)\nGirl 1: What? Sorry, take your time, and tell me when you’re ready.\nGirl 2: Well, I was playing with Bonzo in the garden with a ball, and the ball went over the hedge into the road, and …\nGirl 1: Yes?\nGirl 2: And Bonzo jumped over the hedge after it and he got hit by a car.\nGirl 1: Oh, no! And is he … ?\nGirl 2: Yes. We took him to the vet’s immediately, but there was nothing she could do.\nGirl 1: Oh, poor Bonzo. And poor you. I know how much he meant to you.\nGirl 2: We’d had him since he was a tiny puppy. He was like one of the family.\nGirl 1: I’m really sorry. At least he had a happy life.\nGirl 2: His life was too short!\nGirl 1: Well, yes, OK. I’m sorry, that was a really insensitive thing to say. I’ll come round and see you later, OK?\n\nC\nBoy: Hi, Dad.\nFather: Hi, how’s it going?\nBoy: Did you have a good day at work?\nFather: Same as usual, really. What about you? Good day at school?\nBoy: Yeah, pretty good. Except for one little thing …\nFather: Why do I have a sinking feeling in my stomach?\nBoy: Do you remember you lent me your phone?\nFather: Yes?\nBoy: Well, I was standing just outside school, texting Jack, and somebody ran past and grabbed it.\nFather: You let someone steal my phone?\nBoy: I didn’t let them.\nFather: No, I suppose not. But did you know that that might happen? Is that a dangerous spot?\nBoy: Well, I had heard of that happening, but I’d forgotten. Anyway, I didn’t think it would happen to me.\nFather: No, OK. Did you see who it was?\nBoy: No. It was someone in a blue tracksuit, and there are loads of people who wear those. But there’s a CCTV camera on the entrance. It might have got a shot of the thief’s face.\nFather: You reported it then?\nBoy: Well, not yet, but I will tomorrow.\nFather: All right. Don’t forget to report it tomorrow.

        "transcript": "A (Girl):\nShe lives next door and she’s always been really important in my life. When we were little and my mum was working she used to look after us. She’d tell us stories about her childhood. It was like listening to fairy stories, life was so different when she was a child. In her kitchen she used to keep a special dish with sweets for us, and she was always baking cakes and pies. Now she doesn’t bake so much. She’s started eating more healthily in her old age, salads and vegetables and things. It’s funny how she’s changed. She also goes to this special gym class for old people, it’s amazing. I don’t see her so often now, but she’s always the same person however much her lifestyle changes.\n\nB (Boy):\nHe’s four years older than me and that seemed like a huge amount when we were children. When we were at the same school we’d never talk to each other during school hours. But now we’re older it’s a lot better, although I’ll always be the little one, and that’s annoying sometimes. He’s taken me to rock concerts that I wouldn’t have gone to otherwise and when he was at uni I went to stay with him sometimes. That was really cool. It was great to see what real student life was like when I was still at school. Now that he’s working he’s really busy, but we still hang out sometimes. We go to football matches together because we both support our home team. It’s always good to see him.\n\nC (Girl):\nWe’ve known each other since we were five and we’ve always got on really well. Well, apart from that time when we fell out because we both liked the same boy. But he went off with Heather Jenkins, so we made friends again quite quickly! We both like the same kind of music and going dancing at the weekend, and when we were younger we went out on our bikes together. At school we’re good at different things. I’m good at languages and Laura’s good at maths. That’s good though – it means that we can help each other with our homework. Next year I’m probably going to study in London and she’s going to Manchester, but I’m sure our relationship won’t change.\n\nD (Boy):\nHis family moved in just a few houses down from us when I was about ten, and I still remember how excited I felt when I found out there was another boy on the street. I’d been the only boy, you see. The others were all girls. We were good friends from the beginning because we were into the same things: computers and football, mostly. But we had quite a few of the same hobbies for a while. I remember making lots of models of aeroplanes one year. Another year we took up fishing. We had all the equipment and everything and we’d spend ages down by the river. I never go fishing now. His family moved away a couple of years ago. We’re still friends on Facebook but we don’t really have much contact.\n\nE (Girl):\nI can remember all the details of when we met. I was wearing a red dress and I’d just had my hair cut. I can even remember what music was playing the first time I saw him. I knew he was special from the beginning, and I was right. We’ve been together ever since. Well, it’s only been eighteen months, and some people say that isn’t very long, but it seems like ages to me. We’ve got such similar personalities and so much in common. I’m sure we’ll stay together forever.",

        "transcript": "Zoo guide: OK, are we all together? Right, next we’re going to look at the llamas, but actually here we have four different animals which are all from South America and all related to camels. Llamas, which you have probably heard of, over here. And over there alpacas, vicuñas and guanacos.\nLlamas and alpacas are both domesticated animals and vicuñas and guanacos are wild. Llamas are the biggest animal – they can grow up to 1.8 metres tall and in the past they were used to carry things. Llamas are very sociable animals and live together in groups, in herds.\nTeenager 1: Don’t they spit at people, though?\nGuide: Well, yes, they can. All members of the camelid family sometimes spit. You don’t want to mistreat a llama; it might even spit some of the contents of its stomach at you.\nGroup of teenagers: Uuuugggh!\nGuide: But if you treat them properly they are not likely to. They respond well to being trained and they are usually gentle and curious.\nOK, over here we have the alpacas. As you can see, they are smaller than the llamas. They’ve got smaller faces and they always look as though they are smiling. Look at this one’s face.\nGroup of teenagers: Aaaah!\nGuide: The alpaca is famous for its wool, which is softer and warmer than sheep’s wool. There’s a big demand for alpaca wool from the fashion industry.\nRight, next to the alpacas we have the vicuñas. As I said before, these animals are wild and they are thought to be the ancestors of the alpacas. Vicuñas are very elegant and graceful creatures. Look at this one. She’s beautiful.\nGroup of teenagers: Mmmm. She’s lovely. (etc.)\nGuide: Have you heard of the Incas? The ancient rulers of Latin America who lived in the Andes? Well, they wore clothes made from vicuña wool – only the royal family were allowed to wear the wool. It is even softer than alpaca wool but vicuñas can only be shorn of their wool every three years. For that reason the wool’s very expensive.\nAnd, lastly, we have the guanacos. They are similar to the vicuñas, but larger and stronger. They are capable of surviving at over 4,000 metres in the Andes. When they are in the desert they survive by licking the water off the cacti and other desert plants. Right, any questions?\nTeenager 2: I think I can hear this llama making a noise.\nGuide: Ah, yes. That could be the llama humming. They don’t open their mouths, they just make this strange noise. They hum when they are stressed, or the opposite, feeling relaxed.\nTeenager 1: Can llamas live in the UK?\nGuide: Yes, there are quite a lot of llamas and alpaca in the UK. They adapt very well to our climate. They make good pets and sometimes they’re used for trekking. You go on a picnic and use a llama to carry your food.\nTeenager 3: Cool! I want to do that!\nGuide: And sometimes farmers use them as guard dogs, I mean guard llama. The adult males will protect sheep and hens from animals that might attack them, like dogs or foxes. They’re really useful animals.",

        "transcript": "Host: On ‘Star Students’ today we’re speaking to Peter, who is going to tell us about the Pomodoro Technique, a system to help manage your time. It was invented by an Italian man called Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. Now, he called it the Pomodoro Technique after a tomato-shaped timer that his mother used to use when she was cooking. Pomodoro is Italian for tomato. And this tomato has helped Peter become an A-grade student. So, Peter, welcome to the studio.\nPeter: Thanks.\nHost: Tell us about the Pomodoro Technique. What’s it about?\nPeter: It’s about getting maximum productivity from your available time. I use it for studying, but professionals use it at work.\nHost: Is it difficult to follow?\nPeter: No. It’s actually very simple. It’s about breaking down your work into separate jobs and then using a timer to separate your time into periods of intensive work and short breaks.\nHost: OK, well, that sounds sensible. So, how do you start?\nPeter: First of all, you should think about the task you need to complete. For example, writing an essay for homework. You need to think about all the stages of the task and write a clear to-do list on a piece of paper. When you are ready to start you set the timer to 25 minutes and you start working on the first item on the list.\nHost: OK … but what happens when the timer goes off?\nPeter: When the timer goes off you must take a short break of between 3 to 5 minutes. One 25-minute session is one ‘pomodoro’ so when you have completed this, you deserve a short break. You should try to move about a bit during the break.\nThen, set the timer for another 25 minutes and keep working. At the end of the next ‘pomodoro’ you have another short break. As you complete the items on the ‘to-do’ list you should tick them off, to give you a feeling of satisfaction that you’re getting the job done.\nHost: OK … I get it. Can you use any timer? Most people have timers on their phones these days. Could you use that?\nPeter: You could, but the danger is that then you can check messages on your phone or you start looking at apps. I use my dad’s kitchen timer and I make sure I switch off my phone when I’m studying. I get so much more done. In the breaks I sometimes check my phone but only if I’ve completed some of the items on my to-do list.\nHost: Three to five minutes isn’t long for a break. Is that enough time?\nPeter: Well, when you’ve had four or five short breaks you can take a longer break, and then you start again.\nHost: And it works?\nPeter: Yes, it works for me! It stops me wasting time. My work is much more effective when I use the timer. It’s like short, intense periods of work. I actually get my homework done a lot quicker now, which leaves me more free time, so for me it works really well.\nHost: Oh, I think I’ll give it a try. Thanks so much for coming in, Peter.\nPeter: You’re welcome. Thanks for inviting me.",

        "transcript": "A\nHi, come in. I’m Maya. Hello everybody. Welcome to the Grange Park Sports Centre. I’ll just show you round the centre and explain what we offer here, and then you can ask me questions. Well, as you can see, this is quite a small centre but we offer a lot of different activities at different times of the day. If you’d just like to come through here, you can see the main rooms. These are nice and light and airy and we have a very good air-conditioning system so they are warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Here we have classes of yoga, tai chi, Pilates and Zumba at different levels. We also have different types of dance class: jazz dancing, Indian dancing and Latin dancing. Oh, and we’ve just started offering flamenco. All our teachers are fully qualified and experienced. We have beginners’ classes up to advanced. Some of our students have been coming since we opened, ten years ago.\nSo, if you could follow me through here - mind the steps here - we’ve got the sauna and massage rooms. We have very reasonable prices for massages. And over here we have the gym with exercise machines. It’s quite a small gym, but usually there’s plenty of room for people to move around without any problems. OK, that’s about it. Over there we have the changing rooms with showers. You do need to bring your own towel if you want a shower, but you don’t need to bring a mat for the yoga and Pilates classes. Oh, and I must mention the café. It’s just off the main entrance. That’s very popular with our clients; we have a great selection of teas, fresh juices, sandwiches and cakes.\nRight, the prices. You can join for three months, six months or a year and that gives you the right to use the gym and go to two classes a week. If you want to go to more classes or use the sauna, there’s a small extra charge. For three months the fee is …\n\nB\nOK, let me show you the gym. My name’s Bill and I’m the main sports trainer here, but we have a team of four specialists who are always around to help you with exercise programmes and give advice about lifestyle and diet. We strongly recommend that you talk to one of us as soon as you sign up and set up your personalised training programme. So, through here we have the main gym. As you can see, it’s enormous and we have lots of brand-new machines. You can do everything here, running, cycling, rowing, weights … you name it. Although we have a lot of clients, it’s very unusual to have to wait for a machine. Over there is the area for weight-training. If you want a closer look at the machines, you can come back later. Oh, by the way, you can only come in here with trainers on. No outdoor shoes, please.\nOK, through here we have the swimming pool. It’s great, isn’t it? We’re very proud of it. You can use it most of the time without booking, but there are certain times of day when we have swimming classes and water aerobics. There is always a lifeguard in attendance who will also offer informal swimming tips. OK, just over there you have the changing rooms and lockers, and on the right are the bathrooms and showers. We have our own shop, here, where you can buy our own brand of sportswear and sports drinks and supplements. Right, I can see you’re impressed, and as I said, we’re very proud of our centre. However, I should warn you that we are slightly more expensive than other gyms in the area – but then we offer a much higher level of services and a very wide range of activities. Here’s a brochure with the timetables of the extra classes that we offer, such as boxing, taekwondo and capoeira and quite a few others, besides swimming activities: swimming classes, diving classes, water aerobics and water polo. OK, so have a look at the brochure, then you can speak to one of the secretaries in reception about the best combination of activities for you.",

It’s a new centre; it sounds great. We’re going to go dirtboarding …\nGirl: What’s that?\nBoy: It’s like skateboarding or snowboarding. You have a board, or deck, to stand on and wheels. They’re pretty strong because you go down rough mountain tracks on them. Steep, rough mountain tracks.\nGirl: Sounds a bit risky. Have you done it before?\nBoy: No, but I’ve done similar things. Anyway, we’re also going to go canyoning. Before you ask, that’s when you jump and swim down a river canyon. You have to use ropes and special equipment. And maybe we’ll go white water rafting too.\nGirl: Phew. It sounds far too difficult to me.\nBoy: They have lots of things that you could do too. Like zip-wiring, you know when you go along a wire through the trees or down a mountain.\nGirl: Go down a mountain on a wire!\nBoy: It’s really easy, and exciting too. You just have to hold on and enjoy the ride. Or there’s bungee jumping.\nGirl: Jump off a bridge on a long elastic band! Me? You’ve got to be joking! Anyway, I’m going away this weekend too, thank you for asking.\nBoy: I was going to ask. So where are you going?\nGirl: Paris! I’m so excited!\nBoy: Paris, wow!\nGirl: Yeah, it’ll be brilliant! We’re going to do all the sights, like go up the Eiffel Tower and take a boat along the River Seine and see the old parts of the city. It looks so beautiful in the photos. And then there are all the art galleries. You know how much I like art. I can’t wait to go round the Louvre and see all those famous paintings.\nBoy: I think the famous Impressionist paintings are somewhere else.\nGirl: Yeah, I know, they’re in the Musée d’Orsay. We’re going there too. And then I want to go to the Rodin Museum and see that famous statue, you know, The Thinker. And of course, if we’re in Paris, we’ll have to go shopping. Or look at the shops, at least. And then there’s the restaurants. Just think, French food!\nBoy: You’ve got a lot planned for one weekend.\nGirl: Oh, we’re going for four days, actually.\nBoy: Oh, four days, very nice. And who are you going with?\nGirl: Oh, just a friend.",

        "transcript": "Interviewer: Good morning. Today we’re going to talk about theme parks and we’re going to hear from Andy Wells who has written a guide to theme parks around the world. Welcome to the programme, Andy.\nAndy: Hi, it’s good to be here.\nInterviewer: You really have a dream job, don’t you, Andy? Flying round the world all the time, visiting adventure parks ...\nAndy: Well, yes, it’s pretty exciting. But it’s really hard work too, you know.\nInterviewer: I bet. So, what’s the number one theme park in the world?\nAndy: That all depends what you’re looking for. In terms of numbers, it has to be Magic Kingdom at Disney World in Florida, the most famous theme park. But the most popular park for people who like adventure rides is Cedar Point in Ohio, USA. It has the biggest number of rollercoasters in one park, 17, and three water rides. There are lots of other attractions too. Last year they introduced 50 animatronic dinosaurs. You know, life-size models that move and look real.\nInterviewer: Cool! Have they got anything lined up for this year?\nAndy: Yeah, there’s a new rollercoaster called the Gatekeeper. Well, actually it’s not a rollercoaster, it’s a wingcoaster. It’ll be the biggest in the world.\nInterviewer: What’s a wingcoaster?\nAndy: With a normal rollercoaster you are sitting on a seat with the track under you. With a wingcoaster the seats kind of stick out at the side so the passengers have nothing below or above them. You feel as if you’re flying.\nInterviewer: So it’s more frightening?\nAndy: More exciting! Way more exciting.\nInterviewer: What other attractions have you seen recently?\nAndy: I’ve just been to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at the Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida. It’s great! You know those shops that sell magic sweets and things in the Harry Potter books? Well, they have those, just like you’ve imagined. There’s a fantastic tour of Hogwarts School where you meet characters from the books. It’s so well done.\nInterviewer: Right, sounds interesting. In your book you have a lot of theme parks in Asia too. Can you tell us about them?\nAndy: Sure. Tokyo has had a Disneyland for quite a long time, which attracts a lot of people. Ocean Park in Hong Kong has also been going for a long time – that has a lot of marine animals as well as rides. Lotte World, a huge park in South Korea, has the world’s biggest indoor theme park. And then there’s Universal Studios in Singapore. That’s expanding with additions to its New York street section. There’s going to be a Sesame Street dark ride. A dark ride’s a ride inside a building.\nInterviewer: I see. New York in Singapore?\nAndy: Yeah, it’s weird, but it works. But the place to watch at the moment is China – they’re really expanding. Lots more parks will open in China in the next few years, including another one with dinosaurs in the north, and Ocean Kingdom in the south. That will have the world’s longest roller coaster and tallest Ferris wheel, as well as boat rides and a night-time zoo.\nInterviewer: Wow, so that’s opening soon?\nAndy: Yes, this year. I’ll be there!\nInterviewer: Have a ride for me, then.",

I'm calling about the invoice and the payment terms. I need a favour.\n\nJunko: A favour? What do you need?\n\nAndrea: This is a little, er ... difficult, but I need an extension on the payment terms. I know they're usually 30 days, but we're having some cash flow problems. You'd really be helping us out if you could extend it to 60 days.\n\nJunko: I'm not sure if I can do that, Andrea. We've got regulations at our end, and also have to manage our own cash flow.\n\nAndrea: I promise this won't become the norm, Junko. Actually, I also want to place another new order. The same size order as last time. It's for an important customer and they pay on delivery.\n\nJunko: I see. So your cash flow problem will be solved after this new order is delivered.\n\nAndrea: Exactly.\n\nJunko: That sounds good. Hold on, Andrea. Let me see what I can do. Yes, I think we can make an exception this time.\n\nAndrea: That's great, Junko. I appreciate your help.\n\nJunko: And we appreciate your business, Andrea. It works both ways.\n\nAndrea: Thanks again, Junko. Can you send me a quick email confirmation of the payment terms extension?\n\nJunko: Sure, no problem. We're happy to help you.\n\nAndrea: Great. And I'll email you the new order.\n\nJunko: Thanks. I'll keep an eye out for it. Talk to you soon.\n\nAndrea: You too. Goodbye.",

We've got a really diverse team here – people of different nationalities, backgrounds, religions, ages … and sometimes I don't feel we make the most of this.\n\nStefano: Yes, and even if it isn't specifically challenging, many people are simply unaware of the isolation that some team members may feel because they are different.\n\nBrenda: So, what does this mean? What are we going to do?\n\nNina: Well, we need to create a workplace charter. You know, one that promotes equality, diversity and inclusion.\n\nBrenda: That sounds like a good idea. But will people just see it as something the management team has created? Maybe they won't even pay attention to it.\n\nNina: I know. That's why we're going to involve everyone in creating it.\n\nStefano: That's a good idea. We could run some workshops and get ideas from the employees about how we can create a more inclusive workplace.\n\nNina: Exactly. I was thinking that before that we could run some team-building sessions so they can experience the value of diversity for themselves.\n\nBrenda: Yes, I like that. Many people see diversity as something negative, often because there are different opinions or ways of doing things.\n\nNina: Yes, I know, but if there's no diversity, then the risk is that we all work in the same way, think the same and see the world the same. This makes it hard to be creative and to innovate.\n\nStefano: I completely agree, Nina. OK. So, what do you want us to do?\n\nNina: Stefano, can you look for a successful trainer who specialises in running workshops and team-building sessions on diversity and inclusion?\n\nStefano: Sure. I'll be happy to.\n\nNina: And Brenda, can you find a fun venue? Somewhere that is quite diverse itself. Something that's not the usual seminar-style environment?\n\nBrenda: Sure. That'll be fun.\n\nNina: And I'm going to do some further research into how other organisations are benefiting from their diversity. I can share this with the whole team.",

        "transcript": "Hello and good morning! Well, we're off to a good start in the south this week, as most of the rain from the weekend has disappeared – just a few patches of cloud and maybe some showers here on the east coast. They'll all clear up by lunchtime, though. Over the next day or so, London and the area around Kent can expect a couple of isolated showers, but mostly dry through until Thursday.\n\nIt's not such good news for the north-west this week, I'm afraid: more wet weather, and not a lot of sunshine. Some of today's showers will be heavy – and even thundery in Manchester and across the Pennines. Leeds will escape the thunderstorms, with drizzle and light rain only throughout the rest of the day and tonight.\n\nElsewhere it becomes dry today, but with some foggy patches towards Wales. In England, tomorrow morning will see a dry, bright start in most places, with high temperatures throughout the week. We might see one or two thunderstorms appearing as the week goes on, with temperatures everywhere at 29 to 30 degrees. \n\nBy the weekend, unfortunately, the dry weather will make way for mostly cloudy skies and rain. The rain will move from Scotland, down towards the north and reach the south coast by Saturday afternoon. Temperatures, at least, will stay mostly warm at around 21 degrees for the weekend. It might feel like a nice change from the high twenties and early thirties we'll see in the week. That's all from me until tomorrow. Enjoy the mini-heatwave while you can!",

        "transcript": "Presenter: So, today's expert teacher is Gabriella, a university English teacher from Leeds. Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.\n\nGabriella: Thanks for having me!\n\nPresenter: So, I have to confess today's topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn't so bad. At least I'm in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it's like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.\n\nGabriella: No, you're not strange. In fact, it's really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can't ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it's gone.\n\nPresenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, 'Sorry, can you repeat that, please?', especially if I still don't understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don't do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I'm still lost!\n\nGabriella: They do, don't they? In real life, you've got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.\n\nPresenter: Yep, sounds familiar!\n\nGabriella: But, obviously that's not going to help if it's a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you're just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn't matter. But imagine you're at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?\n\nPresenter: I hope you've got the answer, Gabriella, because I'm coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!\n\nGabriella: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.\n\nPresenter: But how can you do that if you didn't understand what they said?\n\nGabriella: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, 'OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?' and make it a question. Or, for example, 'And which office is that again?' Break it down into smaller questions and the other person will naturally start answering them. That way you're controlling the conversation a bit more.\n\nPresenter: I get you ...",

        "transcript": "Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the first lecture of our new course in Positive Psychology. While some people may associate psychology with looking at what's wrong with us, and at what problems we have, there is much more to psychology than that. Positive psychology, for example, looks at how to help people become happier.\n\nThis lecture begins with a question: what makes a happy life?\n\nNow, I'm going to give you one possible answer. A happy life is a life in which you are completely absorbed in what you do. Now, how does this compare with what you and your partner said? \n\nThis answer comes from the work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and the theory of flow. Csikszentmihalyi is a psychologist who has spent much of his professional life on the study of what makes people happy and how we can find happiness.\n\nCsikszentmihalyi suggests the theory that happiness is not caused by external events or things that happen to us. Our perception of these things and how we see these events either makes us happy or sad. In other words, if we want happiness, we have to actively look for it. However, this does not mean that we should always look for happiness! Csikszentmihalyi believed that our happiest moments happen when we are in a state of flow.\n\nThe theory of flow can be summarised like this: when we are totally involved in, or focused on, what we are doing, we are in a state of flow.\n\nCsikszentmihalyi got the inspiration for this theory when he noticed how artists worked in a studio. They completely lost track of time, they didn't notice they were hungry or tired, and they could work for hours, even days, without stopping. Anyone I have spoken to who has experienced this state of concentration has said it's difficult to explain. The best way to explain it is that it is like being in a river and the flow of the water carries you away.\n\nFor the rest of this lecture, I will explore this theory of flow in more detail. First we will look at Csikszentmihalyi's life, and how it influenced his ideas. Then we will look at the conditions that go with a state of flow. What creates flow, exactly? Finally, we will look at activities that can help us achieve flow in our everyday lives. Will this course make you happy for life? Well, maybe. Maybe. \n\nRight, let's get started. If you look at the next slide …",

The dragon at the end and all the special effects in that final scene were amazing.\n\nWoman: I loved that part! But I still don't think this series was as good as the others.\n\nMan: Really? But you said you wouldn't want to miss it?\n\nWoman: I know, but still … it's a lot more predictable than it used to be.\n\nMan: But that's because the story has been told so well that all the characters are reaching their destiny now.\n\nWoman: I don't know … before, anyone could die at any time so it was exciting! But, this series, no key characters died and we all knew they wouldn't. When Jaime fell in the water after the dragon attacked him, we knew he would make it somehow. And … oh, surprise, Bronn jumps in and saves him.\n\nMan: They did kill some characters in this series, though. What was that one's name …?\n\nWoman: Exactly, see! You can't even remember who died!\n\nMan: Hmm. The only thing I didn't like about this series was that it was shorter than the others. Seven episodes instead of ten. Maybe they spent all their money on that dragon!\n\nWoman: Right! I don't understand why they did it, as all the fans would happily watch ten episodes.\n\nMan: I reckon that now they're not using the story in the books any more, they don't have as many ideas.\n\nWoman: That would explain why they're not being as brave with the story too. It's more like a Hollywood film than a TV show now.\n\nMan: So, is Tyrion still your favourite character?\n\nWoman: You know … surprisingly, I think my favourite might be Cersei.\n\nMan: What?!\n\nWoman: She's so interesting! All the awful things she's done and the way she's just aiming for revenge, even though it won't make her happy. She still surprises us because we're expecting her to have a happy ending where she sees her mistakes and becomes a good person. But she never does, no matter what it costs her. She's unpredictable because we just can't believe anyone would be like her.\n\nMan: I guess. You don't have to like a character for them to be your favourite!",

What do you need from us?\n\nEmiko: Hold on a moment. I think we need to decide between us what to do, to make sure it works for all departments.\n\nJani: Yes, exactly, don't worry. We're going to discuss this and make a decision together. Let's first think about the scheduling of each project phase. What do you think, Emiko?\n\nDavid: Can I interrupt? I think we should first be clear about the process we'll use to make the decision. How are we going to do it?\n\nJani: Ah, yes. Good point. Well, I think the best way is for each of you to give your opinion and then we can discuss and make a decision.\n\nDavid: OK. That sounds good.\n\nEmiko: Yes, that works for me too. I know we're still planning the structure of the later phases of the project, but I think we should begin phase one as soon as possible. We can work out the rest later, as we go along.\n\nDavid: I'm sorry, I don't think so. How can we start phase one if we're not fully clear on where the rest of the project will take us? We might make a wrong decision and waste time.\n\nJani: I agree with you on that point, David. However, we'll waste too much time if we wait until everything is planned before we actually start working on the project. I think we should take an agile approach.\n\nDavid: Agile approach?\n\nJani: Well, it means that we start quickly and then adapt as we go along.\n\nEmiko: That's right.\n\nJani: Carolina, you've been very quiet.\n\nCarolina: Um … I'm sorry. I didn't want to interrupt. I'm listening … and thinking.\n\nDavid: Do you agree we should get the plan right first, and then start with phase one?\n\nCarolina: I'm sorry, David. I don't think I agree with you. It's important to have a good plan. But plans can change, even the good ones – and business changes often. We need to be flexible, and we also need to move quickly.\n\nJani: OK. So should we take a vote?\n\nEmiko: Well, you're the project leader. Let's go with your decision.\n\nCarolina: Yes, I'll follow your lead, Jani.\n\nDavid: Well, I guess that's decided then. We'll follow your agile approach, Jani. Start quickly and keep planning the later stages of the project.\n\nJani: Yes, that's right.\n\nDavid: I still don't think this is the right decision, but I'm happy to go with the majority. We should add some space into the schedule later for additional work this 'flexibility' will need.\n\nJani: Don't worry, David, we will. OK, so it's decided then. We'll start phase one as soon as possible, and in the background we'll continue planning the later phases and adapt them as we go along.",

Wow.\n\nPatrick and Selina: So, what are you doing here?\n\nSelina: Sorry, you go first.\n\nPatrick: OK. What are you doing here? I thought you'd moved to London.\n\nSelina: I was in London for a couple of years. But it didn't work out.\n\nPatrick: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you ... OK?\n\nSelina: I'm fine! The dream job wasn't really a dream, you know? Um ... and London is great but it's so expensive. I mean, just the rent on a flat is ... uh … crazy expensive.\n\nPatrick: I see.\n\nSelina: So, I came back. I've been back now for almost five months. Living back home with Mum and Dad. Which is err ... interesting. Um ... but anyway, what about you?\n\nPatrick: Me? Oh, nothing new. You know me – 'Patrick the predictable'. I never left here.\n\nSelina: Oh. And is that ...?\n\nPatrick: Oh, I'm very happy. I'm married now. We've just celebrated our tenth anniversary.\n\nSelina: No way! You? Married? To …?\n\nPatrick: I don't think you know her.

        "transcript": "Presenter: Good morning, everyone. On today's show, we've got Chris Svensson with us, the author of No more nine to five, the new best-selling book about work–life balance in the current working world. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for coming.\n\nChris: Thanks for having me, Anna.\n\nPresenter: So, Chris, tell us about your book and how the concept of a work–life balance has been changing?\n\nChris: Well, in the more traditional workplaces, people's working lives and their private lives are, or were, clearly divided. People often work from nine in the morning until five or six in the evening. People sometimes stay late in the office and work in the evenings. This is called working overtime.\n\nPresenter: OK, and what else?\n\nChris: Well, in these environments it isn't common for people to work at the weekend or while they're on holiday. They can clearly separate their working lives and their private lives. And the evenings, weekends and holidays are free to focus on non-work areas of life, such as hobbies, interests, sports, spending time with the family and friends, and so on. It's important and healthy not to spend all your time just working, right?\n\nPresenter: Right! So what has changed? How are things different now?\n\nChris: Well, for a start, most people can now access their work emails from their mobile phones. So they are more likely to quickly reply to an important mail in the evening or at the weekend. The same goes for laptops. It's easier to access your work in the evenings from home or even from your hotel when you're on holiday.\n\nPresenter: That doesn't sound like much of a work–life balance. It sounds like all work.\n\nChris: Exactly, but this new mobility brings a lot of advantages with it. More people are now able to work flexibly, so if they need to leave the office early one afternoon to be with their family, they can catch up on work that evening from home or somewhere else.\n\nPresenter: That sounds good. So, what you're saying is that although traditional divisions between work and life are fading, many employees now have more freedom to do their work from different locations and at different times.\n\nChris: Yes, that's it.",

How far is it from London?\nCat: About 70 miles so that's about two hours by train. \nTodd: OK.\nCat: From Central London.\nTodd: So when you go to London you go by train?\nCat: Normally yes because you can't drive, there's nowhere to park. \nTodd: OK.

No biting, no fish-hooking, no groin striking. \nAnn: What is the fish-hook?\nNobu: The fish-hook is a kind of illegal movement that you use two fingers. Point finger and middle finger hooking your nose or eyes. Like that!\nAnn: Sounds dangerous. \nNobu: Yes!\nAnn: Do you ever compete?\nNobu: Yes, I compete a lot.

I mean, British people are renowned to be very polite as Japanese people are too. Japanese people are very helpful as well, probably more so than British people I would say. Mm, what else? \nTodd: What about the weather?\nClare: The weather? Well, it's been raining a lot in Japan recently so we could say that it's quite similar, although actually, when I was e-mailing my parents they've been going on about how there hasn't been much rain the past couple of months and how they think there is going to be a drought. That typical British stereotype of the weather is not true at the minute and it's probably wetter in Japan. But yeah, I think that climate wise it's quite similar in terms of temperature. It's definitely much more humid here than at home.\nTodd: OK. Thanks a lot.",

So even if I like the genre, if like whether it be science fiction or historical drama, if the story isn't good then I don't like it at all.\nTodd: OK. Off the top of your head, what's a movie that you really liked?\nTenn: Well, the Lord Of the Rings they've been doing I really have enjoyed.\nTodd: Uh-huh.\nTenn: They did a good job.\nTodd: Did you read the books?\nTenn: Oh, yes!

It's just very cold in the wintertime. It is.. it has four seasons and the nicest season is the summertime because it's really warm and people play a lot of sports. Tthere are some parks in Montreal and you can go swimming and hiking and biking and rollerblading. It's a very interesing city.\nTodd: Wow! Were you born in Montreal?\nAnn: I was born in Montreal and I can speak two languages. English is my first language but I also studied French in high school.\nTodd: So, were you in a submersion program, or all your subjects in French.\nAnn: No, I went to an English high school but a lot of people in Montreal are in immersion programs.\nTodd: OK. Since you learned French, what do you think is the best way to learn a language?\nAnn: I think that you have to like learning another language and if you have a positive attitude then you can find learning another language fun rather than stressful so I think that I had a few French friends and we would practice. They would be very patient and I liked the fact that I could communicate using another language because then you have another identity.\nTodd: You have your French identity?\nAnn: I do.\nTodd: OK. So what's your name in French?\nAnn: \"Mono e Ann\"\nTodd: Wow! I need to get myself a French name?\nAnn: Todd.\nTodd: OK. Thanks a lot Ann.\nAnn: You're welcome. Nice speaking with you.",

So when you had a teleconference for example, how many students would be on the air at the same time?\n\n    Annili: I guess around eight, in two different locations.

What can I do to lose weight?\nDevon: Well, I exercise a lot. I go running at least three times a week. More than that, I enjoy playing sports. Different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained.\nTodd: Yeah. Actually, one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot.\nDevon: Do you?\nTodd: Yeah, so maybe it's my diet.\nDevon: It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat. Maybe, I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between. No potato chips. No popcorn. No candy bars. \nTodd: That's pretty tough!\nDevon: It is tough but......Well, I must admit that I cheat every once in awhile but... \nTodd: Ok, I'll give it a try. Actually, you see my problem is that I like junk food. I have to choose, either I eat less or I eat a better diet. What do you think is more important?\nDevon: I think that if you are exercising then you should just eat what you want and eat less. \nTodd: Eat less. OK.

I was an international student and I studied education at the University of Sydney. Lliving in Sydney was fantastic becuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney. There are lots of great clubs. People were very, very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people  living in Sydney.\nTodd: How long were you there?\nAnn: I was there for almost a year. \nTodd: Oh, OK. \nAnn:  I travelled a little bit in Australia. I went up the east coast, up to Frasier Island which is a world heritage site.  I saw dingos running along the beach and sharks in the water. We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the West Indies, which is a bit further north. The further north you go in Australia, the hotter it gets. We were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky because I didn't have a diving license. I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really  spongy purple inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly. \nTodd: So, did you lose your finger?\nAnn: Almost. \nTodd: Almost. Ah, you're lucky. It's funny, you go in the water and you worry about sharks\n                          but not clams. \nAnn: Exactly. \nTodd: Will you be going back to Australia soon?\nAnn: I'd like to go and live there for at least another year. Probably I'll go back to Sydney or I may go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city. They have lot of museums and parks. \nTodd: OK. You got to choose real quick. Only one city, Montreal or Sydney, which do you choose?\nAnn: Sydney, without a doubt.\nTodd: OK. All right. Thanks a lot.\nAnn: You're welcome.",

It's quite different from Western style flower arrangement because in Ikebana's theory you can decorate one flower, only with one flower.\nAnili: Oh, really?\nReiko: The flower arrangement in Japan is not only decorating flowers but it's an art with flowers and space. \nAnili: I see.\nReiko: The air between the flowers and also the room and everything, it shows the space or even the universe in it. \nAnili: What's another Japanese art?\nReiko: Japanese art? Ikebana...tea ceremony! \nAnili: Tea ceremony?\nReiko: Tea ceremony! \nAnili: Tea ceremony. Tell me about tea ceremony. \nReiko: Tea ceremony. There's certain ways you have to make tea. Not only make tea, there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl.\nAnili: I see. \nReiko: Yes, with one piece of cloth and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that  you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl.\nAnili: OK.\nReiko: Yeah, so it's a complicated traditional procedure in a sense but..\nAnili: How do you learn that? Is that something that your mother would teach you?\n                          How do people learn that? \nReiko: There's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony. So you need to go to a school, yes, and learn from your teacher and their heirarchy and the organization. You need to pass each test to go climb up the ladder in the heirarchy. \nAnili: I see. Fantastic. Thank you.\nReiko: You're welcome.",

So first of all how many people live in Australia?\nMichael: Australia? Oh, there's about 20 million people in Australia right now. A little bit under but close to twenty. \nTodd: OK. What are the biggest cities?\nMichael: The biggest city? The biggest city is Sydney. Then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth. Most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia.  Perth is on the west coast but sort of of out there by itself.\nTodd: OK. If you had to live in one place where would you live?\nMichael: I like Brisbane. I had my teenage years in Brisbane, growing up in Brisbane. Maybe Sidney because it is a big city, but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine. \nTodd: Oh, nice. Actually, what is the capital city of Australia?\nMichael: Ah, Canberra is the capital city but it's not the biggest city. Sydney is the biggest city. Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get too crowded. It's a separate territory.\nTodd:  Have you been to all the major cities in Australia?\nMichael: I have been to Melbourne when I was young. Yeah, I have. Only a short time in Perth.\nTodd: OK. What is the best thing about Australia?\nMichael: The best thing about Australia? Ah, probably the friendly people. The relaxed attitude and we like visitors from other cultures. \nTodd: Oh, cool. How are Australians different than other people? How are they unique?\nMichael: How are Australians unique? I would say that we're more fun-loving maybe or accepting of other people. We don't mind making new friends  actually and conversing with other people.\nTodd: Yeah, that's good. That's nice. OK. Thanks a lot Micheal.\nMichael: No worries.",

My father is very much completely opposite that. He is a very big man, very loud, very funny, very boisterous. \nHe makes friends no matter where he goes. For example, sometimes he goes to Florida and makes all sorts of new friends. He'll just go by himself. He's a kind of a magnet to people. So my parents are completely opposite and they complement each other very well. My dad has a very good sense of humor. My mom is very gentle. Very nice. \nTodd: When was the last time you talked to you parents?\nJessica: I talked to them probably about two weeks ago. Yeah, everything is going well with them. \nTodd: Are you going to see them soon?\nJessica: I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February. Yeah, depending on when my brother can come in.\nTodd: OK. Who are you more like, your mother or your father?\nJessica: I think I have traits of both, actually.

My family actually raises dogs for helping blind people.\nTodd: Oh, really?\nMatt: Yeah. \nTodd: Wow, like how do they train the dogs?\nMatt: How do they train the dogs? Well, I mean it's a long process right? We get them when they're puppies and so we train them basic. You know, sit, come... really basic things. Then after they're about two year old they go to a different training school.\nTodd: Oh, wow. That's great!\nMatt: Yeah!\nTodd: Well, how many dogs do they usually train at a time?\nMatt: Oh, just one. We have our own dog and then we have a dog that we have that we are training.\nTodd: Oh, OK.\nMatt: Yeah, just one dog at a time.\nTodd: Do you ever see the dogs you trained like out on the street or anything?\nMatt: Sometimes we see them. They'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets. Yeah, you get to see them every once in awhile.\nTodd: Oh, wow! That's cool. Why do people keep pets?\nMatt: I guess the most important thing is companionship, right? So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what. \nTodd: Yeah, that's true. OK. Besides cats, dogs and fish, what are some other pets people keep?\nMatt: Well, I guess if you are Siegfried and Roy you can keep a tiger or lion. I guess all types of things don't they?\nTodd: Yeah.\nMatt: I mean, my friend has a snake. I don't know if you mention that snake, ferrets and insects, spiders...\nTodd: OK.\nMatt: All kinds of things. \nTodd: All right. Yeah, like there is so many. What are some costs associated with keeping a pet?\nMatt: Food is probably the biggest cost. But also if you keep the dog, particularly a dog in your house when they are puppies and we have a lot of puppies they'll chew up everything they can so we're constantly replacing shoes and you know, cleaning up pee from the carpet and things like that. It can be a hassle.\nTodd: Yeah, OK. Thanks a lot Matt. By the way, where are you from?\nMatt: I'm from the U.S.A., from Minnesota.",

In fact, I know this bus is from London because I can see the names: Chelsea, Sloane Square, Victoria, Charing Cross. These are all areas in London.Obviously, the bus is in London. \nTodd: OK. Have you ever been on a double-decker bus?\nSteven: Yeah, many times. When I was younger, you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities. \nTodd: Oh, really? How much is the fare?\nSteven: Well, it depends on the journey. It's..I guess it's not too expensive but the minimum price you would pay is -- for a short journey is about a pound. \nTodd: Yeah, who can you see on the bus? Can you pick out anybody on the bus who looks interesting?\nSteven: This girl here at the back that's leaning on the door, she looks really bored actually. Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go.\nTodd: Yeah. Is that how you feel on the bus?\nSteven: No, not really because I haven't worked in England for a long time so I haven't taken a bus for a long time. \nTodd: So,  you're British, do you missing them?\nSteven: Yes, sometimes. \nTodd: OK.

So actually\n                          this is really silly, I've never made one before. How do you make an\n                          omelet?\nKeri: Well, I can teach you how I make them,\n                          which is the same way my father and grandmother make them so it is a\n                          little special.\n\nTodd: OK. Yeah! Yeah! \nKeri: First you take some eggs and crack them in a\n                          bowl. Whisk them up,  so they're quite high and fluffy. In a hot pan, and you need a pan that's that's kind of small that the\n                          sides go up at an angle. You put some oil and heat it up, so it's quite\n                          hot. Then you take your whipped up eggs or whisked up eggs and\n                          pour them into the pan. As it's cooking, if you take a spatula and\n                          push the bottom layer of the egg to the sides and then to the middle so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan.\nTodd: Oh, OK. Wow!\nKeri: OK. And keep doing that until most of the\n                          egg is cooked. You should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it\n                            over. You'll only have to cook that side lightly. Put your fillings on\n                          the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the\n                          cheese. \nTodd: Wow. That sounds really good. \nKeri: Mm, it is. \nTodd: Wow. What fillings do you recommend? \nKeri: Well, if you want to do a real simple\n                          one, you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese. That's easy\n                          or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese, onions,\n                          tomatoes, mushrooms, anything that you like. If you want to make a\n                          spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg\n                          mixture. It's actually cooked in it. It's inside bacon and sour\n                          cream is nice and Jack cheese.\nTodd: Oh, OK. I'll have to give that a try. Thanks!\nKeri: OK. Sure.",

Hisa, you were telling me that you have a concern about Japan. \n                        Hisa: Yes.\n                        Todd: And what is your concern?\n                        Hisa: It's vending machines.\n                        Todd: Vending machines\n                        Hisa: Yes.\n                        Todd: OK. Can you talk a little about that?\n                        Hisa: Yes, as you already noticed, how many vending machines do you come across a day if you are on the street?\n                        Todd: Many, many.\n                        Hisa: I really do not think we need that many and then each one is really consuming energy, so that is my big concern.\n                        Todd: OK, so what would you like to see happen in Japan with the vending machines?\n                        Hisa: Sorry, what? where?\n                        Todd: Like, what would you like to happen with the vending machines?\n                        Hisa: Yes.\n                        Todd: Would you like more laws or..?\n                        Hisa: Number 1, it really aggravates the scenery. Yes, and then if each one of us take drink with us, we really don't need that many, each corner, or even one corner you really see so many kinds. And then that is, we can really evacuate so many and then we will have a safer, more space on the road, because even without vending machines, imagine how narrow our roads in Japan, even the walking path so narrow, it's dangerous.\n                        Todd: And you were saying that you can actually can see vending machines in very strange places in Japan, like very, very far places in the countryside? \n                        Hisa: Yes.\n                        Todd: Wow.\n                        Hisa: So, just one example is on the summit of Mt. Fuji. Yes, it's a shame. \n                        Todd: All the way on the top of Mt. Fuji?\n                        Hisa: Yes. So those mountain climbers are talking that don't make our mountains like Mt. Fuji. In other words, they are not to put another vending machine on the top of other mountains, because why we need it.\n                        Todd: Yeah, that's crazy.\n                        Hisa: It's ridiculous.",

Actually in Kenya, what's different from other countries, we used to make our own soccer ball to play. So, it's very easy.\n                        Todd: Wow. How do you make the soccer ball?\n                        Alex: We used to collect like plastic papers and bind them with string, around them to make something round. So it was like, you didn't have to spend any money.\n                        Todd: Wow, that's ingeneous. That's great. So were you a good soccer player?\n                        Alex: Not really. I used to like playing soccer but I was not very good, actually to tell the truth\nTodd: Yeah, me too. I wasn't a very good athlete. I mean I like sports but I was never any good. Um, so do you play soccer in Japan?\n                        Alex: Sometimes, until last year when I was in school I still played soccer. Right now, actually I'm not playing anymore because I'm like busy.\n                        Todd: Yeah.\n                        Alex: Yeah. You can't play soccer without a big group of people and everyone is busy right now so I'm not playing anymore.\n                        Todd: Yeah, that's a bummer. Like I always want to play sports but it's hard as\n                          you get older. When's the last time you played soccer?\n                        Alex: About one year ago. I think November of 199?,...2003, November.\n                        Todd: OK. Actually in Kenya do you call it soccer or football?\n                        Alex: In Kenya you call it football.\n                        Todd: Football. I'm sorry.\n                        Alex: Actually, I've been in Japan for sometime so I'm used to calling it soccer. In Kenya you call it football.",

Well, who's a better player?\n                        Dianna: I am for sure, but I told him that if he gets better than me while I'm away that he has to teach me everything he knows.\n                        Todd: Oh, that's only fair. OK. Can you play any songs?\n                        Dianna: Yes, I can play \"Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee\" and just the last part of the \"Star Spangled Banner\".

My dad's name is Robert and he's an interesting guy. He's retired now and lives in Oregon and in his free time he's building an airplane (wow!) Yeah!\nTodd: So can he fly a plane as well?\n\t\t                Kerri: Yeah, he has a private pilot's license.\nTodd: Wow, that must be pretty difficult. He's actually making a plane from scratch.\nKerri: Yeah. Well, he used to be an airplane mechanic, so quite awhile ago. But yeah, he's doing all the riveting, building all the different parts of the plane and assembling it.\nTodd: Wow! So when do you think he's going to be finished.\nKerri: I don't know. I got an e-mail from him recently that said he's just putting the tail section on soon. But I haven't seen a picture of that yet.\nTodd: Wow. So are you going to go in this plane with your father as soon as it's finished?\nKerri: I hope so. He's having someone else test fly it which made me happy when I found out. Although I trust his work cause he's meticulous but it made me feel good that someone else is going to try it for the first time, but yeah, after it's finished, when he's ready to take up passengers.\nTodd: Cool. Sounds fun.\nKerri: Yeah. I think so.",

It's the highest point in Java. One of the biggest island, well the most highly populated island in Indonesia. Ah, last fall, around November, I made it to Bromo and, there's a very high mountain there, over 3,000 meters tall, called Mt. Semaru and I decided to hike this with my girlfriend, Sara. Let me tell you, it's quite a hike, 17 kilometers from the base camp, through a park, very beautiful park, lots of trees, good swimming hole really really nice area, especially in Indonesia, it's so developed, there's a lot of pollution there. \n\t\t\t            It was really nice to see some nature there, but when you get to the park, we started out around 2 o'clock in the morning, camped for the afternoon, because the best time to go to Semaru is at sunrise. So we started off around 2 o'clock with a few Indonesian fellows and about an hour into the trip one of those boys hurt their ankle so our friends were stopped but we didn't want to end our hike so we continued up the mountain, it's still pitch black, we have one flash light between the two of us, and the path starts to get very narrow, and as you approach the actual volcano, you start to see all these markers of where people have fallen off and died, so it's a little unnerving and you make sure you stay on the path and then you hit the volcano, and it's all primus stone, all ash, and you're walking at about a 45 degree incline. \n\t\t                It took us about 4, 3 to 4, hours to walk all the way up this mountain, and our oxygen was getting short. It's hard to get your footing because it's all ash, so you fall down, you're gasping for breath, you walk another 20 meters, you fall down, you gasp for breath more and more. Finally, we got to the top, and as it turned out, it was a really cloudy day and we couldn't see anything.\n\t\t                Phil: Ooh! That's too bad. Sounds like a good trip though.\n\t                    Todd: Yeah, it was an experience.",

Can you recommend anything to me?\n\t\t\t            Phil: The best thing I did in China was go through Zhang Jia Jie National Park. That's Hunan Province, and if you like nature, that's really highly recommended. It's an UNESCO cite. It's easy to find on the internet, but it's just craters, gorges, trees sticking out of really strangely shaped hills, lots of caverns and very very few people there. It was empty when I was there. I had never heard of it before. I had just been recommended by a tour guide. It was spectacular. If you like nature and like hiking it will definitely give you a workout and you'll take a lot of pictures.\n\t\t\t            Todd: Wow, well, how big is this park?\n\t\t                Phil: Good question. I didn't see the whole thing, and I spend three days there walking different parts every day, so I really don't know the size of it except that it's massive. So you just went hiking and then you camped overnight, or did you just hiked for the day?\n\t\t                Phil: Just day hikes, the tour I had been organized with had rented us a hotel, just stayed in the hotel, slept there at night, and walked most of the day.\n\t                    Todd: Uh-huh. Did you see any wildlife?\n\t                    Phil: Some insects and some butterflies, but no, nothing, no mammals, nothing like that.\n                        Todd: Was the, were the trails steep?\n                        Phil: Yeah, but most of them do have stairs so, regardless of your fitness level I don't think it would be very difficult for anybody to, some people might be a bit slower than others but you should be able to make it up alright.\n                        Todd: So, where is this again? You said in Hunan Province!\n                        Phil: I believe it's North-Western Hunan Province.",

Just joking OK. I like windsurfing. That's my number one hobby, and surfing I'm in progress, and I like skateboarding but I'm getting old, so it is kind of tiresome. What else do I like? I like going to restaurants, going out, bars, restaurants, bar hopping.\n\t\t                Todd: Cool, yeah, I like to bar hop. Let's go back to the windsurfing, um, how long have you been windsurfing?\n\t                    Roe: Since 26, so that's 4, 5, 7 years.\n\t                    Todd: 7 years! Yeah, where did you first begin windsurfing?\n                        Roe: Kamakura.\n                        Todd: Oh, in Kamakura. That's a beautiful place. \n                        Roe: In winter, yeah, but in summer, it's, I don't know, it's questionable. \n                        Todd: Really? Why? \n                        Roe:Oily.\n                        Todd: Oh, cause the water is polluted.\n                        Roe: Yeah, cause people, a lot of people come from the city. They put oils right oil, and they go swimming into the ocean.\n                        Todd: You mean suntan lotion from people's bodies gets in the water and makes it oily. That's disgusting.\n                        Roe: Isn't it. You see the oil floating around in the ocean. It's kind of sick in summer, so I really don't windsurf in summer.\n                        Todd: Wow, it must be hard to, if there is so many people in the water.\n                        Roe: Yeah, but there is a swimming section and a windsurfing section, but anyway.\n                        Todd: So, did somebody teach you to windsurf?\n                        Roe: Yeah, my brother. Oh, your brother. OK. Did it come easy for you, or was it difficult?\n                        Roe: It is really difficult to explain windsurfing cause, I show you. Can you stand up?\n                        Todd: OK, so I'm standing up?\n                        Roe: And your holding your rig, and go back, you are like 80 kilometer and your body is more closer to the ocean and your body is like down here and like 80 kilometer and waves are like 4 meters and on a good day so that is really radical.\n                        Todd: Yeah that sounds difficult. I don't think I'm ready for windsurfing.\n                        Roe: It's pretty interesting though. It's free too.\n                        Todd: But the equipment must be very expensive.\n                        Roe: The first time yeah, but once you buy and have everything down it's free to go surfing to the beach so.\n                        Todd: How many windsurfing boards do you have?\n                        Roe: Two.\n                        Todd: Two. And do you have to do a lot of work to maintain them, to keep them clean?\n                        Roe: Not really cause out in the ocean just wash with the water, clean water, that's about it.\n                        Todd: How far do you live from the beach?\n                        Roe: It takes me about, about an hour from my house.\n                        Todd: One hour. Boy. That's dedication.\n                        Roe: It's like, how can I explain this, what are your hobbies there?\n                        Todd: I like running so yeah I run all the time.\n                        Roe: Right, but it's not, you feel like you are dedicating your energy to the running.\n                        Todd: No, No. Yeah\n                        Roe: You do it because it is fun. \n                        Todd: Yeah\n                        Roe: Exactly.\n                        Todd: OK, yeah, maybe I'll have to try windsurfing one of these days. I've always wanted to try that and surfing. It look like a lot of fun.\n                        Roe: Come. I have my board and my surfboard too.\n                        Todd: Oh, that's right, you have two boards, so, hey OK. Thanks and we have to go before it's summer. Now it is spring, and all the oil in the water, that's disgusting. I can't. I thought you meant like oil from ships or sewage from the city. OK. Oil from people's bodies.

What was China like?\n\t\t                Phil: China was an eye-opener. It's a very old culture, but there's not many new, there's not many old things around in China, through wars, through the cultural revolution, a lot of stuff's been burnt, a lot of stuff just's been knocked down. One of the few old things that is there is the Great Wall of China. It's very famous this wall, very big. They are doing some efforts to try and build the wall up again, but when I was there, I believe it was August, 2002 it was still mostly old stuff.\n\t\t                Todd: Yeah, what else did you see in China?\n\t                    Phil: Ah, I went to Xian and I saw the Terra-cotta warriors. Terra-cotta warriors were discovered shortly after Mao died in the late 70's by a farmer who was digging a well, and he was digging this well and he found all these stone warriors,literally hundreds of them, and it's a national treasure now.\n\t                    Todd: Wow! That's fascinating.\n                        Phil: Yeah, it's really an impressive thing to see. Those are the two really old man-made things that I saw in China.\n                        Todd: Was there anything else that was really spectacular?\n                        Phil: The Three Gorges tour was really good. Sadly they are all under water now because of the dam project, but I was able to go shortly before it was flooded and really, really enjoyed it. Saw a lot of beautiful things. Surprisingly enough the water was a lot cleaner than I thought and I actually went swimming in it.\n                        Todd: Oh, cool. \n                        Phil: Yeah, for, this is the Yangzhe River in China and if you've ever seen the Yangzhe, most parts of it, you certainly wouldn't want to swim in it, but these parts were pristine.",

Lao is a very poor country. There's not much industry, a lot of it's still mining, fishing, on the Mekong you still see women panning for gold, but my favorite place in Lao is a place called Luang Prabang, and it's, we really didn't do very much. There's lots of things to do. You can go to caves. You can take inner tubes and go down the river, basically we just ate. The food is really good, a lot of French cuisine, the Lao cuisine is good as well, but we just hung around, read books, and enjoyed our days because it was really, really hot, and really, really dry. This was in February.\n\t                    Todd: Actually, I've been to Luang Prabang and I remember joggin along the river and, just right outside the city and we would jog for miles and miles, on this little trail.

It's not so much, it's not as cultural as say Luang Prabang is, but a lot of people like to go there to relax, hang out. That's where a lot of people take the tubes and go down the river so, but once again it was so hot we didn't really do any of that either.",

I'd recommend going, flying in to Denpassar, and getting down towards Dreamland beach. That's at the southern most tip of Bali. The waves there, I'm a beginning surfer too, the waves there aren't very big, 5, 5, 4 - 5 feet, and just really nice people there. The locals are willing to help you. You meet a lot of Balinese young kids, 12, 13 years old. They're singing in the water as they surf. They're giving each wave names, so It's a lot of fun and there's no attitude, and people are there just to have fun. It's a good time.\n\t                    Todd: Wow, that sounds nice.\n                        Phil: That area of Indonesia is really nice. Lombok is nice too. If you are more wanting to relax, I would go to Lombok, and then go up to Gili Trawangan, which is a small island off the east coast of Lombok. There's no cars on the island. The electricity is a little dodgy. It might flicker on and off. Food is great. You get fresh fish all the time. Snorkeling's nice if you like scuba diving. You can arrange tours through several companies there. But, yeah, I really like Gili Trawangan and I would recommend that to anyone who wants to relax for a couple of weeks.",

The first stop, we went there from Singapore, just taking a bus and we ended up in Malacca. Stayed about five days in Malacca. Malacca's nice. There's a lot of history there. We learned a lot about the colinization of Malacca, the Portuguese and then the Dutch, and then the English and then the Japanese, and, yeah, it was a really interesting place. There was old St. Peter's Church. There's several Mosques. It's a good place to spend for a few days. From there we went to Kuala Lumpur. We didn't really spend much time in Kuala Lumpur. We had spent a week in Singapore and were pretty tired of cities. so we only spent I believe two or three days in Kuala Lumpur, just visits from shopping malls, the KLCC, the Petronas Towers, and yeah, that's basically what we did in KL, and then we went to the Cameron Highlands, and if you like hiking, the Cameron Highlands is a great place for you. I don't know, they might have 16, 17 different marked trails. There's a whole lot of unmarked trails. We spent a month there. I think I only went on only six hikes maybe during that month but once again we were being lazy, and yeah, if you're an avid hiker then you're certainly going to enjoy the Cameron Highlands.\n\t\t\t            \nTodd: Yeah, actually, I did the hike in the Cameron Highland once, and foolishly I started my hike at about 4 o'clock and I thought I could make the loop of the trail at the time, and the sun started to go down, and I was in the jungle, and I was worried about getting back, and I just made it back, but I was pretty scared for awhile.\n\t\t\t            Phil: You were lucky. Some people don't make it back. \n\t\t\t            Todd: Really? \n\t\t                Phil: Well, Jim Thompson.

I think he was maybe based in Hong Kong, but I'm not sure. Maybe it was based in Malaysia. He went hiking. I believe it was 1967, in the Cameron Highlands, and no one has seen him since. He's just vanished from the face of the earth. So, be careful if you go hiking there. Watch your step.",

But either way, they're doing it, so I think it would be really neat, I mean I've always wanted to say to my, you know, one day my kids, \"Ok, let's go to vacation on the moon...I feel like going out to the suite hotel you know.Let's go look at the stars\" you know a few meteors passing by, wouldn't that be neat..to say that and really be able to do that someday.\n                        Todd: Gosh, it must be really, really beautiful on the moon.

How about that?\n\t                    Roe: OK. That was right after graduating university. I became a salesman. \n\t                    Todd: Oooh, salesman! Nice. \n                        Roe: Yep, salesman. \n                        Todd: What were you selling?\n                        Roe: I was selling nothing. \n                        Todd: Nothing\n                        Roe: Nothing. Well, basically I was selling a membership. So, that's, it's not something people can see or visualize, but it's like just membership, so. \n                        Todd: Was it like a membership to a country club? \n                        Roe: Yeah, actually a private resorts and golf clubs.\n                        Todd: Nice. Was this in Japan or in the US?\n                        Roe: In Japan. \n                        Todd: Wow. What was the best thing about your job? \n                        Roe: Troubles! Cause I have to knock on people's houses.\n                        Todd: Oh, wow, it was door to door \n                        Roe: Exactly without any appointments and membership costs 5 million yen. Starting, starting costs. \n                        Todd: 5 million yen to start and you must have been in very rich neighborhoods. \n                        Roe: No, actually we just go to any areas. We just stop off at a station and we start from there.\n                        Todd: Really. Were you successful? \n                        Roe: It's a long story but to be honest with you, how many memberships do you think I sold in a year? \n                        Todd: Wow, I don't know. I will take a guess. In one year, maybe one, two a week, so my guess is, I don't know, a hundred. \n                        Roe: One! \n                        Todd: One! One! \n                        Roe: Can you believe it! \n                        Todd: So you must, so you remember the lucky person? Probably still remember that person\n                        Roe: And you know what, the person who bought my membership, is who? My father. \n                        Todd: Ooh, that's a tough job. \n                        Roe: It was rough, really. It was really rough. \n                        Todd: That's a lot of rejection, every day. No, no, no \n                        Roe: I know, I mean if you think about it, that's natural though, I mean 5 million yen. and I can't really show the place, cause I can't take the person to the place. all I can do is show the picture and speak and that was right after the bubble economy bursted, so nobody had really, nobody had money, so. \n                        Todd: Wow, man so were you depressed? Were you sad?\n                        Roe: It was very interesting. It was hard to motivate myself. The people would call the police, and call me like a robber Yeah, yeah, cause I had to like open the gate and run to the door and stick my leg so that they won't shut the door. \n                        Todd: Seriously\n                        Roe: Yeah, that's how you do it. Door to door sells. \n                        Todd: Wow, that's, that's a tough job. I don't think I could do a job, what's your job now? What do you do now? \n                        Roe: I am, I work for Yokohama city and I am in a place called Yokohama Convention Bureau. It's a city job. \n                        Todd: OK, so the Yokohama Convention Bureau.  OK, so you deal with foreigners, naturally cause it's in English. \n                        Roe: And travellers and visitors and what have you.\n                        Todd: Do you like your job now? \n                        Roe: Interesting! Like I said I meet talk to about over 2,000 people a day, so it's kind of tiring though. \n                        Todd: Wow, 2,000 people a day. \n                        Roe: About 200 people an hour. My office is at the station. Yokohama station. Right out of the gate of the JR, so people are going to stop by. \n                        Todd: You, that's a lot of talking. You must be tired of talking. \n                        Roe: I am tired.",

Does the meat have to\n                                go on a tortilla or something? \nAnna: Yeah, on the tortilla. \nTodd: Oh, OK. \nAnna: And you can add on top. \nTodd: OK, what kind of\n                                tortillas do you use, flour or corn? \nAnna: I like corn, but my\n                                husband John, he likes flour.

        "transcript": "Hi! I've lived in Spain and Japan and so I'm just\n                                going to talk about a few differences between the\n                                two countries that I've found. In Spain, when you\n                                meet somebody you give them two kisses, first on\n                                the left and then on the right cheek, and in Japan\n                                there is definitely no public kissing at all, so\n                                that is definitely a faux pas, here. In Japan you\n                                just bow or you hand shake which is normal. \nIn Spain, also the people are very caliente,\n                                which means they are very warm and very open and extremely loud, extremely loud. In fact, when I\n                                was living in my host family's house, the first\n                                few months when my Spanish wasn't the best, I\n                                thought my host mom was mad about everything. I\n                                thought she was just ... I thought she was at the\n                                  point of just leaving the entire household for\n                                    good, and then when I realized what she was\n                                saying, it was just like, \"When are you going to\n                                take out the dog?\" but screaming this mind you, or\n                                \"Let's do your homework!\" or even just like, \"Pass\n                                me the salt!\" Everything was screaming. Japan\n                                people are very quiet. They definitely don't\n                                scream about things like that.\n\nThe food - Spanish food is the best in the world.\n                                I really like Japanese food, but Spanish food -\n                                they use a lot of olive oil, a lot of beans, a lot\n                                of vegetables and fruit. It's a Mediterranean diet\n                                and lots of fish but it's heavier food. In Japan\n                                they also eat a lot of fish, but it's lighter and\n                                rice and seaweed, but Spanish food is the best.\n                                The best in the world, definitely.",

        "transcript": "One of the things that I really like about Japan is Japan has a really good train system. I take the train to work every morning and I take the train home every night. I like the trains because on the trains I can do what I want to do. I can read a book, read the newspaper, listen to music, study Japanese. It's really nice. I see my time on the train as my free-time, to do things that I like to do. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t      Also, the train saves me a lot of money. In Japan it's quite common for companies to pay for their employees train ticket, so I don't have to pay for commuting to work. And because I get to take the train every day, I don't need a car so I don't have to, for example pay, for gas, car registration, car maintenance, things like that. Also, I don't have to waste time for parking.  The worst thing about the trains is that they're very crowded - very, very crowded, and sometimes it's hard to get a seat so you have to stand for a long time, and sometimes it smells a bit, but overall I like the trains and I'm really, really fortunate that Japan has such a good system.",

I didn't see a lot of\n                                the country as such. I think we spent about 7 days\n                                in Istanbul which was an amazing place. It was\n                                really, really interesting because you had the\n                                different cultures. \nIt was slightly Westernized but mainly\n                                not and you'd hear the call to prayer five times a\n                                day and there was so much to see and do and they\n                                were  really friendly there. The weather\n                                was great and then, after our 7 days in Istanbul,\n                                we went right to the middle of Turkey to a place\n                                called Cappadocia, which was basically a place\n                                where everyone lived in caves because it was so\n                                hot and that was so interesting to see their way of life.\n\nAnd mainly I think they just made their\n                                money from carpets, so we went into a lot of\n                                carpet shops. They tried to get us to buy the whole tourist thing,\n                                but they were such friendly, welcoming people. And\n                                I really liked Turkey and I want to go back and do\n                                  the coastline and more things but Istanbul\n                                and Turkey in general is a place I'd recommend.",

Well, our first\n                                Valentine's day, I wanted to give John a very\n                                unique gift. So I remembered\n                                that he used to have an iguana, so I\n                                thought he liked reptiles, and I found a cute Pac\n                                Man Frog at the pet store and actually one of my\n                                students told me about Pac Man Frogs and I thought, \"Oh, that's so cute!\" and so I bought the\n                                frog for John and I surprised him with it. And I made\n                                  \n                                  him close his eyes and I brought the frog\n                                out and the look on John's face was so\n                                funny. He was so terrified because he didn't like\n                                reptiles. I was wrong. \nTodd: Oh, no! \nAnna: Yeah, so he had\n                                to keep the frog for maybe one year.\n                                And he didn't like it. He thought it smelled bad,\n                                and the worst thing was the frog had to\n                                eat baby mice, so once a week John had to go to\n                                the pet store and buy a baby mouse and feed it to\n                                the frog, so! \nTodd: Wow! The frog ate mice? \nAnna: Yeah, it ate once a week,\n                                it ate a mouse. \nTodd: How much did it weigh? \nAnna: Maybe 8 ounces. I don't\n                                know. It was big. It could sit in your hand. It\n                                was the same size as your hand. Yeah, it was\n                                really big. \nTodd: Wow, that's a cool story.\n                                A Pac Man frog. \nAnna: Yeah, Pac Man, cause it\n                                looks like the Pac Man character.",

So, I would go with my little\n                                host brother, Javi, on our little dates\n                                because he never went into the city, although he\n                                lived really very close to the city, he would just\n                                never go into Madrid. So, he was always wanting to\n                                go, so I would, you know, pack him along and, \"Alright, where do you want to go?\" and he\n                                wanted to go the wax museum one day. \nSo we go to this wax museum, and we were by\n                                ourselves in this creepy old building, and it was\n                                really dark, and there were like a lot of wax,\n                                like figures everywhere, and they're full size,\n                                and you can actually touch them and take your\n                                picture with them. But the lighting, it was low\n                                \n                                lighting, so it was really dark, and it was kind\n                                of scaring him, you know, cause, at the time, he\n                                was like ten or something. So he was going up to\n                                all the wax figures and like saying something to\n                                them, just to try to like combat his like fear,\n                                he'd be like, \"Oh, you're ugly!\" or \"Oh, look at\n                                the hair on your head!\" and things like that. So\n                                he was insulting all of them, you know, as you do\n                                when you are little, and so he went up to this one\n                                not realizing it was a real man, cause the man was  standing absolutely still. He wasn't\n                                moving at all, and he was like, \"And you!\" and the\n                                guy said, \"What about me?\" And I swear to God,\n                                Javi screamed like a little girl and ran\n                                at me, and I was like, \"I'm sorry, señor.

        "transcript": "Todd: Every year, my company\n                                gives me three weeks' holiday. In summer, in\n                                August, and usually I go home, and I see my\n                                family. But, two years ago, before I went home, I\n                                took a hiking trip in Japan, and I went\n                                hiking across the \"Minami Alps.\" \"Minami\" means\n                                \"south,\" so they're the Southern Alps in Japan. It\n                                was a really good hike. \nThe hike took me five days. Before I went on the\n                                hike, I needed to buy some gear, so I\n                                bought a tent, a backpack, some hiking boots, and\n                                a good map of the area I was going to traverse.\n                                When I did the hike, it was really, really hard. I\n                                was not prepared for how difficult it was going to\n                                be. Each day I had to hike about 12 hours, and the\n                                hardest part about each hike was having to carry\n                                lots and lots of water because you're walking all\n                                day, you have to drink lots of water, or else\n                                you'll get dehydrated. The mountains were really steep, but once I got over the first\n                                mountain, it was just beautiful, really, really\n                                beautiful. And I met lots of really nice hikers,\n                                especially elderly hikers on the trail, and I just\n                                had a great time. I just remember the\n                                beautiful views from the peaks, and at night, I\n                                could see the stars really clearly, probably more\n                                clearly than I ever had before. It was a really,\n                                really good trip.",

        "transcript": "It was interesting as well while\n                                we were out on the farm. There were thousands of\n                                trees, I think, on the farm. So, we saw lots of\n                                different insects and little animals as well. The\n                                most exciting thing I saw was a redback spider\n                                because the redback is one of the most poisonous spiders\n                                \n                                \n                                in Australia. So, I had been traveling there for\n                                over a year, I think at\n                                  that stage, and I'd never seen a\n                                redback spider. But, I'd seen lots of colorful\n                                spiders, so that, every time I saw a new colored\n                                spider, I'd go and have a look and maybe play with\n                                it a bit or take a photo, something like that. \n\nSo, while I was picking the macadamia nuts with\n                                my friends, I saw a really brightly colored\n                                spider, so I decided to get a stick and kind of turn\n                                  over a leaf and see what it was doing, and\n                                then, I was kind of looking at it for a while and\n                                then suddenly I realized, \"Oh, my God! It's red\n                                and black. It's a redback spider!\" So. I thought,\n                                okay, I'd better stop playing with this guy and leave him alone. So, after over a year in Australia, I saw my first\n                                redback on this macadamia farm. And then, later\n                                on, that night, just before I was going to bed, I\n                                walked into the room I was staying in with my\n                                friend, and there on my bed was baby redneck\n                                spider... redback spider, sorry and I couldn't\n                                believe it. After one year, no redbacks and then\n                                two in one day. It was a bit crazy really, so I\n                                had to get someone to help me to get rid of it, cause it was a bit scary.",

It was a very, very hot day, so all the windows in the house were open, and we decided to play hide and seek, so my brother, Daniel, he goes upstairs and he sits by the window, on the window ledge, and he's waiting for us to come and find him, so he leans back, but not realizing the window's open he falls out of the window, so he falls about 15 feet and he break both of his arms and all we hear is this screaming and we think, ah you know, he's just kidding around and them my mom goes out and sees that he's lying on the floor, one bone sticking out of one arm, the other one's all twisted, so we call the ambulance and everyone's crying. My mom is being sick with the shock, and he goes to hospital. We were really, really worried, you know, is he going to die, or whatever, and he was fine. He broke both his arms but he was in hospital for about two weeks I think. Yeah, it was really nasty. He's got a horrible scar now.",

        "transcript": "Hi! This is Jessica and today I'm going to talk about spaghetti. Now a lot of people think that is might just be really easy to make, but let me tell you, mine is the top of the top. It's, I can make a mean spaghetti. So first, I take and I cut up garlic. Garlic is essential. As much garlic as you can possibly stand to cut, and then I cut some onion and put that all together, and fry it with olive oil. Then basically after that point, it kind of varies. It just depends on whatever vegetables I have around. Usually I put in like green peppers, definitely mushrooms. Mushrooms are a must. Um, let's see, and then basically it depends on the time of the year, so if it's summer I'll just put in like squash and, so I saute all the vegetables up, and get them to the point where they are just right and then I put oregano in hopefully, hopefully, the best is if it's fresh but, you know, you can't have it all so, you put in oregano, and then from there, I put in, and I hope my dad's not listening because he'll never eat it after this point, but I put in tofu ground beef, so you can't really taste it, um, I mean you can taste it. It tastes like beef, but nobody knows that it's tofu, just because I don't particularly like raw meat, so Tofu I think is the way to go, so then, um, so I put that in there, and you don't really have to cook it, you just warm it up, so I just cook it all together, warm it all together. And then I put in some fresh tomatoes, and then I usually use like a half a can of whatever tomato sauce is on sale, whatever pasta sauce, and then again a little more oregano, and just let it simmer to absorb all the flavor. That's it.",

We had no air conditioning. We actually slept in tee-pees like the native Americans. It was a great time. Everyday we took swimming lessons. We went to arts and crafts. We had to help cook the meals. We made breakfast, lunch and dinner. We learned how to canoe, ride in a canoe, and we also, what did we do? We rode horses, too. We got to ride horses. At first, maybe the first three days, I was really homesick, and I cried and I wanted to go home but after one week I loved it and I didn't want to leave.",

I was not in the city when it came through, however I did come back about 24 hours later and the difference in the city was amazing. \n                          I was driving down in the morning and it was before sunrise. There was no lights south of maybe Brower county, which is the next county north of Miami. It was dark. Normally when you travel on a highway, there's lights on either side. There's lights of the city,the buildings, the waterways. Everythings lit. It's very strange to drive down a city with the only lights being from your car and as I was getting closer to where I lived, there was no lights.                               \n                          You had to be careful. There were things in the street. We even had friends who kept driving past the street where they lived but didn't recognize it because everything had changed. There was ... all the markers, the trees, buildings, had completely either been demolished, or just weren't there anymore. So I had one friend pass his street 3 times before he realized it was his street, so yeah, a lot of destruction, a lot of people were in shock.",

It won't go in my head.\n\t                      Todd: Yeah, how do you retain everything?\n                          Alexandra: You just go back. You take notes for every 50 minute block. You stand up at the 10 minute block and stretch, come back and try write down what you read and try to, you know, do small little bullet points of what you read and that sort of keeps it in your mind.\n                          Todd: That's a good strategy. Wow. Do you do anything to actually increase your reading speed?\n                        Alexandra: No, you can't. With law you have to read each word, because each word has a particular definition. It could be a procedure in a courtroom which has particular steps, so if you omit words, or skip things you might miss the whole point of the case, so you can't speed read as it were. That's why you need to do it, you read for a long time. You just have to be careful and try to take enough breaks to give yourself a rest.",

As a young kid, there was a lot more freedom as a child to just run around your neighborhood or ride your bike, go to school without being escorted by a parent or going on a bus, you could walk to school or ride your bike to school. \n                          Now there are so many more people in the city and the demographics have changed due to a hurricane we had about ten or twelve years ago, and so it's, the parents now have to be more vigilant with their children. Be more careful. There's more people.                              \n                          Todd: You said a hurricane changed the demographics.\n                        Alexandra: Yes, in, Hurricane Andrew had come into Florida, lower, southern Florida, and had completely demolished this south of Miami, a city called homestead, and all those residents moved up to Miami, and many of the residents in Miami that had damage from the hurricane moved up to the next county up. So you have a completely different demographic coming in.                             Many people from other parts that were affected in South Florida also moved up, and also the people that are originally in Miami, some even moved out of the state. They had enough of hurricanes. You get a category five which is probably the strongest hurricane there is, blow through and completely destroy your home, you really don't want to stick around anymore for another taste, so and also Miami has become a very popular place to come and live and work, so you have an increase in population, and different types of population. As I said before there's many different people's from different countries and every so often you have a new wave of immigrants coming in, so it changes things.",

Perfect actually.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t      Christian: Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t      \nTodd: And many people from Norway have excellent English. What is the secret about Norway?\n\t\t\t\t\t          Christian: I don't know. I actually heard that before that I meet a lot of people and they say,\"Oh, you're from Norway. Norwegian people speak such good English. Why is that?\" \n\t\t\t\t\t          Personally I think it's because we get a lot of exposure to English, through TV, music, media, everything, and we don't dub movies and TV programs like they do in many other countries. We get subtitles. And the same with music. English music is very, very popular. Probably more popular that Norwegian music, and I guess as well the education system provides us with really good, you know, teaching so, I mean all those combined together, you know, creates, how to say.                              \n\t\t\t\t              Todd: Super speakers!\n\t\t\t\t              Christian: I don't know super speakers. It's a good combination, I guess in term of learning the language, so, you know, and a lot of Norwegians travel as well and they have time to practice as well, which is important if you want to speak English well.\n\t\t\t                  Todd: Sure, well, how difficult is it to learn Norwegian?\n\t\t\t                  Christian: That is probably more difficult that English, I'd say, but it's interesting I have a private Japanese student at the moment and he went to Norway on exchange from his university here in Japan and he didn't speak a word of Norwegian before he went but he spent the year there, and he now can have a decent conversation with me in Norwegian. That's three years ago since he went there, but still he speaks pretty well.",

You go out there, you go someone who knows the game and they'll teach you.

I was snow boarding and he was actually downhill skiing, and it was a fun experience for him because he didn't know what was going on, so I taught him a bit but, yeah, he didn't really learn that much.

What's life like in Dublin?\n\t\t\t            Mauve: I think life in Dublin is very different from everywhere else in the country. It's the biggest city in Ireland. It's got a population of about a million I think, even though the population of Ireland is only 4 million,\n\t\t\t\t            so most people...\n\t\t\t            Marion: So it's a quarter of the whole population.\n\t\t                Mauve: Exactly. It's a very young population, I think, the Dublin population, I suppose like all cities there's plenty to do, in terms of cinemas, theatres, I don't know, you know whatever else, comedy club and all that kind of, plenty of night clubs, loads of restaurants. It's very international now, at the moment I suppose, like there's Japanese restaurants, and well there's always Indian and Chinese, and there's like, I don't know, French and Spanish, and every type of restaurant.\n\t\t                Marion: So it's kind of a cosmopolitan city. \n\t                    Mauve: Yeah, exactly\n\t                    Marion: Or big by Irish standards, I suppose. Yeah, it's probably like a village for other people. \n                        Mauve: I know. Even though when I went to New York then, in June, it wasn't such a culture shock, cause even though, there are high rise buildings and every thing but it wasn't that different though. You know, I think that Dublin has come on a lot and it's by no means rural anymore, you know, in comparison to other cities in Ireland, like Cork and Gaul, we're very rural, but, I don't think Dublin is. \n                        Marion: Yeah, I think Dublin is like an international city, and it can stand on it's own.\n                        Mauve: Definitely, yeah, you can compare to London or, you know, New York.\n                        Marion: And the standard of, like the cost of living, is very high in Dublin, though, isn't it.\n                        Mauve: Yeah, it is. Rents are much higher there. It's more expensive to eat out and I suppose to do everything really. You need a good salary to live in Dublin I think. \n                        Marion: Yeah, yeah!\n                        Mauve: Big bucks!",

They, it's very cool to be around all these women. It's a very good experience, it's, how-should-I-say, it's, I'd say it's made me a better person, maybe a bit more sensitive to their feelings, I'd say and...\n\t\t\t            Todd: So you still must get special attention though!\n\t\t                Shawn: Still, must get special attention, um! Just because I'm the only guy in the class, it doesn't matter. You can float around that classroom and talk to anybody you want. Some girls cannot float around the classroom and talk to other girls because I'm the only guy in that class it seems that they want the attention regardless if they don't like you or not. They just want the attention. So it's never, it doesn't get lonely in the class because as a guy in the class you'll never stop talking, because they want your attention, but it's a very cool experience.\n\t\t                Todd: OK, well as a teacher, do you think that men teachers think differently that female teachers?\n\t                    Shawn: I'd say, not so much in the classroom setting but in terms with fellow coworkers, I'd say that men are very, more composed, they don't, how-should-I-say, what I've noticed in my program with women having their infighting in the class, not that they always come to me, it's just that, I'm very composed, I'm able to, how-should-I-say, not lose my head, not lose my patience right away, so, but in terms of teaching skills, um, I don't see any difference, like they're both doing the same type of job, trying to educate young minds, so in terms of teaching strategies, it's how-should-I-say, women have, I'd say more of an artistic touch than I do, it's, um, I put that as the main difference, they're more relaxed singing around the class, whereas I'm just nervous as can be and I don't like doing it, so.\n\t                    Todd: OK, I agree.

Horses are pretty big animals, and um, so we were, it was beautiful. We were in the mountains, and we were going up this hill, this trail and we got to the top. \n\t\t\t            You know the weather was beautiful when we started out, of course, it always is. We get to the top of the mountain and it starts to rain. Well not only does it start to rain, it starts to pour, and we hear the Thunder in the distance, and the horses get a little scared and the one I was on got really scared, and I look around and my uncle is taking shelter under a tree, and I'm looking around and we're on the very, very top of this ridge of mountains, the top, like, the highest point, you know, and the lightning is coming and I see the only tree that hasn't been struck by lighting is the one that my uncle is under with his horse and I'm scared and the horse is going crazy and I'm holding on and I'm thinking, \"Oh, my God! I'm going to die!\" But we got under the tree and we got down to a lower ridge and we made it, but it was scary.                              \n\t\t                Jessica: So how apt were you to go back on that horse after that?\n\t                  Ashley: Oh, well, I went, we finished the ride, and it was fine, after that you know, mountain storms, they come and go so quickly.

My favorite toppings on pizza are pepperoni, mushrooms, basil, garlic. I like lots of cheese also. \n\t\t                  Olives are really good on Pizza as well. I like pizza with a thick crust but I also like the crust to be somewhat crunchy. I know how to make pizza quite well and I think some of the best pizzerias that you can go to usually serve it with olive oil, chili's and parmesan cheese. That's how I like it.",

What is it about hockey? \n\t                      Steve: Well, hockey is a really exciting sport. It's played on the ice. It's really fast. It's aggressive. Also, it requires a lot of skill. It's a really good sport for spectators to watch because there's lots of action. You can watch it at home with friends. Drink beer, eat pizza, and have a really good time. I also like it because I'm Canadian and it's Canada's national sport, and Canada is the best hockey team in the world right now. \n\t                      Todd: Now Canada has the best hockey team. \n                          Steve: That's right. We won the gold medal. We won the world championship. Both the men's and the women's teams. \n                          Todd: Wow, that's pretty cool. In hockey, how long is the game?\n                          Steve: The game is three twenty minute periods, but because of stoppages in play , it usually takes about two and a half hours for a whole game. \n                          Todd: Oh, OK, and did you play in high school when you were younger? \n                          Steve:  Ah, no, I'm not that good a skater. You have to be a really good skater, but I played street hockey and floor hockey. \n                          Todd: OK, what's the difference between street hockey and ice hockey? \n                          Steve: Well, it's pretty much the same thing. Street hockey you play on the road or on a tennis court and instead of using a puck you use a hockey ball or a tennis ball.\n                          Todd: OK, and do you run or?\n                          Steve: Yeah, you run.\n                          Todd: Oh, you run!\n                          Steve: Yeah.

Right, there was no paper. All of the students' assignments were posted on a web page, so for each of their papers that they had to write, each of their essays, they could just go online and read the description of the assignment and all their requirements, and then they had two options for handing in their essays; they could either type them up and e-mail them to me or they could type them up directly in like a text format screen on the web, so that I could, I would do all of the grading for the papers like online.\n                          Todd: OK, did you like it as a teacher? \n                          John: It was a bit difficult cause it takes a lot to get used to reading everything on the screen, and it's, actually as far as like marking papers and grading them, it's easier for you because you can just highlight something and make it red and be like, you know, red needs spelling or whatever, and it's much quicker than like circling it and writing \"spelling\" once you get in the habit of doing it with the mouse and have your color skeem worked out, it goes very quick, and if you want to do a comment you can just, you know, change the font or the size, and type directly in the text, and they know, \"oh well, here's John's comment.\" \n                          Todd: Did the student like it?\n                          John: Most of the students liked it, but there was a small majority that, you know, usually when they were late, or whenever they wanted to just like slip a paper under my door, and they couldn't do that, because you know they would, I would know if their paper was late because you know, it wasn't, the computer doesn't lie. It was logged in at this time and you know sent to me, so \"yes it was late!\" They couldn't, you know get around that kind of paper trail.\n                          Todd: So, you're a writer, do you think it actually helps students to do this stuff on computers or should you go back to the pencil paper method?\n                          John: I think it is important to be able to do both. I think that's the most important thing about being a writer is being able to be versatile and go in different directions and write in different forms, but probably as far as tools go these days, it's more important for students to be able to compose on a computer, because most likely that is what they'll be doing most of their writing.",

We were up every morning at 4:30 in the morning, um, to watch the animals and then we would have all day to kind of sit back and do nothing and then we'd go on another animal drive in the evening because that's when the animals are eating, so cause it's so hot in the day that they come out at dawn and dusk to graze. It was incredible. \n\t\t                  When we first started out, we weren't even in the national park, we were on our way to the park, and we saw some zebras and we were screaming at our safari driver,\"Stop! Stop! There's zebras! There's Zebras!\" And he's like, \"Uh!\", he's like,\"You'll be sick of zebras by the end\" and we were so sure, like there was no way, we will never be sick of zebras. We will never be sick of zebras animals, it's just, it's just to foreign, to incredible to us, but by the end we were like,\"Uh, another zebra\" No, I'm kidding, I mean still, it was incredible. We saw just lions and the whole thing, giraffes. Uh, to see giraffes run. Their necks, are just this wave. It's beautiful, so beautiful.                              \n\t                      Jessica: So were you most impressed with the giraffe or?\n\t                      Ashley: No, probably the lions. I mean, their the king. Just, we saw thirty different lions. It was, it was something out of a fairly tale. It was incredible. We even saw, we didn't see them make a kill but we saw them eating a kill, which was quite disgusting, but it was incredible to watch because there was a male lion who was, I guess he had already eaten cause you know the men eat first and then they let their families eat, but there was another male, we were trying to figure out the dynamic of it because he wouldn't, the one male was keeping the other one away and keeping him away so his cubs could eat and they were kind of fighting, growling, I mean we were only ten feet away from them, not even that, like five feet. We were right there. It smelled cause it was a dead, I don't know, buffalo. It was gross. But it was incredible.",

And for the social types they have many bars in Toronto, unfortunately Toronto has a bit of a homeless problem, how-should-I-say, it's tiresome over the years, like every time you go downtown, you're bound to bump into a homeless person, like, wha-cha-call-it, for a city of 4 million compared to New York City that does not have a homeless problem it's pretty embarrassing. Um, how-should-I-say,at times it can be unsafe if you're around them because you're constantly being pestered by them, but, I'd say it's a good city, how-should-I-say, many different things to do, you're just not confined to one area of the city to have fun, you can go pretty much anywhere in the south end of the city and have fun.\n                          Todd: OK, wow, sounds like a really good place.\n                          Shawn: And of course, a lot of good looking girls in Toronto.

What's the best way for a student to get into a Canadian University? \n\t\t                  Steve: Well, it all depends on your nationality, and your level of English, in terms of your TOEFL score. If you have a very low TOEFL score then probably your best bet would be to first go to Canada for three to six months and study in an English college there, and try to improve your English. While in Canada you can take practice TOEFL tests, and you can find tutors to help you write essays, then when you return to your home country, if it's Japan, there's lots of good English schools, English tutors in Japan, Korea as well. I'm not too familiar with other countries but basically you have to apply for a student visa. It's usually not that difficult to get. Along with your student visa, you'll have to take a TOEFL test, which requires you to understand grammar. \n\t\t                  There's a listening portion, um, there's a reading comprehension portion, and the most difficult portion for non-native English speakers is the essay question, because you have to write an essay during the TOEFL test, so I recommend that you practice writing essays and if you want more information I would ask the Canadian Embassy in your country or do a search on the internet where there's lots of information.",

Onsen is like a public bath, where men go, or women, in separate areas of course, and enjoy very hot baths. \n\t\t                  I like it very much because it's very relaxing and it's very healthy.                               \n\t\t                  They have different kinds of baths with different sort of flavors, you might say. Some baths have minerals like sulfur, or radium, or even camphor in them and they have different health benefits. \n\t                      After bathing in an onsen, for an hour or two you take a shower, shave, and wash your body and then afterwards, you feel really, really good. I like to go for sushi after onsen.",

        "transcript": "Marion: While I traveling in Australia I went to visit my friend Nicola, um, she's teaching in a school on the East Coast of Australia, so I went to visit her about a month ago and she's staying on a farm, she lives on a macadamia farm, so my friend and I went to visit her and stay at her place, so as part of the deal we had to go out and pick macadamia nuts for two hours every day, so usually we'd get up quite early in the morning and we'd go out and pick macadamia nuts for about an hour, and then just before it got dark in the afternoon or the evening we'd go out and pick nuts again for another hour.\n\t\t                  It was a lot of fun I think mainly because, you know, it wasn't a proper job. We could take our time and we always had a laugh and a joke while we were there. Um, it was really nice to work outside, for awhile, you know, to work in the sunshine and also I'd never worked with macadamia trees before. Before I'd left Ireland I don't think I'd even heard of macadamia trees, cause I think they're a nut that's native to Australia. I know they're very popular in Hawaii as well. I think they were first cultivated for, for profit reasons in Hawaii. Yeah, so macadamia nuts are really, really tasty, so they're very popular as souvenirs from Australia, so you often get chocolate covered macadamia nuts, or macadamia cookies to bring to your friends when you come home from Australia. What else can you get with Macadamia nuts? You can just eat them on their own as well, they're very, very tasty. When we came back for breakfast, we used to bring a handful of macadamia nuts with us and use the nut cracker to open them up cause they've got a very very hard shell, so even if you throw them on the ground, it's very difficult to open them up, so you have to have a nutcracker, to really crush the shell, and once you open them up inside, they're very white, very pale in color and they almost look like nuggets of white chocolate. It's quite strange and they have a real creamy taste to them, so they're, yeah, probably one of my favorite things to eat in Australia.",

Obviously being from a small country where people aren't educated about these things we don't realize what is really happening, but we are really starting to realize now and we and other small nations have spoken out about it and it's good to know that bigger countries are doing something about it, and I think thing needs to be done now, rather than waiting, which is happening with governments which are under economical stress right now...they haven't done enough..they know the situation, they know they're responsible for it. We're the ones who are suffering because of it even though we don't add to it. Yeah, so I think they should do something.",

The city is center is busy but it's not very busy. It's not as busy as Tokyo or New York. It's just a busy city but then it just slows down as you move away from the city\nTodd: Is it easy to find housing?\nAaron: It's very easy to find housing. There's a lot of hotels, accommodation, and a lot of places to rent. You can buy houses quite cheaply in Melbourne as well and there's only about 5 million people there so it's not crowded as well.\nTodd: How much would a house cost? A decent house?\nAaron: A decent house in Australia, or in Melbourne, would cost about 250,000 Australian dollars, which I guess compared to Japanese prices, isn't so bad, and that would be a big 4 bedroom house, maybe two stories.\nTodd: Wow! Front yard and backyard?\nAaron: Front yard, back yard, driveway, garage, 4 bedrooms.\nTodd: What's the transportation like in the city?\nAaron: The transportation is very good, but it's very slow. You have to wait twenty minutes for trains. They only run every twenty minutes, but the buses and the trams will take you to wherever you want to go, but the trains are very centralized, so they all run into the city, through four major train stops, and then they run back out to the suburbs on a big loop so they never crossover each other and you have to catch buses if you want to go away from the city. \nTodd: Is it a safe city?\nAaron: It is a safe city but like any place it has it's troubles but you don't have to worry about living in Melbourne.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Aaron, sometimes I hear from Australians, the term, have a walk-about, or walk-about!\n\nAaron: A walk-about is an aboriginal word. It basically, means an aboriginal boy, when he is growing up goes for a long walk, maybe for twelve months, and he doesn't see his family and he has to live off the land. He can't, he doesn't have money so he can't buy food, he can't buy anything, and he just hunts for food. It's not so common now, and I've never had to do it, but it's more of an old story from the aborigines who tell you about a walk-about.\n\nTodd: Do you know anybody who's ever done it?\n\nAaron: No, I've never know anybody to do it, but I don't know if it's a true story or, I don't think it's common now, but maybe in the old days, maybe a hundred years ago, it was common for them to do it, but now they don't. \n\nTodd: So, there's lots of different aboriginal people in Australia. Where does, which aboriginal tribe does this come from, or group?\n\nAaron: OK, I'm not sure what tribe it comes from but the aboriginals in the Northern Territories, which is all desert are probably the most famous for it, near Darwin and the top end we way, the north of Australia, where it's very mountainous, and you could walk for a year, and never find your way anywhere.",

That sounds painful!\nIan: Mm, but there's more!

I spent about 8 days in hospital and it was is Wales. I always remember being in Wales because I had problems understanding the doctor's accent, and then, are you ready, there's more \nAdrienne: Tell me\nIan: Again when I was 20 years old I was at university in Leeds, and again I had a lump in my throat and I had problems breathing. I went to the hospital and the same thing again. My right lung had collapsed \nAdrienne: Collapsed!\nIan:  Yes, but this time, because we were in a big city, they had more sophisticated medical equipment and they put a syringe, made a very small hole in my chest and put the syringe into my lung and drained away the excess air and my lung was inflated again.\nAdrienne: Did it hurt?\nIan: Not as much as the first time. And I only spent a day in hospital and then they sent me home, but there's more. A week later I had the same problem, a lump in my throat, and I had problems breathing and so I went to the hospital again and my right lung had collapsed again, for the third time, so this time the \n                                doctors decided they had to do a bigger operation to make sure that this wouldn't happen again so I was \n                                at hospital for two weeks and they cut away the top part of my lung, and stitched me back up and now my lungs are absolutely fine. I've had no problems since and I'm doing lots of running and I feel much better,\n                                but I don't want to have the same thing again.

What's the matter? \nDoris: Well, I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London tomorrow. \nAdrienne: Really?\nDoris: Yeah.\nAdrienne: How do you feel about that?\nDoris: Well, I do feel a bit down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months in Japan. I am going to miss it so much,  I've had a great time here.\nAdrienne: So what are you going to miss about Japan?\nDoris: Oh, I am going to miss the people, the food, the night life. Especially the nightlife.\nAdrienne: What especially about the nightlife are you going to miss?\nDoris: Well, I really like dancing. And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London. \nAdrienne: How are the clubs different in Japan than in London?\nDoris: Well, here there are many different clubs you can get into for free, you don't have to pay, some of them. In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee. \nAdrienne: Always?\nDoris: Yeah.\nAdrienne: Ah, then it's different. \nDoris: But they do have the same pubs but if you wanted to go to a nightclub for example it would cost quite a lot of money. \nAdrienne: And how do the prices of food and drinks compare?\nDoris: Ah well, I'd say in Japan drinks are cheaper than in London.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Now Aaron, Australia's a big place. Can you describe the Australian landscape?\n\nAaron: No worries. In Australia, there are cities and then there is country. Not many people live in the country and the desert. About 70% of the population live on the East Coast on a very small area and 80% maybe 70% of Australia is just desert. Nobody lives there or it's just farms and nobody lives there as well. The cities aren't like Japan. They're very small cities and there's a one high-rise area and then the rest of it is just flat.\n\nTodd: How about the natural landscapes like deserts and rainforests and things like that?\n\nAaron: No worries. The rainforests are in the south, mainly in Tasmania and in the tropics to the north but the desert is the center of Australia and the north of Australia as well and on the west coast. There's not much rainforest. There's a lot of desert. Not many rainforests and the rest is just built-up area. Suburban areas. \n\nTodd:  Australia is know for it's beaches. What area has the nicest beaches? \n\nAaron: The nicest beaches are probably in Queensland or the Gold Coast. The West Coast has some great beaches as well but there are now cities over there, so it's not so popular but I think the best beaches are in Queensland cause the pollution is so low. In the cities.. in the south, the beaches are a bit dirty so you can't always swim there.",

One, it's famous for curry. Indian curry because in Bradford we have a lot of Indian and muslim people but also it's famous for riots because Bradford had major riots in England. It's had maybe the two worst riots in England for the past 10 years and that's due to racism basically.\nTodd: Really?\nMark: Yeah.\nTodd: Oh, no! Is it a rough area?\nMark: Yeah, it's very working class. Yeah, not so much money in Bradford, pretty poor. \nTodd: What was it like growing up there like, what did you do as a kid?\nMark: What did I do as a kid? It was.. it was tough. I lived on a government. Well, we call it councilor estate, maybe in America it's called maybe government assisted housing. So my area was pretty tough but always there were lots of kids around so we were always playing  football, cricket or riding bikes or sometimes causing mischief.\nTodd: How would you cause mischief?\nMark: It depends, maybe sometimes there's an old guy who nobody likes who lives near us so we go and throw maybe eggs at his windows and as we grew older we started throwing rocks at his windows, yeah.\nTodd: What would you do if you had a house now and some kid threw eggs at your house?\nMark: If some kid threw eggs at my house I'd probably buy a big dog and set the dog off the leash and the dog can chase the kids away.",

I spent three weeks in Northern Thailand and then three weeks on the beach in the southern part of Thailand but my last night I was packing up and I had a suitcase in the corner with the warm clothes from Northern Thailand and I saw something dark in the corner and I'm thinking,\" Oh, it's just some clothes that fell out of my suitcase so I reached out to grab the clothes and something dark rose up and spread out and it was the weirdest feeling because at the same time I felt like a hand grab me from behind and yanked me out of the cabin and I didn't feel any fear until I was in the middle of the clearing and I screamed twice and got everybody's attention, \"What? What? What?\" and I said \"snake\" and of course a few people started laughing, thinking,\n  \"Oh, well, this little bitty green, harmless snake\" Ah, no big deal. So one of the little bitty Thai girls, walks into my cabin and she comes running out, \"Aah, snake!\" and so it was a black king cobra which is the most poisonous snake in the world and this is really kind of scary because my little brother had been killed by a snake and so it's frightening to me to think how close I came. After I left Thailand, two things happened: I found some photographs in which in the photographs that I took of my cabin you could see the snake crawling into my cabin and the other one is an e-mail from the owners of the resort that they found two more cobras underneath my bed.\nTodd: Wow, oh man! So normally do they have king cobras on that part of the island?\nGloria: No, they don't. They say they may come in when they transport.. the building, they're making a lot of new buildings so they brought in wood from Northern Thailand and maybe it came in there. Also the envirorment's being upset and they're chopping down a lot of trees and they're finding more and more snakes that they didn't know were there. \nTodd: Wow. Well, you're very lucky. \nGloria: Yeah, I've been told that.",

And if you complete all three then you can go to Buckingham Palace and he gives you your award.\nAdrienne: The award is for what kind of job?\nIan: OK, well it's for young people between the ages of.. I think it's 14 to 21, but I'm not quite sure and you have to do different challenges for each award. Now, for the gold award you had to do community service and I visited an old man. I had to do a sport and I played badminton. You had to do an expedition and we went hiking in the Breton Beacons in Wales for five days and you had to do a skill and I did driving and you had to do each one for a year.\nAdrienne: So what was it like getting the award?\nIan: It was exciting and disappointing at the same time because my friends and I, we were waiting at Buckingham Palace for quite a long time and we had all our best clothes on our ties, our shirts, our trousers. We had very clean shoes. It was quite hot and we were waiting and we were waiting and in came the Duke of Edinburgh and he gave us our award. He asked us maybe one question each and then he went, so we only actually met him for about five minutes. \nAdrienne: So it wasn't the most exciting time, meeting him a famous person. \nIan: No, he was a very busy man but you know, I shook his hand and that was it but it was nice to see  Buckingham Palace and it was a good day out in London. \nAdrienne: Sounds like it.",

        "transcript": "Jeff: My brothers and I just did a really fun and difficult journey across India in a rickshaw. It's.. a rickshaw is a three-wheeled, a little three-wheeled vehicle. It's a cross between a car and a motorcycle. It has no doors and it has no trunk to put luggage in and it has a little.. it has a little steering bar like a motorcycle and it doesn't go very fast and we drove this all the way across the country from Bangladesh to Pakistan and it was a crazy journey. It was crazy, very dangerous and full of surprises and very hard of your body and your mind and I did this with my two brothers in a rickshaw. My brothers and I filmed the entire journey in the rickshaw with a professional video camera. One of my dreams in life is to make a documentary for TV and we decided to make a documentary of our trip across India and it was very difficult. We thought it would be easy but when we started to do this it was very, very tough. They make it look easy on television and when you have the camera and you're trying to video people, it's very difficult. They don't do what you want to do and the weather doesn't cooperate with you and maybe the camera breaks down and you're tired and you can't get the video shots that you want and it becomes like a game or struggle. Trying to get the best shots, trying to get the most interesting shots and it is like a game, a fun and frustrating game but by the end of the trip, we managed to get all of the video. And we put together a very interesting three minute video and a couple of Indian video producers helped us put this together. And you can see the short video on the web site - www.eagarbros.com and I think you'll like it. It's full of surprises and full of funny and strange sites and full of action so, it's pretty good. I think you'll like it.",

On  my father's side of the family, I have quite a few cousins and quite a few uncles and aunts. My dad is one of eight children, so we've always been very close and basically we've been a nuclear family around my grandparents of my dad's side. So my cousin Brian, is going to be getting married in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and I think that wedding is taking place about August 9th. \nTodd: Oh, wow. \nTravis: So we are  going to.. be going out there as a family. Hopefully, maybe we'll have as many as  forty of us and whoever the bride invites and we'll be on the beach for about 3 or 4 days. And have a wedding of Saturday so it should be pretty exciting.\nTodd: Mexico, that's an interesting choice. I mean, that's pretty far away. \nTravis: It is pretty far away so it should be kind of expensive for all the guests to get there which might be planned on my cousin's side because he might be trying to limit how many people who come to his wedding so it won't get to overly large. And Mexico is actually cheaper to have a wedding than the United States because the power of the dollar versus the power of the peso is you know, quite strong so you can go down to Mexico and for maybe a third the price have the same lavish wedding you might have in the United States, though Puerto Vallarta might be a little more expensive than a normal Mexican wedding because Puerto Vallarta is sort of a tourist and resort community.\nTodd: Have you been to Puerto Vallarta before?\nTravis: I've never been there before. In fact, even though I am from Southern California and from Los Angeles basically, which is only two hours from Mexico, I've never been to Mexico.\nTodd: I'm from San Francisco and even I've been to Mexico.\nTravis: Well, Tijuana is a place everybody goes to and it's never had any big appeal for me. Typically, southern Californians will go there as soon they turn 18 because at 18 you can drink in Tijuana and you can't drink in California when you're 18. You have to wait until you are 21, so that's a big reason to go I suppose but I never made it down there.\nTodd: Well, I'm sure you'll enjoy Mexico.\nTravis: I'm sure I will.",

We are still making the plans to go but I think we're going to go for two weeks. And we're probably going to go from Chicago because that's where he lives to Buenos Aires and then go north to the city of Córdoba, which is the second largest city in Argentina. So.. and then from there I'd really like to go and see some gauchos which are Argentine cowboys, so I think that that would be really cool and have some barbecue and see everything that we can, so..\nTodd: Cool! Are you going to work your way down to the southern tip?\nJessica: I don't think we're going to just because I have a buddy of mine that lives in the north, in Córdoba and I think it's so far from the north to the south just cause it's such a long country. That he said by bus it would take something like some ungodly amount of hours and so I don't know, in two weeks. I think that would be a little bit ambitious to try to cover it all so..\nTodd: OK, do you know anybody in Argentina?\nJessica: Yeah, my one friend who lives there that I definitely want to go and visit him. \nTodd: Oh, so your friend already lives there.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Lois, I noticed that you have a poster of David Beckham by your desk.\nLois: Yes, I do. I think that David Beckham is quite a handsome man. I also think that he is a very, very talented footballer. Although, his recent performance in Euro 2004 was maybe not quite what it should have been. He did miss two penalties but I think in the past he has been a very good role model for people in England and a very good footballer. \nTodd: So what is it about David Beckham that everyone thinks is handsome?\nLois: Everything about him is perfect. He's got a lovely body, great hair, when he has hair and then when he doesn't have hair, he has a great shaped head. The only thing I don't really like about his body is his tattoos. He's just had a new tattoo on the back of his neck and I think it is a cross with some angel's wings on it and I don't think that is very nice but apart from that I would say that he is perfect. \nTodd: Well, what color are his eyes? \nLois: I have no idea what color his eyes are. No, I'm guessing brown but I don't know. \nTodd: OK and how tall is he? \nLois: How tall is he? Taller than me but I don't know how tall he is either. \nTodd: No details, details. So do you think David Beckham is a better football player or a better model?\nLois: Ugh, Tricky. Possibly at the moment a better model and maybe he should spend less time concentrating on that and more time on his football. \nTodd: Well, how old is he now? \nLois: I think he's about 29. Yeah, because his wife just turned 30 a couple of months ago and he's one year younger, so he's 29. \nTodd: Does he have any children? \nLois: He has two children. I don't know how old they are. One is called Brooklyn and the other one is called Romeo, not really sure where they got their names from but yeah, two young children.",

So that was pretty good. \nAdrienne: Oh, that's true. I guess your right. \nTodd: And what did you think about the pizza?\nAdrienne: The pizza was delicious. I would like it to be a little bigger because pizza at home is usually much bigger but it was still very good. \nTodd: Yeah. I forgot, how much was the bill. How much did we pay?\nAdrienne: About 3,000 yen I think. \nTodd: 3,000 yen. So what do you think? Is that expensive or cheap or..?\nAdrienne: That seems pretty standard for Tokyo I think.",

I worked for a language school where you go to a normal school in Austria for one week and you take one particular year group and you teach them English for that one week. And then you move onto another school the next week so you're moving around every week which is good because you get to go to Vienna and Innsbruck and you're constantly moving around the country, so it's an interesting lifestyle. \nTodd: What's Vienna like? \nSarah: Great. I like Vienna. It's very, very easy to get around. Very friendly place. The transition from England to Austria is very,  very easy one and there's a lot to do in Vienna. Quite similar to London in that way. \nTodd: Like for example what things? \nSarah: It's very cultural and a lot of museums and art galleries. It's quite historical. It's an historical city.\nTodd: OK. Can you tell a little about the history of Vienna or why it's historical? \nSarah: No.\nTodd: No? I'm sorry. That's a tough question. How about the food? How about Austrian food? \nSarah: I don't like Austrian food actually, I have to say. It's quite heavy. It's very heavy. A lot of sausages, a lot of meat. They're very much into their meat but they also have a lot of Italian food because of course, they're on the border. So they have a lot of influence from other cultures, so they like curry and Italian food as well. It's very, very big. \nTodd: And what's the landscape like in Vienna? \nSarah: In Vienna?\nTodd: I mean.. I'm sorry, in Austria?\nSarah: The landscape is beautiful. That is one of the main reasons why I went there. It's very mountainous and the Tirol which is very beautiful. \nTodd: I'm sorry the Tirol?\nSarah: The Tirol. It's like.. it's just a long journey through the mountains that you go through. It's called the Tirol. \nTodd: Did you go hiking?\nSarah: No. I went skiing a few times, not hiking. \nTodd: Good. Good ski slopes?\nSarah: Very good, yeah!",

They finished fifth in the premiership this year, so they're near the top. \nTodd: OK, so right now we have the Euro cup and last night England played. \nSarah: They did.\nTodd: Yeah, did you see the game? \nSarah: No, I was going to watch it tonight actually in Shibuya but I'm thinking maybe not now because we lost on penalties.\nTodd: Yeah, what was the score? \nSarah: The final score was 2 all (2-2) and then it went to penalties and I think it was 6-4.  So England always lose on penalties. \nTodd: They always lose on penalties? \nSarah: Yeah.\n Todd: Well, sorry. Maybe in the World Cup, next time. \nSarah: Maybe. Yeah. \nTodd: Now do you ever play football? \nSarah: No, I've never played. \nTodd: Never?\nSarah: Never played, no. \nTodd: OK. Do you ever go and watch games in Newcastle? \nSarah: It's very difficult to watch games in Newcastle because it's a big club and it's Premiership and you have to book in advance quite a few years but I've seen some first division football clubs\n                                play against each other. \nTodd: You have to get tickets two years in advance?\nSarah: For the big clubs, yeah. They're booked up.\nTodd: That's pretty intense. So when there's a game on TV then what do you do? Do you watch it at home? Do you go to a pub? \nSarah: It depends on the game. I like it and I like Premiership football and I like World Cup football and Euro 2000 but I wouldn't watch particularly a first division game on the television but normally I would go to the pub with friends and watch the game.\nTodd: Do you think that athletes make too much money? \nSarah: I think footballers do. Yeah, I think they do. I think they do a good job but I think they're incredibly overpaid.\nTodd: Yeah, I think it is the same thing in the States. I think they make too much money.",

He's a regional manager which means he has the whole province of Ontario and he is responsible for distribution for.. he handles big budget, we're talking about millions of dollars here and he is a problem solver. When an area does not make profit or if they have problems then they send him there to fix the problems. He's very good at that. He has very good human communication skills and he sees problems and he sees solutions that please everyone, so he's very successful. I have my daughter, who does many things. She works in the circus industry. She teaches at Cirque de l'Arc in Quebec and she's also has her own busker act with a friend and she also teaches trampoline at the circus school and she also competes. She's an international athlete. She came  7th at the world competitions in Hamburg last fall and synchronized trampoline. And my youngest son, he's in computers. He enjoys it very much. He works for a big consulting company. They have contracts, government contracts and he sets up the database and trains the government people so that they can use the computers to for example, monitor medical files of the people of the province.\nTodd: Wow, you must be really proud. You have three amazing kids. \nNorm: Thank you.  They worked  hard. Yes, and they're.. they like also to experience different things so there all in that kind of field where they can change job when they find that the job is not as interesting anymore, so they ask for transfers and that's the way they like it.\nTodd: Well, you're one cool guy Norman.

I'm teaching science and English and math and maybe some French and sports and music and any other subjects they do at eight years old. \nTodd: So, how old will the students be?\nLois: So I will be trained to teach from 5 to 11 and hopefully I will teach 7 or 8 year olds. \nTodd: Mm, you like kids?\nLois: I hope so. Yeah, when I worked in Prague I taught some children's classes and I really, really enjoyed them. So hopefully, I will like it in England as well. Although, it will be a bit different because I'll have maybe twenty five or thirty students in a class so it might be slightly different to the twelve when I was in Prague. \nTodd: That's a lot. What made you decide to become a teacher?\nLois: I'm not really sure because my mother was a teacher and she's trying really hard to convince me that I shouldn't do it because she thinks its too much work but I enjoy talking to people and being around children and teaching so hopefully it will be nice for me.",

        "transcript": "Todd: What about the food, like are there certain kinds of food that you eat for Carnival?\nCleAnn: Food... for Carnival, not particularly for Carnival, but Trinidad and Tobago as a whole has a kind of a distinctive type of food because we are mostly Africans and Indians, our food is always a mix of curry and spicy African foods, which is kind of strange.  So, in Trinidad and Tobago we eat, as I said, very spicy foods and a lot of meat.  We love meat in Trinidad.  Actually, vegetarians, people are usually, it's a strange idea, sometimes.  And, a lot of rice sometimes, and pasto.\n                              \nTodd: So when is the next Carnival?\nCleAnn: Next year, February, I don't know the exact dates.  But it's always in, it's... if you check the Catholic calendar for Lent, it's always coinciding with that season.  So, 'cause Ash Wednesday I think is the start of the Lenten season.\nTodd: So what are the religious connotations to the Carnival and Catholicism.\nCleAnn: I think it has lost all religious connotations.  I think originally it was very religious because people, they would wear, like full dresses, women wear long dresses, and they parade the streets ringing bells, you know like the priests and incense, and things like that.  But, now there's, it's no more of that.  Now it's just basically a big party.\nReligiously it... it becomes religious after carnival, when people go to church for ashes on Ash Wednesday.  But I wouldn't say there's much religious significance.  There may be originally when slavery was abolished, there may have been some spiritual significance for the freed African slaves, because Carnival was used for them as a time of celebration, of celebration of being free.  So, they used to dance to a lot of their traditional drums and worshipped their traditional African gods and traditional religions were also...  they were also praised and celebrated at the same time kind of as the Catholics would celebrate their Carnival mass at the time.\nTodd: This is actually a holiday that's not just in Trinidad and Tobago.  This in other countries as well, right?\nCleAnn: Yeah, but I don't think it started in... I wouldn't say that it started in Trinidad, and... which is why I like to stress, to emphasize that I think the Catholic Church has a big part to play in it because you will find carnivals in those countries where Catholicism is very prominent. This is why Brazil even, they're Catholic, I think.  And in Europe, there are many parades, they call them by different names, I know in Germany for example in Mainz, in the city of Mainz it's actually called Carnival also.  And it developed from the Catholic... from a Catholic Church celebration, they also have Ash Wednesday celebrations.  So I wouldn't say it started in Trinidad, but our particular version of it, with the African drumming, and our music, I think that's what makes it unique, although it is definitely present all over the world.\nTodd: Okay, well, sounds good.  Thanks.\nCleAnn: No problem.",

It lasts for two days; it's called Carnival Monday and Tuesday.  And for those two days, that's when we have the big parades in the street, with big costumes, small costumes, and a lot of music.\n                              \nThe days leading up to carnival may actually be more important than the two days of Carnival themselves, because that's when we have a lot of concerts and competitions for Calypsonians, and Calypsonians are people who sing Calypso, which is music that's native to Trinidad and Tobago.  And we have a lot of steel band festivals, and steel bands are like big musical bands who play the steel drums, which were invented in Trinidad and Tobago.\nTodd: So, this is a national holiday.  Everything's closed down?\nCleAnn: Everything's closed for at least a week.\nTodd: A week?\nCleAnn: Yeah, even before... before Carnival Monday and Tuesday, it's closed from the Wednesday of the week before.  So, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.\nTodd: And then everybody goes right back to work?\nCleAnn: And the following Wednesday is Ash Wednesday.  It started I think as kind of a religious festival.  I've seen examples of it all over the world, including Europe.  And actually, it started from the Catholic Church, so on Ash Wednesday, people are supposed to go to church and confess their sins and get ashes.  And I can assume that we probably have a lot to confess after... Carnival Monday and Tuesday.\nTodd: And so is it usually pretty much the same thing every year, or does it change a little bit year by...\nCleAnn: It always changes because it's not government run, and the carnival bands, that means the bands of people who parade the streets in different costumes, they're actually competing with each other to get, to win the band of the year, and they're judged on their costumes.  So we have private owners of bands who design different costumes every year with different themes, and they have to portray these themes on the street.  And the aim is to win the competition for band of the year, and every year the costumes are different.\nActually, Carnival is launched from the year before.  So I think, this year, Carnival will be launched somewhere in... Actually I think they already launched it last month, July.  And so, from July, you're going to see all the bands coming out with their costumes on display for people to decide which band they want to play, which costumes they would like to use.  Artists start to release their Calypso singles,  'cause there's also competition for Best Calypso and other different types of music which are not as big as Calypso music in Trinidad and Tobago.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Heidi, we're talking about demographics and population. Now we actually both live in Japan. So you are from Mongolia. I'm from the U.S. and we go to the same university. You're a student. I'm a teacher. Now in Japan, have ever heard the term 'parasite child'?\nHeidi: Yes, I heard. Yeah.\n                              \nTodd: Can you explain what parasite child is?\nHeidi: Well for me, parasite child is even if you get older, you're still living with your parents and not paying for anything. Just getting money from your parents probably. That's the term of the parasite child.\nTodd: Right, exactly. And in Japan, it's also quite a big issue because they have a population that's shrinking, and so they want people to get married and have children, but lots of children actually get a job, are professionals, like doctors and lawyers even, and they still live with their parents, so they don't move out and start families and these are often called a parasite child cause they continue to stay at home. Now do you have this in your country in Mongolia? \nHeidi: Well, I don't know if it's called parasite or not, but then in Mongolia, the young couples are still living with their parents, and not paying anything as well, and they're just working and making money for themselves and not paying for the family. Well, the reason why is in Mongolia the apartment cost is really expensive and for the young couples it's really hard to afford for the apartment, so that's probably the reason they are still living with their family.\nTodd: Wow, that's interesting. So you're saying they're actually together, like a married couple and they still live with their parents.\nHeidi: Yes, that's right.\nTodd: And you said the main reason is because the apartments are really expensive?\nHeidi: Yes, that's really expensive and even if they get the loan from the bank, they can't pay like less than ten years, so it's kind of hard to like afford for it, so...\nTodd: Actually, that's really surprising because as you mentioned earlier, you're country is really big. Like you don't have a problem with land, so you would think that housing would be very cheap?\nHeidi: Well, the problem is people are living in the capitol city. Even if you have big land, but the capitol city is really small, and there are so many people who wants to live in the capitol city, and the capitol city land is really expensive, and even if you want to build your own house, it costs a lot so there are not many people who wants to live in another city than Ulon Bator, which is the capitol city of Mongolia.\nTodd: Now because it's a big city, is it also hard for people to actually get houses, like they have to live in apartment buildings.\nHeidi: Yeah. Mainly Mongolian people are living in the apartments. Yeah.\nTodd: Wow, that's really interesting to find out about. It's actually I think quite similar in America surprisingly these days where some people, young people, are starting to live at home.",

        "transcript": "Eli\nAt the moment I'm living in Japan and life here is pretty different to anything I've really experienced before. I think just because the daily routine is so different. In England, in England, basically I was really lazy. I'd probably get up at you know 8:30 in the morning. Leave ten minutes later, cause I always brush my teeth at work, eat breakfast at work, get to work for 9 o'clock, come home from work at 5:30, probably lie on the sofa, watch the Simpsons, cook some food, go to bed, and that was the sort of daily routine in England, a very lazy one. I mean, even if I needed to get to the supermarket which was probably what, like 3-400 meters away, I'd get on my scooter to do it. Walking anywhere would be just a massive hassle and so it was a bit of a shock when I got to Japan and all that changed, I mean, the one thing you have to do a lot of in Tokyo is walk. You have to walk everywhere. I mean the train systems are absolutely amazing but you need to walk to get to the train. You need to walk between the trains and like when I first arrived, I walked my feet into the ground. After a week they were aching so badly after two weeks. They were just I don't know, it took me at least a month to like wear my feet in. They're still, still like now, after long walks, but it's just apart from the walking, you just, it's just a business of life here, I mean cause no one actually lives in Tokyo cause it's so expensive.\nWe all live out sort of in the suburbs in what we call bed towns, and so actually getting into school every morning, I'm studying Japanese here, I have to get up pretty early just to get onto the train, to then travel, commute, an hour in, to get to school on time, which of course I never do. I'm meant to be at school at about nine, which would mean, sort of leaving my house at about 8, getting up at 7. I know this is not shocking for a lot of people, but after the routine I had, it's a pretty shocking experience for me, especially the hour of commuting on the train where you're kept in like sardines, you just would never have in sort of London and London underground in England where I'm from. On the London Undeground if the trains full people wait for the next train. Here if the train is full, people just push and push until they get on so you can end up being stood, never get to sit down, just standing for an hour, like squashed up, like sardines, so by the time you get to school you're totally tired and then there's a school until lunch time and after lunch I always say I'm going to come back and study but I never do I always come back and fall fast asleep.",

However in some ways it doesn't help because the Japanese learner, the Japanese sort of mind, and how they learn languages is so very different from anywhere in Europe or South America so activities that would work really well with a European western, South American audience, or South American class, don't seem to work at all due to some of the differences in Japanese and Western culture.\nEli: Do you think the whole sort of Japanese schooling system is very different?\nBen: It's extremely different. \nEli: How is that?\nBen: I haven't got a great insight into it but I think the kids have to work a lot harder here. All, I teach a lot of high school children and they're often coming to my lesson, in between their breaks between cram school, on a national holiday, in the summer holiday. When I was a kid I'd be playing in the park and beating up girls up the street with a wooden stick or something.\nEli: And do you reckon that is kind of passed on with the ****** of work society here, like sort of similar sort working, or?\nBen: Yeah, I suppose so. I think a lot is expected of them all throughout there lives. Two of my neighbors are both salarymen, and they often are arriving at home very very late, and a lot more is expected of the Japanese staff at the school than is of the western staff. They'll often ask them to do jobs that take twice as long as what they ask us. I don't know whether that is because they expect the Japanese staff can do more, or they just think we're stupid, which some of us are!",

        "transcript": "Todd\nI'm going to talk about movies. I love movies. I think many, many people around the world today love movies. I probably see one or two movies a week on DVD in my room. I watch the movies on my computer so I am a big, big fan of movies, and I watch them all the time, but I have three big complaints about movies, about Hollywood, my country, that I wish they would change. The first complaint is that movies have too many guns. This really bothers me. If you go into a video store and you look at the cover of all the movies, almost on 50% or more of the movie covers there is somebody holding a gun, and I think this is absolutely crazy. In my country, unfortunately there are many guns, but in reality, you never see guns. People have guns, but it's not common to see a person with a gun and in movies, there's always guns and shooting and killing and violence and blood and I just think it's unnecessary, so I really wish that they would not have so many guns in movies and maybe not so much violence. My second complaint is that the stories of most of the movies today from Hollywood are terrible. They're so bad that you can't even watch the movie. I guess most movies now are geared towards special effects and visual effects so the story is often really bad and I think that's just terrible.\nI wish Hollywood would make fewer movies, and concentrate on movies with a really good story, like my favorite movie is a movie called \"Wallstreet\" and it just has a fantastic story. Another movie I really liked was \"The Paper\" and also \"Field of Dreams\" and both these movies have really good stories and almost no special effects, so I think that we don't need so many special effects in movies. And my last thing, my last complaint about movies, is that, or Hollywood, that they stop only using beautiful people. Every time you see a movie, or movie stars, it's always really beautiful people, but in reality most of us, definitely myself, we're not beautiful. Most people look average so why don't they just use actors and actresses that look average. I'm sure that there are many, many really good actors and actresses that just aren't beautiful and they would do a fantastic job in a movie and it would be a really good story, compelling story, but they don't get the role because they're not beautiful and they're not young, and I just think that's kind of sad. I know that movies are the way they are because they are geared towards younger people, but I think there's a lot of older people, like myself, I'm 35, who would like to see more movies with good stories, less violence, less special effects, good writing, and people that look average like everybody else.",

        "transcript": "Eli\nI've been at boarding school since the age of 8, which is pretty young if you think about it. The reason I went there was because my family were living abroad and they thought it would probably be better for me to go to school in England. It was really fun actually. At sort of 8 to 13, my first school, I had a great time. I loved it. I hardly ever missed my parents. We had so much to do. This school was great. They organized all these things for us to do. Obviously we were there over the weekend. Some of the kids went home at the weekend. Some of the kids went home everyday but us that had to stay over the weekend, we always had like loads of stuff to do. \nThere were rules obviously, but we were given a pretty free hand within the sort of school grounds. We were left to do our own thing. We had our own like common areas. We could bring in our music, we could, it was, you know, it was great and sort of the only bad memory I really have of that is having to say goodbye to my parents all the way in Holland where we lived and I would have to say goodbye to them at the end at the airport and then fly over by myself to England and get picked up by an aunt and taken to school which was, that was the only sort of thing I can remember that was bad about it,                              but obviously as you get older, and I moved on to my secondary school, what we call it in England, yeah, I started to like it less and less, obviously as you get older, you sort of get more opinions about things, about people, how people should be, brought up, about the sort of freedom you should be given, especially from the ages of maybe 13 to 16. You're very opinionated and think you know best, but the school I went to was very rules orientated. It was very strict, and yeah, as sort of other people of a similar age to me, started going out, you know to clubs, going out to pubs, and doing what kids normally of that age do, we were stuck at school and had to bed at like quarter past 10 on a Saturday night, which I think for a 17, 18 year old kid is pretty unnatural. It's not a very sort of, I mean at that age I don't think it's a natural environment for children to be in. When I say children, you're not really a child anymore at that age. You should be learning to, you know, cook for yourself, wash your own clothes, look after yourself, but of course all of this is done for you at school. \nHowever, I have to say now, now that I'm living in a different country at the moment. I'm living in Japan away from all my friends, away from my family, and it really isn't a problem for me at all. I sort of just slipped into life here very easily cause I so used to living alone.",

I was really bad, you know, and then the reason is, at that time I was working for, I was a bike rider at a delivery.\nTodd: Oh, you delivered stuff?\nKawabe: Bike delivery!\nTodd: Oh, really, what did you deliver?\nKawabe: Ah, the documents and you know whatever it is when you want to send somewhere the thing fast!\nTodd: Yeah, yeah, cool job!\nKawabe: That's what I was doing, and then before the interview I was delivering one thing.\nTodd: Oh, no, yeah!\nKawabe:And then, so, anyway, I was late and in my bag, when I was driving the motorcycle I put my suits and shoes and everything, I've got to wear for the interview and I was in a rush, and I'd been to that building where I had an interview and in front of that building there was a MacDonald and then I rushed into the toilet of that MacDonald that was on the first floor and I think, you know, it was funny if you were looking at me. I was wearing..\nTodd: I can imagine.\nKawabe: I was wearing like a driver's suit and when I came out from the toilet I was in a suit, like Superman! And then, yeah, I changed my clothes, very very quickly in the toilet and I rushed into the building for the interview but I was 30 minutes late, and actually I got a great interview with the guys of the broadcast station, but ah, since I was late that was the only and biggest reason I couldn't get that job. Actually, they said that if you were not late I could take you, so it's a funny story, now but at that time I was like so disapointed with myself, (Yeah) I was so stupid. The job was great!\nTodd: I've done that too! I think we all do that at one point. Well!\nKawabe: Yeah, I learned a lot of things from that experience.\nTodd: But you got another job with another TV company after that, correct?\nKawabe: Mm, it's not a TV company but the same kind of job and it was lucky cause, since I missed the first one I got the second one and that is why I could join to the World Cup.\nTodd: Oh, cool!\nKawabe: Yeah, so!\nTodd: It all worked out at the end!\nKawabe: Yeah!

Unfortunately I have a terrible voice. I cannot sing at all, and in Japan, this is very embarrassing because Japanese people love to go to karaoke, and karaoke is when you go with a bunch of friends to a place, a karaoke bar, I guess, or center, and you get a small room and inside the room there are TV's and songs are on the TV's. You can choose what songs to watch and then one person sings the song and everyone listens and it's very popular in Japan and it's a lot of fun but it's really embarrassing because I can't sing and everybody always says, \" No, no, no, you sing. Oh, no, it's OK. It's OK. Don't worry. Don't be embarrassed,\" but after I sing, my singing is so bad that everybody doesn't want me to sing anymore, so it's also really hard for me because I teach children and I love teaching children and\nwhen you teach children you need to teach songs, and so I sing many, many songs with my students, for example, \"Itsy-Bitsy Spider\" or \"Row-Row-Row your boat!\" or many many songs, but I can't sing and so luckily the kids really don't care so usually it's alright that my voice is really bad but sometimes they tell me, they say, \"Sensei, Sensei!\" in Japanese, \"You're singing is terrible!\" so it's really embarrassing but I have to do it. Songs are very important for children when they're little. I think the reason I cannot sing is because unfortunately in my country we don't sing as children and I really would like this to change. It really bothers me. I've noticed in Thailand, in Japan, in other countries that I have taught, children sing in elementary school a lot and in the United States you don't do this and I think's it's terrible because you need to sing when you're little to train your voice so it can learn tones and so it can learn how to sing properly and because I never learned to sing when I was little it's almost impossible to learn how to sing when you're older, so yeah, I really wish I could sing but I just don't think that it's ever going to be a reality.",

The worst job I've ever had has to be Fort Fun in East Born.\nMarion: What's Fort Fun?\nSteve: Fort Fun is fun for children but it isn't fun for the spotty 16 year olds who have to work there, so some have the good fortune to operate go-carts and other things like that. I had the great fortune to work in the tearoom with an old lady called Brenda.\nMarion: What was Brenda like?\nSteve: Brenda was basically a witch and she had two offspring which were also going to probably a witch training school, and they'd come around and they'd gossip and, but Brenda would always notice in mid gossip whether I'd, if I'd stirred the tea one revolution too few and then she'd be on me, as it is, so I had to serve ice-creams and scalding hot tea from a spitting tea machine that wasn't working properly from two hatches. One, one looking out onto the beach, and one actually inside Fort Fun  so inside Fort Fun was bearable, because, and also all of this time you have to bear in mind that I was wearing a cowboy hat and a little cowboy waistcoat with a sheriff's badge on it, and I had two holstered plastic guns which I was advised by the manager to like whip out and pretend to shoot like any young kid that came up there. Anyway, that wasn't so bad, having to suffer that indignity, you know lack of dignity, but when it came to serving from the hatch, from the sea front, where all the surfers would come and get their tea, and obviously that provided great amusement to them, and anyway, to cut a long story short, I lasted about three weeks before deciding f*ck it, I'd rather be poor for the summer, then have people going yeah, that's him as I walked out.\nMarion: That's the cowboy from Fort Fun?\nSteve: Yeah, that is.\nMarion: Brilliant. Thanks Steven.\nSteve: You're welcome.",

It was not very long but I was doing that for like 6 months.\nTodd: Do you mean push bike or motorcycle?\nKawabe: Push bike? What is a push bike?\nTodd: Push bike is like the one you ride with you legs.\nKawabe: Oh, no, no. no. The motorcycle. \nTodd: Motorcycle! OK.\nKawabe: Yes! Yes! 400 cc. I forget the name of the bike, but it was kind of one really fast, and then, you know what they are doing, they just go, OK, if you are sending a letter, a very important document, you want to send it to somewhere really fast, very, very quickly! \nTodd: Like for a signiture of something.\nKawabe: Yeah, whatever it is! Like and then, you call me. You call to my company and the company call to my mobile or beeper, and then, \"hey Kawabe, you go to that place,\" and you get the address, and I look it up in my map, and I go to your place and pick up the thing and deliver to your receiver.\nTodd: Oh, to the receiver, to the recipient (Yeah), the recipient.\nKawabe: And then since it's a bike delivery it's always something you've got to deliver really fast, so which means it's a really dangerous job, you know, so many people, my colleagues had a car accident.\nTodd: Oh really!\nKawabe: Definitely, if you,..\nTodd: Not you right? You were OK?\nKawabe: Not me! Since I thought I, you know, I can have a really big accident if I keep on this job, that is why I quit. \nTodd: Good choice.Yeah! \nKawabe: If you do that job for one year, definitely, you'll have one accident at least.\nTodd: Seriouly!\nKawabe: Yeah! Seriously!\nTodd: Man, wow! I heard something similar in the U.S. Big truck drivers, on average over their career, kill at least one person.\nKawabe: Yeah, the same kind of thing, you know! Especially in Tokyo. You know, there's millions of cars and motorcycles, and people walking on the street, you know it's really dangerous, and even if you are a safe driver, someone's gonna hit you, (Yeah) so.\nTodd: There's nothing you can do.\nKawabe: You can run away if you are on the street but there's no place to run away, so, anyway, that was, that was an exciting job. I really enjoyed that because you are always outside. The rainy days, you know, I didn't like that, but on the sunny day, autumn, spring, and it was great to drive in Tokyo city. You could go everywhere and meet a lot of people and so. Yeah, I met one person, he was a manga writer. How do you say?\nTodd: Yeah, manga writer, sure, yeah!\nKawabe: And then the publishing company asked me to take, how do you say, the document for the next week?\nTodd: Oh, like the, the new issue. (Yeah) Yeah, the first draft, or whatever.\nKawabe: Yeah, and then he had to finish that one like until that day, so \"Hey, Kawabe, you go to that manga writer's house and pick up the documents he's gonna give you, and then you bring that, the draft, how do you say? (Yeah) **** to the publishing company.\" OK, and I'd been to his house and I had to wait like four hours in front of his door cause you know, you can imagine, he couldn't finish up his work (Yeah, yeah) so he like in every thirty minutes he comes to the door, and says, \"Oh, I'm so sorry! I'm gonna finish it in 10 minutes. It will be done in the next 10 minutes.\" And then he goes back and I wait and I just kept waiting from the door and actually, four hours later, he gave me the manga.\nTodd: Really! (Yeah!) Did you read it on the way?\nKawabe: No, yeah, I was really tempted but I couldn't do that, and yeah, I brought that to the publishing company. That was so funny! \nTodd: Cool story!",

It's a heat gun over the custard and it makes the sugar harden and then on the inside it's all custard. If that makes sense. It's really good.

        "transcript": "I'd like to talk about consumerism in capitalist and communist countries. I don't know if anyone has actually noticed but Japan is very, what's the word, \"consumerized.\" Everything is built for the consumer. You've got huge adverts, you've got talking trees, you've got people with microphones outside the shop screaming \"Ireshaimase\" at everybody as they go past. Everything is built for advertising, for consuming, for buying, for competing, for constantly making newer and better goods so people buy them. A complete reverse of this is somewhere like Cuba, which is one of the last sort of communist states around, and probably the only place where communism has actually worked. In Cuba everything is owned by the government so there's no companies competing with each other for advertising space, sort of trying to out do each other, and driving prices up, everything's done by the government, any adverts are for the same products owned by the same people. When I was living in Cuba we tried to explain how in a capitalist society, how consumerism would work, so I'd like to give you a quick example.\nIn Cuba there are many people selling really cheap orange juice on the street. They make it from like a, like a cordial, like a powder which they add water to and they dilute it and keep it cold and they sell it for the equivalent of about 10 yen a glass. Many people sell this. I tried to explain to my host family, OK, if this was, if we wanted to sell this orange juice in the street, we would find out the supplier, buy all of it, and then open up shop charging three times the price as anyone else. No one would be able to sell any because they couldn't naturally get a hold of it. The Cubans have no idea this would be a good idea. We received questions such as, \"Why would you do that? But that would mean no one else could sell any. That would mean you would get all the money and no one else. We were like, \"exactly!\"",

I've actually been at school in England for quite a while of it. Living away from your own country is great. I guess it's really good when you're young you get to see different countries. I stopped off in Africa and Nigeria. I was actually born in England, but I went there fifteen days after I was born so, my first plane flight was 15 days old, and I can't really remember obviously that much of that but then we went to Holland for nine years, which is great and it's, you know, I'm very lucky to have grown up in a different culture, although very embarassingly I can's speak the language cause I always went to an Enlgish school, but it's kind of difficult cause you, wherever you go, you make friends. You get close to people and then suddenly you have to move, and move house, go on to somewhere else, and I found this to be the sort of hardest thing, when I was 8, I went off to boarding school in England cause my parents thought I'd get a better education that way than moving around to different schools all over the world, and this was you know, it was good it was fun, but something like I always envied was the way, all the other kids at school, there school friends were just their friends in term time, but their real friends were friends that, you know, they had known since they were little, since you know, since they had been born or, you know their early school friends and they still knew them and you know even when I was 18 years old, still, my friend's from school had their real friends at home who they'd known all there lives, and I've kind of always envied that because we've always been moving around and as I say, you know, I'm very lucky, we've been in Holland, Scotland, and Africa, and I've very lucky to have seen all of these places but it's kind of hard as well, not having a root, not having a place where you can actually call your home, somewhere to go back to at the end of the day and have all of your family and friends around you.",

        "transcript": "Eli\nI had a really nice day today. It's Sunday today, so obviously I got nothing to do so I went to meet my English friend Ben in a place called Harajuku in Tokyo, which is a great place to hang out in on Sundays anyway, but we found this amazing sushi restaurant that we used to go to together every time we meet up. Sundays usually our day for meeting up together cause he lives in Yokohama which is quite a long way away from me. So I don't ever see him during the week. Anyway, this sushi restaurant we found is the best one I've eaten at in Tokyo. It's one of those ones with all the sushi on a little conveyor belt, that goes along, but it doesn't just do raw fish it does all the different meats. It does little hamburgers on rice, little bits of bacon on rice, melon, salad, and also loads of puddings. We ended up I think eating about 7 puddings between us today. Um, it's, the pricing system really good. It's done on, the, how many plates you eat, and each plate is different color and that's a different price and it's so cheap and you end up, just gorging yourself eating loads and loads, for really a very cheap price, so after that we were both stuffed, and left the restaurant, went to a, up to a place in Harajuku where all the crazy kids hang out wearing costume. Had a look around there. Took some pictures and then walked along the road together about 15 minutes to a place called Shibuya which is really one of the good sort of trendy young shopping, hanging out places in Tokyo, um, just so crowded all the time,\nbut today they were having a Matsuri festival on, where all the sort of people from the local different sort of dojos and clubs get together and carry this big heavy thing through the streets all in there traditional Japanese clothes, and all that chanting and singing and whistling, so that was really nice to see. We decided we wanted to go to the cinema to see a new film that has just come out so we walked all around Shibuya looking for cinemas and everyone we went to didn't have this film, wasn't playing this film, so we gave up on that in the end. Ben went home and I went into one of the shopping centers in Shibuya looking for souvenirs for my friends, cause it's getting to that time now where I gotta start thinking I'm leaving Japan in a month and there's just my list of presents that I've got to get for people, a number of people I've got to get things for is just getting longer and longer as I keep on remembering more and more people, so I've stuffed my souvenir buying now and I think Shibuya, as far as my girlfriend's is concerned is the best to buy stuff.",

        "transcript": "Todd\nOK. Growing up in America, in the United States, as a young child, we have three special people, mythical people, we believe in and we really like because they give us gifts or money. The first special person is the tooth fairy, and the tooth fairy gives you money for your teeth, so it works like this: when you're very young you lose all your teeth, usually one by one, so every time you lose a tooth you put your tooth under your pillow and when you wake up the next day, magically there is money under your pillow, usually it's a silver dollar, and so you're always very excited to get the money and it's kind of cool because, you know you're happy to lose teeth, maybe the only time you're happy to lose teeth you're entire life. The other special character we believe in is the Easter Bunny and the Easter Bunny hides Easter eggs on Easter Sunday. The Easter Bunny is a rabbit. Bunny means rabbit, and on Easter Sunday, a Christian holiday in March and April we go outside with a basket and we look for eggs the Easter bunny hid in the garden or backyard or something like that and there are two types of eggs: there are real eggs, hard-boiled eggs that are painted on the outside and often the children decorate those themselves and there are plastic eggs and plastic eggs are hallow on the inside and you can open them, and when you open them, there is candy or money, so those are the ones the kids really want to get. Actually, it's funny, sometimes kids won't even pick up the real eggs because they just want the eggs with money or candy in them.\nAnd then, actually, I'm sorry we have one more person of course, and that is Santa, and everybody knows about Santa around the world, and Santa comes down your chimney on Christmas Eve Night, Dec 24th, and he puts gifts in your stocking. A stocking is a big sock, a big red sock for Christmas, and you hang it on your fireplace and then Santa puts toys and gifts inside for the good little children around the world, so the story goes, that Santa works all year to make toys and gifts for children but only for the good children, so you have to be good. If you're a bad child then you don't get any gifts but it usually doesn't work that way, so you come down the next day, and you go to your stocking and you're very happy because Santa had come. One other thing about Santa is usually as children we leave cookies and milk by the fireplace for Santa to eat as like a thank-you gift, and it's interesting because when you go down the next morning, of course the cookies and the milk is always gone and so I think you can guess who actually ate the cookie and drank the milk, but yeah, it's kind of nice, so those are our three special people that we believe in as children in the United States",

OK, manga is the, is the drawing with the story.\nTodd: Uh-huh! So like a comic book, but not really a comic book. \nKawabe: Mm, that, many kinds of manga, so basically it's the picture which is drawn by someone, and then you read it, and which has a story, it's a comic. Mm, it's a comic, and then,\nTodd: So there's manga about many things. \nKawabe: About many things yes!\nTodd: For example, what topics or what themes might there be manga about?\nKawabe: It depends, it depends. There are thousands of you know, stories and if it's about the animal,like a, it can be anything.\nTodd: Really! (Yeah) Like for example, baseball or?\nKawabe: Yeah! Baseball stories. A kid's stories, American football story, Shakespeare's manga.\nTodd: Shakespeare manga!\nKawabe: Yeah, you don't have to read! (Really) Yeah, of course. And then, what else? Everything, you can. \nTodd: Ramen manga?\nKawabe: Ramen manga! There is. Seriously! Ramen manga! Salaryman manga. School teacher manga, and any kind of home drama, or the stories of novel can be manga. Manga script. So, it's, OK, imagine the movie. Yeah! You can make up everything. Troy! Old ancient greek stories! Or the like the, the future stories, like, and the, you know, whatever it is. You know. You just make it up,and write it or draw it.\nTodd: Why do you think manga is so popular?\nKawabe: Because, it's like the hollywood movie, in the states the hollywood movie is so popular, because it's the field you can express your imagination, where you can play with your imagination, and how do you say?\nTodd: Like it's not real.\nKawabe: Yeah, it's not real.\nTodd: Escape reality.\nKawabe: Uh-huh, it's the, like a neverland. \nTodd: Fantasy!\nKawabe: Fantasy! So, in Japan it's the manga instead of hollywood movies, I think. \nTodd: That's really interesting. So do you still read manga?\nKawabe: I used to read a lot, read a lot, but now I don't read much as I was reading, OK, for example, how much do I read? Like one story in three months. \nTodd: You mean one manga story in three months. Oh! so you still read manga sometimes?\nKawabe: Sometimes! Like sometimes my friend recommended, or sometimes I saw a good review on the magazine. Yeah, I pick up some and I read them when I got time, but not very much recently.",

T. do?\n\nCat: Occupational therapists work with people who have had accidents or disabilities, help them regain function and so that they can be independent in the activities that they enjoy doing, so the occupation and occupational therapies, the activities people enjoy doing every day and it looks into, instead of physiotherapy works with just the muscles and building muscles, so they just do repetitions, but occupational therapy incorporates things that people actually enjoy doing into the activities for therapy, if that makes sense. It's kind of broad but yeah!\n\nNicola: So, it's kind of getting them back into their own life, their normal life? So, for example, if they've had an accident, is it or, for young people or old, or?\n\nCat: Yeah, it's the whole span of people, but um, yeah, people, for instances if a child has had an accident their main occupation is play so, you want to get them back into as much play as they can, and get them as strong as you can, so you can do that through play, but an adult you want to try and get them back into, say if they enjoy sewing or riding or surfing or those kinds of activities, as the O. T. you try to incorporate that into the therapy that you do with them, as much as you can. It depends on their injury. \n\nNicola: OK, so where are you working now as an O. T.?\n\nCat: Right now, I'm working in hospital at Lismore, and it's more of an acute care setting so people who have had major injuries or accidents and it's pretty much just helping them move on to the next step, either going home or going to another hospital and organizing the things that they need to be able to get back to the activities of daily living. (Wow) It's kind of complicated, but that's the basics of it, but it's a little bit more than that.\n\nNicola: That sounds pretty challenging.\n\nCat: Yeah, it's good. \n\nNicola: OK, so thanks for talking to us and all the best in your work.",

Now, Gabrielle you talked to us last year. \nGabrielle:That's right!\nTodd: And you said that you're from Christchurch?\nGabrielle: Uh-huh, from Christchurch in New Zealand.\nTodd: OK, can you talk about your city?\nGabrielle: Absolutely! Absolutely! Well, Christchurch I guess compared to Japan is pretty small, but for New Zealand it's quite a big city. I think it's a great place. Yeah, we've got the beach, the mountains, yeah so city center and nature, really close.\nTodd: Sounds nice! How many people live in Christchurch?\nGabrielle: Oh, that's a good question. Gosh! Were certainly not up to a million! I guess about 600,000 people. \nTodd: Wow, that's it! Just 6!\nGabrielle: That's it. Big city in New Zealand!\nTodd: Wow! So there's three big cities in New Zealand! \nGabrielle: That's right! That's right! We're probably the second or third biggest city.\nTodd: Uh, what's the transportation like?\nGabrielle: Well, I use my bike usually or a car. We certainly don't have the trains like Tokyo, but there's a bus system. It's not too bad, but most Kiwis have cars. Yeah, more convenient. \nTodd: OK, now can I ask you about costs?\nGabrielle: Sure! Sure!\nTodd: OK, and you can say Japanese yen prices.\nGabrielle: Yeah! Yeah!\nTodd: How much is an apartment? A one bedroom apartment, downtown?\nGabrielle: Well, to be honest we don't have that style. We've got plenty of space so we usually rent a house which has three bedrooms and a garden, for example, and much cheaper, much, much cheaper. I'm just trying to convert.\nTodd: Three bedrooms and a garden!\nGabrielle: Yeah! And often we go \"flatting\" which means we share the house with maybe a couple of friends, probably pay about, I was paying $80 a week for my room so, oh, sorry my conversion rate is not working too quickly at the moment.\nTodd: That's really cheap though!\nGabrielle: It's incredibly cheap. Yeah, much, much cheaper! Much bigger!\nTodd: Wow! sounds like a nice place! OK, how much is, New Zealand prices OK, how much is a loaf of bread?\nGabrielle: A loaf of bread! To get the good bread, probably about $2.50 a loaf, yeah, so, maybe about, oh sorry, my conversion's not working, I've been in Tokyo for too long!\nTodd: How about a movie ticket?\nGabrielle: A movie ticket would be about $13, so it's much cheaper than here. Yeah, definitely!\nTodd: And bus fare!\nGabrielle: Bus fare, a dollar fifty, two dollars for one way.\nTodd: How about if you're going to buy your friend a sweater, a nice sweater, how much would that cost?\nGabrielle: Well, I like the good outdoor brand sweaters so I would probably say about $50 but an everyday sweater you could get about $15 New Zealand. Yeah. \nTodd: OK, Wow! Sounds like a great place. Oh, and last one, the weather, when is the best time of year to visit?\nGabrielle: Oh, summer, definitely.\nTodd: So that's December?\nGabrielle: Yeah, so we're going into summer now so December to February, but we have four seasons in one day, so you can count on all weather even within summer. Yeah! Yeah! \nTodd: Do you have a really bad month to go, where the weather is not nice?\nGabrielle: Yeah, usually June, July, it probably rains the most, but we still get gorgeous sunny days in the winter so, yeah there's not really any bad time.\nTodd: Oh, sounds nice! Thanks Gabrielle!\nGabrielle: No, problem!\n                                No, problem!",

She also knows a few friends that I know in England so we've\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    kind of got similar interests. We're from a similar world in our own country so it's really nice to find someone who I'm sort of on an equal stepping with here, so she invited me over for the evening. I had a lesson in the afternoon and then after that I got in the tube, she lives about, sort of over an hour away from me by train cause I live in the sort of northeast of Tokyo, actually out of Tokyo in Chiba, and she lives in the southwest, so we couldn't really be farther away if we tried but she invited me over for a girl's night in which is something I did a lot with my friend when I was in England so it was really nice and she's doing, she's teaching a design course here, interior design, in a Japanese college, and she's got her own apartment near Shibuya, which is quite a sort of busy nice area of Tokyo. So when I went over it was really nice. She's got her own little space with a balcony and kitchen something which I don't have at the moment, cause I'm living in a guesthouse and she cooked for me. Mash potatoes and sausage and onion gravy which is a very typical English dish and so we ate that. We had some wine and then watched a DVD called Twin Towns which is made in Wales and is sort of made us really miss home. We had this sort of very English evening together all together. I had Bangers n' mash , *** a potato and sausage, and um, like English film, and it was really, really enjoyable. It was something I haven't done here yet and I guess it's something I really miss cause I really miss my friends from home and hanging out with them and it was nice and then I stayed over. She had like a futon in her sitting room and I stayed over we both got up together this morning to head in for work. I was a little bit late, but, cause of the distance I was having to travel but that doesn't really matter. I'm usually late for school anyway.",

What kind of sandwich? (Sorry!) What kind of sandwich?\nRaphael: You know the usual ones you find in Japan like tomatoes and then tuna and some mayonnaise, yeah, basic triangle, you know, bread sandwiches.\nTodd: Yeah, not good stuff.\nRaphael: No, it's not really good.\nTodd: Um, what do you normally have for dinner?\nRaphael: Well, the same kind of things. (Why?) The truth is, like almost everyday I eat outside cause it's quite easy to eat outside in Japan, yeah, but when I eat home like pasta or pizza.\nTodd: Oh, OK. Oh, and what can you make? What type (myself) yeah?\nRaphael: French gratin. Gratin. (Oh, gratin.) Yeah!\nTodd: What is that?\nRaphael: It's basically baked potatoes with milk, onions, bacon, and what else, butter, what, that's it. You can add several things. Cheese as well of course. \nTodd: So how do you make it?\nRaphael: Well, you cut the potatoes in slices and you make like, you put, you need a big dish. Put the potatoes and a bit of bacon and a bit of onions and then you put cheese and potatoes again until you go to the top where you add the milk and you put some butter on top of it make it bake for 45 minutes and it's done\nTodd: Sounds good!\nRaphael: It's easy. It's quite easy actually. I'm not a good cooker at all. I can smell it though. Yeah, I haven't had dinner so that sounds good.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Eli, could you talk a little bit about what you study to be an animator and how the industry has changed over the years?\nEli: Yeah, well, I actually studied, the degree I did was a graphic design course, which taught you art, every aspect of graphic design but they looked at graphic design as actually communication design which is basically just trying to get a message across a certain way thought the use of graphics, you know graphical methods, so I mean, that doesn't necessarily mean just you know text, words, on a screen, you know, words on a poster. I mean, people's people's views of graphic design is usually like posters, advertising, um, adverts in magazines but we were sort of made to think that that is just a tiny bit of graphic design, I mean you can communicate message, through any medium, you know even sort of acting, and stuff like that, they were, it was really that broad so, obviously with my love of anime I chose animation, I mean, it's something I've been interested in for a long time and I do 3D computer animation kind of like \"Toy Story\" but obviously not as good. I was actually the only person on my course doing that, so it was quite a challenge. I had an amazing animation tutor, who had got some pretty amazing portfolio behind him, to help me out, and if it wasn't for him, I probably would have torn my hair out years ago and maybe even quit the course cause I, there was a big, dispute with sort of my view of computer animation, what I was interested in with the graphic design tutor's views, they were all about deep meaning and you know, messages behind work and I was actually about learning how to animate well, you know the techniques of animation. I mean it's always very important to have the background skills of ideas because you can be technically good at something, you can be able to use a computer program brilliantly, but if you don't have the sort of ideas or background then you're never going to be able to make a good piece. I mean, I've heard that Pixar, the company who make \"Toy Story\" actually hire actors instead of animators to do their animating. They hire them for their acting skills and then they teach them how to use the software afterwards, cause actually, that's what it's about, it's making characters act, it's whatever it is, whether it's a coke can or a book, if you want to give that a personality, you got to think about how you're gonna give this inanimate object a personality, how are you going to make it looked scared, how are you going to make it look happy, um, that's what I was interested in, sort of techniques of learning how to do that, so, yeah, it was a struggle but it was definitely worth it in the end, and I think I'll go on to have a good career.",

That's my job!\nTodd: OK. Why is theater design going away? Because people are not going to the theater? \nRaphael: No it's not being away, but the point is it's a difficult job because there's not so many money coming from this practice, you know, because the theater system is not, not so many people go to the theater comparing to cinema or exhibits or, you know, this kind of things, and it's quite a reserved to the helet, and it's very difficult for the, actually, the artists who works in this area cause there's not a lot of money coming from it so just living, like designing for theater is quite difficult. \nTodd: Well, I can imagine. So, what kind of design would you like to do then?\nRaphael: Now, I'm really interested in light design. That's the reason why I came to Japan, because they have some really interesting light designer here, especially because they don't have the same strict architecture rules that we have in France, like every time you want to build something new, or just decorate a shop, anything, you need, once the project is over, everything's prepared you need to show it to an architect who specialize in this very rules. He will tell you if you can or not actually build it, corresponding to the rhythm of the existing buildings, you know the lines, the structure of everything, things like that. It's really difficult, so Japan is changing faster, they destruct, they build a new building, and they destruct, and they build something new, they don't really care about the past of the buildings so there's a lot of liberty from light designer. It's very free. They can do some really interesting things.\nTodd: Well, what would be your dream job, if you could have any job?\nRaphael: My dream job? I wish I could make a connection between my light design skills and my taste for music, sound design. Actually it's, theater is one place where these things mix up. Cinema is one place where it mix up as well, but there's not a lot of fields where you can like think at the same time about the effect produced by the sound, and the effect produced by the light.\nTodd: So, it's be like a scary movie has dark lighting and dark music?\nRaphael: Yeah, this kind of thing. This kind of, but when you want to produce a moment because it's basically what it's about, it's producing a moment, a feeling, like you can use any media, right? Whatever it is, it's not important. The important is what are you creating, has an effect, but when you use at the same time, light and sound it's quite complement, complementary.\nTodd: Oh, OK. Well, best of luck.",

He's my favorite president. \nJose: Well, it's so interesting because you know the guy was, I mean when went there, all of a sudden I had this strange people looking at me. I say, \"What happened? What's wrong?\" There were 8 bodyguards with the guy.\nTodd: No kidding!\nJose: Yes! He was with his wife and his daughter and the child. Yeah it was interesting. You know that's just one anecdote but still, I'm , the Galapagos Islands, what I can tell you is that, it's a unique place, but you have to go there, sooner than later is better because I think the whole ecosystem will collapse. \nTodd: Oh, no!\nJose:  Yeah! The situation is very complicated because lack of ---- of the government. The poor fisherman, and they don't have any kind of way to actually make a living by destroying the system. And all the money just goes to the big tourist companies that are taking tourists and you go to the capital, to Quito, but the people on the Islands, they don't have money, so they are, there's no control, for fishing, I mean, sharks and lobsters and tuna and so on, so everything is terrible. I was very very upset with the situation, and also you know, it's a kind of tourism for rich people and I was the only Ecuadorian in the group \nTodd: Really! That's not good. \nJose: Yes, that's not good. You know we were just servers and waitresses and waiters and Ecuadorians so, for me it was, I was 5 days there. You know it's very beautiful to see the animals and birds but me being an Ecuadorian I had a completely different point of view. I was very disappointed frankly.",

Wow!\nJose: Yes, yes, yes! Potatoes and also corn from the Andes\nTodd: Wow!\nJose: Yes. Didn't you know?\nTodd: No, no! That's embarrassing.\nJose: And do you know, of course for us, potatoes and corn and also rice. It's one of the main dishes, I think, or pork also, and we use lots of pecante sauce, chili sauce. Ah, corn is great. Corn with fresh cheese.\nTodd: Corn with cheese?\nJose: Yes, yes, yes, yes!\nTodd: How do you make it?\nJose: Just you take the corn when it's fresh and boil it and you just put it with out anything, no salt, no butter, no anything, and fresh cheese.\nTodd: No kidding, so you melt the cheese on the corn?\nJose: No, no, no, no!\nTodd: So the cheese is hard?\nJose: It is fresh cheese. \nTodd: Oh, I don't understand.\nJose: Fresh cheese! Do you, you have different kinds of cheese. (Yeah) You have this kind of fresh cheese. You have basically no salt, and it just made. Usually the cheese you have to mature the cheese.\nTodd: Oh, I got you! So it's more liquid?\nJose: No, no, it's just called fresh cheese.\nTodd: OK, well, I have to try it. \nJose: Yes, of course. \nTodd: Wow! That sounds good. And can you get Japanese food in Ecuador?\nJose: Yeah, it's very expensive. You can do it because of course we have the Pacific coast, we have very good, what can I say, fish, and actually Japanese fisherman, they go to the Galapagos area and they pay certain fees. I don't know when, what they pay, and they catch all the tuna they want, so we have good, very good tuna, yeah, and many different kinds of fish so you can have sashimi and sushi and in Quito you have maybe two or three different Japanese restaurants. All of them very upscale at least.",

Japanese is a very difficult language and I think as someone who has never learned another language before I'm struggling more than other kids are. I feel that a lot of theother, say European kids, that this is there third or fourth language, that they can speak fluently, they pick it up very quickly, and for me it's slightly more difficult. \nAs I say, our school is quite advanced and it moves very, very quickly in conversation. We're not learning any Kanji, which is kind of difficult cause that's one thing you really do need to learn if you're living here, but the conversation moves very quickly and we learn a lot of new stuff, so it's quite difficult to practice it all. I think that's the problem I'm finding, and a lot of my friends say the same thing: they're learning it all but then they don't have time to practice. It's actually crazy to think, you're in Japan but it's quite difficult to actually practice the Japanese language. \nYou see all my Japanese friends they want to practice English with me, so, you actually end up being very lazy, and not talking that much Japanese, so I think that is the problem, just you have to have conversation thru conversation all the time and I'm not really doing that at the moment, so yeah, it's difficult. I think I'll get there. I'm just about starting to understand stuff now.",

So, first of all, how often do you clean, like your apartment?\n\nAdrienne: Thoroughly, I would say I clean once a week.\n\nTodd: So, do you consider yourself a clean person?\n\nAdrienne: I consider myself an organized person.\n\nTodd: OK. So, in your house what is the one room you hate cleaning?\n\nAdrienne: Probably the bathroom, which includes the shower, the sink, toilet. (Yeah) All together.\n\nTodd: Yeah, so, why?\n\nAdrienne: I just think it's the grossest part of the house. It always seems to accumulate the most dirt and grime (Yeah) pretty disgusting.\n\nTodd: Yeah, it's hard to get the stuff off the tiles. (Right) You got to scrub and scrub and it's still brown or green or whatever color it is.\n\nAdrienne: Exactly. It's just a difficult place to get into to clean, and there's lots of small spaces to get into and.\n\nTodd: Yeah! In Japan it's weird because they have these little portable bathrooms, you know, they're all plastic so,\n\nAdrienne: It's easy. You just take the sprayer and spray the whole room.\n\nTodd: Yeah! I'm convinced that they drop those bathrooms in a, with a helicopter. They just drop them right in there. You got everything, you know. \n\nAdrienne: Easy! Convenient! Efficient!\n\nTodd: What about laundry?\n\nAdrienne: I don't like really doing any type of manual labor, but I don't mind doing laundry from time to time. \n\nTodd: Yeah, I like laundry actually. I like the smell of the clothes when you finish. \n\nAdrienne: Yeah, that's a good part of it, but I don't like to actually to do the work, washing!\n\nTodd: Yeah, actually, I like to clean. That's why I have this question. (Mm) I'm a clean freak. Like, I like washing dishes. I like doing laundry. Yeah!\n\nAdrienne: Yeah, that's not fun for me. (No!) I'd rather sleep given the choice. \n\nTodd: Like you can pay me and I'll clean your apartment.\n\nAdrienne: Oh, sounds good. Perfect!\n\nTodd: How much? How much would you pay me?\n\nAdrienne: Um, see, going rate for a maid these day, Todd?\n\nTodd: Maid! That's a sexist comment!\n\nAdrienne: It is a sexist comment! But it is, the going rate for a maid,\n\nTodd: Male cleaning attendant!\n\nAdrienne: I don't think that's what they're called. They'd still call them a maid service. Um, I don't know.I think it's about 15 dollars an hour. \n\nTodd: Ooh! You'd pay me 15 dollars an hour?\n\nAdrienne: No, that's the going rate. That's not what I'll pay you.\n\nTodd: I thought I was going to make some money!\n\nAdrienne: Well, I thought I was going to get a discount.\n\nTodd: This web site's expensive.\n\nAdrienne: Oh, right, right, right!\n\nTodd: So I need the money.\n\nAdrienne: Oh! OK, 15 it is!\n\nTodd: OK, but how dirty is your place?\n\nAdrienne: Pretty, pretty dirty!\n\nTodd: Ah, well, I'll take a look at it.\n\nAdrienne: You'll me working for the money, for sure!",

Depends on the time. \nTodd: I mean, well, the US is the same. We have cities in America where it is incredibly dangerous. \nJose: Yes, yes, yes. Of course but, usually I think Ecuadorian people are very kind, very nice, and you can, you'll have a great time.

I'd probably say about twenty different countries. I've taught English in Japan, Korea, and in Thailand and traveled throughout Southeast Asia. I have family in Europe so I've done the, you know, the high school backpacking trip around Europe and since I'm North American I've visited pretty much all of North America, you know, US, Mexico, Canada, and I went on a delightful trip to Cuba.\nMichael: Cuba! Excellent!\nSimon: How bout you? Are you well traveled?\nMichael: Um, not as well as you. I think my tally is now is 14 countries. I've been to Scotland, Ireland, England. I've been to Trinidad and Tabago.\nSimon: Wow that sounds! That would be an interesting place.\nMichael: Yeah, it was. I've been to quite a few places in Asia now. Singapore and Hong Kong. I've been to Australia. I've been to about 20 prefectures in Japan.\nSimon: Oh, wow. That's quite a few. Travel in Japan is quite difficult actually. For those of us that don't make a lot of money anyway. \nMichael: Yeah, it is kind of expensive, but actually, the prefectures are so small, that you can go to quite a few on a local train from Tokyo.\nSimon: That's true. That's true. Ah, is there any prefecture that stands out in your mind as being special or interesting or different?\nMichael: Mm, that's a good question. Prefecture! I don't know about Hiroshima prefecture but the city stands out in my mind. The people are really, really lovely. And as far as the scenery, Mie prefecture is gorgeous and for that real Japan experience for that people from abroad, their image of Japan, Hakone in Kanagawa. I stayed in a Japanese inn there and it was just perfect.\nSimon: Wow, that sounds great. Yeah, for me, the real good stuff in Japan was Tohoku because it's one of the few places in Japan where you don't see power lines everywhere but you still have a lot of Japanese traditional architecture and style.\nMichael: Yeah, I had one of those experiences in Tohoku, I think it was in Akita, driving and we passed, we were on a bridge and we passed by a valley with a very traditional Japanese houses and a little tiny river and it was exactly like you imagined Japan. \nSimon: Oh, that's great!",

I've been playing for many, many years since I was a little girl and everyone in my family plays an instrument so it's part of what we do together as a family. \nTodd: So when you were little you practiced every day?\nAdrienne: I did. My mom made me. I didn't have a choice. It's good for discipline though, or at least that's what she told me. \nTodd: So, how would you practice? Did you have a tutor come over to your house?\nAdrienne: No, I had a violin teacher once a week and when I was really small I went to group lessons also, so it was once a week with a private and once a week with a group. \nTodd: Wow! That's a lot. What did you think about the violin when you were little?\nAdrienne: I don't remember thinking about it. I don't even remember learning how to play. I was only two so (so young) I know. I was still in diapers, but my mom said that when I had my first recital that I really wanted to play in the recital and she said I absolutely could not play on stage in a diaper so that's basically how she got me out of my diapers. So she says!\nTodd: When did you stop playing?\nAdrienne: I haven't stopped.\nTodd: Oh, you still practice.\nAdrienne: I still play although I don't have my violin here in Japan, right now. I'm kind of on a break I guess. I just don't like to carry it around overseas.\nTodd: Is it hard to be away from your violin?\nAdrienne: It is sometimes. I miss it. I miss playing with my family too, cause we're kind of like the Van Trap family, which you know from the movie The Sound of Music.\nTodd: No, no, I don't. I've never seen the movie. \nAdrienne: Oh, you haven't? The Sound of Music is about a family in, I think it's Austria and they all play an instrument or sing and it's a World War II movie and that's how they escape the Nazis, from singing or something. It's kind of like that, except for without the war.\nTodd: Well, I have to see the movie so!\nAdrienne: Yeah, you should. \nTodd: So are you going to play the violin for me sometime?\nAdrienne: Sure! If you can find a violin I will.",

You have so many microclimates because you have the Andes ranges, you have the coast and then you have two ranges, mountains, it's got actually, it's called the avenue volcanoes. It's got key mountains. It's very beautiful. You have these subtropical valleys and then you have, you go to the amazon basin. You have the jungle. So you have the jungle from the coast, the jungle also going to the Amazon, and you have this beautiful area in the Andes, so it's very, very nice. \nTodd: Oh, I want to go! \nJose: Please, please come!\nTodd: OK, when is the best time of year to Ecuador?\nJose: Also, as I said the micro climate, that means that it depends on where you want to go. You want to go to the Galapagos the best time is from November to April probably. \nTodd: I don't want to go there now because you scared me because you said about the people going there.\nJose: Yeah, yes! But it's a very beautiful place. I mean if you go just like tourist, you're going to, it's fantastic, it's a unique place. You can actually swim with the sea lions and they are chomping next to you, very beautiful. But I can not separate nature and from the people, so that is my problem. I think Ecuador is a very interesting place to be. \nTodd: Well, I would like to go. I'd like to go Ecuador and learn Spanish actually. \nJose: Yeah, there are so many schools actually. There is a big business. Lots of music and culture. Mm, very pretty girls. That is the part that you like. \nTodd: Maybe!",

So it would be the Sunday after March 23rd. \nEaster is a Christian holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That means the rebirth of Jesus Christ, when he was born again after his death. If you ask children, however, what Easter is all about, they will say that it is about Easter eggs and the Easter bunny. It’s interesting this tradition comes from a non-Christian source. \nA long time ago when non-Christians would celebrate the springtime, there is a story of a bird who had a broken wing and a magician turned him into a rabbit so he would be able to survive the winter better. And this rabbit was still able to lay eggs like a bird. So now they celebrate the Easter Bunny during springtime and we—children paint eggs and adults hide them and the children have to go find the eggs and put them in their Easter basket.",

He went home and told his dad and finally called me back later on that evening and said, \"Hey, my dad said that you need a modem to break into another computer.\"",

It always takes, it always takes hours to set up, and it was always fun for us when we were in school because we would get a, get a break from studying, and we would get to watch a movie, but they would usually turn off all of the lights, and for us kids, having the lights off meant, meant bedtime, so I can remember, it was, even though it was exciting, it was always very hard to keep my eyes open and I would end up falling asleep before the end of the movie.\nEver since we got our first VCR and remote control my dad has been absolutely fascinated with it. He can't stop fiddling with the controls. He turns up the volume, he turns down the volume. He changes the channel. He stops. He pauses. He just can't stop playing with it. We feel he needs to go to a remote control addiction recovery center so he can, he can heal his problems that he has with the remote control and try to have better habbits with it.

You could set it up in your house or outside and try to program in directions so that it would follow a path, so you could try to make it go from the living room and take a left into the kitchen and stop just before it ran into your mom, and back up before she kicked it and yelled at you, or make it turn around in circles. I think it also had some sounds you could make, but it's very interesting to think back that, that kind of technology existed, you know, in the late 80's, early 1980's, too. Of course, everybody's favorite when I was a kid anyway, even today, are video games, not only home video games but the arcade style games. I was a, I was a good kid but I can remember of the few times that I got in trouble with my dad was because I ended up at a arcade, and I was playing video games for so long and I didn't call home and ended up coming home very late and that was very upsetting to my parents and they were worried about me. Also, it seemed like the kids in school that were most popular were the kids who had video games at their houses. I didn't have a video game at my house so I always had to find friends and go over to their house to play.",

A fool in English is someone who is not smart. We have many words for this in English: dumb, a dummy, stupid, imbecile, idiot, but you're all nice people so you'll never need to use those words so you can forget that. But the people who continued to celebrate the New Year's on April 1st were called April fools. So a tradition started, that on April 1st people would try to make, would do pranks on other people.",

What's the first thing you do when you're getting ready to paint?\n                              Yuri: Basically I get up in the morning, and as soon as I'm ready, I go to my room, which is my painting room, my atelier, and I work. I do sketches or I work on a painting is on progress.\nShirley: Okay, and how do you get an idea for a painting?\nYuri: The idea can be from anything. It can be from my little doodle on a piece of paper, from movies, a lot. Or... very often I get ideas, actually from the country where I'm living at the moment.\nShirley: How do you progress from that idea to getting it on a piece of paper or a canvas?\nYuri: Well, if I have an idea, which I'm more or less sure what it is, of what it's going to be, I start a sketch on the canvas. And from then on... often the painting can change daily.\nShirley: So you sketch using, what, a pencil, or? \nYuri: I use some kind of pencil, charcoal, and from then on, I work on colors.\nShirley: So you sketch the painting and then you go straight into oil, or something?\nYuri: Yeah, usually in oil. Sometimes, I do the background with acrylic. It's quicker.\nShirley: Do you have to kind of prepare the colors before you start to put them on the canvas?\nYuri: Well, in my art, I prepare everything by myself. I prepare the canvas. I stretch it. Sometimes I even mix the color by myself.\nShirley: What does that mean, you prepare the canvas and stretch it?\nYuri: I have to get the canvas, sometimes can also be some old bedsheet, and I prepare it with some special material. I put on stretchers, they're made of woods. I use it some special tools, and then I start the work.\nShirley: So how long does it usually take to complete a painting from the initial idea to the framing at the end.\nYuri: It varies. Sometimes can take me a couple of days. Sometimes can take me up to a month.\nShirley: Why would there be that difference?\nYuri: Size. Also, what I'm intending to paint. Like sometimes I do some painting very, very fast. Energetic, which are usually the faster one. If I really work on details, then it can take very long time.\nShirley: Can you explain how you think up names for your paintings?\nYuri: Oh, that's interesting because, sometimes I have the title before the painting. I think of something, or sometimes can send me a word, or I read something on a book or magazine. And some that I got the idea for a painting. It's like a flash. And from there on, I work on a painting.\nShirley: And if you just work from an idea, how do you think of a name at the end?\nYuri: It's can be a big battle, because I can find 25 different names. And sometimes I ask my wife, friends, or sometimes I even change it.\nShirley: Oh that's really interesting. Thanks.\nYuri: You're welcome.",

I would suggest to try both.\nShirley: So are the costs the same? So, you know, for a beginner, who wanted to, you know, start with water color, or somebody who wants to learn oil painting with you, what's the difference in the cost of materials?\nYuri: Usually water color much cheaper. So if you want to buy a small set, you just need paper, and a small pen, a set, and a few brushes. So if you are thinking of the economical point of view, go with water colors.\nShirley: And how many little pots of paint would I need to buy to start my first water color?\nYuri: Very few, usually just buy little sets, with sometimes 12 colors, you're done.\nShirley: And for the oil painting, what kind of materials would I need to buy to start as a beginner in oil painting?\nYuri: The problem is that you also need canvases. You need also some material which can be costly, and the colors themselves, they are much more costly than water colors.\nShirley: And what about paint brushes, do I need different kinds of paint brushes, different sizes, or?\nYuri: Of course, yeah, but you want to always, when I start with beginners, I always try also thinking that they might not like it after, and I give them the cheapest set, the easiest set, just to try it out.\nShirley: How many paintbrushes would that consist of then, the most basic set?\nYuri: You can have just 3 to 5.\nShirley: Okay.

So Yuri, can you tell me something about the difference between water color painting and oil painting, the difficulties between the two, and where should a beginner start?\n                              Yuri: That's a good and complicated question. So, first of all, water color of course are made with, usually they are on paper, and made with a water colors. It is much weaker to make a painting because it dries very quickly. In few hours, usually.\nOil paintings are a little bit technically complicated, starting with, they have the disadvantage, they dry much slower, but the advantage is that actually you can correct many things and change it very easily, which is impossible with water colors.\nShirley: So with water colors you said it's easier to correct. Can you explain a bit more how easy it is to correct the oil painting?\nYuri: Well let's say that I'm making a portrait, okay? And I'm making an eye, and then I do a big mistake, I don't like it. I can either take a piece of cloth, rub the color completely off and start again. With water color, it's very much more complicated, because once the paint is in the paper, it's almost impossible to take it off.\nShirley: So how would you correct that mistake with a water color then?\nYuri: Well you try not to make mistakes first. You can maybe use a knife and take it off, but it's very dangerous.\nShirley: And what kind of knife, a kitchen knife?\nYuri: No, there are usually special knives.\nShirley: So if I go to the museum and I'm looking and trying to appreciate the art. How can I tell the difference between say an oil painting or a painting down with acrylic color.\nYuri: Okay well, first you check on what kind of material are done. Usually, let us say before, if a work is made on paper, it's most probably a water color. \nOkay? Acrylic, it depends. It almost like oil, but it is different kind of shiny quality.\nShirley: And can you correct mistakes if you're using acrylic?\nYuri: Yeah. Very much it's like oil colors.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Mike, you were born in Croatia.\nMike: That's right.\nTodd: Now you told me an interesting story about the necktie. Can you explain where the necktie came from?\nMike: Well, my understanding is that the necktie originated from Croatia. Originally, several hundred years ago, when the Croatians went into battle they would have a scarf or a handkerchief that protected their necks when they went into battle, and when they fought, and what they started doing was wearing this scarf or this handkerchief around their neck almost as an accessory and they wore this in the 17th, I believe it was 18th century maybe, or 17th century. They went to visit Louis the 14th in France on some sort of official visit, a delegation of Croatians, that rhymes, and they wore their handkerchiefs, and apparently Louis the 14th was so impressed and thought is was such a cool looking accessory that he adopted it as a fashion item for the French and it became the necktie, and the French word for necktie comes from the French word for Croatian, which is \"cravate\", so the cravate origin is from the Croatian. That's the story as far as I know it.\nTodd: Wow, so today people wear neckties because of Croatia?\nMike: Because of Croatians and that doesn't make me feel any better because I hate wearing a necktie, but I guess I can't change history.",

I had kind of an extensive list for people I would send cards to but in October my hard drive crashed and I lost my Christmas card list, so I had a hard time trying to figure out how to get cards to everybody this year, so what I’ve been doing is when I receive a card I’m cutting out everyone’s return address and actually taping it to the back of their card so that way I’ll have an ability to rebuild that list at some point.\nAdrienne: Wow, that sounds like a big project.\nMary: You know it’s really so bad cause I enjoy taking a look at the cards anyhow so it’s something do while I’m looking at the cards.\nAdrienne: So when do you usually send your Christmas cards out? \nMary: Well, I try to send them out in the middle of December but this year they left my house on the 21st, so it was sort of way too close to the end.\nAdrienne: Right. Right. Um, what about next year? Will you try to get them out in the middle of December?\nMary: I’m definitely going to try cause now that I have everyone’s address I’ll be able to rebuild that list hopefully before December. \nAdrienne: Well, sounds like a good plan.

It's a little quirky habit of mine but I always like to have backup whenever I need it so I've got into the habit of stockpiling batteries and keeping them in the fridge.\nAdrienne: Well, it's very practical but why do you keep them in the frigerator?\nMary: I read somewhere a long time ago that that's how you extend the life of batteries by keeping them cool, that and film too so I also have several canisters of film in there, too, no room for the butter but.\nAdrienne: Do you have any food in your frigerator?\nMary: Some but it's mostly batteries and film.\nAdrienne: What kind of food do you keep in your frigerator?\nMary: Right now because it's winter time, I have some oranges and actually some grapes and things so those are kind of coveted at this time of year, otherwise just the standard things. I have yogurt, milk, and some bread and I think six brusselsprouts.\nAdrienne: Just six.\nMary: Just six.\nAdrienne: Why do you have brusselsprouts?\nMary: Just got in the habit of eating them. They're really very good, so I thought well I'll keep on, just handfuls so they don't spoil.\nAdrienne: How so you prepare your brusselsprouts?\nMary: Um, I steam them for about 10 minutes or so and eat them just perfectly plain, a little salt and a little pepper, that's about it.\nAdrienne: Really, I find them a little bitter.\nMary: I find them a little bitter too, but the longer you steam them the bitterness kind of goes away and of course there's ways you can dissipate the bitterness with a little bit of butter or salt or seasonings too, so they're not so bad.\nAdrienne: Well, I'll have to try that.",

That is something, a project that Dave and I worked on over a couple of weekends. We really enjoy doing woodworking and he actually has a very elaborate woodshop at his house and it's something I really enjoy working on too, so we thought of a project, which was the table and kind of designed what it would look like and bought some lumber and used his tools to figure out exactly how to put it all together and the process was a lot of fun, um, making the plan and actually using four or five different kinds of tools to assemble it and get it all put together. I have to say that I wasn't quite sure what it was going to end up looking like cause in the rough form it wasn't impressing me too much but once everything was sanded and stained and done it really impressed me so it's a lot of fun to do.\nAdrienne: So you made the table from scratch?\nMary: Yep, Yep we did. Just bought some lumber, certain sizes of lumber and ended up cutting it to the different kind of things we needed so it was like making a pattern and then using all these raw materials to put together to create the final product.\nAdrienne: Wow, that's really impressive cause it's a nice table. \nMary: I really like it. It was a lot of fun to do.\nAdrienne: Um, any other projects you've done that you have in the house?\nMary: Um, well, not quite like the table, but just some general finishing things, for instance if something is broken, like I'm not sure if you noticed, but my front door has no doorknob at the moment so I do have a doorknob and I will be fixing that at some point, so\nAdrienne: That falls, I'm sorry, does that fall into the category of woodworking?\nMary: It can cause it's gonna involve some tools.\nAdrienne: I see.

It’s a great place but it’s really cold this time of year.\nMary: It is, but if you’ve lived here a long time you get used to it. A lot of people from the South get really chilly when the temperature gets around 50 and right now that’s, that’s actually sounding pretty good because a Minnesotan will probably just be wearing a lightweight jacket when it is about 50 degrees, but we’re OK with that. You know it gets to be kind of fun when you have a big snow fall and you go outside with all your neighbors, pushing cars out of the snow drift and kind of enjoying it that way so we have a lot of fun with it being cold and snowy and you have to make some fun on the inside of your house too, you know. A lot of people have fireplaces, so there’s a way to enjoy being inside for long stretches of time and opposed to just kind of, I guess, being locked in and not being able to enjoy house or that kind of thing.\nAdrienne: What do you do to warm up in the winter?\nMary: Well, there’s always sweaters. You know we like our sweaters here, that keeps us warm. Actually, you can get pretty warm outside. A lot of people enjoy cross-country skiing which I do from time-to-time and the more you exercise outside, you can actually get pretty warm doing it even though the temperature is cold, but as far as being indoors, that’s when, I think that’s when people start really kind of researching their hobbies, things they like to do, that’s activity that will keep you busy while you are inside the house for such long stretches and things.\nAdrienne: Yeah, that’s true. I like to drink hot chocolate when I get cold. Do you like hot chocolate?\nMary: Yeah, that will always help, and tea, really enjoying my tea as well, but there’s nothing like, you know, hot chocolate and maybe roasting something in the fireplace and making smores.\nAdrienne: That sounds great.\nMary: Yeah, that would be kind of fun.\nAdrienne: Very cozy.",

        "transcript": "Adrienne: So, Mary, who are these guys here?\nMary: This one's Piper. She's seven. She just had a birthday in October, and this one's Daisy, she's got kind of an older face on her. I think she's probably about nine years old.\nAdrienne: Are these your children?\nMary: You know, they could be my children, but they’re actually dogs. Golden Retrievers.\nAdrienne: They're so pretty.\nMary: Yeah, they're a lot of my attention. They really have my heart captured right now, so I do spend a lot of time, you know, working on them and training them and taking them out for walks during the day and as you can tell by the big giant basket behind you they have a lot of toys so they're kind of active. They like swinging stuff around and playing outside. (Pipe. Hi, there!).\nAdrienne: So how did you get them?\n                                I actually raised a Golden Retriever puppy for about 8 years. When I lost her, I remember thinking to myself, I'd love to have another golden retriever but puppies are really hard work, and wouldn't it be great if I could just find a dog that was already an adult, and I made mention to it to someone at work one day and she let me know of an organization, a rescue organization that worked primarily with Golden Retrievers, so I contacted the organization and they had several dogs available for adoption and I went and met a few, and kind of figured out their personalities and decided that there was one there for me, and that was Tucker, my big, big male who I had for a long time, so I ended up adopting him when he was a year and a half. He still had a lot of puppy in him, but he was already housebroken, and you know, in pretty good shape for bringing home so he was a lot of fun. That was my first experience with the organization, and they are a great organization. I really believe in a lot of the work they do, because a couple of the dogs, Piper in particular, happen to have been an abused animal unfortunately in the first part of her life so this organization spent a lot of time kind of evaluating the right kind of environment for an animal, and the right kind of animal for a family so the adoption process, as they call it, it's really involved, It's almost like adopting a child because they want to make sure that you're home is, you know properly set up for a dog this size and that your yard is fenced and that you can handle a dog like this and have what it takes to train him and get him to trust humans again so it's been a really long process in some cases. When I adopted daisy, almost two years ago, that was not so hard. She was a very easy dog to adopt. She just came in, made herself at home, got along great with Piper right away and, you know, she has never given me any concern or any reason to worry about her temperament. She's been just such an easy going dog.\nAdrienne: Yeah, she seems like a sweetheart. Both of them are.\nMary: Yeah, they're fun. They're fun.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Miki, you went to UC Berkeley, a very famous university in the U.S. What is your university like? Why is it famous? \nMiki: Why is it famous? Well, I suppose historically it's kind of famous, recent history, because it was a center for the freedom of speech movement in the 1960's and the civil rights movement, and it's pretty much where multi-culturalism, feminist studies and those sorts of so called liberal political movements were born and they're still quite strong today on campus and so students kind of get drawn to that, the political aspect of it I suppose, also the, it's a research university and it attracts nobel laureates, very famous professors, at the top of their field, it's also quite a beautiful campus, I love the campus, it's not, it's not, how do you say? \nTodd: It's not like maybe a college town, or?\nMiki: Ah, no, it's not really a college town, of course, because it's right smack in the middle of a metropolitan area which is the Bay Area, and just right across the bay from San Francisco. The natural scenery is quite beautiful. There's the ocean to the west. There are mountains to the east and just beautiful gorgeous sunsets going down into the Golden Gate. The natural scenery is just beautiful, and the architecture of the campus is quite beautiful too, and apparently during the war, World War II, a number of tests were done on campus in terms of integrating floral species with each other, and so you have firs next to cedar which is a strange combination. The idea was would they kill each other. \nTodd: Oh, Wow! That's awful! \nMiki: Yeah, no, so there's some scientific engineering going on on campus. \nTodd: But the trees survived? \nMiki: Yes, as a matter of fact.\nTodd: Well, that's good. You can't fool nature.\nMiki: No. no, but it is a beautiful campus, and I went there for four years as an undergrad. I lived in the dormitory for the first year and I lived in the co-ops from the second through the fourth year and the co-ops are kind of a housing community that's owned by students, it's run by students and is there for quite cheap so it attracts poor students who work, while they go to school at the same time, and that's who I was. I worked at a restaurant, I worked at a sandwich shop, I worked at a toy store, I worked as a secretary to put myself through school and lived quite cheaply in these co-ops which incidentally also had marvelous parties and almost every weekend there was some party somewhere that one of these co-ops was putting on, and it was really wonderful.\nTodd: Wow! Sounds like a good time.\nMiki: Yeah!",

        "transcript": "Todd: Miki, when you were in college where did you live?\n\nMiki: My first year I lived in the dormitory that was quite close to the campus. It was about a five minute walks so it was very convenient but I'm not sure that that many people actually enjoyed living in the dormitory because there were so many of us packed into such a small space that one did not get a sense of privacy at all. I shared a room with two other girls and 24 hours a day there was always someone near you, next door, down the hall if not in your own room, and a very small space. In Japan perhaps this wouldn't have been such a large problem because the sense of personal space and privacy perhaps isn't as strong growing up, but really in the United States if you grow up with you own room, it you grow up with your own sense of self and if, you know, you have personal space that you define just instinctively which, you know, maybe three feet in front of you, a meter, or if you have your own personal room itself, it's very difficult to move from that sort of sense of individuality and personal private space, to move into the dorms, and to have to share, all of that, and then always have a smile on your face, if you don't want to be considered a bitch.\n\nTodd: Yeah, so what about food? What did you eat for food? Did you have a kitchen? Did you cook?\n\nMiki: In the dormitories, no! We had a dining hall. I don't quite remember what it was called, but it was a common area where everyone went downstairs at the same time. It was only open, three hours in the morning, 3 hours in the evening, and we all shared our time together, kind of like a family, I suppose, and we must have eaten just normal American food. I don't remember.\n                                Todd: Yeah! Yeah! How about your laundry? How would you wash your clothes?\n\nMiki: That I forget! I think we had laundry machines every other floor in the dorm building. But I actually don't remember. Sorry!\n\nTodd: And what would students do for fun? for socializing?\n\nMiki: Oh, I think the bigger question is whether students did anything besides socialize, you know, right, I mean, if you're a freshman the chances of you actually doing work are actually quite small, especially in that sort of a social setting where,\n\nTodd: Even at Beckley?\n\nMiki: Oh, are you kidding me? Yes! Berkley is highly competitive but it's also highly, it's a highly social atmosphere, especially in the dorms, well, and then once you move into a communal area, if you're there with your friend, then I don't think a whole lot of studying goes on.\n\nTodd: Wow! That's funny! Oh, thanks!\n\nMiki: Surely!",

Now you are of Japanese ancestry.\n\nMiki: My mother is. My father is from Kansas. \nTodd: Oh, really. \nMiki: His family is from the South, Kansas, Arkansas, Texas. My mother is from Japan. She grew up in Nagasaki and moved to Yokohama when she was young so most of my family is there, Yokohama and the South.\n\nTodd: Oh, wow! What a combo.\n\nMiki: Yeah, I guess so.\n\nTodd: Now were you already fluent in Japanese before you started university?\n\nMiki: I was but it wasn't a standard Japanese. It was very familial. It was Japanese that was spoken within the family, between parent and child, and so it was very casual, and conversational.\n\nTodd: OK. Is it difficult for you to comprehend people sometimes in Japan or is it just like home?\n\nMiki: Oh, it's absolutely difficult because there, well first of all, they're dialects and then of course there are different levels of politeness and conversationalist, I guess, and especially once I get into a classroom with other professors, and other students, colleagues my age, it's quite difficult to follow the language, but if it's street talk it's much easier. \n\nTodd: Oh, really! OK, so at university, did you study just to learn Japanese as a language or did you study literature?\n\nMiki: I'll be honest. I studied to get an easy degree, and frankly it was quite easy, but then I had a very good professor in classical Japanese and that's when my interest in literature and history actually was born and I ended up becoming a researcher in medieval history, medieval literature.\n\nTodd: Wow, that must be really difficult though cause that's old, old style of language, it's an\n                                old text. (Yes) Like Shakespeare is difficult for me.\n\nMiki: That's actual, well, that's actually an interesting comparison cause Shakespeare is actually just a little bit easier for us modern Americans to comprehend than classical Japanese is for a modern Japanese person to comprehend because the language, actually, Shakespearean English is actually much closer to modern English than classical Japanese is to modern Japanese, but\n                                it's not spoken, so if one has a dictionary, then one can do research.\n\nTodd: Alright!

This is what I want to say, and people, the relationship in Osaka between each, between, you know people, are so close, very very closer than Tokyo one and people are so friendly, you know, for example when buy something at the shop, where ever it is, someone's gonna talk to you. \"Hey, where are you from?

It's like New York City and, you know, there are too many people to deal with, to, you know, so in Osaka it's a big city but it's always, it's also, at the same times like a huge village. \nTodd: Mm, that's a good point. A huge village!\nKawabe: And in Tokyo, nobody speaks with a dialect but in Osaka everybody speaks the same language, I mean that Osaka dialect. That is why I think they are feeling the same kind of\ntie.

You know, everybody likes it, so the most of the famous comedian in Japan, on every kind of, any kind of TV show are from Osaka. In Japan, most of the famous comedians are always from Osaka. Yeah, so, it's a big difference. The, OK, simply, character in Tokyo is cold, the people are cool, you know, stay cool. You don't show your emotion very much. You've got to be very, very, like, decent, square, and you've got to act cool. This is what you have to be in Tokyo, but in Osaka, you just, you know, anything goes. You can do whatever you want to do. You can be whoever you want to be and then, you know, people are wild and free and cheerful, lovely and it looks like they are enjoying the life, like an Italian, like Italian, yes! I think this is a good example. It's like Moscow and Venezia, or Moscow and Napoli or, you know, North Korea, Pyongyang and Rome. It's like this.\nTodd: Yeah! Wow! \nKawabe: People are so different.\nTodd: Interesting. Interesting observation.",

I've actually been at school in England for quite a while of it. Living away from your own country is great. I guess it's really good when you're young you get to see different countries. I stopped off in Africa and Nigeria. I was actually born in England, but I went there fifteen days after I was born so, my first plane flight was 15 days old, and I can't really remember obviously that much of that but then we went to Holland for nine years, which is great and it's, you know, I'm very lucky to have grown up in a different culture, although very embarassingly I can's speak the language cause I always went to an Enlgish school, but it's kind of difficult cause you, wherever you go, you make friends. You get close to people and then suddenly you have to move, and move house, go on to somewhere else, and I found this to be the sort of hardest thing, when I was 8, I went off to boarding school in England cause my parents thought I'd get a better education that way than moving around to different schools all over the world, and this was you know, it was good it was fun, but something like I always envied was the way, all the other kids at school, there school friends were just their friends in term time, but their real friends were friends that, you know, they had known since they were little, since you know, since they had been born or, you know their early school friends and they still knew them and you know even when I was 18 years old, still, my friend's from school had their real friends at home who they'd known all there lives, and I've kind of always envied that because we've always been moving around and as I say, you know, I'm very lucky, we've been in Holland, Scotland, and Africa, and I've very lucky to have seen all of these places but it's kind of hard as well, not having a root, not having a place where you can actually call your home, somewhere to go back to at the end of the day and have all of your family and friends around you.",

        "transcript": "Eli\nI have a few main ambitions at the moment. I think the first and foremost ones, seeing as I'm in Japan at the moment studying Japanese, would to be actually to be able to speak the language, but I think that's pretty far-fetched ambition at the moment at the rate I'm going. I think to actually learn this language properly you'd have to live here and be studying at least a year to get to know the language and then another year to get fluent, get the speed up, get the slang in, so I mean I think that's one of my life ambitions is to learn Japanese. I can't speak any other languages so just to be able to speak another language would be amazing. I think English, English speaking people have, well, a sort of bad arrogance that everyone else speaks English and so why bother to learn another language. It's not like people in other European countries where, like from a very young age they learn English. They can speak English, maybe French, Spanish, and Italian. Once you got one language under your belt it seems to be a lot easier to pick up other languages. So that's one of the things I'd like to do. My other main wish at the moment, which I hopefully I'm going to turn into a reality when I return home is to actually get a job in the animation industry. I did my degree in that and it's been something that I've, you know, I've been waiting to actually get to the job stage, the job stage for so long now. Before I came to Japan, I was working, but in a graphic design job which is not what I'm actually wanting to do, so I think my, you know, number one wish at the moment, apart from the Japanese, is to actually be there in the industry I want to be working in, working the way I want to work, you know doing what I do for fun, as a job. That's my sort of number one ambition. I mean obviously making money is nice but I think at the moment the most important thing in a job is, you know money shouldn't be the first thing, you should really enjoy what you're doing. I've always said I'd never want to work in an office where you have to wear a suit, where you have to be constricted and constrained. You know I want to have my offices, sort of I mean, the environments I've, the work environments I've seen so far through friends and what I've worked in myself is pretty similar to how I think it should be: a group of more friends than colleagues working together on something they're passionate about. I think that has to be my main aim in life.",

        "transcript": "Eli\nI think food is such a great subject, such an interesting subject. I mean, food is something that everyone has to do. It's a life necessity, and actually because of that it can be a real hassle, like when you have to eat when you're hungry but you really can't be bothered to make anything. You can't go out and buy anything. You don't have the money to go out and buy anything is the worst thing, but when you're not in that situation food is great. Um, I'm just sort of thinking over all the different types of food I've eaten throughout my life and the sort of real spread, range of food, throughout different countries. I mean, I come from England where, I wouldn't say England really had a very specific scene of it's own. I think, you know, very nice English restaurant food is probably more like French restaurant food. The only sort of staple things that everyone knows comes from England are obviously Fish and Chips which actually, normal English people don't eat that much of. I probably eat Fish and Chips 3 times a year. Maybe if I lived a bit further north, I'd eat it once a week, but that is known as the sort of number one English dish. Although that's really junk food, and I think a good roast with gravy , Yorkshire pudding, baked potatoes. I see that as proper English food, but just thinking, now living in Japan, the difference between the food in England and the food in Japan, and then I've been brought up very much on like Chinese food as well. My mom always cooked lots of Chinese food, and in England of course, the number one favorite food is Indian curry, and all these different foods are so, so different from each other, just flavors, what you use, I mean, cooking here, is really depressing when it gets to about 7 o'clock in the evening here, cause I go down in the guest house I'm living in, and I walk into the kitchen area, and just the whole area smells amazing from where all the Japanese residents are cooking their normal Japanese meal, which are totally normal to them, but to a foreigner, they seem like these amazingly elaborate meals where I'm sure, like roast beef and Yorkshire pudding would seem the same to a Japanese person, but it's a pity really that sort of countries aren't more, sort of aware of sharing their food with each other. I mean when I get back to England, I'm gonna be in a whole load of trouble cause all the food I eat here, all the ingredients that I need, you can only get in Japan: they're specific Japanese vegetables, or in Asia at least, and I'm gonna have to get to very specific supermarkets to get even half the stuff I want and all the things like the nice vegetables I won't be even able to buy.",

Is there anything else that maybe is not so good about Jakarta?\n                              Lia: I would say the traffic jam is such a mess in Jakarta. There are so many cars, so many other public transportation but the road is still the same so it's kind of difficult. And also, the behavior of the drivers themselves is not that good. They don't follow the rules. They usually just pass the traffic light. So it's really bad, the traffic jams in Jakarta. So that's why a lot of people come from the sides, in the suburbs near Jakarta. If they work in Jakarta in the downtown so they have to wake up like 5:00 in the morning or 4:00 in the morning and go to the street and spend two to three hours to reach their work or school. So traffic jams really are such a waste of time. \nTodd: Wow, that's terrible!\nLia: Yes, it's very terrible. \nTodd: So is the government trying to do anything like build more roads or build public transportation? \nLia: They try to solve it by one type of bus what I call \"TransJakarta\", but still TransJakarta is also controversial because some people said because that bus has special routes so for example if you have three lanes for the cars then one lane is for that special bus, so the others have to go for the other two routes, so the street becomes narrower because of TransJakarta, but actually the government tries to solve that problem by that kind of means. \nTodd: Wow. So is there anything else that is a problem in your city? \nLia: I would say the infrastructure is actually not good... which the river and the drainage system basically is not that good. We just build and build all the new buildings without thinking about the infrastructure. And we have so many rubbish in the river that's why the water never flows I guess. Yeah so, we have a lot of rubbish, a lot of garbage in the river, the infrastructure is not good, that's why we have floods these days. We have annual floods these days, big floods in Jakarta every February. \nTodd: Oh, that's terrible. \nLia: Yes.\nTodd: Anyway, thanks a lot Lia. \nLia: Your welcome.",

Well, first I think it's probably America's most multicultural city. So it has a really large Asian population, and a really large Latino population. So when you go to the city it's really mixed. There's not one type of people that look like they're San Franciscans. So you get a nice variety of cultures and people, which is kind of nice.\nLia: What about... so you said that there are a lot of multicultural communities, so, they respect each other, how they're...\nTodd: Yeah, actually, yeah, San Francisco I think is a good example of everybody pretty much getting along. So there really isn't any, I would say, divisions between the cultures. I think there is in other cities, but San Francisco doesn't seem to have it. You know, I think it's just because everybody's so busy working, and because it's kind of an even balance that maybe that's one of the reasons why.\nLia: Anything else, any other good sides of your city?\nTodd: Well I think one is San Francisco has amazing architecture. We have some of the best architecture probably in the U.S. We have many landmark buildings, Coit Tower, Transamerica Tower, Golden Gate Bridge. So, that's one thing.\nAnd besides the architecture I would say, just the nature. So... San Francisco is quite near nature, and there's lots of places that you can get to within 30, 40 minutes of the city center. For example you can get to Muir Woods in about 30 minutes. It's this beautiful, beautiful forest, and it's just amazing, like when you go in the forest, it is just nature at its most perfect form, and that's only 30, 40 minutes from the city, so it's really nice.\nLia: Wow, seems really beautiful. I would love to go there.\nTodd: Oh you should go. For anybody going to America, I definitely recommend San Francisco.\nLia: Well, any other good things? What about the food?\nTodd: The food is really good. Like other cities, like New York, because we have so many cultures, you can get pretty much any type of food in the world. Even like all different types of African food, and South American food, Asian food of course, European food, so yeah. But it's a little expensive because the city is, like I said, it's expensive.\nLia: Okay.\nTodd: If you get a chance, you should go.\nLia: Yeah, I would love to. Okay, thank you very much.",

What subjects did you chose?\nCat: When I did A-levels, which is the exam from 16 to 18. I studied psychology, English literature and business studies.\nTodd: Wow. Of those subjects, what was your favorite?\nCat: Probably psychology. \nTodd: Psychology?\nCat: Mm.. \nTodd: OK. Do you still study psychology? \nCat: No, I did at university but since I left university I haven't really studied anything.\nTodd: OK. What was your best memory about high school? \nCat: My best memory, leaving.\nTodd: Yeah. OK. What was your worst memory? \nCat: The exams. At my A-levels I took about 24 hours of exams.\nTodd: Wow.\nCat: In a space of a couple of weeks. It was a nightmare. \nTodd: Yeah. That sounds like it. Wow, that's terrible. OK. Thanks. \nCat: No problem.",

There are different challenges, I mean any marriage has got challenges, and just having different cultures and different backgrounds and different languages, despite the fact that we both speak both our first languages. Yeah, it has different challenges but that makes it fun.\nTodd: You said that your wife speaks to you in Japanese and you speak to her in English?\nMark: No it’s fifty-fifty really. It really depends on what we’re talking about: if we’re watching an English movie or something on TV in English we’ll speak in English; if we’re reading the Japanese newspaper and we find something interesting we will probably speak in Japanese.\nTodd: Ok, well, actually, how did you meet?\nMark: Through my room mate in Japan, how many years ago now, probably about 15 years ago…\nTodd: A while back\nMark: …introduced us. Yeah, it’s been a long time.\nTodd: That’s cool. Is there anything that’s hard about having an international marriage?\nMark: I suppose it means that you’re always away from one person’s family. I suppose that’s the hardest thing. I’m in Japan now so I’m a long way from my family; when we lived in New Zealand before, my wife was a long way from her family.\nTodd: That’s tough, that is tough. So how long did you live together in New Zealand?\nMark: We were there for about 4 years,…I think. Yeah, yeah, approximately 4 years in New Zealand.\nTodd: Now, have you lived in any other countries together?\nMark: No, no, not together, it’s either been Japan or New Zealand.\n\nTodd: Do you have any plans as to which country you’re going to settle in?\nMark: Now that sounds very permament to me!\nTodd: So you never know?\nMark: Never know.\nTodd: Alright, thanks a lot, Mark.",

I felt that it was probably better to work just one long block of time than rather have a part time job 2 or 3 nights a week. So I kept that up for 2, 2and a half years until my final year of university. Then I decided that study on Friday was more important than the part time job, but for 2 and a half years I really enjoyed it.\nTodd: So for this job what exactly did you do? What were your duties?\nMark: We used to take the TV guides from the printing presses and bundle them up and get them ready for distribution to the various convenience stores and gas stands and bookstores throughout the whole country and then make sure that each or the shops and regions got the right number of guides.\nTodd: So a job like that would be manual labour, versus say a customer service job where you are always talking with people. Which type of job do you think is more enjoyable for a young person?\nMark: Because of the hours we worked, it was all overnight, there was a combination of other university students and also quite a few housewives who were doing it for extra income, so we actually had quite a good team. There were probably 10 to15 of us. We used to enjoy a good laugh while we were doing it as well.\nTodd: Sounds fun!\nMark: It was tiring, especially lectures on Friday mornings but we used to stay awake. I don’t think I ever slept in the lecture afterwards.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Mark, when I was in London I saw so many people from New Zealand and actually everywhere in the world I meet so many people from New Zealand, but you have such a small population. Is anybody still in New Zealand?\nMark: Yeah, I think the Kiwis and Aussies that you see in London and in other parts of England and Europe, many of them are young Kiwis doing what we call ‘the big OE’.\nTodd: The big OE? What’s that?\nMark: ‘The big overseas experience’ or ‘the big overseas excursion’. So, a lot of people, when they finish school or finish university, they take a year off and because New Zealand is located a long way from anywhere, instead of taking a trip from one country to another for a week, like many Europeans do, when young New Zealanders travel they tend to go backpacking a lot, get a part time job working in a pub or a restaurant in London to make more money and then they will travel for 3 or 4 months through Europe. They may go back to England and work a bit more and then see a few more countries, and then maybe after a year or so they’ll start heading back towards home. That’s ‘the big OE’. \nTodd: So did you do ‘the big OE’?\nMark: Sort of, yeah. After I’d finished work at…after I’d finished university I worked for a few months and yes, I did go to England. I’d applied for a job and then hadn’t heard back so I started my OE and I did it for a few months and then I actually found out I’d got a job, so I cut the OE short to join the working world.\nTodd: Ok, what countries besides London are popular for Kiwis to go and visit?\nMark: Um, now…\nTodd: Or what cities or places?\nMark: Now I think they’re getting more adventurous. Before it used to be very euro-centric, but now a lot more people are going through Asia and going to more exotic locations: maybe South America, some people travel to Africa. The old ties to England are still there; I think that’s still the first location for many people: save a bit of money and then see the rest of the world.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Mark, what do Kiwis like to do in the summer?\nMark: Yeah, I think the first thing for some people to realise is that Christmas is midsummer in New Zealand.\nTodd: Oh nice!\nMark: So Kiwis combine Christmas holiday and New Year holiday with a summer vacation as well. I can remember when I was small, we’d have family Christmases and then the next day, which is Boxing Day, we’d go to the beach or we’d travel somewhere and rent a small house on the beach. They call them ‘batches’ in the north of the island or ‘cribs’ in the south island. And you just spend 4, 5 days, maybe a week, 2 weeks, just swimming in the sea, playing in the sand dunes, walks in the forest: just a really relaxing time with family and family friends.\nTodd: That sounds nice, so you know in Australia they’re really big on surfing. Do a lot of people surf in New Zealand?\nMark: There is a surfing population. I think the Australian beaches are probably much larger and\n\t\t\t\t                    maybe they have better waves, I don’t know, but several of my friends used to go on surfing holidays in summer as well. \nTodd: And what foods do people like to eat when they get together for the summer?\nMark: Barbecue is almost the national obsession in summertime, you know, you’d just throw a sausage on the barbie or friends would ring up and say ‘hey, it’s a nice night, let’s have a barbie!’. I think all my friends have their own barbecue set.\nTodd: What meats do people barbecue?\nMark: Again, New Zealand foods used to very much sort of be the lamb or beef, but now it’s getting a lot more varied, you can grill a nice fish on the barbecue, you can still have sausage, chicken, pork, beef, lamb, whatever you want.\nTodd: Yeah, it sounds good. OK, well thanks, Mark.\nMark: OK.",

(OK) Each of the sales reps have a given territory so I cover the Western Japan region for Longman.\nAndy: That's a pretty big region. \nSteve: It is indeed. It is. It is Andy, yeah. \nAndy: Do you get a lot of travelling for that?\nSteve: We do indeed, yeah. Basically, my main job is to go around to the universities, to some extent the high schools and the private language schools and to see what their needs are, see what kind of books they are using. We are also increasing, we're promoting CD-ROMS and e-learning as well as the tradional textbooks.\nAndy: Very nice. Very nice. What kind of schools are buying your books?\nSteve: Well, again the university is a huge part of it because in Japan the first year students and to some extent the second year students have compulsory English education. There's a lot of teachers who have big classes, large enough classes that it makes it very much worth our while to visit those universities and make sure that those teachers are using as many of our books as possible. \nAndy: You mentioned e-learning, like CALL, computer based (Yes, indeed, yeah) English. Is that growing?\nSteve: It is. It is. I mean, it's growing quite slowly because it takes a lot of time for the decision making process, to say for example, a Japanese university to kick in and to invest in our CD_ROM's.\nAndy: Yeah, sure, plus first they need to have a computer room.\nSteve: They do indeed, yeah, yeah. \nAndy: That's a big investment. \nSteve: But they already made a huge investment in the hardware, and it's actually not a huge leap of faith to persuade them to invest a little bit in the software as well, and the people we have using our software, they're really getting a lot of enjoyment out of it, they're enjoying interacting, not only with the teachers but with the computers as well, and getting immediate feedback with what we're doing. \nAndy: Um, so you have stuff for windows and the mac, or are they platform based?\nSteve: That's a little bit of a problem actually, Andy. Most of our software is only supporting the windows platform, but a few things because we noticed that a lot of the university teachers in Japan prefer the Mac platform, we are moving somewhat slowly in that area but we are producing more software to support the Mac platform. \nAndy: Ah very nice.",

I think football's good. I think football's good. It's a good sport, but I'm sorry, it's just not as good as baseball.\nSteve: Really, I'm quite surprised to hear you say that because you did mention, I believe the question was \"the best sport in the world\" (Yes) whereas baseball isn't as nearly as widely appreciated worldwide as football is. \nTodd: Ah, that's true. That's true. I will give you that, but a lot of countries do play baseball, it's popular in Asia (they do indeed, yeah) and Central America, and in North America, and it's a young sport. You just got to give it time. We need more time to come around. \nSteve: Yeah, I don't have anything in particular against kids playing baseball. I think getting kids out playing any sport is very healthy and it very good thing to happen, but I got to say, I mean for young kids, particularly in developing countries where they perhaps need a lot more equipment to play baseball, I think soccer is much more accessible than baseball. They only need a ball, a field, a street even before they can get started. \nTodd: Well, that's kind of true, but I mean in baseball you just need a stick and a rock.\nSteve: Yeah you could do like that, yeah.\nTodd: But I mean, one thing that I think how baseball is better than football is that in baseball it's more democratic in that everybody has to bat. You can't have a prima donna star. I mean you can have stars, but everyone's gotta swing the bat, and you know, in soccer if you're a fullback, if I'm using that correctly, you play back by the goal, you know, you're kind of just lagging back there. You're not gonna score or anything. \nSteve: Yeah, that's very, very true and I think you're very right in saying that baseball is indeed a democratic sport, but I think soccer gives each individual player to play to his own strengths, his own physical capabilities, for example you have people who are naturally strong presence who are more suited to, well, playing defense, whereas your speedier players, and your slightly more cunning players lends itself to being a striker, so it really allows people to specialize and the crowd really get behind that. The crowd really appreciate a good strong defender and a nifty striker who gets in there and poaches a lot of goals for his team.\nTodd: Well, that's true. Those are some good points, but in baseball you have to utilize more skills. I mean, you have to be skilled at catching the ball (Yes), throwing the ball (Yes), hitting the ball (Yeah), running the bases (yeah), you know, football you just got to run and kick (Yeah).\nSteve: But I mean, to be honest with you, baseball, that's not really doing anything that cricket never did, for example. All those skills were employed in a sport that was invented way, way much longer ago than baseball ever was.\nTodd: That is true. You got me on that one, so anyway. well, I like football, but I just, I have to stick with baseball. \nSteve: That's fine. I think we can agree to disagree.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Steven, where did you go to college?\nSteve: I went to the University of Wales, um, the College of Cardiff there, so it the United Kingdom, obviously we have England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland and so I spent three years over in Wales. \nTodd: Wow. Sounds fun. So what's university like in Wales? Is it different than University life in Britain?\nSteve: Yeah, it is. Um, for example Wales has it's own distinguished, distinctive language and culture as well, so if you go to Wales you'll see street signs written not only in English, but above that you'll have the Welsh language there and Welsh people are very, very proud of their language, and their heritage and there culture and it made it just a slightly different experience from studying over the border in England.\nTodd: So they speak Welsh? Is that the language?\nSteve: That's correct. Yeah. Yeah, they do. It's not spoken by everybody in Wales. Since the middle ages, the usage of the language has declined somewhat but there has been a revival over the last 30 or 40 years, and now about, maybe about 40% of the Welsh population speak it as either as their first of second language.\nTodd: Did you learn it while you there?\nSteve: No, no, I didn't, no. Everybody speaks English there. but there is a lot of good music coming out in Welsh now. There's lots of cultural festivals and when I was at Cardiff, there's lots of pubs where it's Welsh speaking only and it was quite good fun to go in there and try to order a beer and stuff in the Welch language, but that was about as far as I got. \nTodd: Could you say that there's any, it's a stereo type, that's there's any difference between the Welsh people and the British people?\nSteve: There is yeah, because they've had a different history and obviously that affects how people have evolved over many centuries. They like different sports for example. They're more into rugby than they are into football. They tend to look slightly different than they do to English people. They tend to have sort of redder hair and darker eyes than English people, but also they're very, very loyal, they're very, very fierce, they're very passionate people. They're very nice people.\nTodd: Well, it sounds like a nice place to go. I'd love to go someday.\nSteve: Yeah it was nice!",

It's attached to London, just next to London. \nTodd: Oh, OK, but you said it's a small town.\nSteven: It's quite small, well, relatively small. The populations about 50,000. \nTodd: OK, well what kind of place is your town where you grew up? \nSteven: Um, it's actually a very nice town. People often move into Brentwood from the surrounding towns, or from the east end of London. Um, it's quite prosperous. Well, you could, in some respects, it's a dormant town. People often travel out from Brentwood into London and they work in the city, but it's a pleasant place to live. It has lots of countryside around it. There's a very large country park. Ah, it's quite a small town but it's, at the high street it's quite small but it's quite a pleasant town to shop in.\nTodd: Oh, it sounds nice. Well, now if you live in a little town that's near London is it really expensive?\nSteven: Well, Brentwood is particularly expensive just because it's a desirable place to live and it's proximity to London also makes it, the housing is quite expensive, even a town next to it would have much cheaper housing. \nTodd: Oh, really, cause when I think of a small British village, you know, I think of really old houses, and nothing's changed, so do you have modern stuff, like do you have a health club and a movie theater and things like that?\nSteven: Uh, I think the cinema in Brentwood actually closed down, with the advent of out of town shopping centers they always have their multiplex cinemas with six or eight screens and the cinema in Brentwood only had two screens and it couldn't really compete for everyone has cars these days so they can easily travel to big shopping centers, so that closed down however, yeah, it have a very nice health center and as I said lots of parks to play. There's lots of opportunity to exercise and do various forms of recreation.\nTodd: Wow, sounds like a nice place to live.",

I think I used to make the most of my free time, well in fact I didn't make the most of my free time. I was a very lazy person. I was an incredible time waster, so I would have all of this free time to make use of and I would probably just sit in front of the TV, or I'd probably go to a pub and drink, but anyway I took my time for granted. I thought I have this time. It wasn't such a precious thing for me. I had so much of it.\n\t\t\t\t                Once I became a father, suddenly my time disappeared but strangely enough, now that I've become a father and I've, it's taught me to appreciate the time I have. My time is now very limited. My work has become busier but I actually make much more use of my time now than when I did so much of it. It's kind of strange.\nTodd: And how many children do you have?\nSteven: Ah, two. BOys, \nTodd: Oh, two boys. \nSteven: Yep, they're both still very young. They keep us very busy. The eldest is four and the youngest is three.\n\nTodd: Wow!\nSteven: So they need, they still need quite a lot of attention.\nTodd: Yeah, so when you first have kids do you lose a lot of sleep? I'm always worried that I won't be able to sleep. \nSteven: Well, something that carried over from my previous lifestyle was an ability to sleep very well, and, um, fortunately I have a very understanding wife so if the children woke up, yeah, well because I had to work my wife was, my wife tended to be responsible. She would look after the children if they woke up during the evening, during the night, sorry, and I'm such a good sleeper that even if they were crying incredibly loudly I could just go back to sleep. I don't think there are many fathers like me. I've spoken to some other fathers and they don't have the same talent as I do. \nTodd: Oh, well, thanks Steven.",

If you want to, if you want, if you want to see the sites then well you'd want to, you'd obviously want to stay centrally, I'd have thought. Um, most of the famous landmarks are in the center. However, if you're going to spend some time living in London, and if you want to experience maybe a more, just an ordinary side of London, then you can live a bit further out. I actually lived in the south of London, just below Brixton, maybe you know Brixton. I lived in an area called Strettom, and the atmosphere there is very lively, also very lively. I enjoyed South London. In the past South London had a bad reputation. People didn't think South London was a very nice place to live, but over the last few years the quality of life in South London is improved, has improved a lot. More and more people are moving in to South London and, well, consequently, as a result the prices are going up and up and up, but it's actually a nice, a nice area to live in, in South London I think. \nTodd: Oh, sounds good. Thanks.",

I travelled with some friends, so you can buy one ticket. It's called an interrail ticket and you can visit any country in Europe using this one ticket. They last, well, the ticket I had lasted one month.\nTodd: That's a good deal. \nSteven: So, we went to France and we travelled to Italy and then we went down to some Greek islands. Also we went to Amsterdam in Holland.\nTodd: Wow! What did you do in France?\nSteven: In France we were on the South Coast, South of France. What did we do? Well, really we spent our time on the beach mainly playing water sports on the beach and just sunbathing and relaxing. (Cool) That kind of thing. Yep.\nTodd: Ah, did you make it to Sardegna?\nSteven: Sardegna...no\nTodd: Or Corsica? I'm sorry. \nSteven: No, no we didn't. Nope.\nTodd: Oh, really. \nSteven: Um, I think my favorite city was probably Florence in Italy.\nTodd: Oh, OK. \nSteven: We were lucky, We met some students, some British students who was studying Italian, and they had their own apartment on the hills, one of the hills in Florence, and they invited us to their apartment, so we stayed with them, and they had, they had built up some local knowledge. They knew about some local restaurants so they took us to a very traditional, whatchucallem, piatza, uh pizza restaurant, pizze, pizzu (Pizzeria!) Thank you. Yes. Um, and I think it was the best pizza I've ever had. It was wonderful. \nTodd: I'm hungry now too.\nSteven: And they even took us to a communist festival, which was in the mountain and we played five a side football, at a communist festival which was quite a unique experience.\nTodd: How bizarre. How bizarre.\nSteven: After some tequila. It was great. \nTodd: So, Florence was your favorite city. Was Italy you're favorite country?\nSteven: Ah, I think so. I love the Tuscany area. Yeah, it's absolutely beautiful. Hard to beat.\nTodd: Well, wish I could do it again.",

Well, I would just love to have some free time, occasionally I have some free time and well, I love to go hiking. Ah, I live in Japan in Kyuushuu and there are some beautiful mountains quite nearby to where I live so sometimes I go, I go hiking in the mountains.\nTodd: Well, actually, I love hiking and I am new to Kyuushuu (Right) I just moved here, so can you tell me where I should go hiking. What are the best spots?\nSteven: Right, well, there's one range of mountains in Kuju. One of the mountains is called Nakadake, which means central peak, I believe, and that is actually the highest, the highest peak, the highest mountain on mainland Kyuushuu. There is one higher mountain on an island near Kagoshima but on mainland Kyuushuu that's the highest peak and it's quite a challenge and there are some beautiful views from that mountain. \nTodd: Wow! Is it a day hike? Can I hike it in one day?\nSteven: Oh, sure. It takes about three hours to go up and the descent takes about two hours. \n\t\t\t\t                    It takes about two hours to come back down. \nTodd: Oh, that's great well, we live on Beppu and Beppu is on the coast. It's on the ocean, so how can \n\t\t\t\t                      I get to the mountain. Unfortunately, I don't have a car, so can I take the train or a bus?\nSteven: Um, I'm not absolutely sure. I've only ever been by car myself. Um, I don't believe there's a train that \n\t\t\t\t                        stops by the mountain but you can certainly get closer than you are now by train, and then you can perhaps \n\t\t\t\t                        take a bus or even a taxi from a town closer by. I don't know. I'm sorry. \nTodd: Oh, that's OK. Well, you know, I've never done it before, but I hear that it's safe \n\t\t\t\t                          to hitchhike in Japan. Is that true?\nSteven: Oh, absolutely. Yep. Yep. The crime rate in Japan is so low. You'd have to be incredibly \n\t\t\t\t                            unlucky to have any problems hitchhiking\nTodd: And will people stop and pick me up?\nSteven: Ah, that I don't know. \nTodd: Maybe I'll have to give it a try.

(Oh, right) So you're from Canada, what do you think?\nAkane: Well, I think it's a great idea. to have genetically modified foods.\nTodd: Why?\nAkane: Well, I think that especially for countries like China research shows that the people in China, the quality of their life is going to be of the level of the people in America within the next thirty years, and if this world is going to support that kind of population, we definitely need more resources in order to make food to support the population.\nTodd: Do you worry more that maybe there haven't been enough tests on genetically modified foods, that there might be side effects that could lead to cancer, or could maybe ruin the naturally life cycle of the plants?\nAkane: Uh, definitely, I think there is lots of reasons to be concerned and that's why the research has to be taken carefully and slowly and there has to be laws and procedures in place so that the research is controlled and that foods are tested before people can use them.\nTodd: So, you're saying that they should do research but it's OK to go ahead and try to use it now?\nAkane: Well, if there is reason to think that it is safe after many tests then, then I think we should start using it for the future.\nTodd: Mm, I mean, I can understand why people would want to use genetically modified foods because in terms of drought or insects eating the plants or feeding really impoverished areas like Africa and parts of Asia (Right) it's useful but we really don't know, I mean, aren't you a little bit worried that if you rush it you don't give enough time for the tests, you know, if it's really harmful to the environment or the people.\nAkane: For sure, so I don't think we should rush it, but at the same time I don't think we should completely stop the research, either because the fact is the population is growing and these people are going to have to eat food so if genetically modified foods can help people to eat and survive and for the human population to survive then we're going to have to continue with the research.\nTodd: That's a pretty solid argument. I pretty much agree with you on that.\n\nAkane: Thanks\n\nTodd: OK, thanks, Akane.",

(Yeah) Ooh, shopping.\nRuth: I really like shopping.\nTodd: That's true but you're on a budget. You're trying to save money.\nRuth: I know, but is was my brother's birthday. Well, it is my brother's birthday in a week so.\nTodd: Oh, no kidding.\nRuth: Yeah.\nTodd: So, what did you get your brother for his birthday?\nRuth: Well, it was quite difficult to find something that I thought he would like, but I got him some cakes in the end, some Japanese cakes.\nTodd: Japanese cakes?\nRuth: Yeah, they're in like a special presentation box.\nTodd: So, how are you going to get the cakes to your brother? Just through the post office?\nRuth: Yes, I sent them in the post this morning.\nTodd: Oh, did you send them express or just regular mail?\nRuth: No, regular mail because it was cheaper.\nTodd: But, don't you want it to hurry and get there for his birthday?\nRuth: I've got one week. I think it will get there in time.\nTodd: So, what do you think you're brother will think of the cakes?\nRuth: I don't think he'll like them actually.\nTodd: No?\nRuth: Well, he likes chocolate cake, and they look like they've got kind of chocolate inside but it's bean paste. I think he'll be disappointed.\nTodd: So what did you brother get you for your last birthday?\nRuth: That's a good question. He always gives me money, and he often gives me chocolate as well. He's very generous. \nTodd: Actually, I'm the same way. Guys like to give money. Money is so easy. No shopping involved.\nRuth: It's practical, though, it's good.\nTodd: Now, I've been told that when you give money for a gift, it's actually very impolite. \nRuth: Really?\nTodd: Is that true? Yeah!\nRuth: Why is that?\nTodd: I don't know. Some people say it's just really impersonal. That you should take the time to get a gift.\nRuth: Really! I really think if anybody gave me money I would be so pleased. It's a good present.\nTodd: Exactly, that's what I think. (Pause) Hey, um, actually, when are you going to see your brother next?\nRuth: Probably, I will see him in August of September.\nTodd: Oh, that's quite a ways away.\nRuth: Yes, about four months is that.\nTodd: So is this a younger brother or older brother?\nRuth: He's older. He's twenty-six. \nTodd: Oh, he's twenty six.\nRuth: He's going to be twenty-six soon.\nTodd: Ok, well, if you happen to e-mail him, tell him happy birthday. \nRuth: Oh, certainly will do. Thanks.",

Is that conservative or liberal?\nRuth: Oh, it's labor. \nTodd: Labor. So the Labor newspaper, the Guardian, what angle do they have? Like in the States you'd say it's either conservative, like the Wall street Journal, or it's liberal, like the New York Times.\nRuth: OK, it would be more like the New York Times. \nTodd: Oh, like the New York Times. \nRuth: Yeah. \nTodd: Actually, I don't even read papers anymore?\nRuth: What!\nTodd: I mean, I read them online, but I just prefer to get everything on the internet.\nRuth: So, you just read the newspaper on the internet?\nTodd: Pretty much. Yeah, I never pay for a paper paper anymore.\nRuth: What! Don't you think that is really anti-social, looking at a screen all day?\nTodd: Yeah, but how much more social is it looking at a paper?\nRuth: Well, I don't know. I guess it's not much more social, but I don't know, at least if you read a newspaper, you can read it outside in the fresh air, for example.\nTodd: Well, that's true. I guess so, but it's free, and I know how you're always saving money.\nRuth: Well, that's true but, I think the Guardian is a good newspaper so I like to support them. \nTodd: I have to admit I do like to go out on Sunday and get a paper and a coffee. Yeah, it's nice. \nRuth: Yeah, even like just walking to the shop to get the newspaper is quite nice.\n\nTodd: Yeah, the thing is though, I don't like how the print media, or newspapers that you buy, have such limited space, and on the internet you can get such a wider range of information that it's just a lot better I think, cause these days I don't know if you can really trust what they put in the newspapers.\nRuth: Yeah, I'm not sure that you always can, but I think TV is the same and I think the internet is exactly the same.\nTodd: Yeah, that's actually why I like radio news, cause I think radio news is a lot more in depth. You can actually hear the person talking, and unlike TV that has very short clips, radio news usually has longer segments, so I am a big fan of that. \nRuth: Yeah, I like the radio, but you can't see the pictures and I don't have a very good imagination, so I like to see the pictures.\nTodd: Ah, I just love the voice. I love when they go, \"And now to our correspondent in blah-blah-blah.\" It just sounds cool. \nRuth: No, you're right, it does sound good. And it's free as well. \nTodd: Well, I have the internet in my apartment so anytime you want to read the internet news just come on over.\nRuth: Oh, thanks very much. Also, I have a newspaper in my apartment and I get a subscription so, come along and read the newspaper at my flat. \nTodd: Oh, cool, I'll definitely take you up on that. \nRuth: OK",

Come on it's Star Wars. \nAkane: Well, I watched Episode II before and I really didn't like it. \nTodd: Really!\nAkane: Yeah!\nTodd: Oh, I thought it was great. I mean I know the critics were really rough, but it had great action, cool characters.\nAkane: Well, actually, I thought it was very commercial. \nTodd: Oh, really! \nAkane: Yeah, and the whole thing was really mushy, and there were also some annoying characters.\nTodd: Yeah, well, maybe, but, I just like all Star Wars, it doesn't matter, it doesn't have to be perfect. As long as there's storm troopers, and light sabers, I'm happy. \nAkane: OK, so you're a big Star Wars fan. \nTodd: Huge. But that's OK. I'll get that movie another time. Um, how about you suggest a movie. What would you like to see?\nAkane: Um, I really like romantic comedies, especially Meg Ryan movies\nTodd: Oh, no! \nAkane: Yeah! \n\nTodd: I can't stand her.\nAkane: What! What's wrong with her? \nTodd: She's terrible. Every movie she has the perfect life, and she has, she looks so cute, but she can't find love. It's like, come on, people like that have a perfect job and look cute and beautiful like Meg Ryan do not have trouble finding love. \nAkane: But she's so cute and funny to watch. I just really enjoy watching her. \nTodd: I don't know. I just can't do it. You know though, I liked Meg Ryan in that movie she's made about, she went to the Gulf War, or whatever, and she was a helicopter pilot. \nAkane: Oh, yeah, yeah! I remember that one. I forget what it was called though. \nTodd: Yeah, yeah, she was OK in that but she wasn't that cutesy romance.\nAkane: That's true. She was a different character than usual. \nTodd: Yeah, so we can't see a Meg Ryan movie, and we can't see Star Wars, so what else?\nAkane: Ah, I don't know. What about a comedy that will make us really laugh.\nTodd: OK, um, let's see. We could see Shrek.\nAkane: Oh, I love Shrek. \nTodd: Ok, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, I haven't seen Shrek 2. Have you seen Shrek 2? \nAkane: Ah, no, I haven't actually. \nTodd: Perfect. Shrek 2. \nAkane: Great! We'll get that. \nTodd: OK. I'll run down and pick it up. \nAkane: Thanks.",

I've got to fill in some forms, tonight. I'm going to law school in September, so I've got to get some money together.\nTodd: You've got to get money together on Saturday night?\nRuth: Well, I actually did try to do my forms today but I didn't manage to get anything done, so now I have to do it on Saturday night.\nTodd: Yeah, but tomorrow is Sunday. Just do it tomorrow.\nRuth: Yeah, but I'm going to church tomorrow and so I'd rather get some done tonight.\nTodd: Well, how long are you going to work?\nRuth: Tonight! Um, I'll probably do a couple of hours. Maybe I can come up and watch the end.\nTodd: OK, well, what time do you think you'd be able to come up? Cause we can just do different stuff.\n\t\t\t\t                              You know Akane, she's always cleaning. I'm sure she'd love to go back and scrub her apartment or something. \nRuth: Well, how about 10 o'clock? What are you doing at 10?\nTodd: Ah, 10 would be good, if I'm still awake.\nRuth: Will you be too tired?\nTodd: No, no, that's good. It's Saturday. No problem.\nRuth: Really?\nTodd: Yeah, yeah! Do it. Um, we were thinking of getting Shrek 2. \nRuth: Oh, wow! I really like Shrek 2.\nTodd: OK, cool.\nRuth: I really like it.\nTodd: I wanted to watch Star Wars but she said \"no\".\nRuth: Oh, I'm glad she said \"no\".\nTodd: You don't like Star Wars?\nRuth: I can't stand it, except that I do like Ewan McGregor.\nTodd: That's right. That's right. You said that before. OK, yeah cool, well, just go home \n\t\t\t\t                                                          and work really hard and try to come back.\nRuth: I'll do as much as I can. \nTodd: OK, see you then. \nRuth: Alright.

We have some really nice paintings in here.\nAkane: I think I really like this one. Can you tell me a bit about it?\nRuth: Certainly, yes. Now that one's actually by a local painter. His name's John Mansfield and he's been painting since he was 14 actually, although he died in 1999 so he painted for about 53 years in total. I really like that one myself actually.\nAkane: So he died? That means that there aren't many of his paintings left.\nRuth: That's right, yes. I mean most of his paintings are one-offs and this one is a one-off.\nAkane: Oh, OK. Well I especially like the colours of this one. I like how it's bright and it looks really nice and I like how it depicts the local landscape.\nRuth: Yes, that's true. It is really nice isn't it? Actually this is a picture of a local walking route which is quite famous and quite popular with hikers. A lot of people go there on walks particularly at the weekend. And if you look on the left hand side there, that tree is the oldest tree in the area.\nAkane: Oh, is that right? Have you ever been to this place?\nRuth: Yes I've been there quite often actually and it looks very much like this in the spring.\nAkane: Well if John Mansfield is a local painter, have you ever met him when he was alive?\nRuth: Yes, he often use to come into this shop. He was a very devoted painter and he really enjoyed buying paintings by different painters in the area.\nAkane: Really? Well that sounds really interesting. How much is this painting?\nRuth: That one's actually a hundred and eighty pounds.\nAkane: Wow! 180 pounds! \nRuth: Yes I'm afraid so.\nAkane: Well that's a bit beyond my budget. Would you be able to give it to me for 100 pounds?\nRuth: Mm, I think a hundred is too cheap.\nAkane: Well let's see. This other painting looks quite nice too. How about if I buy both of them? Would you be able to give it to me for maybe 250 pounds?\nRuth: Why don't we say three hundred and you've got yourself a deal. \nAkane: Three hundred? That sounds good. Thanks a lot. I'll take it.\nRuth: OK then.\nAkane: Great!",

Firstly, when you go in, there's normally someone at the door who greets you and they give you a hymn book. Hymns are songs and we have a book full of songs, then in the main part of the church, we sit on pews. Pews are like long wooded seats and the pews in my church are quite big. You can fit about ten, or fifteen people, on one pew. The minister, he's the man who leads the service, is at the front of the church. He stands behind the pulpit, which is a wooden box, and he puts the bible on that box. \n\t\t               There are lots of stained glass windows in my church. They are windows with colored glass in them, and they often have pictures in them, normally pictures of stories in the bible. We also have an organ in church, and somebody plays the organ every week. The organ pipes are at the front and it's very loud. However, we also have a piano, and a small group of people who do singing on other days. I really like my church. I like the atmosphere there and I really think it's a friendly place.",

I didn’t know any Portuguese, except for some simple words like “hello”, and “thank you”. I learned some simple words through an audio CD, before I went there. And the people that I stayed with didn’t know very much English either. However, we got along surprisingly well. They were surprised that I was able to eat some of their exotic foods. They made some delicious meals every single day, like octopus, tripe and rabbit. It is quite exotic, but I thought it was quite good. They also made some excellent desserts, like crème caramel, and a rich sponge cake that they call Paon d’lo.",

Have your ever seen a horror movie?\n\nAkane: Well, um, when I was little I used to watch them with my friends, because, back in the 80’s, horror movies used to be really popular. Like ah “Jason”, and “Freddy Cruger”. (Oh yeah) and things like that yeah. But ah, they used to keep me up at night and I couldn’t sleep.\n\nRuth: Yeah, my friend actually had a “Freddy Cruger” poster. It used to frighten me.\n\nAkane: Did she?\n\nRuth: Yeah, it wasn’t my favorite. So, ah, what don’t you like about horror movies?\n\nAkane: Well, um, I think, I think uh, I don’t know, I think it’s the psychological aspect of it. They just really make me feel scared.\n\nRuth: Ah, heh.. What was the last horror movie that you watched?\n\nAkane: Um, the last one I watched was, I think it was the “Blair Witch Project”.\n\nRuth: Oh I know that film, yeah\n\t\t\t\t          .\nAkane: The first one, I saw it in the theatre with my friend. And I couldn’t sleep properly for a week after that.\n\nRuth: Oh no!\n\nAkane: Ya, I mean, I know it’s stupid. A lot of people think it’s a pretty stupid movie. Um, but I think it was just, just the psychological aspect of it that really made me feel scared. And uh, I think, with that movie, after people saw it, they weren’t really sure whether it was real or not. \n\nRuth: Oh yeah.\n\nAkane: And so there was that element as, as well. \n\nRuth: Was that the same film that I’m thinking of. The one where they filmed people in a forest, is that right?\n\nAkane: Yeah, that’s right. It was in a forest. And the whole thing was done with a camcorder. A hand held camcorder. And so, it was, a lot of it was, I think, black and white. I can’t remember. And uh, and the camera was very shaky, and…\n\nRuth: So it wasn’t professionally filmed?\n\nAkane: Um, I guess it didn’t look like it was.\n\nRuth: Right.\n\nAkane: Yeah, I heard that the movie actually only took um, It didn’t take a lot of money to film it. \n\t\t\t\t          But it, it made a lot of money.\n\nRuth: Yeah, I can believe that actually, I can believe that.

They don't learn how to share or, you know, how to get along with and talk to different people.\nAkane: Well, I think that the child will actually get more interaction if there's a stay at home parent because the parent will be able to take them to different activities and to other houses to have playmates and at the same time, they'll be able to spend more time with that parent and have socializing time with family members.\nRuth: But I think children could get those same experiences from different people who look after them. It wouldn't necessarily have to be there family who looked after them surely.\nAkane: Well, sure but, I think that it's different when a person who is not related takes care of a child. I'm sure that they do their best but the love is not there. The caretaker would not love the child as much as the parent would and at the same time if there's one person taking care of ten different children at the same time I would wonder about the amount of attention that the child would get,and safety issues as well.\nRuth: But I think you've got to look at the practical aspect of this. It's not always practical for people who don't have much money to have one parent staying at home all of the time.\nAkane: That's true. I really agree about that.\nRuth: Oh, good we agree on one thing.",

When they speak their own language instead?\nRuth: Firstly, I give them a stern look, although that doesn't always work, then, well, if I'm setting an activity, I always make sure that, I ask them first of all which language they are going to do the activity in, and any student who's not going to speak English has to put their hand up and generally students don't like to be the odd one out so they don't put their hand up.\nTodd: That's a pretty good strategy.\nRuth: What do you do? \nTodd: Um, well, I don't know, I mean, I haven't had much success really, so I've actually been pretty casual about it. I just let them speak occasionally to each other in their own language. \nRuth: Really?\nTodd: Yeah, and then, I just encourage that they speak English but I figure as long as their trying to speak in English and they do the majority of it in English, that when they have to speak a little bit of their language, that's OK, I mean, as long as it's quick, and..\nRuth: I really think English should be the only language they speak in class if they're learning English.\nTodd: But don't you think that that just too hard, that maybe that actually brings them down, they strain too hard, that sometimes it's just easier for them to communicate really quickly, and then switch back to English.\nRuth: I think it's really good for them to, I think as a challenge. I'm not saying it's easy for them, but I do think it's good for them, and I think it helps their English to improve more quickly.\nTodd: Yeah, I guess. Maybe I should try it. I'll give it a try, but it might be too late cause I've already let them, you know, not do it, so!\nRuth: So do you think you might start this week?\nTodd: I'll try, but I have to be careful because I don't want to shock them too much.",

Um, I would recommend, if you're not used to cooking I would recommend the fried noodles. It's quick. It's easy. It's inexpensive, and yeah, I think you can do it.\nTodd: Mm, OK, so what do I do? I mean actually, first of all, what do I need to buy?\nAkane: Well, I think you would need to go to the grocery store and get some noodles. You can get the ready prepared ones which are quick and easy. The dried ones you would have to boil first, so I would prepare, I would recommend the ready prepared ones and you also need some vegetables, and maybe if you like you can also add some meats.\nTodd: Mm, OK, I probably won't do the meat thing, but for the vegetables, what vegetables do you recommend?\nAkane: Well, I recommend seasonal vegetables because the ones in season are always higher in vitamins and nutrients. Right now it's about early summer, late spring so the ones that are good right now egg plants, spinach and, well bean sprouts are good all year round.\nTodd: Mm, OK, so assuming I buy all this stuff (right) bring it home, what do I do?\nAkane: Well, first you need a good frying pan. (I got that) OK, first you actually need to wash the vegetables and cut them up into small pieces and then heat the pan up with oil and then put the vegetables in first because they take longer to cook than the noodles. After you have seen that the vegetables have gotten slightly brown and soft, then you can add the noodles and mix it up until the noodles are heated up and then just season it with salt and pepper or a sauce that you like.\nTodd: OK, sounds pretty easy, but as for the oil, what kind of oil should I get?\nAkane: Well, vegetable oil, kanola oil, or olive oil, I think would be the healthiest choices.\nTodd: OK, now one problem I have about cooking is, for people who don't know how to cook, how much do you cook? Like you said, chop up the vegetables (Yeah) Do I chop up five eggplants, one eggplant?\nAkane: Well, if it's just for yourself, I would recommend just one eggplant and maybe half a bag of bean sprouts and half a bunch of spinach. The vegetables really shrink after you cook them so it might look like a lot when they're raw, but once you cook them. They shrink.\nTodd: OK. Well, I'll give it a try, and I'll tell you how it tastes.\nAkane: Great. Good luck.",

What happened?\nAkane: Well, it's kind of a funny story actually. I fell asleep on the bus and I was so tired that afternoon. It was a Friday afternoon and I'd had a long week and just fell deep into sleep and I really didn't notice when we were at the end of the bus ride and we were at the station, and then I was really upset because the bus driver didn't say anything and so I just kept sleeping and by the time I woke up and noticed we were on our way back to the school again. Yes, and I didn't get a chance to press the button and get off until I was almost halfway to the school, so I ended up getting home really late and even more tired and it wasn't a very good experience at all.\nTodd: Did you say anything to the bus driver when you got off?\nAkane: No, I didn't because I was so flustered and I was in a rush to get off that I didn't really get to say anything.\nTodd: Oh, that must have been so annoying.\nAkane: It was.\nTodd: So what time did you actually make it home?\nAkane: I think it was around 7:30, maybe.\nTodd: Well, the next time we come home, I'll look for you and I'll make sure to wake you up.\nAkane: For sure, and make sure to look in the back seat and make sure I'm not lying down horizontally because I think that's maybe how the bus driver missed out on the fact I was there.",

It's funny how you can love something and hate something at the same time.\nI like to go running in the park, particularly after a long day at work when you've been inside for the whole day it's really nice to go outside in the fresh air and get some exercise, and after the run is finished you feel so good: You feel really good about yourself and you know that you've done something worthwhile and something which is healthy too. Sometimes I like to go to the gym and I like to run on the treadmill, but I think it's easier to run on the treadmill than it is to run outside on the concrete or on the grass.",

There's always little glitches and problems. You know, computers are getting better but so are viruses. Programs are getting easier and better, but they're also getting more expensive and you always have to upgrade because what you want to get doesn't work necessarily with what you have on your computer, you know. Internet connections are always speeding up, but there's always a slow internet connection, at least 20 or 25 percent of the time. You know, if you want to run something you always need to download this or download this. This program is incompatible with this program. When you are on the internet, there is always strange pop-up ads and things like that. E-mail! Ah, your e-mail box is full, too much memory, yeah, printers, printers are the worst of all. You know after all this time, why is it that printers always break down when you need to print something on time.

        "transcript": "Yeah, I want to talk about one of my pet peeves. You know a pet peeve is something that you as a person don't like. You personally don't like a habit or a mannerism or something that other people do, um, for example a pet peeve could be people who don't like wrinkled shirts or they don't like it when people chew gum in public, or like the noise that some people make, or habits, mannerisms, for example my grandmother, my grandmother's pet peeve was, you know, messy clothes or people who wore messy clothes. She didn't like that, you know, if someone had a whole in their sock, she would sew it up immediately. She just hated it. It was her pet peeve, you know, if you didn't wear nice, crisp, clean clothes, you know, you know some people's pet peeve is, you know, when other people talk on the cell phone, ah, things like that. \nYeah, my pet peeve is a little more complicated. It's a little more unique I think then other people's pet peeves, but it's when Canadians wear, or embroider, canadian flags on their backpack. That's just something that's annoying or irritating for me. It's my pet peeve. I'm Canadian so it's not like I don't like Canada or I don't like Canadians because I am Canadian and I do love my country, but it's just so cheesy when I see so many travelers, usually the backpacking kind that put Canadian paraphernalia, especially Canadian embroidered flags on their suitcases or backpack. I don't know why it bothers me. I guess I think it's not cool, or I can't see the reason why to do that. I mean, people tell me it's to show that they're not American, but, who cares? You should be able to just tell them, \"Hey, I'm from, you know, I'm from Canada, I'm from Vancouver, I'm from Toronto, I'm from Saskatchewan, where ever.\" Yeah, it's something I can consider as a personal pet peeve. Don't do it Canadians.",

You can go for a cigarette. You can get something to drink. You can go to the bathroom, which you cannot do in a car.\n                        Simon: OK, and let's talk about the airplane.

Uh, we are traveling in Japan, so the train is very fast and efficient, however, it is expensive, and another thing is, you're confined by schedule and things like that.

I mean I like to play sports more than I like to watch sports but sometimes a good game on TV or watching it live can be really good, um, you know, everybody, or many people like to watch the olympics or the world cup of soccer, I mean those kinds of sports are really, really exciting. I like to watch them too. I like to watch a good game on TV, you know, it there's lots of buildup and tension for the match, it's even better. \nOne sport that I've been really getting into recently is Japanese Sumo wrestling, yeah, it's, you know, it's quite a spectacle. Many westerners think that it's kind of a joke, you know, a bunch of fat guys in tiny underwear, you know bashing their bodies against each other, but there's really a lot more to it than that, I mean, these guys are incredibly athletic. They also are quite strong and they have a repertoire of martial arts and wrestling ability. It's pretty amazing to watch. I mean the matches are really really short so sometimes the uninitiated don't know what going on but basically the rules are stay on your feet and stay in the small circle and, you know, try to get your opponent to fall down or to go out of the circle. That's why they only take about 10 or 20 seconds to finish a match because they do everything they can, but finally, before you know it, the match is over, you know, they do wrestling throws, they do martial arts, they do all kinds of things. It's really fun, and there's the whole ritual with it as well, I mean it's pretty amazing.",

Me, too.What's your favorite episode of the old series?\n\t                    Simon: Of course, that would have to be number two, The Empire Strikes Back.\n                        Lesie: Really, mine is the original Star Wars.\n                        Simon: Oh, really! Why do you like it so much? Why is it the best?\n                        Lesie:  I think it's the best because the characters are really, really different. In the second and third one they're kind of, they begin to mellow, but in the first one, they're really different.\n                        Simon: Oh, you mean that each character is distinct from the other characters.\n                        Lesie: Right!\n                        Simon: Yeah, I like the second one better because it's a little bit darker and cooler and the bad guy, Darth Vader, of course one of the most famous bad guys in movie history, plays a bigger part and you know there's the drama and plus the, you know, the fighting, and the space scenes are all a little bit better and cooler. \n                        Lesie: I see. Well, my favorite character is Princess Leia. Do you know why? \n                        Simon: Well, I'm sure you'll tell me.\n                        Lesie: Well, because she was the first positive strong female character I saw in the movies. She was take charge, told everybody what to do.\n                        Simon: Well, she was popular with both girls and boys.\n                        Lesie: Right! Hey, did you have any Star Wars toys when you were a kid?\n                        Simon: Yeah, of course, I had the Luke Skywalker action figure.\n                        Lesie: Oh, I see.\n                        Simon: How about you?\n                        Lesie: Ah, I can't remember. I don't remember if I have any, if I had any toys but I had the soundtrack to the movie.\n                        Simon: So can you sing, can you hymn it a little bit of the soundtrack right now?\n                        Lesie: No, but I can tell you most of the dialogue from the first movie.\n                        Simon:So that you can say that you are a diehard Star Wars fan?\n                        Lesie: I am a diehard Star Wars fan.\n                        Simon:Yeah, when I was young, me too.",

        "transcript": "Ruth: So Akane, what do you think about children today having mobile phones?\nAkane: Mobile phones? Well, I mean, I think they could be a good thing, I mean for safety reasons.\nRuth: Really?\nAkane: Yes if I was a parent I think I would feel safer knowing that my child had a mobile phone and I could get in touch with them whenever I need to and if something happens like an emergency then they will be able to use the mobile phone.\nRuth: You see I would argue that they’re quite dangerous actually, because children don’t really have the best attention spans anyway and often they could, for example, walk into the road whilst they were talking on their mobile phone and generally not pay attention so I don’t think they’re very safe.\nAkane: Well that’s a good point but that could also teach them responsibility as well. If mobile phones are unsafe, I mean bicycles could be unsafe and toys could be unsafe, but that’s all part of growing up and I think that if you teach them responsibility, it shouldn’t be a big problem.\nRuth: But I think fewer children these days play on bikes than they used to; I think children are more dependent upon technology and I see that as, as a definite negative thing because children don’t play out as they used to before. They just stay in and watch TV and play on computer games.\nAkane: True, true. I suppose so, but you know technology is a necessity in our lives and in the future if we want them to become competent in using technology and taking advantage of technology then I think it would be a good way to start.\nRuth: Don’t you think they are really expensive though? I mean, don’t…\nAkane: Oh yeah, they are.\nRuth: If I was a parent though I would not want my child to be phoning people left, right and centre because it would cost so much money.\nAkane: Well you could be right about that. They do cost a lot of money. \nRuth: Oh, I’m glad you agree. Well, yeah, like at least we agree about something now.\nAkane: For sure.",

I still really like autumn. One of my favorite things about autumn is whan all of the leaves fall off the trees and you can walk about and crunch in the leaves. However I think my favorite thing about autumn is the conkers. I love it when conkers fall off trees and you can collect them. \nWhen I was at school we used to collect conkers and put them on stings and then we would have a competition to see who had the best conker. We would hit our conkers with somebody elses and if yours didn't smash then you could have one point so after your first game, your conker would be a oner. Then if you won twice, it would be a twoer and so on. It was a really good game and it kept us amused for hours. Conkers are great fun. Have you ever played conkers? Maybe you should. Why don't you try it this autumn?",

        "transcript": "There are two things which really annoy me. Actually I experience both of them, sometimes, on public transport. Often when I travel I go on buses and on trains and both of these things seem to occur quite often. Firstly is when other people listen to music, they listen to their CD player or their MP3 player and the music is really loud. I mean, I don't mind if other people want to listen to music. In fact, I also really like listening to music and I often take my MP3 player to different places with me but I don't like listening to other people's music so I wish they would just turn the volume down a bit.\nThe other thing which really peeves me is when people leave their mobile phones on in public and the phones ring and ring and people never know whose phone it is because often people have the same ringtone. But the worst thing is when people have long conversations in public on their mobile phones. I don't really want to hear everybody else's gossip. I mean, obviously sometimes it is necessary to make a phone call to arrange a lift or to organise something. That's different. But when people have lengthy conversations I really get annoyed. I wonder what you think about that?",

        "transcript": "When I was younger I was in an organisation called the guides. Guides are girls who are between 10 and 14 who get together once a week to do things like have competions and play games and go camping and generally just have fun together. I really enjoyed being in the guides. There's a similar organisation called the scouts for boys although I think these days girls can be scouts and maybe boys can be guides - I'm not sure. Anyway I used to go camping quite a lot with guides. \n\t\t\t            I remember I went one weekend and it was the same weekend as my birthday and I was going to be 13 that weekend. We had a really good weekend and we cooked different things and we played games and we didn't really get much sleep as you generally don't when you're sleeping in a tent with a lot of people your age you tend to stay up all night.  So on my birthday which was the Sunday, everybody sang Happy Birthday to me and they gave me a cake and they wrote on a card for me and I had a really nice day. That evening I went home and I was so tired and I started to unpack my things. And then the doorbell rang and my friend arrived and then one by one - it was very strange- all of my friends arrived, and what had happened was my parents had organised a surprise birthday party for me! I was so excited but I was also very smelly. I hadn't had a shower for the whole weekend. We had a great time, we went bowling and it was really a day to remember.",

I think primarily I like him because he is so good-looking and he's just got really nice skin and really nice eyes and nice hair and so primarily I think it's his looks, although from what I've read in magazines and things, he seems like he is a nice guy as well.\nTodd: What movie did you really enjoy that he made?\nRuth: Probably Moulin Rouge. That's probably my favorite because in Moulin Rouge he sings a song called Your song by Elton John and he sings it to this girl, and I just think, \"Wow, imagine Ewan McGregor singing that song to you. That would just be absolutely phenomenal.\" I really like that, so although he's been in different things but that's probably my favorite.\nTodd: Did you see him in Train Spotting?\nRuth: Yes, I did, yeah.\nTodd: That's the first time I saw him and I thought that that was just a really good movie. \nRuth: It's a really good film.\nTodd: You know when they showed that in the States a lot of people requested that it had like transcripts. \nRuth: No way. \nTodd: Yeah, because the English was so difficult for American people to understand.\nRuth: That's really funny.\nTodd: Isn't that funny.\nRuth: Yeah.\nTodd: Yeah, so, it's funny though cause now Ewan McGregor is Obi-One. \nRuth: That's true.\nTodd: In the Star Wars movies.\nRuth: No, I'm not a Star Wars fan, actually but I would probably watch it just for Ewan McGregor.\nTodd: Have you seen him in the other two?\nRuth: I just saw him in the first one.\nTodd: Oh, really.

That's sleeping in for me.\nRuth: That's sleeping in. That's true. You're an early bird aren't you?\nTodd: Now, last night we went out and had the beers.\nRuth: Yeah!\nTodd: I was actually quite happy this morning. I had no hangover.\nRuth: Did you not? (No) I felt a little bit queasy this morning, and I was a bit ashamed, and I didn't even drink very much. I wasn't, I didn't feel queasy. I think is was more that I hadn't had any sleep actually.\nTodd: Yeah, did you feel guilty in church knowing that you still had the beer buzz?\nRuth: No. I didn't feel guilty about that.\nTodd: Yeah, that would be tough one. No, I still got up this morning at 5:45.\nRuth: 5:45!\nTodd: Yeah.\nRuth: You must be a lunatic.\nTodd: Well, I mean when the light comes up and the light goes through your window, I don't know how people can still sleep. You know? You can sleep when the light, the sunrise still comes up?\nRuth: Yeah, not for too, I mean I can't sleep forever, but like, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, then my body wakes up.\nTodd: The apartment I was at before, it was crazy because there was a rooster outside, and it didn't do what it was supposed to do, like normally when the sun comes up, the rooster is supposed to go, \"er-er-er-er\" or whatever, \n\t\t\t\t                                                  but this thing did it at like 1 and 2 in the morning. It used to drive me nuts, so I used to always wake up at 2 because I'd hear this rooster going \"er-er-er\" and I just wanted to kill that bird.\nRuth: Did you go sleep, back to sleep after that?\nTodd: Yeah, of course I went back to sleep, but the bird would wake me up regularly. Yeah. No roosters here. \nRuth: That's not funny is it? \nTodd: Yeah.",

Like snakes, spiders, rats?\n\t\t\t            Ruth: Probably sharks. \n\t\t\t            Todd: Sharks. \n\t\t                Ruth: I know that sounds quite irrational, especially when I don't live near the sea but just the thought of being eaten by a shark. It's horrific. I really, really, I'm frightened of sharks.\n\t\t                Todd: Have you ever seen a shark? \n\t                    Ruth: No. \n\t                    Todd: No. \n                        Ruth: Thankfully. \n                        Todd: Yeah. \n                        Ruth: I think I'd run a mile. \n                        Todd: I don't know really what I'm afraid of, I guess,I don't like heights too much. Yeah, so. I have to admit that when I'm on a plane I get kind of freaked out, when I fly, yeah. You think, \"How is this thing staying in the air?\". You know?\n                        Ruth: You're always happy to land. \n                        Todd: Yeah, yeah. Always, always, very happy to land, and often when I go home I have to fly across the Pacific and there's no land so you look out your window and you think, \"Ah, if something goes wrong with the plane we can't land anymore, but that's very irrational because most accidents I think happen over mountains, so. I think so.\n                        Ruth: Although if you landed in the sea, then there might be sharks. \n                        Todd: That's true. How do you feel when you fly? \n                        Ruth: I quite like flying actually. I quite like it. I mean I'm quite used to flying. I've flown to a lot of places. If it's a long haul flight, i guess it's a bit boring, but I like the handheld computer you get to play with. \n                        Todd: Yeah, those are nice. \n                        Ruth: They're good. \n                        Todd: Now, you're a vegetarian so what's the food like? \n                        Ruth: Oh, well the last time I flew I didn't get any vegetarian food. I think I forgot to tell them, so I had to eat the chicken, whatever. \n                        Todd: Really, you actually ate the chicken? \n                        Ruth: No, I didn't eat it. I didn't eat it. I just had it in front of me. \n                        Todd: Yeah, I heard that the vegetarian meal are actually better than the chicken or beef meal. \n                        Ruth: Really, they're quite good, I mean when I've had then in the past they've been quite good. \n                        Todd: Well, here's to not seeing any sharks in the future. \n                        Ruth: Absolutely.",

And I was very, very pleased because I found a parking space immedately which was rather unusual. I did my shopping, which only took half an hour and I went back to my car, and to my absolute horror it was no longer on the ground but it was suspended in the air. I really did not know what to do at this point so I walked back into town and I went to the police station. \n\t\t              The police were very kind to me and I was very grateful for that and they interviewed me.  They asked me what had happened and I said 'I'm really sorry, I didn't buy a parking ticket' and they said 'We hadn't even noticed that!', they said 'Do you realise where you had parked?' and I said 'Well no, I have no idea' and they said 'Well actually you parked into the entrance to a car park and as a result nobody could get out of the car park because you were parked in the entrance'. So I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time then. It was very embarrassing: I hadn't seen the sign, I hadn't noticed the car park which was rather silly. Erm, but now my friends think it is really funny when I tell them the story. I also think it's funny but it was an expensive mistake!",

Nottingham is quite famous for Sherwood forest, where Robin hood was supposed to live and as a child I spent some of my time in Sherwood Forest playing. \n\t\t\t            I live in a village and it's actually a mining village with about 1,000 or 1,500 inhabitants. There's really not very much to do there. There's a shop and a post office, a school and my mom teaches at the school. \n\t\t              I did actually live in Edinburgh for one year and that was quite different from life in my village because there was so much more to do and there were so many more people and there was so much more traffic, but I think actually I prefer living in a village because, well, if you want to go out to the shops, if you want to go to the cinema, you can go to the nearest town, or to the nearest city, but you can always escape city life and you can always go back to where it's quiet and more peaceful and where everybody knows each other, but if you live in the city you can't really escape it, and I don't really like the noise of the city so I think I will probably live in a village for the rest of my life.",

        "transcript": "I'm an English teacher in Japan and when I first came here I didn't really have very much money so I found things quite expensive and I went out looking for cheap bargains. I came across a shop and it called the 100 Yen shop. It's absolutely fantastic. 100 Yen is about 50 p, 50 pence that is. I think that's about 1 dollar, and you go in there and everything is 100 yen. You can buy all sorts of things in a 100 yen shop. You can buy food. You can buy things for your house, things for your bathroom, your kitchen. You can buy ornaments and stationary and things like shampoo. \nI really, really like to get a bargain and when I go in and I know that I've found something and it's worth buying, I really, really get excited about it, and it sends shivers down my spine. We have a shop in Britain and it's quite similar to the 100 yen shop. It's called Pound Land and so everything in it is 1 pound. Not everything is a real bargain. Some things are really pretty rubbish but if you do find a bargain, it's great. It reminds me really of what we have in Britain called car boot sales. They are places where people go and they fill their cars full of things that they don't want anymore and they sell them and people look through other people's items and they find the things that they want to buy and they barter, so they try and get things for a cheap price. It's really good though when you get a bargain. \nHow do you feel about that?",

We did a project at school and I found out that animals are actually killed for us to eat and as an 8 year-old I thought that was rather immoral, so I went home and I told my parents that I didn't want to eat meat anymore so now I eat everything really except for meat and fish and I don't eat things with animals fats in either. \nI think really I'm a vegetarian now because it's a habit and if I were to eat meat, I think I would be quite ill. My favorite food is probably tofu although I like broccoli and I like chocolate as well. Sometimes because I like traveling, I go to places and it's really difficult for vegetarians because they don't really have anything for vegetarians to eat, so sometimes I just have like, a bowl of rice, or an omelet, or something like that, but when I'm at home, I like to cook for myself, and I like to cook nice vegetarian dishes, and stews and things like that. My parents didn't mind me becoming a vegetarian, and I think they were really good about it because I don't know many people, who when their child said they wanted to be a vegetarian would except that, so I was really grateful to my parents for being so nice and understanding about it.",

I quite like to make, like a vegetable stew with tofu in it. Things like that, but it's not very exciting. \n\t\t                Todd: Well, how do you make the stew? \n\t                    Ruth: Well, firstly, you get all of the vegetable ready and so you chop them up and the potatoes and you boil the potatoes and then you boil the other vegetables, and you fry the tofu with onions and then I think you just put it all together in a pan and stick it in the oven, I think. \n\t                    Todd: Sounds pretty good. \n                        Ruth: It's very easy. \n                        Todd: What vegetables do you usually put inside the stew? \n                        Ruth: Oh, thinks like carrots and leaks and courgettes sometimes, mushrooms, and really any vegetables that are in season that I can get hold of. \n                        Todd: Courgettes? Is that squash? Zucchini? \n                        Ruth: I think it might be squash. No, I think it's zucchini. \n                        Todd: Zucchini. \n                        Ruth: I think it's zucchini. \n                        Todd: OK, yeah, I think in the states we call it zucchini. \n                        Ruth: And you would call aubergine, eggplant. \n                        Todd: Yes. What do you call eggplant? \n                        Ruth: Aubergine. \n                        Todd: Aubergine. \n                        Ruth: Yeah. \n                        Todd: How do you spell it? \n                        Ruth: Good question. A-U-B-E-R-G-I-N-E. \n                        Todd: Wow. How do you spell courgettes?\n                        Ruth: C-O-U-R-G-E-T-T-E \n                        Todd: That's pretty good. Now can you spell Zucchini? \n                        Ruth: Probably not. Z-U-C-C-H-I-N-I. \n                        Todd: Yeah, maybe that's it. One more time. \n                        Ruth: Z-U-C-C-H-I-N-I. \n                        Todd: Yeah, I think that's it. Zucchini. I'm not even sure. \n                        Ruth: I'm not either. \n                        Todd: Yeah, what's your favorite vegetable? \n                        Ruth: Ah, it has to be broccoli. \n                        Todd: Oh, yeah? \n                        Ruth: I really like broccoli. They look like little trees, there that's nice. \n                        Todd: Yeah, that's true. Yeah, if you just get one broccoli and start eating it, you can't even finish it. It's just so big. \n                        Ruth: Oh, you can. You definitely can. \n                        Todd: Well, how do you cook your broccoli? \n                        Ruth: Just very briefly really because there's nothing worse than soggy broccoli. You cook it. You boil it in a pan with water only for a three or four minutes. What's your favorite vegetable? \n                        Todd: That's a good question. I would have to go with the eggplant and the \"aubergine\"? \n                        Ruth: Aubergine. \n                        Todd: Aubergine. So the aubergine as you call it, yeah. \n                        Ruth: I think eggplant's the best. Really, don't you think they're sometimes a bit soggy? \n                        Todd: Actually I kind of like them that way. \n                        Ruth: Really.\n                        Todd: Yeah. I like them any way. Although the bad thing about the eggplant is you can't eat it raw. \n                        Ruth: Yeah, that's true. It takes effort.",

(Nice!) It was really nice, actually, yeah.\n\t\t\t            Todd: Wow, so where did you go in Scandinavia?Ruth: Well, we started off in Sweden and then we went to Norway and then we went to Denmark. We never actually made it to Finland. That was simply because we ran out of money, so. \n\t\t                Todd: So were you out in the wilderness, or were you just going from village to village? \n\t\t                Ruth: Really we just, we arrived in Stockholm. We went around Stockholm. We went to Oslo. We spent most of our time in the cities, although everything was so expensive. We ended up sleeping in youth hostels or on people's floors. \n\t                    Todd: What do you remember most about your trip?\n\t                    Ruth: Um, probably just having no money, so we couldn't eat really for a fortnight. \n                        Todd: You couldn't eat? \n                        Ruth: Well, we ate breakfast in the youth hostel, and then we would take a bread roll from the youth hostel, from the breakfast bar and have that for lunch and then in the evening we would eat if we could afford it. \n                        Todd: Actually, in terms of food, what do people in Scandinavia usually eat? \n                        Ruth: Um, I think they eat a lot of potatoes and meat and things. I'm not sure really what a typical Scandinavian meal would be. \n                        Todd: That's OK.

Um, so what do you remember most about Stockholm?\n                        Ruth: Ah, they've got some really nice buildings in Stockholm. I've got relatives who live in Stockholm so we stayed with them, and also it was really hot when we went there, but it was also very pricey. \n                        Todd: So in every store you went into were they playing ABBA? \n                        Ruth: No. Thank goodness.",

How did you do it?Akane: Well, I've been really eating healthy and working out a bit as well.Ruth: Wow. I read recently actually in the newspaper that there are lots of new gyms opening up. Is that what you've been doing, going to the gym?Akane: Ah, yeah actually. I joined a new gym. It wasn't that expensive either and it's been really good. Ruth: So, how much was it?Akane: It was about $30 a month. (Oh) Yeah.Ruth: So when you so to the gym, what kind of thing do you do?Akane: Um, well, my favorite thing to do is to run on the treadmill, and sometimes I also do weights.Ruth: You do weights as well? (Mm-hm) Really heavy weights?Akane: No just lighter ones.Ruth: Oh, I see.Akane: Yeah.Ruth: So do you mind the fact when you're in the gym the air is really stuffy and you can always smell people's sweat? Does that not bother you?Akane: It does actually bother me so I do prefer to go when it's not too crowded.Ruth: Of course, yeah.Akane: People tend to go after work so I try to go a little bit earlier, or a little bit later. That's a good plan.Ruth: But you know, sometimes I still wonder if it's healthy to exercise inside because if you  exercise outside you can get more fresh air.Akane: I think you're right about that. It does feel better when I do get exercise outside,  but sometimes I'm so busy and if the weather's not good, it's just easier to go the gym.Ruth: Well, I suppose so.Akane: Yeah, and a little exercise inside is better than no exercise. Ruth: You're right actually. Akane: So if I want to lose weight, what would you recommend?Ruth: Basically, just exercise within you limits and eat healthy.Akane: I think it's just common sense.Ruth: Really. Do you think I'll lose weight.Akane: For sure. I think so, but I don't know what you're talking about. You definitely don't need to lose weight.\nRuth: Well, that's kind of you Akane. OK, thanks.",

Yeah.Akane: Yeah, there's that, that other store, the sushi shop that we haven't gone to yet.Ruth: Ok, well, we could go there because that would be a nice walk as well.  We could walk there and walk back and we could get some exercise at the same time.

Have you ever fallen asleep at work?Akane: Actually, well, I don't fall asleep when I'm teaching, cause its such a busy job (Yeah) but when I was working in an office, when I was doing medical research, it was such a boring job that I did used to fall asleep in front of the computer sometimes. It's really embarrassing.Ruth: So have you ever had an embarrassing moment when you've fallen asleep?Akane: Actually, yes. One time we went to watch the symphony orchestra  and it was beautiful music and I was enjoying myself but I just fell asleep in between.Ruth: Oh, no, Akane.Akane: Yeah.Ruth: So how many hours sleep do you normally get Akane?Akane: Well, I try to get at least nine. Of course that's not always possible,  so I'd say on average about eight and a half hours.Ruth: Eight and a half.Akane: Yeah.Ruth: Well, I suppose if you add that to the five hours a day that you sleep that's quite a lot.Akane: If you put it that way.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Tres, you said when you were younger, you took many family car trips. Tres: Oh yes. You can say I grew up in the car. We’d take road trips from Oklahoma (state of Oklahoma) to say Florida or Georgia, Mississippi. We’d even drive up north to New York, and I’ve taken road trips to Colorado, and Seattle Washington. Inside the car, when I’m with my brothers and sisters, sometimes we’d fight but most of the time we’d play various games. For example we’d count the license plates.Todd: So license plates are the, like I.D. on the back of a car.Tres: Right. I.D. on the back of a car, and depending on the state, the license plate changes. So we try to see, how many states we can count. And who every got the most states by the end of the trip of course would win. We’d do other things, for example, my parents always made sure that we visited historical sites to learn about the local culture of the area. And we’d also try the local foods that existed. So whenever we’d drive to the south, for example, if we drove through Louisiana, we’d try Cajun food. Which is full of gumbo (which is another word for okra), and rice, and Cray fish (which is sort of like a lobster).Todd: Sounds good. It’s spicy?Tres: Oh yea it’s very spicy. Very very spicy. So we had a lot of fun times in the car. Todd: So did you have some bad times in the car? Did you fight with your brothers and your sisters?Tres: Occasionally we would fight. I was the youngest of three, so I always lost. So it was very hard. And I had the middle seat. So if my older brother fought with my older sister, then I was stuck in the centre. Todd: Not fun.Tres: Not fun at all. But we hardly every fought and I would say the road trips were a lot of fun.Todd: Yeah. I took a lot of road trips with my family I remember them very fondly.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Kate, if somebody had a month to spend in New Zealand where do you recommend they go and what do you recommend they do?Kate: Well most often you will fly into Auckland airport so you can start off in Auckland whch is a nice big city, however the most important thing about New Zealand is the smaller countryside parts of New Zealand, so you should go up to the north… past… further north than Auckland. Go to the beautiful beaches and you can go all the way up to a place called ‘Cape Reinga’ which is the very top of New Zealand. From there you can see the Pacific ocean.Todd: Sounds nice.Kate: Yeah, it’s very beautiful.Todd: How long do you recommend someone stays there?Kate: Just stay there maybe only a couple of days, maybe a week maximum at the top of New Zealand. Just get to see some beaches and the top of the north island, Cape Reinga.’ And then travel down the island by car or just hire a car or a camper van. You can just sleep in the camper van or on the camping ground and one, it’s cheap and it’s a lot more fun with your friends.Todd: Sounds like a good time. So when you go camping, when you move down the islands, the north island or the south island, what do you recommend that they see or do?Kate: Well definitely go to the national park. It’s called Tongarigo national park. It’s where Lord of the Rings was filmed.Todd: Oh woah!Kate: And I’m sure if you’ve seen that movie you can.. you know the beautiful scenery that was there. Really amazing.Todd: Good deal. So besides Auckland are there any other cities that people should see?Kate: Then you can go down to Wellington, the capital city and you can just see the museum and the harbour. Just the museums. That’s the main thing. Todd: Ok well, sounds like a nice country to visit. I would definitely go!",

Kids have a lot more freedom that kids in other countries: we can.. obviously we go to school from 5 years and until 16 years old you must go to school, but when we come home from school there’s our parents there. They’re very loving and caring, in general that is. And we have a lot of lawns, a lot of scenery, landscapes that we can run around on.Todd: What kind of things did you do when you were little, like games and sports?Kate: Sports.Todd: Oh sports, what sports?Kate: I started off with ballet and I got really bored with ballet. I went to gymnastics and that was my main sport when I was growing up.Todd: Oh wow you were a gymnast? What events did you do?Kate: Events? Well you have levels: competition levels, so you start from level 3 and I went up to level 7 and next level would have been very competitive, it’s called ‘junior elite’. Had I continued I would have probably stopped school and concentrated on gymnastics only.Todd: When you were younger was your dream to go to the Olympics?Kate: Yes definitely.Todd: Oh ok. So do you ever - because you’re still very young - do you ever practise gymnastics still?Kate: Yes I do actually. At the university that I go to I joined the club which is not gym but it’s kind of dance and I can still do some of the stuff I used to be able to do.Todd: As you get older have you ever thought about becoming a coach?Kate: Yes, I did think about it but it’s not a reality any more. I’ve forgotten so many things already. Just teaching for fun.",

Now is that because he’s handsome or because he’s a good actor?Kate: He’s handsome but he’s actually a very good actor. I like him because he is very well respected in Hollywood. You look at the other actors and they’ve all had these scandals: drinking scandals, drug scandals but I haven’t heard of anything about Brad Pitt.Todd: That’s true actually. Come to think of it, I never have. What’s a movie that he was in that you really liked?Kate: Ocean's Eleven. That was a very, very good movie.Todd: Yeah, any other movies that you really liked?Kate: I can’t think of the names right now, but he has a recent movie out called ‘Mr and Mrs Smith’ I think, and it’s with Angelina Jolie. And that's ... did you hear about that? Todd: No, I haven't actually.Kate: They heard….Angelina Jolie is said to have been with Brad Pitt while they were making the movie, although Brad Pitt is supposed to be with Jennifer Anniston.Todd: Right so they’re married, right?Kate: Yes, they were.Todd: They were married?Kate: They separated.Todd: But they’re not divorced?Kate: Not divorced, no.Todd: Oh OK, no I didn’t know that. So as a Brad Pitt fan who do you think is more his type? Mrs. Jolie or Mrs. Anniston?Kate: I prefer Jennifer Anniston because she’s more calm and more… they seem like they could have a nice little family together, but Angelina Jolie, she’s very wild and keeps partying and …Todd: Yeah, they do seem like they’re different, that’s true.Kate: Yeah, very different.Todd: What is it about Brad Pitt’s features that you think make him attractive?Kate: I like his smile, his eyes. That’s generally what I go for.Todd: So in a guy you look for a nice smile and nice eyes?Kate: Definitely. From first impressions, from the first look, definitely the smile and eyes. If they stand out, I will go for them.Todd: Oh, very interesting. OK, thanks",

When I was 15 I went to Tokyo, Japan for just 2 weeks on a high school exchange.Todd: So were you alone or with your school?Kate: Erm I was…Well you could say I was alone. I went with a group of about 7 people around about the same age and they were from the same city.Todd: What was it like living with a Japanese family?Kate: Oh it was very interesting. The customs were so different. The family was really great to me, really kind and caring.Todd: What is different about the Japanese lifestyle and the lifestyle in New Zealand?Kate: Erm, in a way they have this togetherness , the family. The traditional way is that the mother is home all day: she is a housewife and she will wake up at 5 o’clock in the morning, make the breakfast for the whole family and then she is at the home all day cleaning. Then when the kids come home and she makes them dinner and finally the father comes home very late at night after work, and then he gets his dinner. Very very different from my family which is everybody just gets their own dinner. Everyone is independent.Todd: Wow that is a lot different. Any other differences like, for example, bathing or sleeping or eating or anything like that?Kate: Bathing, yeah. They share ofuro… it’s like, they share a bath. I think it starts when they’re children. I’m not sure, I can’t quite remember but they all share the same water, they don’t waste water. They are very conservative. Todd: So one person gets in the bath, then the next person, then the next?Kate: That’s right.Todd: Separately?Kate: Separately.Todd: Oh, interesting. Ok, and what about sleeping? Did you sleep on a bed or a futon?Kate: I slept on a futon which to me… it felt like the floor. I might as well just put the futon away and slept on the floor but I got used to it.Todd: What do you prefer now: a futon or a bed?Kate: I have a bed now but I don’t mind a futon. I’ve really gotten used to it.Todd: So you obviously have really good memories having an exchange… or being an exchange student. Would you like to have an exchange student some day?Kate: Yes, of course. I’ve had 3 already actually in my house.Todd: Really?Kate: Yes, because when you go to Japan you’re expected to have a host sister or host brother come back to New Zealand the next year, the following year.Todd: Ah, I see.",

She was just so happy and overjoyed. And we still keep in contact.Todd: What was her name?Kate: Ariko.Todd: Oh, ok.Kate: Ariko.Todd: So were all the exchange students from Japan?Kate: They were. Three from Japan.Todd: Who else did you have come to stay with you?Kate: The next one was interesting. She was from Kanto.. Kansai, near Osaka in Japan. And she actually…she was in a band, a brass band, an orchestra. She actually came to New Zealand to just play in this orchestra. She was a very lovely girl. She spoke fluent English so we had no problems in communicating.Todd: How long did she stay?Kate: She stayed for 3 weeks actually. A bit longer.Todd: You said there was one more…Kate: One more was Ayako. She was older, she was actually more my brother’s age so she spent a lot of time with my brother rather than with me ‘cause I was going to school every day.Todd: Oh, I see.Kate: But we still got on very well. And my most memorable moment was going horse riding with her.Todd: Oh, nice.

Akane: Oh, I see....Does everybody still live together?Ruth: Well, actually at the moment my brother lives in London and my parents live in Darbyshire and I live in Japan but very soon we are all going to move back in together.Akane: Ooh, are you looking forward to that?Ruth: I'm looking forward to it but I think it could be interesting.Akane: Yeah, for sure.....So who is the oldest person in your family?Ruth: The oldest person is probably my great aunt and she's 80. Akane: Oh, and who is the youngest person in your family? Ruth: Actually, my cousin was born about two weeks ago. She's called Ema. She's two weeks old. Akane: Wow! Did you see a picture of her?Ruth: I have seen a picture of her, yes. She lives in Sweden. Akane: That's really exciting.Ruth: Yes, it was nice. Akane: And how big is your extended family? Ruth: Well, I'm not from a really big family actually. My dad has got three sisters and my mom has just got one brother, so you know, some people are from families and somebody has ten children, and they have lots of aunties, and uncles. It's not like that in my family.Akane: Oh, OK. And where is your family originally from?Ruth: Originally, my parents, and their parents,and their parents I think , are all from Yorkshire in England. It's in the North of England.Akane: Everybody in your family is from there?Ruth: I think so, although my family have since moved, and so some live in Sweden now, some live in Australia and some live in America.Akane: Oh, that sounds really interesting......So when does your entire family ever get together?Ruth: Well, that's a good question. Well, a lot of people get together at Christmas, but even then not everybody does. I think really we only see the entire family at weddings and at funerals.Akane: Oh, OK, and when was the last time there was a wedding or a funeral?Ruth: Um, I think it was about eight years ago, so quite a long time ago, now.

Akane: And who is the most generous person in your whole family?Ruth: My brother is really generous and he makes me feel bad because he's so generous in buying me things and giving me things, and I would say my brother.

He bought me some clothes actually before I came to Japan.Akane: And who do you talk with the most in your family?Ruth: All of them really, but I suppose deep down I maybe talk to my mom the most. I tell her most things.Akane: Really! What kind of things do you tell her?\nRuth: Just everything that's going rough in my life, really ,because she's a really good friend to me so, I'm just very open with her, and she's open with me.

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Mark, when people think of Americans they often think of the hot dog and when they think of Japan they think of sushi. What are the foods that people associate with New Zealand?Mark: According to a lot of the Japanese students that I know who have gone to study in New Zealand or have a home stay programme over there, they normally come back speaking about 3New Zealand foods. The first one is probably fish and chips, which is a traditional or unofficial traditional Friday night meal. At the end of a long week mum and dad will say, “Lets go and get some ‘greezies’”: deep fried battered fish, potato fritters or hot dogs and fried chips. They used to be wrapped in newspaper but now for health reasons you’ve got to have plain white paper.Todd: Oh, no kidding.Mark: Yeah, but the fish and chips dinner on Friday night is a bit of a tradition. Todd: Oh, ok what else besides fish and chips?Mark: The other one would be something called a pavlova which is similar to a large meringue cake, very rich, very very sweet, made with egg white and lots of sugar with lots of whipped cream and fresh fruit on top. Kiwis and Australians often argue over who invented it but I’m sure kiwis did!Todd: Pavlova, uh?Is this like a snack you eat in the afternoon?Mark: No, it’s a dessert, it’s the size of a cake. It would be a dessert cake. Todd: Is this something people make themselves or buy in the store?Mark: The best ones I think are home made. The third food is vegemite, which is a breakfast spread, a yeast based breakfast spread. Lots of non-New Zealanders who don’t know it think that it looks like chocolate spread, and then they put in on their toast or bread in the morning, but it actually has a very unique taste and it’s nothing at all like chocolate!Todd: So is it bitter? Is it sweet? Is it sour?Mark: It’s got a very yeasty flavour but its quite hard to describe, but its another one of those New Zealand traditions. Todd: You say its made from yeast so what are the main ingredients?Mark: It’s a yeast based extract so its very healthy for you: lots of minerals, and all kiwi kids should grow up on it.Todd: Ok, sounds interesting – I’ll have to give it a try.",

But I still enjoy giving him his bath and helping put him to bed and playing with him in the mornings and at the weekend.Todd: Oh, that’s great. So, what’s it like being a father?Mark: A lot of fun. As I said, I think my wife has a harder job looking after him during the day. The father can have the good jobs in the evening and the early morning and at the weekend.Todd: So is your child speaking yet?Mark: Not quite, but he understands English and Japanese. So if we tell him off in either language he runs away and starts crying. He’s just started walking.Todd: Ok, oh that’s got to be tough.Mark: It’s getting tougher. We just have to childproof the house more.Todd: So how do you childproof the house?Mark: Make sure that all breakables are above the level where he can reach, that’s the most important thing.Todd: Now, when you have a child, like, first of all how much does the baby sleep?Mark: Well he’s a good sleeper. He’s basically always slept from about 9 in the morning, 9 in the evening until 6.30 or 7 in the morning. He’s waking up a little bit earlier now because it’s lighter earlier.Todd: Oh, wow, so what does your child like to do? Do you play special games with your …, with Roy?Mark: He’s into dancing at the moment. He really likes the beat of the BBC world music so he looks forward to the BBC news at the hour. He likes going to the sandpit and playing with the other children from the neighbourhood.Todd: Well, you have a lovely child.Mark: Thank you.",

It's a beautiful campus, by the way, and so, you know, I remember she was sitting on this bench and I went and, you know, she smiled at me and I smiled at her, and there was some kind of spark.\nTodd: Yeah, yeah, like a connection.\nMike: There was a connection. There was a connection there, and I, you know, we went on this walking tour of the campus and when we were you done, you know, I kind of reluctantly, sort of said goodbye to her and the rest of the group, and you know, kind of said, see you around, and I think the next day even, she went found out who I was and where I worked and she dropped in my office.\nTodd: Wow, that's pretty cool. That's pretty romantic.\nMike: It was very cool. Very romantic. You know the funny thing is, that particular bench, where we met, on our anniversary, 20th anniversary, we went back to the campus (no way) where we met and we took a picture of ourselves on the same bench because this is where we first met.\nTodd: What a great story.\nMike: It was very cool to go back there.\nTodd: So, in terms of your personality, how are you guys similar?\nMike: How are we similar? Oh, man, I think we're more different than anything. I think our biggest similarity is that we're both so different, in other words that we're both very tolerant (yeah) of people who are different and so we, you know we kind of get along. We have an understanding that's we're going to misunderstand each other most of the time.\nTodd: Right, right.\nMike: But we sort of approach that with a kind of humor and flexibility so I think that's what makes our relationship work is that we got that kind of agreement.\nTodd: So you think that's the key to any successful marriage?\nMike: Is not getting so upset at misunderstanding each other or kind of using misunderstanding as a way of getting to know each other. I think that is one of the keys.\nTodd: That's nice. Thanks.\nMike: Sure.",

Go to bed around 11. Get up at 6. On a good day, sometimes go to bed later.\nTodd: Yeah, do you have to have an alarm clock when you get up?\nMike: I sometimes set an alarm if it's a really important day, but I almost never need it, you know what I mean. It's like a back up.\nTodd: Right. Right. Yeah, I always wake up at first sunlight, like I can't sleep once it's light outside.\nMike: You're like a natural animal.\nTodd: Yeah, exactly, actually I never use an alarm clock. Now you have a beautiful dog. I saw your dog.\nMike: She will sometimes wake us up.\nTodd: Yeah, that is what I was wondering.\nMike: Because, like, she has a natural cycle so at six in the morning, bam, you start to hear her wagging her tail or scratching, or trying to get attention. Time to get up.\nTodd: That's so cool. I want a dog. Yeah, so do you walk your dog in the morning?\nMike: Yeah, and that's another ritual I have is she needs a walk in the morning, so I've got this route. It's about a two mile walk that we go on. Almost the exact same route every morning. It takes about 30 minutes or so to do, yeah.\nTodd: And so, in some countries or places you need a leash for your dog, so your dog can't get away from you. Do you have a leash for your dog?\nMike: Yeah. I keep her on a leash when we're walking were there are other people because you know, a lot of people are not comfortable with big dogs (right) but she'll stay close to me, even without a leash (right) but I do it for their comfort, but if we're in an open area, I'll let her off the leash and she loves that.\nTodd: That's so good, because you know I'm a runner and it always freaks me out when I see people with their dogs and their big and the dogs aren't on a leash.\nMike: You kind of wonder, is this dog safe to go past?\nTodd: Well, yeah, and plus, I'm running behind the owner of the dogs and so I might startle the owner, and startle the dogs, and the dogs might be protective and attack me, so sometimes I'll holler in advance, \"Hey, I'm coming. I'm coming.\"\nMike: Right, right.\nTodd: So. Yeah, cool. Thanks Mike.",

Mini: Hello.Todd: Now, Mini, you are from Sri Lanka.Mini: Yes.Todd: If somebody is going to your country, can you recommend three things they should do or three things they should see?Mini: OK, the first thing is you can go and see the ancient things that all the Kings and Queens built, like castles. We have a castle called... it's called the Rock Castle. It's called Sigirya, so it's very beautiful.Todd: This is the Rock Castle.Mini: Yeah, it's... the castle is on the rock itself, so you can see the ruins there. It's really beautiful, with pictures, paintings, arts and stuff.Todd: Oh, really. That's really cool, so this rock castle, how old is it?Mini: I'm not sure, but maybe around two thousand. I'm not sure. Sorry.Todd: What else should people you see?Mini: The second thing should be beaches. We have beautiful beaches all over the place, blue, clean. You can swim. You can surf. It's very beautiful. That's the second thing.Todd: Surfing is popular in Sri Lanka?Mini: M-hm. I mean, not popular amongst Sri Lankans but most of the... many tourists come, especially the Germans, they come to my country and surf because the hotels near the beaches are very cheap and it's very beautiful hotels and very cheap. Food is cheap. It's nice.Todd: OK. So, we've got the Rock Castle, surfing on the beach. Anything else? Mini: And then a third thing should be the Tooth Temple. It's like the tooth of a Buddha, so we got it from I guess India, King Ashoka, so it's one of the things that you can see there. It's a really beautiful temple.Todd: OK, I'm sorry. Can you say the name of that again?Mini: Temple of Tooth Relic.Todd: The Temple of Tooth Relic.Mini: Yeah.Todd: OK. Mini: It's in Kandy. A place called Kandy.Todd: Kandy. OK.

Did you get a chance to go camping or hiking? Asako: Oh, yeah. Camping almost every single weekend. That's a joke, but... Yeah, many times. I camped and of course people enjoy hiking, rock climbing. If you're not really an outdoor type, you can enjoy barbecuing, but yeah, some people do enjoy outdoor.Todd: Well, you know, Alaska is really famous for bears, so when you would go hiking or camping would ever see any bears?Asako: Of course.Todd: Seriously?Asako: Yeah. Of course. Wolves. Bears. You can name it.Todd: Bears. Wolves.Asako: Yeah.Todd: And people still go out there?Asako: Of course.Todd: Yeah, but aren't you afraid of the bears?Asako: Well, you have to know what you are supposed to do, but yeah.Todd: Well, what do you do?Asako: Well, you have to be careful about what you would do with your food. You know. You don't put your leftovers anywhere you like. You have to be really careful with that, and also you have to know how you are supposed to act when you actually meet a bear when you are hiking, but if you have the right knowledge, you should be OK. Of course, still there are accidents but you should be OK.Todd: Wow! So what do you they tell you to do if you see a bear?Asako: Well, you're supposed to wave your hands.Todd: Wave your hands. Up high?Asako: Up high.Todd: So you seem taller?Asako: You seem taller and also bears have never seen animals doing stuff like that, so they get scared and leave. That's usually but when bears are really hungry, then you still, yeah, so there are bears that are really hungry and maybe look crazy, so you're still taking a chance, but.Todd: Well, what about a wolf? Or wolves? Do you do the same thing for wolves?Asako: Well, actually, the only wolves I've seen was in the Denaly Park. I was in a car, so i didn't have any problems, so I really don't know what I am supposed to do when I meet wolves.Todd: Now for the local people, what do they consider more dangerous, a wolf or a bear?Asako: You don't see many wolves, but you do see a lot of bears so maybe bears.Todd: Oh, yeah.

Nagoya.Todd: Now, Nagoya is a very big city.Asako: Very big. Two million people.Todd: So, what was it like going from a big city in Japan to way out in the wilderness in Alaska?Asako: Do you know what? A lot of people think I had problems, many problems, but actually I did not. I just loved it. I did not have any problems.Todd: So maybe, by nature, you are actually more of a nature person.Asako: Exactly. So when... actually when I had problems, was when I came back to Japan, back to the big city in Nagoya. Then I had a lot of problems.Todd: You missed the wilderness?Asako: I missed silence. Quiet. I... just too many, too many sounds in the city. Even when you're sitting in your room, you still hear some sort of sounds, noise, surrounded by some sort of noise all the time, and I just couldn't stand it. It took me a long time to get used to.Todd: You know that's kind of interesting because I grew up in a small town and then I moved and I lived some major cities: London, you know, Tokyo, and I lived in Bangkok and when I would come home from being in Bangkok, Thailand, I was so used to having people around all the time, it was really hard to have too much space.Asako: Interesting.Todd: It was too much, like I missed having action and noise around me all the time.Asako: So you are a city person?Todd: You know, it's funny, oddly enough, I grew up on a farm and in a small town and I actually think, Yes, I am more of a city person.Asako: Wow.Todd: Maybe it us just the difference.Asako: Maybe so. Maybe. Yeah.Todd: So would you like to move back to Alaska some day?Asako: I would love to. It could be a little difficult because it's very cold in the winter. But I would love to. I miss nature.Todd: Now do you do the really rough, Alaskan things, like hunting, fishing, things like that?Asako: I have tried. I couldn't catch any.... well, fish yes, but I couldn't shoot anything, but I tried.Todd: You tried to shoot?Asako: Shoot. I did.Todd: You didn't hit anything?Asako: I didn't.Todd: Really!Asako: I was really bad.Todd: Well, I am sure, out there, there's some animal that's very thankful you're not good at hunting.Asako: I'm sure they were.",

Really. So obviously there's lots of beautiful things and the mosquitos, but what else? Like what was the city like? I mean, was it a big city or a small city?Asako: Well, the biggest city is called Anchorage, and... but it's not really big-big. In the middle... the biggest street in Anchorage you can see moose.

Exactly.Todd: Now can you go up and pet them like....Asako: No, never. Never. They are wild things. You can't pet them, but, I mean, they are very, very calm and nice animals but if you meet a mother moose and if there are children, her children are around, they can be really mean. So you don't really pet them. You can look at them and admire them, but that's it. Beautiful things.Todd: Well, that's good to know.",

Actually, I lived in Prague for about a week, or two weeks. Anita: OK.Todd: A long time ago.Anita: Wow.Todd: Right out of college.Anita: Really. And how did you like it?Todd: Well, it was great. It was one of the first European cities I went to, and it was so different from America, and I thought the architecture downtown was really beautiful.Anita: So what was your first impression when you got there?Todd: Well, when I first got there, I had no place to stay, and this young kid came up to me and convinced me to live in his house.Anita: Wow!Todd: So they... his mother was renting rooms to foreigners, so I lived with a Czech family for about ten days.Anita: Really, so did you eat Czech food?Todd: I did, but you know I don't remember anything about it. It was so long ago. It seemed really good though.Anita: I guess. I like it. So what did you do in Prague? What did you see there?Todd: Well, of course I went to the downtown area which had the castle and the bridge and lots of the old buildings, and I just took local transportation. I took the... I guess it's not a subway or...Anita: It is. You can call it a subway. We call it the Metro.Todd: Yeah, I took the Metro to different places and I took buses and just walked around the city and I had a good time.Anita: Did you find it cheap or expensive compared to the States?Todd: Well, it was really cheap, but at that time I was working in Europe and I had no money, so I still was very poor.Anita: Hmm, I see.Todd: Yeah, so now... I was in Prague, you know, 12 years ago. Do you think the city changed a lot since I was there?Anita: It's changed very much. I guess since the fall of Communism in 1989, the city started changing at that time and it's still changing. It's become very modern. Of course the historical parts are still preserved. You're not allowed to build skyscrapers or very tall buildings. It's good because after the fall of Communism a lot of the buildings were renovated, so the whole city looks like it's new. It's old new.Todd: Yeah. Anita: It's very colorful. It's just beautiful. Yeah.Todd: Yeah, I remember, the city almost looked like a museum because the buildings were just so pristine and perfect.Anita: Yeah. It's... I personally just love walking through the streets. You can never get tired of that.Todd: Well, hopefully I can go back again someday.",

Anita: I have been there once a long time ago when I... well, not that long but when I was twelve years old I went there with my family.Todd: Great. You know, I'm from San Francisco so what did you think?Anita: I think it was a very beautiful city. You had... there's so many nice houses in these little winding streets, you know, going up the hills and down the hills, and you get the old, the historical trams.Todd: Right, exactly.Anita: Right?Todd: The cable cars.Anita: The cable cars, and the Golden Gate Bridge is beautiful of course.Todd: Yeah, actually I think the Bridge is still pretty amazing. I mean, even people that live there, it's just an amazing thing to look at, to cross. It's nice. But one thing about my city is it's really expensive. Did you find it expensive when you were there? Anita: Well, thankfully I went there as a child so my parents paid for everything, so I didn't have to worry about that so...Todd: Right.Anita: If I went there now, I mean, probably I would be worried about that, yeah.Todd: Yeah, I think... I'm sorry. I forgot. You said you were twelve.Anita: Yeah.Todd: So, OK. Well, when you were in America did you enjoy American food?Anita: Yeah. I like any kind of food, so... I don't like to eat too much fast food but I didn't have any problems now that I recall, now that I remember so... It was OK.Todd: Right. Yeah, but in America we don't eat that much fast food, at least not in San Francisco.Anita: OK, I'll take your word for it.Todd: Did you talk to anybody, or did you meet people?Anita: In San Francisco, not that I remember. Of course, we talked to people we met but we didn't visit friends. We just went there as tourists and you know, took a couple of tours, so yeah we talked the tour guide who lives there, and it was nice meeting somebody from San Francisco.Todd: Now, my favorite part of the city is... there's two places actually: Golden Gate Park and also the Presidio. The Presidio is also a park. Did you go to either of those?Anita: I think we did. I don't remember them very clearly but all the major sites that are there we definitely went to. It's hard to miss.",

Anita: I am from the Czech Republic.Todd: Oh, and what city?Anita: Ah, from the capitol city, Prague.Todd: Oh, that's a beautiful city.Anita: Yes, it is. Todd: Can you talk a little bit about your city?Anita: OK, Prague is a very historical city. It's got many, many old buildings. It's very popular among foreign tourists, especially. The main attraction is the Prague Castle, which is right in the city center. That's where the President has his office.Todd: Inside the castle?Anita: Yeah, in the castle.Todd: That's really cool.Anita: Yes, yeah, it's really beautiful. Of course you can't go into his offices, but you can go into the premises of the castle and walk around and there's a very big cathedral right in the middle of the castle and it's absolutely gorgeous.Todd: Now, actually, I saw the castle many years ago, about 12 years ago, and if memory serves it was built by the Romans? Or am I wrong?Anita: I'm not very good in history, so I'm sorry.Todd: OK, I...Anita: I'm not sure.Todd: I'm probably very wrong.Anita: But, one of our late last kings. He was an emperor of Rome as well.Todd: Oh, I see.Anita: A Roman Emperor.Todd: Ah, so maybe that's it.Anita: Something to do with Rome. Anyway.Todd: Somebody will probably write me now and tell me the history. And there's also a really famous bridge correct?Anita: The Charles Bridge. Exactly.Todd: Right.Anita: The Charles Bridge.Todd: So, it must be nice to be living in a city with so many beautiful buildings and history.Anita: It is. You know, I mean, of course it depends where in the city you go because the city center is the historical part but when you go to the outskirts of the city, that's where it is... that's where you get buildings from the Communist era, so it's not colorful. It's all grey. It's all one style and it can get pretty ugly in some parts, but if you stick to the city center it's gorgeous. It's like a fairy tale.Todd: So would you say then that your city is a mix of new and old?Anita: Um, I probably wouldn't say a mix of new and old because they're not mixed in one place.Todd: Right.Anita: It's old in the center and then new, not modern... I wouldn't say modern, but new, Communist new in the outskirts, so it's separated. It's not mixed together, which is good because when tourists come they don't get to see the ugly parts as much.Todd: It's like in the States. Believe me, every city has it's ugly parts.Anita: Yeah, I guess.",

Yeah.Rebecca: Do the tortillas... do they stand up or are they round ones that always fall over when you go to eat them?Diego: They're the round ones and they're also soft so they're not corn chips.Rebecca: Like the ones we get.Diego: Yes.Rebecca: Not true Mexican.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Mike, you're giving tips about weight training and we've talked about upper body. Now what about lower body and legs? I actually don't want to lift weights with my legs. I just... It is OK if I just skip it? Mike: Well, you should do your legs because you should get a full body workout because if you just do one part of your body it affect the other parts of your body as well, so you need to be balanced.Todd: OK, so I'm convinced. I'm gonna work on my legs. What's the most basic exercise I should do?Mike: I think you should start off squatting. That's where you put... make sure you have a squat rack, and you put the bar behind your head on your shoulders and you just squat as if you are sitting on a bench and come back up.Todd: Now often I see guys in the gym that do that. They have the big weight belt. Do I need to get a weight belt?Mike: It would be good, that if you're just starting off to use the weight belt but once you get the motion I would advise you to to not use the weight belt so that it forces you to keep good posture yourself.Todd: Now, when you do the squat, like how low should I go. Should I go until I'm almost sitting on the floor?Mike: As is there was a bench underneath your.....Todd: Bottom?Mike: Bottom.Todd: Right. Yeah, right. So basically, your legs and your knees should be about 90 degrees.Mike: Yeah.Todd: OK, so that's... that will work out all my legs? That's all I have to do is squats?Mike: Yeah, that's probably the best one you can do.Todd: OK, and that is for my calves and my hamstrings too?Mike: Not your calves but for your hamstrings and your bottom.Todd: OK. So what should I do for my calves?Mike: You can do calf raises, which is... you can do it on a squat rack, and you just hold the bar in the same position as you would a squat and just raise your legs up on your toes.Todd: OK, so in terms of how... of sets, like how many sets should I do of the squats?Mike: I think you should start of with three sets.Todd: Three sets.Mike: The same as the other exercises.Todd: And about ten reps?Mike: And about ten reps, yes.Todd: So do I always keep the weight constant? I don't have the weight go up or down?Mike: Well, once you get used to the motion and the position that you're in, then you can start increasing the weights as you go.Todd: OK, but I mean, each set should be the same weight.Mike: Yeah, when you're starting off.Todd: OK, yeah. And also just for the calves, just do three sets?Mike: Yep, just do three sets.Todd: Alright.Mike: Well, thanks a lot, Mike. I'm gonna get started.",

        "transcript": "Todd: OK, Mike, you are fit, and you got me motivated. I want to work out, so I thought I would ask you about a work out routine, so first let's talk about upper body? What should I do for my chest and shoulders? Mike: Well, the first basic chest work-out is the bench press, where you use the straight bar, and you should probably do three sets, if you're starting out: three sets, doing ten reps each set. Todd: OK, three sets would mean I do it three times with rest in between, correct?Mike: Yes.Todd: And how much time should I rest between each set?Mike: Maybe a minute-and-half, two minutes.Todd: OK, and then when I do each set, so you say I do ten reps, that means I lift the weights ten times?Mike: Yes.Todd: OK, and I should do heavy enough weight that I can only do it ten?Mike: Yeah, you should lift weight that is heavy enough to where you can only do it ten times.Todd: OK, so, that's gonna build my chest and my shoulders?Mike: That will build your chest.Todd: OK and then what about my shoulders? What can I do for my shoulders?Mike: Well, a good one is the military press which, there's usually good machines for that, where you sit down and you just press the bar above your head.Todd: OK, so you think it's better that I do this on a machine than free weights?Mike: Yeah, if you're just starting out, I think you should do it on a machine. It's probably safer. You can get the motion down and then it puts less strain on your back.Todd: OK, and when I do this, again I should do it about ten reps?Mike: Yeah, about the same.Todd: OK, now when I lift should I do it like really quick and fast or like slow?Mike: You should bring weight down slow and explode up.Todd: Oh, so I lower the bar slowly and then push up as quick as possible?Mike: Yeah, and you do that ten times.Todd: OK, so we've got my chest workout, we've got my shoulder work-out. What about my arms? I want big arms, Mike. I want guns.Mike: Well, for arms, there's a lot of good exercises, usually for your biceps, the basic would be dumbbell curl, or straight bar curl, which you use the large straight bar, so you just stand and hold the bar in front of you, and just bring it up towards your chest.Todd: OK. Is there any dos and don'ts about lifting the bar, like things I should be careful of?Mike: Just make sure that your back is straight and that your stomach muscles are tight so that it keeps you solid.Todd: So, I need to keep my torso, my chest, very straight and not move to much?Mike: Yes. Yes.Todd: OK and the same as before: ten reps?Mike: Yep, that's the same as well.Todd: OK, so do the curls. Alright. I'm set. I hope I'm gonna get pumped, MIke.",

How did you get involved in weight training? Mike: Well, I started in high school. I've played sports since I was little and once I got to high school, we had to start weight training for our team.Todd: OK, and so did you just start with like, you know, the basics, like free weights or did you do like the machines?Mike: Yeah, well, we had a weight lifting coach so we did both machines and free weights and he made sure that our form was correct and we did everything properly, so.Todd: Right, now, actually which did you prefer, the machines or the free weights?Mike: I prefer free weights. Yeah, I think machine is a little bit more restrictive than free weights so if you know how to... if you have proper guidance, then free weights are better.Todd: So, actually you play soccer. Is that correct?Mike: Yes.Todd: See, that's interesting cause I wouldn't think that soccer players would be into weight training.Mike: Yeah, that's the usual way of thinking for a lot of people, but actually now people into playing soccer are doing a lot more weights.Todd: But when you lift weights, don't you feel that you're more tight? Or you're tighter? That you're not flexible?Mike: Yeah, but that means that you have to stretch. Do a lot of stretching as well.Todd: So, stretching is just as important as the weight training?Mike: Yes.Todd: OK, well, you don't play soccer anymore, do you?Mike: No, after college I've retired from competitive sports.Todd: So, do you still follow the same regiment that you did with your soccer training?Mike: No. Weight lifting when you're not playing sports is different than when you are playing sports, so now I just lift to keep fit and not actually for sports performance.Todd: Well, that's interesting. Like, what is different about doing weight training for sports and doing it just to be fit?Mike: The exercises vary a lot. If you're doing, for sports, you do things that you need to do a lot of explosion work so that you can move faster or better and... whereas if you're just staying fit, you just do more to get exercise and you know, to keep your shape.",

I might like to see how that lifestyle is.Mari: Sounds cool.Mike: What about you?Mari: I couldn't see myself living here in the long-term.

My parents live here, so I feel like I'm more inclined to live here. My brother lives in the States and so if we both lived in the United States, I think my parents would feel a little bit lonely so I feel more inclined to live in Japan.Mike: Which city in Japan would you like?Mari: My parents live near Osaka. I grew up in Tokyo. I'm thinking maybe like Kobe. I think that... I like Kobe a lot because it's like an international port city, or originally it was.

Mike, you've lived in both Florida and Hawaii, and both of these places, people go there on vacation, so can you compare the weather? Mike: Well, actually both places are warm most of the year. Well, actually Hawaii is warm all year. But I would say that Hawaii's weather is probably better than Florida because the weather in Hawaii is not as extreme as it is in Florida and... so where as the temperatures in Florida would range from fifty degree to ninety degrees, in Hawaii it would stay between seventy-five and eighty-five degrees most of the year.Mari: Wow. That's really nice weather. How about the food?Mike: Well the food, in both places are really good but it's quite different. Both places of course you can get good American food, like burgers and that type of thing, but in Florida you get a lot of foods such as Cuban food or Jamaican food which is really good that you can't get in Hawaii, but in Hawaii there's a lot of Asian influence so you can get really good Japanese food or Thai food, but also traditional Polynesian food as well.Mari: Wow. Sounds yummy. How about the shopping?Mike: Well, the shopping varies between both places. Florida is a lot cheaper than Hawaii. Food shopping as well as clothing and that sort of thing. I guess in Hawaii everything has to be shipped over so it's a little bit more expensive.Mari: I didn't know that. How about the night life?Mike: The night life in both places are really good. Hawaii has a lot of clubs if you like that type of thing and Florida of course has a lot of clubs if you like that type of thing, but there's also good bars or just movies and shows in both places.Mari: If you could live in one place, where would you live?Mike: I would choose to live in Hawaii. Well, I'm from Hawaii so I have a bias towards it, but I think Hawaii would be better between the two places for me.",

        "transcript": "Mike: Hey, Mari, so you said New York was very diverse. What parts or neighborhoods do you like? Mari: I really like Soho because there's lots of great shopping to do. Really small shops and really cute restaurants and cafes and then if I'm lucky sometimes when I'm walking around or eating I see like movie stars, so recently before I moved back to Japan I was shopping on Broadway and I say Claire Danes with her boyfriend. It was pretty cool.Mike: So, I always hear about Central Park. Can you tell me about Central Park?Mari: Yeah, Central Park is obviously in the middle of Manhattan. It's really big and people go and play sports or they just hang out and walk around. If you go there on the weekends, you see a lot of joggers because the roads are closed off, so there's no cars. Cars are not allowed, and in the summertime you see a lot of roller-bladers, and bikers.Mike: How big is the park?Mari: It's really big. It goes from I think 56th Street to 110th, so it's pretty large.Mike: So, what other parts?Mari: I went to grad school at Colombia so I lived right near Harlem and I actually really like Harlem because you get a very neighborhood feeling. You hear... You see people walking on the street talking to each other. You walk by the barbershop and you know that everyone knows each other. Everyone is interested in the other. They're gossiping about people in their neighborhood.Mike: Is there any area you don't really like?Mari: Because I am from New York City, I really don't like going to Times Square. I feel like it's very commercial and touristy, so I really don't like Times Square, but I guess for tourists it's very exciting. There's all these lights and, and I don't know, it's probably very exciting, the side street vendors, the musicians and all these things. It would be exciting for tourists, but I try to avoid it.",

It's very convenient. It's energetic. There's lots to do, and New York City is really diverse so it's fun to see the different communities and different people and tourists walking around.Mike: So if I was visiting New York, what should I do?Mari: It depends on which season went to visit, so I don't know if you went during the spring or summer time, I would suggest that you spend some time in Central Park. Go see sports. A lot of sporting events during the summer and there are a lot of events also in Central Park. There's outdoor theater and music concerts and stuff but if you went maybe in the wintertime, you should go see all the windows on Fifth Avenue that are decorated with very holiday themed decorations and Rockefeller Center is know for their big Christmas tree, and you just get a really fun feeling in New York City. Everyone's a little bit more nicer, and I don't know, I like all the seasons in New York City so it depends on which season you decide to visit.Mike: Ah, sounds great, so there's a lot of things to do in New York.Mari: Yeah.",

Can you tell me about the weather?Mike: The weather's really nice in Florida most of the year, which is one reason why I went from Hawaii but in the summer time it gets really hot and when it gets hot you really need air-conditioning, but that's not problem.Mari: Does it rain?Mike: Actually in the summertime, there's really bad lighting storms. It's always... It lasts for about half an hour but it's always between three and five o'clock in the evening.Mari: Sounds pretty scary?Mike: Yeah, but when you're inside it's OK. It's kind of cool to watch.Mari: Is there something you don't like about Florida?Mike: The only thing I don't like is the bugs. There's so many bugs, especially during summer time. And really scary ants, and bugs you can't even see and they end up biting you.Mari: Wow.

So what is summer like in Belgium?\n                              Christophe: Well, at first I would like to answer you that summer is much more better than wintertime in Belgium because there is more sunshine, and the days are longer so there is more sunlight during the day, but actually we also have a lot of rain during summer in Belgium, so people are really upset about it, and I think many people also feel really bad about that because there is rain again.\nAiste: Oh, it sounds like it's raining all year long in Belgium. Which season is actually the nicest one?\nChristophe: Well, it's true. Belgium is not a country that you should visit because of the weather because the weather is not really that nice in Belgium.\nAiste: So what is actually there to be visited? \nChristophe: In summer, it's actually nice to visit Belgium because there are a lot of music festivals. We even have one of the biggest and most famous music festivals in the world, where a lot of famous artists come to sing and a lot of people visit the festival, like over 50,000 people on one day. It's really huge.\nAiste: Do you often go to that festival?\nChristophe: I went to that festival when I was younger, but right now I stopped going there. It's too crowded for me. Too many people. Once you get older, then you don't like that anymore. You like to go to more quiet places and smaller festivals. What about you? How is summer like in Lithuania? Is it as cold as in wintertime?\nAiste: Oh, no, it is not very cold. Actually in summer we have plus 30, so it means from winter there's almost 60 degrees change to summer. Further, people are very happy because after the winter and after a very dark period when sun comes out, they feel like the can take just a holiday and everybody has to stop working. Everybody's really happy with the sun getting out of the sky, and it is very popular, especially in July and August. The people take holiday and go to the seaside and spend their time with their families together while swimming and enjoying the sun at the beach, and I really like summer. I think Lithuania looks wonderful in summer, and anybody who goes to Lithuania should visit it only in summer because otherwise you'll won't bring a very good impression out of it.",

Usually we have snow from the beginning of November till the beginning of April. That means almost five months of snow, but the good thing about snow is that after miserable autumn, where it rains every day, and when the snow starts falling, you have white the atmosphere everywhere, and when people walk in snow, they're not that unhappy and not that desperate anymore, so I actually like snow because snow keeps your mood up. What about Belgium in wintertime? \nChristophe: Belgium in wintertime is really miserable. It's raining all the time, almost every day rain, rain, rain. It's so miserable that people just look at the pavement when they are walking outside all the time. They look like they're so depressed. There's only one thing in their heads, \"Oh, I hope it will be spring time soon.\" But, I was wondering, if it's snowing in Lithuania, isn't it cold?\nAiste: Oh, it is very cold. Just a few years ago we had a temperature that reached minus 26 in wintertime. It was really freezing. You almost can't get out of your house. Once you get out, your eyelashes get frozen, and when you get inside, you're just naturally crying because the ice is melting and running all through your face.\nChristophe: How do you heat your houses when it's so cold?\nAiste: Well, when it's so cold, it's really a problem to heat your house at the proper temperature, and it definitely costs a lot of money. So far I don't have my house and I live with my parents, so my father was taking care of that. He was combining three heating parts with two different kinds of wood and also natural gas from central heating system and by combining this three parts of heating system, he was heating up the house, but still when it was minus 26, once the pipes were frozen, and it was really a huge problem to make the system running back again.\nChristophe: Wow, that sounds like a really complicated and expensive heating system. I prefer rain in my country then.",

It's been a long time since I did sports regularly.\n                              \nTodd: Yeah, me too, but I love sports. I love to watch sports on TV.\nMarion: Mm-hm. But that's not really taking part in sports is it? It's not the same. That just means that you like TV.\nTodd: No, I don't like TV. I like watching sports on TV. There's a big difference.\nMarion: OK, so, what kind of sports do you like watching on TV?\nTodd: Well, I think you know, baseball.\nMarion: But of course. Anything else?\nTodd: No anything, pretty much basketball, baseball. I watch anything but there are sports I really dislike.\nMarion: Hmm, like what, for example?\nTodd: Ice-skating. I hate ice-skating. It's torture. Like I can't watch...\nMarion: The girls doing their pirouettes and stuff like that?\nTodd: Oh, yeah, plus.\nMarion: Figure skating, is that what you mean?\nTodd: Yeah, yeah, so when you watch it you think, they're gonna fall, they're gonna fall, and they've got the music on in the background, and they're going around really fast, and then maybe you like one of the skaters, and then you're nervous cause you think, she's gonna fall, or he's gonna fall. I mean they're terrific athletes, but to me that's not a sport, that's an art. It should be like dancing or ballet. Like they don't put ballet on the sports network, so they should not put ice-skating on the sports network either.\nMarion: OK, I see where you're coming from, but I think if you watch a race like say the 100 meters, or something like that, you might also be nervous and afraid that one of them is going to fall, if you have that kind of investment in somebody.\nTodd: Yeah, I don't think so, and I mean maybe it's just me but, yeah!\nMarion: If you've got and American runner, which you usually do, in the 100 meters, do you not feel really nervous for them?\nTodd: No, cause I know they're gonna win. No just kidding! Actually, they haven't been winning recently, but, yeah, I guess a little bit, maybe the hurdles. You fell that way about the hurdles, a little bit.\nMarion: Yeah!\nTodd: So, but do you like watching ice-skating?\nMarion: Um, I don't mind, but I do find it a bit boring after awhile, really.\nTodd: Yeah! Yeah!\nMarion: I find, to be honest I find most sports boring to watch after a certain length of time. An hour and a half is about my limit. I like watching soccer, but soccer is always changing so, I don't find that a chore to watch but everything else really, an hour and a half and I'm done.\nTodd: Well, I guess that's better.",

I'll say traditional.\nMelissa: It could be fun but if you're already at the point where the girl's like in your house ordering pizza and a movie that's ...\nDoron: Well, I was talking about eating out and going to the cinema. You already got the guy back to your house. Very forward.\nMelissa: Well, pizza and a movie sounds like pizza delivery and video rentals, so I see what you mean. I could always go out for a pizza.\nDoron: I like doing that but then on the other hand, I also like to do something totally strange and different, like when I was living in Berlin in Germany a couple of years ago, I met a girl I liked and I invited her out for a date, and she surprised me by saying yes, so I had to find something to do and I was bored of movies and pizza so we went to a restaurant near my apartment, but the restaurant was really, really cool because it was totally, totally black. There were no lights.\nMelissa: Wow!\nDoron: You just go in there and order from a menu in the foyer and then you get taken to a table by a blind waiter and you can't see anything.\nMelissa: No way!\nDoron: I think they're quite famous. There's two or three around the world. One in New York I think, and also in London and it was the craziest experience because you just have to talk, and I think that's really cool because you don't look at the person. You don't care if they're cute or whatever. You just really get to know them.\nMelissa: That's cool. Were there lot's of people there?\nDoron: It was packed. You had to make a reservation. It was really, really packed.\nMelissa: How could you find your way to the restroom?\nDoron: You had to ask. You had to ring a little bell and then a blind waiter would come and take you.\nMelissa: What do you mean a blind waiter?\nDoron: All of the waiters and the waitresses, and the waiting staff, they were all blind or partially sighted.\nMelissa: Oh, really.\nDoron: Not the chefs. I think the chefs could see.\nMelissa: Oh, OK.\nDoron: But the staff there, they were partially sighted.\nMelissa: Oh, that's interesting.\nDoron: So they learned the room really well because they could see and they were your guides. It was a really interesting date, just ...\nMelissa: It's interesting just from the view point of experiencing what it would be like to be blind because I think people don't get to experience that enough.\nDoron: Exactly, and to know that maybe when you see someone blind in the street, you think, ah, poor guy, poor girl, but then all of a sudden, they're the ones that know their way around and you rely on them.\nMelissa: Yeah, that's really cool.",

This Japanese guy recently told me it was the most interesting sport to watch because of the rules, but unfortunately I don't really know the rules so I have a hard time following it.\nTodd: But you're American. You don't like American football?\nMelissa: I'm more of a basketball fan cause when I watch it, I can easily understand what's going on, and when I'm watching football, everyone around me just screams and they don't really tell me what's going on.\nTodd: Right. But the Super Bowl - that's like the biggest game of the year right! So you go to Super Bowl parties, right?\nMelissa: Yeah, my sister's crazy about football and she has Super Bowl parties but I haven't really lived in America for the past three years, and before that I was in college and I never really went to one. How about you? \nTodd: Oh, yeah, I'm huge .... it's the biggest day of the year for me.\nMelissa: What's your favorite team?\nTodd: Well, my team is terrible now ... the 49ers, so they're never, ever in the Super Bowl.\nMelissa: Yeah, that's cool. San Francisco.\nTodd: But the thing I think is great about Super Bowl Sunday is it's really ... it's like the silent American holiday.\nMelissa: Yes.\nTodd: You know what I mean? Like it's the one day where everybody gets together and watches the game and has a good time.\nMelissa: Well, I'm from Philadelphia and Philadelphia fans of all sports are totally wild and crazy, and they just go all out, so a lot of my family members and friends go crazy about the Eagles' games.\nTodd: So have you ever been to a professional game?\nMelissa: I haven't. I haven't been to a professional football game.\nTodd: Now, what about college? Did you have a big college team?\nMelissa: No, I don't think so. We had a good basketball team at the University of Arizona - The Wildcats, but ....\nTodd: Oh, right.\nMelissa: Football, I don't really recall having a good football team.\nTodd: So when you watch the Super Bowl, usually the best part is the commercials, right? So, they have the commercials, so you watch those, don't you?\nMelissa: To be honest, I can't remember watching the Super Bowl in recent years.\nTodd: Wow!\nMelissa: Yeah.\nTodd: Here it is. I'm saying it's the biggest day of the year, and you don't remember ever seeing it?\nMelissa: I mean, I remember watching it, but they're just ...

I was moving from one house to another and as I was moving from the parking lot to my house, I saw this really skinny dog that looked like he really needed food and also affection. I petted him. He followed me back and forth. The next day, he was out in front of the gate to the house. The next day, he made it inside the house to the genkan, the area we leave our shoes. The next day, he made it to the top of the bed.\nTodd: Wow. So wait a minute. You're saying that you didn't choose your dog. Your dog kind of chose you.\nGreg: Yes. It was fate. Destiny.\nTodd: So, what's cool about your dog?\nGreg: Well, basically my dog is the world's greatest dog. I'm very unbiased. He understands English and Japanese and French. He almost never barks. He likes lots of people. He's very intelligent, sensitive human being ... ah, dog!\nTodd: So your dog speaks three languages?\nGreg: He doesn't speak them, but he understands them.\nTodd: So, can your dog do any special tricks?\nGreg: Actually, like I didn't teach him to do any tricks, but he's amazing, like I walk him for ... I can walk for miles with him. He's always by my side and I don't need a leash. No leash whatsoever. He listens to me. He stops when I tell him to stop. If I tell him to go quickly, he runs quickly.\nDog: Wow! Sounds like a pretty good dog. ... So could you live without your dog? Is your dog invaluable?\nGreg: My dog is invaluable. Actually, he's getting old now. He's thirteen years old now and I know that some day he will pass away, and when I think of that it makes me really, really sad. I dread it.\nTodd: Yeah, that would be pretty tough. ... but in the future, you know, maybe after your dog is passed away, would you get another dog?\nGreg: I think it would take me many years probably to recover from the loss of Dancer. His name is Dancer.",

I mean, I didn't see it in the Olympics. Maybe it is, but ... because people from South East Asia are so good at it and you need to have like that type of body ... very, you know, kind of light, and lean and very flexible. But for people that aren't familiar with the game, can you explain what it is?\nSanti: The ball is made from rattan and then you have to be kind of like athletic and have special talents to catch the ball with every part of your body and then you have to have self-conscious of where the balls gonna go because once like it goes fast and just times oh my god go directly into you so have to catch the ball maybe with your head or maybe with your hands or even with your chest.\nTodd: Its amazing ... an amazing sport. Actually, speaking of individual sports, what about golf. That's the ultimate individual sport.\nSanti: I want to do it but actually the equipment is pretty expensive and I don't know much about it.\nTodd: Now in your country, in Indonesia, are they many golf courses?\nSanti: Yes, they have. We have an international tournament actually in Bali. It's very good place to play golf.\nTodd: Oh, really. In Bali?\nSanti: Yes.\nTodd: So you can surf in the day, or in the morning,\nSanti: and at night you have ... kind of like relax and enjoy a message and spa.\nTodd: Wow. Sounds good.

You got nice kids?\nMarion: I have a mixuture so, but mainly they're quite good children. They're mostly very nice, but there are always going to be a few who are a bit naughty.\nTodd: So what do the naughty students do to be naughty?\nMarion: Well, in my class naughty students don't pay attention when I speak sometimes, or they talk to their friend next to them when they should be listening or writing or doing something else. I don't mind if they talk to each other about what we're doing but if they are talking about what was on TV last night so something like that I don't like it, unless they do it in English. If they can that's fine.\nTodd: Well, what do you do if your students are bad, are naughty? How do you discipline them?\nMarion: I hit them....No, I don't.\nTodd: You do not.\nMarion: I'm joking, I'm joking. Well, I have quite small classes, so it's quite easy. I'll just either call their name or walk down to their seat and if everybody is working on something, I'll talk to them about their work and see what they're doing, if they have any problems, that kind of thing and then if it gets worse, then sometimes they have to stand up, or if they are really, really naughty, and don't do any work, they'll have to come back and see me after school, and finish their work, then.\nTodd: So are you a strict teacher or a friendly teacher?\nMarion: I'm more of a friendly teacher, but with a couple of classes, I've become a strict teacher because I have to be, but mostly a friendly teacher I think.\nTodd: Who are easier to teach, the junior high students or the high school students?\nMarion: Probably the junior high because their more enthusiastic about English. They get quite excited about coming to our classes, and like I said they are small classes so it's easier and better for them to because they have more chance to speak and to use English.",

It's a good thing. I'm very close with my brothers, both of them. One of my brother's name is Michael and the other's name is Patrick and all three of us are equally close with each other.\nMari: That's good. Did you guys play the same sports growing up?\nRon: We all played the same sports growing up, however as we got older we started concentrating on our own sports, so me and Patrick played football - American football - and Michael started focusing more on soccer, but from the beginning, we all played the same sports together.\nMari: Do you guys dress the same?\nRon: We are very similar in how we think so we do wear each other's clothes and so we do dress alike.\nMari: Have you ever walked out wearing similar shirts or the same outfit?\nRon: Yes, we have and for the most part we try to wear the same colors if we're together going out. \nMari: Did you get in trouble growing up all of you?\nRon: I think for the most part we were good kids growing up and the good thing about being very close to your brothers is that you never wanted to dissapoint your brothers or make them think bad of you, so you always tried to be a good kid.\nMari: What's cool about being a triplet?\nRon: I would say the coolest thing about being a triplet is just having people that are very close to you all the time. We never really had trouble making friends or when I to a new school, I always had a friend with me because my brothers were always with me. It was never ... I was never alone.\nMari: That's pretty cool. Was there anything not cool about being a triplet?\nRon: Well, growing up the attention is not so cool sometimes. It gets kinds of old and the questions about being a triplet gets kind of old, but for the most part it's good.",

        "transcript": "Mari: Hi, I'm Mari, I'm here with Ron. Today, we're going to debate about if it's better to sit in the front of the class or in the back of the class, so I'm going to start. I always sat front-row-and-center in all of my classes all throughout my education, and I think that it's a lot better to sit in the front of the class because teachers and professors know your name. I feel like the teacher is always looking at me so I stay focused, so I think that's why I sat in the front of the class or I think it's important to sit in the front of the class.\nRon: Well, Mari, I believe that it's not necessarily better to sit in the front of the class because all students aredifferent. Some students will be overwhelmed by the pressure of having the teacher stand right in front of them, talking to them, and they'll forget about taking notes or forget about concentrating and only worry about having the pressure of the teacher standing right in front of them, so in that case, it's good for students to sit in the back of the class so that they can relax and make sure that their mind is free so they can learn what the teacher is saying.\n                              \nMari: But are you really learning in the back of the class? Are you focused in the back of the class?\nRon: Yes, you are focused because you're relaxed and you can make sure that the pressure of not having the teacher in front of you doesn't overwhelm so that you can go at your own pace.\nMari: But I don't feel pressure from my professor. I think it's more pressure that I put on myself. But I think that the kids or the students that sit in the back of the class are never really paying attention. They're always just kind of talking amongst themselves.\nRon: And usually, I think they're talking about the subject of the class, so that is even... that's another strong point about sitting in the back of the class. You don't have to interrupt the class and you can just ask your friend quietly on the side if you're unclear about something.\nMari: I think it's better to sit n the front of the class because I think you're able to develop a relationship with a teacher. If I look confused maybe they'll re-explain something or it's a lot easier for me ask questions. I think that maybe teachers think that if sit in the back of the class, they don't really like you.... like the teacher.\nRon: That may be true sometimes, but in my experience it was a lot more comfortable for me to sit in the back of the class with my friends and we could feed off each other, and we could ask each other questions to make sure that we understand the subject, so I think sometimes in class it's more important that you be comfortable than it is to be uncomfortable, but try to impress the teacher.\nMari: I see your point, but I disagree.",

I mean, what I meant, you can find a lot of people who can speak English there.\nBrian: Oh, so because of the games many people are learning English ... but I could still ... even if I didn't go during that time, English people are still around.\nFanny: Right, right exactly. If you go to the shops most people there can already speak English, Japanese or Korean.\nBrian: Oh really?\nFanny: Yeah, so ...\nBrian: Very talented people in your country.\nFanny: Yeah, we can say that.",

So if you wanna go to China I think the best season should be summer.\nBrian: Summertime.\nFanny: Summertime. \nBrian: OK, so maybe like June or July is a good time?\nFanny: I think July is the best time to go, because August there will be a lot of tourists there ... so July will be the best time because you can see the best view and there will not be that crowded.\nBrian: Now does it rain a lot in July? I've heard there's, like, rainy seasons?\nFanny: In the north part ... it doesn't rain that much but in the south part it does.\nBrian: So I should probably bring an umbrella and a raincoat?\nFanny: Oh yeah, I think so.\nBrian: OK.\nFanny: Which city do you want to visit?\nBrian: Well that's actually a good question. You know I've never been to China and I don't know so much about it. What would be the most interesting place that you can recommend?\nFanny: It depends on what kind of view you want to see, what kind of ... you know, especially in the north part, there are a lot of historical cities like Beijing, Xian you can visit. You can see the old China because there are other ... for example there is the Summer Palace. Have you ever heard of that? \nBrian: I've heard of it but I don't actually know what it is.\nFanny: Yeah, it's just a palace which the old Chinese king lived there. It's a very good place to visit because you can see the long history you know because China has a long history, so you can see that kind of thing.\nBrian: So this is a pretty popular tourist place ...\nFanny: Very popular. And also there is the Great Wall in Beijing \nBrian: Ah, I do know the Great Wall, I've heard of that one.\nFanny: Yeah, so I think a lot of foreigners are very interested in the Great Wall, so maybe you can go there and see ...\nBrian: OK, that sounds pretty good ...\nFanny: .. then maybe you don't need the umbrella then\nBrian: Fair enough.",

Have you ever actually ever lived on a farm?\nMonica: I haven't lived on a farm as such, but I've visited family friends who have lived on farms.\nTodd: Did you like it?Monica: Yeah, I remember loving visiting my family friends on farms. Yeah, especially riding horses. I loved riding horses when I was young.Todd: So are you good? Are you an equestrian professional?Monica: I wouldn't say that. I do remember one time. My mother always seems to tell people this story about when I was young, and we were at her friend's farm. I was on a horse, and the horse took off, and I was only about, I think ten at the time and I was hanging off the side of this horse and my mother was really worried for me, and then when the horse finally stopped she ... you know ... she came running up and asked me if I was OK and things, and apparently I said to her, \"Oh, it's OK. I wanted it to go fast.\"Todd: That's cute. You're lucky you didn't get hurt though.Monica: Yeah, well, I guess I just didn't sense the danger.Todd: Actually, I kind of grew up on a farm. My grandfather had a ranch growing up so I spend every summer on his ranch, so I have quite the ... I don't know ... I guess I have a lot of experience on a farm. Yeah, it's good. I remember when I was young I thought the life on a farm was just the best. I mean I had it so good, and I loved everything about living on a farm and I thought when I was gonna get older, I would want to be on a farm, but now that I'm older, I couldn't image doing it every again.Monica: What can't you imagine doing?Todd: I don't know, I guess, I just couldn't imagine all that work, and I think I'm just so addicted to city life or suburban life and living in a house and just doing work on computers and things like that. I couldn't go back to that lifestyle, but when I was young, I have to admit, I enjoyed it a lot. So how about you? Could you see yourself moving and living on a farm?Monica: Well, yeah, I think my thoughts are similar to yours in that I'm very used to being inside using a computer, and I'm used to a very different lifestyle to one that involves being on a farm, but yeah, I've never had a long period of time where I've stayed on a farm like you so yeah maybe it's a bit different for me.",

What are three or four places that you must see in New Zealand?Monica: Oh, OK, three or four places you must see. Well, it depends what you're looking for really. I think a lot of people that come to New Zealand enjoy an outdoor lifestyle, so there's lots of outdoor activities and places you can go to to enjoy in New Zealand. Personally, I find the South Island of New Zealand very scenic in comparison to the North Island, so for me, a must-do is the West Coast of the South Island. It's very pretty.Todd: The West Coast.Monica: Yeah. In particular, there's two glaciers. Franz Joseph and Fox Glaciers, which are very stunning to look at, and you can either have a look at them by foot, or you can pay for a helicopter ride that takes you up and shows you an ariel view of them.Todd: Now, do people ever walk across the glaciers?Monica: There are guides that can walk you across. Yeah, I haven't done it personally, but it is possible.Todd: So what else would you recommend for New Zealand? What other places should people see?Monica: I think if you want to see ... let me think ... rural New Zealand. It's quite a nice idea to drive the length of the country and then you can see the interesting farming that is taking place, in particular in the South Island. The lower part of the South Island, and a lot of the North Island as well. There's a lot of sheep in New Zealand and there's a lot of cattle as well, so I think it's interesting to go for a drive to see that firsthand.Todd: So, you just start up in Auckland in the north and drive all the way down south?Monica: Yeah, well, there's many ways you can do it, but I recommend one way of doing it is too arrive in Auckland and to have an experience of a big city, well a big city for New Zealand, and then drive down the center of the North Island and maybe have a farming experience somewhere. There's a lot of farm stay opportunities available for tourists who come to New Zealand, so depending on how you do it. You might want to stay two or three days with a family and experience a farming lifestyle. So that's, yeah, one thing I'd recommend. And another is to maybe go to a city like Rotorua which is really in the center of the North Island, and experience Maori culture. There's a Maori village there near the Whakarewarewa forest which hosts a lot of tourists, and you get to experience Maori waiata which is Maori songs and you get to see the hot springs in New Zealand and thermal mud pools, so, yeah, Rotorua is a nice city to go and visit, and then work your way down to the capital of New Zealand which is Wellington, and I think if you want to experience the cafe lifestyle of New Zealand that's a good place to go.",

One time when I was in Bangkok, I met a guy and he was doing Tai Chi and he looked really young, but he said the secret to his old life ... he said the secret to looking young, was Tai Chi and cold showers. He took a cold shower every morning.\nMonica: Oh, wow!\nTodd: Could you do that?Monica: No, I don't think I could actually.Todd: Yeah, you know, I actually tried it for awhile and I tried it for about a week and I did feel so energized and it was easy in Bangkok, cause it's really warm but I couldn't keep it up, especially not that I'm in the cold climate. There's no way.Monica: Yeah, I remember when I was young, my mother used to teach me to splash my face with cold water in the morning because she believed that helped wake you up, and I remember as a child not liking that at all because I found it too cold. I preferred to splash my face with warm water.Todd: So, have you heard about any other secrets to having a long life?Monica: Yeah, I've heard of quite a few different secrets to having a long life. I guess one secret that a lot of different cultural groups seem to share is diet. If you take the Japanese as an example, and Japanese people do have a long life expectancy in comparison to other people from ofher countries. I think the Japanese eat a diet that's quite low in fat and reasonably low in salt as well, and I think their fluid intake is quite healthy because they drink a lot of green tea which has antioxidants in it, and a they drink a lot of miso soup which has a lot of vegetables in it, and is made from fermented barley, so I think that's very healthy.Todd: I've also heard that people in the Mediterranean, they also often have a long life span in certain regions and maybe the combination of wine, just a little wine, not too much, but wine and olive oil, and then a lot of fish, seafood is also maybe beneficial to a long life.Monica: Yeah, that's true. I've heard French people for example live a long life and that has often been said due to a glass of red wine a day, and I know people think differently about alcohol and it's affect on the body these days. Todd: Right.Monica: Yeah, because alcohol used to be considered quite a bad thing and discouraged in all forms but now people tend to think that a glass a day is actually quite beneficial to your health.Todd: I've also actually heard that laughter, that people that laugh a lot tend to live longer.Monica: Yeah, I've heard that too, actually, because laughing releases natural endorphins, and I think that helps you physiologically, and also I think psychologically you're happier if laughing so. Yeah, I think that long life is related to how you are feeling, and I think a lot of it is psychological as well as physical, for example, how much you are eating and what types of food you're eating.Todd: Yeah, I guess, I'm kind of in the same boat, but I just don't know if I laugh that much. Maybe I'm in trouble.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Monica, you do Tai Chi?\nMonica: Yes, I've just joined a Tai Chi club?\nTodd: What made you join the Tai Chi club?Monica: Well, I wanted to do something that was a lot different to what I usually do, which is high impact sports like basketball and tennis.Todd: So, you wanted to do something that was slower?Monica: Yeah, well, I don't usually enjoy exercise that is quite slow such as yoga, but I decided to join this club and I'm really enjoying it.Todd: So, what exactly is Tai Chi? What do you do in Tai Chi?Monica: Well, there are different types of Tai Chi. There's the original Tai Chi which involves quick fast movements, and then there's a slower form of Tai Chi which is quite popular in Japan. I think it's called Mr. Young Tai Chi, and that involves very slow pronounced movements, and that's the Tai Chi that I'm doing.Todd: How do you feel? Like after you do Tai Chi, do you feel tired? Do you feel energetic?Monica: After I've done Tai Chi I feel quite energetic actually. I don't really feel tired because I haven't had a really hard workout, but I feel that my mind is very relaxed and focused and that I'm very motivated to do whatever I need to do for the rest of the day.Todd: Now, you actually are a tennis coach, so you teach sports. Would you recommend Tai Chi for other athletes?Monica: Yeah, I do recommend Tai Chi for other athletes. It's quite difficult to know exactly how you would benefit from Tai Chi, and how it can directly relate a specific sport, but I've heard that it works on your energy levels, and focuses your mind so that everything is in balance, and I think that can help in kind of sport because even in a sport like tennis, it's important to have balance when you're hitting the ball, when you're volleying, when you're getting ready for a smash. It actually involves having balance in terms of where your center of gravity is, so yeah, the concepts are similar.",

        "transcript": "Jess: OK, so Tom, I've told you all about my beauty regime. You look very well groomed. Could you tell me what do you do to keep yourself looking good?\nTom: Well, thank you Jess. I mean this look is the product of many stages of evolution. When I was a teenager, I had long hair pulled back in a pony-tail, but at that time I wasn't growing a beard yet so I did get mistaken for a girl, so since then I've had short hair. There have been some periods when I've been traveling and when I'm traveling I don't like to bother too much about grooming, and my beard has started to grow, and it was a couple of years back that I went back to my job after traveling. I didn't have time to shave, and my colleagues and students saw me with a full beard, and to be honest they weren't as rude as I thought there were going to be, and I thought well maybe this looks good, so I thought I'd keep that. The beard lasted perhaps a year and then it began disappearing and appearing according to my whim and now I've settled on a goatee which is where I shave my cheeks and underneath my chin, but I keep the mustache and and beard around my mouth. I've never grown sideburns because I'm a little embarrassed to say, I've never managed to get the connection between my beard and my hair. There's a little gap just by my ears which never has quite grown hair, so that's where we got to where we are today.\nJess: And have you ever removed hair from, waxed or shaved or any other part method from any other part of your body?Tom: Do you mean my legs? No, I have never shaved my legs. I'm not a very hairy guy, but I just don't feel comfortable with men shaving their legs. A friend at university was a cyclist and he always shaved his legs and I thought it was strange because ... I mean, seriously, is wind resistance that important that you need to shave you legs to get the extra bit of speed on a bicycle, but he explained to me, \"No\", it's to do with evening after cycling and you have to get a sports massage and a massage is much easier if you don't have hair on your legs. I always thought it was about wind resistance, but I was completely wrong.Jess: So, it sounds like in comparison to mine your beauty regime is very simple.",

I have highlights which is one color. They take small strands of the hair and color that so overall it looks like it's more sunkissed, like it's bleached in the sun. But then I also get a low-light put through it, which is less harmful to the hair and gives more volume to the color if you have two colors, and that takes a long time to do. They wrap the hair they're going to color in foil and it takes about half an hour for it to take effect and during that time they put a big ... I don't know how to describe it really. It's like a big helmut which releases hot air onto your hair, which speed up the process of the coloring, so it's quite long and drawn out. I usually get through two or three magazines while that's happening. And then they wash out all of the color, and I have a treatment to protect the hair because the color often makes it dry, so the colors kinds of ... the treatments nourishing and moisturizing and they leave that on for about twenty minutes again so usually I fall asleep at that point, and then they'll rinse your hair and then cut it and style it so anything between two and a half and four hours, so much more complex and longer than you're half-an-hour short-back and sides. \nYeah, I have a whole monthly beauty regime. I also go and get my nails done and I have a manicure and a pedicure simultaneously to save time. And I love that. It always feels decedent to have one person working on your hands and another scrubbing away at your feet, and sometimes I'll have like a matching polish which always makes me feel good. What else do I have done every month? I try to go for a massage and a facial once a month. At the moment, I'm doing like a workout regime so I'm working out every day, so my muscles are aching a lot, especially when I stand up and sit down, so I'm going for special ... what's the word ... ayurvedic. I'm not sure what the right word is: special massage where they really push down on your muscles and then I have a facial afterwards. Yeah, I think that's about it. I think that's enough, no!Tom: Well, I don't envy all that time you spend! But you do look great.",

        "transcript": "Tom: Jess, I love hearing you talk about the different cities, you've been working in. Were they all very expensive places to live?\nJess: No, they weren't all expensive. The first city I lived in when I moved away from Britain was Budapest in Hungary, and when I lived there it was before Hungary had joined the Euro, so the currency was still the Hungarian forint and most things were really cheap compared to Britain. \nThere were things that were expensive there, I think especially for tourists or for people who the taxi drivers perceived as being tourists. After I had lived there for awhile kind of knew how much certain journeys should cost and I was very surprised at how often the taxi drivers would double that as soon as they realized I wasn't Hungarian, but overall Budapest was a cheap city. I'm not sure if that's the case now. It uses the Euro, but then it was cheap and very good fun. After Budapest, I went to Madrid, and that was a bit more expensive than Budapest, definitely. Rent was certainly more expensive and a large proportion on my monthly salary went on rent but other things like eating out, supermarket shopping, clothes shopping, they were still quite a lot of choices that wasn't too expensive. The high street shops were about the same price as in Britain, but eating out there was cheap. Again, beauty services in Madrid - haircuts - I think they must be expensive all over the world cause they were really expensive in Madrid as well.So, you've told me about Tokyo and Bangkok, where else have you lived Tom? Tom: I had a short contract working in North Africa in Tripoli in Libya and rent was taken care of and I almost paid nothing while I was there and I was able to send seventy or eighty percent of my salary home to England to my savings account. Travel around Tripoli by these little minivans was a quarter of a dinar and food was a little bit more expensive but I could live on a very small amount of money each month and of course tripoli is right on the Mediterranean so on my days off I could go to the beach very easily. The weather was always fantastic. It was an interesting place to live and the currency in Libya are these beautiful huge bank notes that you have to fold several times to put into your wallet. It was a really satisfying to have a fist full of those in your pocket.Jess: Oh, it sounds fantastic. I'd love to go there.",

        "transcript": "Jess: So, Tom, I was reading in the newspaper this morning, and I noticed a story which said that Tokyo and Osaka are now the most expensive cities to live in. I remember you told me you used to live in Tokyo. Was that your experience of living there?\nTom: That's right. Tokyo was really expensive. I am so pleased that now I live in Bangkok. Living here is fantastic. My apartment - I have this lovely beautiful big apartment and the rent is a good deal. Thai food is famous all over the world and actually when you come to Thailand, you realize how cheap the food is and how available it is. You can buy food - every kind of food from any shop or restaurant - even on the street. They have street stalls where people cooking. They have people walking up and down the street pushing carts full of food and it's all really cheap and delicious. I like to go shopping in Bangkok. There's a lot of clothes and shoes and bags. The prices are really low and it's this lovely feeling being able to walk around and afford things. Did you know in Tokyo the most surprising expensive thing was getting a hair cut. I don't go much for expensive hair cuts and it used to kill me how much I had to pay just to get someone to chop off my scruffy locks. I know you've lived in Europe mostly. What was your experience? What was the most expensive place in Europe?\nJess: Well, I've lived in three European cities: Budapest, Madrid and Paris and of the three Paris was definitely the most expensive. The things that stands out in my mind as being the most expensive were beauty services. Things like hair cuts, hair coloring, facials, waxing. I actually had to save and budget every month to make sure I was able to afford in Paris the the things I was used to getting without thinking about back home in Britain, but not every thing was expensive there. Beauty services were and rent was but the wine, brilliant French wine, was really cheap and there was a huge variety, so in that way, I guess it balanced itself out.",

        "transcript": "Enam: Katia, what are the environmental problems in your country?\nKatia: Well, I can think of three problems. One is water drought. The scarcity of water. Second, we have a lot of air pollution, and third a lot of deforestation.\nEnam: OK, so can you tell me about deforestation in your country?Katia: Well, Mexico is big and we have areas that have a lot of trees, but unfortunately many factories have been moving into that area in particular and they take down the trees. That has been happening for so long that the areas have increased and because of that a lot of indigenous are displaced as well as a lot the animals have died or it has decreased so unfortunately that has been a big problem in certain parts of Mexico, but then of course there are some things that are being done. For example, the government has placed certain areas that are to remain untouched and also they are bringing more trees in certain areas and planting them and hopefully it will bring the green area back to where it was before.Enam: Really, that's good. But how bad is the water scarcity problem?Katia: Well, water scarcity I think is one of the major problems Mexico has. For example, I can just talk about Mexico city. Mexico City was built on top of a lake and we Mexicans have been using the water from the lake to supply out water needs but this has been going on for so long that we basically use all the water that was left and now we trying to figure out where to bring water from. This is a big problem that Mexico faces. We don't have many wells that we can get water from. And unfortunately also a big problem is with the piping system a lot of lakes and actually a big percentage of our water is lost through leaks. What is being done about that problem? Well, first, they're fixing the pipes. That's a basic way to start. Also, we are only allowed to use water certain days of the week to water our garden or wash our trees or wash our cars and so yeah, and I think the Mexicans are becoming more conscious on how to use water, so I think hopefully that will help with the water scarcity problem.Enam: And what about air pollution? Katia: Well, actually we also have the air pollution problem, and if you go to Mexico, if it's any day of the week, from Monday to Friday, it's very hard to see the sun. It's always very cloudy. Your skin becomes very dirty actually, and it's very hard to breathe because of the high contamination. There are many cars: too many cars that is really hard to breathe, and you can tell that also by sun. Saturday and Sunday. you can actually see the sun because a lot of the people are not driving since it's the weekend, and also it was said that you could measure the pollution of Mexico City by counting how many dead birds you can find on the streets because of the high contamination, but yeah unfortunately a very bad situation however Mexico has put some rules that if you have a car, you can only drive on certain days of the week, and that anytime so hopefully that has ... that will help in the future to prevent much more contamination and of course there are other things that have been done. There are more parks to help with the pollution, but yeah, I think this is the main thing they have done regarding the transportation. Just preventing people from driving as much as they want.",

How is Mexico City in terms of real estate, landscape?Katia: Well, Mexico City is one of the biggest cities in the world and it's in a valley, so it actually had to stop growing even though it has a big population, but basically there was no room. It was surrounded by mountains so the actual structure of the city is not very well designed but however we can all fit there and somewhat live comfortably.Enam: What about the people there?Katia: What do you mean, what about the people?Enam: Like how are they? Are they cordial enough? Katia: Well, I think in every big city there's always a tendency to have some kind of survival skills. When there's a lot of people, you have to make sure you're the first one to get in the bus, the first one in line, so there's a little bit of that feeling. However, everybody's, most everyone is kind and they will be helpful, so there's all kinds of people. It's a big city so it's very hard to say.Enam: Really, tell me about the transportation system?Katia: Transportation system? Well, we have a Metro. We have bus, taxis, but it is quite bad. It's too many people in a small space, so yes you can get around but it's better to live close to your work and just move in one particular area otherwise it will take you a long, long time to get from one place to another.Enam: Really, that's common like to our place. And do you enjoy shopping in Mexico City?Katia: Ah, shopping! There's a lot of shopping in Mexico City, especially for the last few years. Big Malls have been constructed and especially the young generation like shopping and inside the shopping malls there's always movie theaters, so shopping is very, very popular in Mexico City.Enam: Really. Do you go to theaters more often, like in Mexico City? Katia: Actually, it's a part of the culture. Every weekend, movie theater, or a theater ... you go to a theater to watch a show so it's very common. That's part of the culture of the Mexicans in Mexico City. There's always things to see.Enam: Is there any difference between the food you eat in Mexico City like commonly, and the food you like outside the city?Katia: Well, definitely yes. Mexico City is so big, and the people that live in Mexico City came from the rural areas or other cities from Mexico City so in regards to food, variety is wide. There's many things ... that I go back to Mexico City and there's always something new that I haven't tried, so it's very interesting the food, and it also ... we have food that backs to the Mayas or the Aztecs time that Mexicans have been able to keep it and we still eat it.",

It's my iPod touch and it is fantastic. I often take long bus journeys at the weekend and on this little electronic storage machine with screen I can watch a movie and that's just ... makes bus journeys fly by. It also has wireless internet so I can carry it around and in a coffee shop I can check my e-mail and it has the added function of being able to play music, although I don't listen to music much. That's one. My iPod touch is with me all the time. It's kind of connected to my number 2. Number 2 is the internet. I couldn't live without the internet. I'm online every day - reading newpapers, checking out information about things I want to do and see that day. Keeping in touch with family and friends, although I don't do that as much as they would like. The internet is such a huge part of my life. I can't imagine what it was like ten or fifteen years ago, when nobody was online. Number three, I suppose is the sun, which sounds a bit facile because everything on the whole planet requires the sun, but for me it's not so much about the nutrition that plants and animals derive from the sun. It's just being able to lie and relax in the soft warmth, tanning by the pool letting my mind empty and clear. Those are my three. How about you?\nJess: Well, I have to agree with your second one, definitely the Internet is one thing couldn't live without either, for the same reasons you mentioned, really, just to stay in touch with people for things like reading the news, checking my e-mail, finding phone numbers, getting information. I really couldn't live without it. The second thing would be my family. I couldn't live without them. I think since I've moved away from Britain and I don't live close to them, and I don't see them regularly anymore, I've grown to love them even more. Kind of you don't realize what you've until it's gone, and that was true with my family. I really miss them all the time, and I love going back to see them, so they're my number two, and my number three would be music. Music's a huge part of my life and I think I remember things by what I was listening to at the time. I'll remember periods of my life by what's songs I was listening to or what album i bought, so for me my memories are very much brought back to me by music, so those are my three things: the Internet, my family, and music.",

        "transcript": "Tom: Jess, usually when I see you, you're sitting at the computer checking your e-mail. How many times a day do you check it?\nJess: I honestly don't count, but many, many times. Definitely more than twenty times a day. It's not really necessary. It's not like I have millions of e-mails coming into my account every day, but I'm very impatient and I hate waiting for responses or waiting for something that I'm expecting so I'll check my e-mail so that I can receive it as soon as it's sent. How about you? Do you check your e-mails often?\nTom: I suppose I check once a day, and if I have any mail, it will be one or two weeks before I reply to it. I'm really bad at keeping in touch. I've got accounts at facebook and my space and hi5, all these social networking sites, but I almost never log on and people .... I got a message the other day, a friend telling me, I'm a boring facebooker. It's official because I haven't updated my profile in so long.Jess: Why don't you? Is it that you haven't got enough time?Tom: I have got so much free time. I think it's just because I'm very lazy. I take photos. I meet people. I do things. I just don't feel the need to tell everyone about it at the end of the day. My family have kind of gotten used to it now. They know that I'll get in contact they'll likely to see me in the next few months, or I'll get in contact if there's a birthday or a baby, but apart from that, I really don't keep in touch very well.Jess: Apart from e-mail, neither do I. I did join Facebook a couple of years ago when all of my friends did and everyone was sending me links to join, and I created my profile, but to be honest, it's too much for me to have more than one thing to check that many times a day, so usually I stick to e-mail for communication. Yes, I do check it a lot, but I think if I started checking Facebook as regularly, I wouldn't have time to do the things I need to every day.",

What do you mean?\nChristophe: Well, actually, next week I am going to run a marathon in Switzerland, so right now I'm going alone all by myself. I have nobody to go with me, so I was thinking maybe you would like to go with me. Join me, so I'm not alone.Aiste: Oh, next week, yes, we have a holiday and actually I was thinking I have no plans for this holiday. And Switzerland, that sounds like a wonderful country. How are we going to get there?Christophe: Well, I was thinking of taking the train from Brussels, so we just take the train around eight o'clock in the evening, and when we arrive there in the morning, we can have a nice sleep during the night on the train and, well, just next morning we are there.Aiste: Oh, that sounds great. Definitely. Can you tell me more about the marathon? What type of marathon it is, and how are you planning to do that?Christophe: Well, actually, it's a mountain marathon. It's quite interesting. It's not just like a flat marathon. It goes from 500 meter altitude to 2,300 meters altitude, so the finish is close to a glacier. It's really very impressive. I think you will like it.Aiste: Oh, that sounds really difficult. Are you sure, you're prepared for that?Christophe: Oh, yeah, I prepared three months for this marathon. I put a lot of work into it. It was a lot of training, so I think I will be fine, but what about you? Will you run it too?Aiste: No, no no no. NO way. I don't think I can run the marathon, but I suppose in Switzerland they should have some kind of elavator or funicular to get up the mountain. Can I see you reaching the glacier happy?Christophe: Well, actually, they organized some special trains for supporters of the runners, so if you join me, you can just buy a train ticket, jump on the train, and see me running while you are taking the train. It's a perfect combination or tourism and supporting me at the same time.Aiste: Oh, that sounds really great. Let's do that.",

Christophe: I don't care. I love running in the rain, and I have to run because I am training for a marathon.Aiste: A marathon! Isn't that like some 100 kilometers of running?Christophe: Oh, no. A marathon is a race where you run 42 kilometers. It's a long distance, so you need to train every day for it.Aiste: So do you actually run 42 kilometers every day when training for it?Christophe: Oh, no. Actually, a good preparation for a marathon is about 12 weeks of running, and you never run for 42 kilometers in one training. You never do this because it's actually very, very bad for your body if you would do that, so you run a maximum, like 32 to 34 kilometers.Aiste: Every day?Christophe: Not every day of course. I think, right now, I run about 80 kilometers a week, but that's almost every day, 10, 15 kilometers that you have to run.Aiste: And how many marathons have you done already?Christophe: I've already ran about four marathons, and now I'm preparing for my fifth marathon.Aiste: What is that going to be like?Christophe: Well, actually, I hope to run less than three hours. It's quite fast. It's like fourteen kilometers average during forty-two kilometers.Aiste: Whoa! That sounds difficult. I'm not really into sports very much, so I think for me, even a five-minutes run seems kind of difficult and requiring lots of endurance.Christophe: Well, in the beginning, it's hard maybe, but once you try running a little bit longer, you really start liking it, so I would recommend you to do one training with me and you start slow and then you build up slowly until you can run five, maybe ten kilometers, and then you will see, you will get addicted and you will love it too. I think in a couple of years, you will run your first marathon.Aiste: Oh, that sounds great, but ... I really don't think it's for me.",

I couldn't believe the first night I had this really good dish with the shrimp and vegetables and it only cost about three or four US dollars, so it was really cheap.Tu: Two dollars.Todd: Yeah, so good.Tu: Did you go to Mui Ne?Todd: Yeah, I did. I went to Mui Ne and ...Tu: How was it?Todd: It was good. I mean, I went there actually to surf. I heard it had really good waves but I was there during the wrong season, I guess, so I didn't surf, but they had this ...Tu: Why?Todd: Well, the waves were just ... there were no waves.Tu: Oh, really?Todd: Yeah, there were none.Tu: OK.Todd: But I saw the sandunes, and I was quite impressed.Tu: The sand dunes. Yes, it is Mui Ne famous for.Todd: I mean, it looks like you're in the Sahara Desert or in Africa.Tu: Really?Todd: Yeah, they're so big, and some places, when you stand, all you can see is the sand, like, you can't see anything else. It's pretty amazing.Tu: Mm! It looks so beautiful.Todd: It is. It is really beautiful. Tu: I love it too.Todd: And then the last day, I went to Nha Trang. Am I saying that right? Nha Trang.Tu: Nha Trang.Todd: Nha Trang.Tu: Oh , yeah. The famous beach.Todd: Yes, and that actually surprised me because Ho Chi Min was very old and very gritty and crowded and Mui Ne was kind of a very small traditional beach village, and then, Nha Trang was like this big city. It's like Waikiki in Hawaii. It was like a resort. Tu: Yeah, yeah, it's very beautiful and like high quality.Todd: Right, exactly.Tu: High quality.Todd: Exactly. I couldn't believe it. And I got a really great hotel, right on the beach, over-looking the ocean, third floor for only ten dollars a night.Tu: Ten dollars?Todd: Yeah.Tu: Nice price.Todd: So, I was very impressed. And you know, the food was good, and it was nice.Tu: Did you get to go to Hanoi?Todd: I didn't because I only had seven days, so you're from Hanoi right?Tu: Yes, I'm from Hanoi.Todd: Yeah, I should go there. I did like Vietnam a lot. I do want to go back, so hopefully, I can go back and go to Hanoi next time.Tu: Next time I will be your tour guide.Todd: Oh, thanks Tu. That would be great.",

What was the most thing ... what was the thing you remembered most about Vietnam?Todd: Well, there's lots of things to remember, maybe too many, it was just great, but I think one thing I thought was special was a haircut. This guy cut my hair on the street, and I had never had that happen before, you know, get my haircut on the street.Tu: Tell me about it?Todd: Well, I was at a cafe, a beautiful little garden cafe on the corner, and .... oh, by the way, your country has amazing coffee.Tu: Really, you think so?Todd: Ah, the coffee was so good.Tu: Yeah, we love it.Todd: So, anyway, so I come out of the cafe, and there's this guy and he has a chair and a mirror under a tree and he's motioning with his scissors for me to come over.Tu: I see. It's a very common thing in Vietnam.Todd: Really, to have barbers on the street?Tu: Barber on the street with the tree and one mirror, one chair only.Todd: Oh, really.Tu: Yeah, common thing.Todd: So, it seems pretty unique, so I talk to him and he was trying to convince me to get a haircut and I didn't know how much.Tu: Did you speak English?Todd: He didn't speak any English, and embarrassingly I didn't even know numbers in Vietnamese. I didn't know anything, so I just held out my money, and he pointed to how much the hair cut would cost, and it was quite cheap. I couldn't believe it. I think he only wanted to charge me two dollars.Tu: Two dollars?Todd: Yeah.Tu: It's normal though.Todd: That's the normal price? And then he sat down and he started cutting my hair.Tu: How was it?Todd: It was amazing. Like he had all these little tools. He had these little metal tools I had never seen before, and he was cutting my hair and moving about and he was very professional. You could tell ...Tu: Were you scared?Todd: No, I wasn't really scared. I thought that maybe, he might chop up my hair, but in actuality, the man was incredibly professional, really really good. Very skilled at his job, and I thought he did a fantastic job on my hair and he also did things that we don't get like in the states, like he cut my hair and then he shaved of course and then he took out this ear cleaner, these like stuff, and he cleaned my ears.Tu: Oh, I see.Todd: Yeah, that doesn't happen in America.Tu: Everyone does that.Todd: Oh, wow, like it's interesting, cause like in Thailand, I lived in Thailand for many years and what they do it, they massage your head.Tu: Really?Todd: Yeah, and it's really nice, so when you get a haircut, they massage your head, but I guess in Vietnam, it's they clean your ears.Tu: Yes, now that you talk about it, I think it's only unique to Vietnamese barber.Todd: So only Vietnamese barber's clean your ears?Tu: I think so.",

I mean, kids on the university campus were selling their old clothes and stuff and I got this very nice winter jacket for about 50 cents.\nTodd: 50 cents?Melissa: Yes.Todd: Wow!Melissa: Yeah. It's right there. That one. It's green.Todd: That's a nice jacket!Melissa: Thanks.Todd: I like the price. Like, they said, \"nope\" - 75 cents - too much. 25 cents - too cheap. Now did you actually haggle for 50 cents?Melissa: No, now that jacket was actually that price, but some other kids at a different spot on the same site were doing a game where you shoot down things with this kind of play gun and get points and then depending on how many points you got, you could choose from a different group of stuff. So, I was shooting for a CD-Stereo, but I ended up only getting a jacket and and a hat and some accessories like a watch and a necklace. Yeah, so that was kind of disappointing cause I ended up walking away with a bunch of stuff I didn't want or need. That was good on their behalf. I thought that was good sales tactic, cause I thought I was playing a game and I was enjoying shooting stuff down and getting points but then I realized I was acquiring these things I didn't need.",

I'm trying to get more involved in community events. There's a flea market this weekend.\nTodd: A flea market?Melissa: Yes.Todd: Oh, yeah.Melissa: At the beachside, and there's going to be lots of different eco-friendly stuff going on there, so it's kind of a mix of a reuse, resell your old stuff. Get new stuff for cheap.Todd: OK, so for people who might not be familiar with the term flea market, can you explain?Melissa: A flea market is basically a place where people can take old clothes, old utensils, forks, spoons, knives, things like that from the kitchen, and other housewares either sell them or give them away at a cheap price, and it's fun because the customers ... a lot of them like to come and look at all the different stuff and even maybe haggle some prices, so try to get you to give a lower price, or if you're trying to get rid of a lot of stuff you might try to get the customer to take two things for the price of one. Things like that. Todd: Yeah, right. Like when I was a kid I used to always go to flea marts, or flea markets with my grandparents, and what I thought was great is that you can haggle.Melissa: Yeah.Todd: Right? Cause in the U.S. you can't haggle at a store.Melissa: Yeah, exactly. And I like doing that when I'm travelling ... haggling. Trying to get a good deal, so it's fun to do it at a flea market when you're selling your own stuff.Todd: So, this weekend, are you selling or buying?Melissa: Well, I actually don't have that much stuff to sell cause I've recently moved so I've gotten rid of a lot of stuff I don't need, but I do plan bring some old pieces of clothing and things like that that I want to get rid of, and yeah, I'm really into flea markets and old thrift stores and stuff like that, so I just like to see what people have.

Do you and your partner hold hands when you go out in the street?\nNick: We hold hands all the time. Initially, we ... when we first went out, holding hands was the first thing we did, and then progressively moved on from there to kissing, but holding hands was certainly the first thing we did in our relationship.\nCheryl: Do you remember when you first tried to hold her hand, or did she try to hold your hand first?Nick: I made the first move. We were sitting on the couch watching a movie, and I was getting a bit nervous, and I couldn't quite concentrate on the movie, so I moved my hand over to hers, and she reciprocated, and it moved on from there, so ...Cheryl: You know, that's funny that you bring that up because on of the most common moves that is made fun of in movies as well is when the guy takes a big yawn, a fake yawn, and he opens his arms wide and places it around the girl's shoulder, and thus embraces her, but he had to do it because he yawned.Nick: My experience, like my first hug was like that as well, so it was just a bit of an excuse for us reaching for something, and then suddenly my hand went around, and she didn't mind so.Cheryl: That's very good. And what about kissing? Do you kiss a lot in public, in the streets? Nick: Rarely in public, cause we find it makes other people uncomfortable.Cheryl: Yeah, that's true. I find that when I see couples kissing, or making out in public, I usually think to myself, Why don't you get a room?Nick: Yeah, you don't want to see that. You just want to be having a conversation with them or ... you don't want them to be constantly distracted.",

And also let's say one thing that I don't like is that cities are too big, you know, and if you get lost, if you travel to Bogot·, it's huge so I don't like cities in Colombia because they're so big, they're huge and you get lost.Katia: What about in Ecuador? Quito, is it also a big city?Felipe: Well it is a big city but it's not as big as Bogot·. If you think, you can travel from the south to the north in a couple of hours, maybe two hours, it's not that huge as Bogot·.Katia: That is so interesting. What about something that you would like to change perhaps of Ecuador or Colombia?Felipe: Well, the only thing I would like to change is something about tourism because you know that people overseas outside of Colombia and Ecuador, they don't know too much about Colombia and Ecuador. So I don't know, I think the government should, you know, make people overseas know more about Colombia and Ecuador so that we can attract more tourists to our countries.Katia: That is so true. Actually just by knowing more I want to go to Ecuador and Colombia.Felipe: There you are, that's great.Katia: So thank you Felipe.Felipe: OK, you're welcome.",

        "transcript": "Erina: So Mike, you know the other day my friends and I were talking about ideal hotels. What is your ideal hotel?\nMike: Well, there are many hotels that would appeal to me but I'd say my ideal hotel would number one have to have a gorgeous view from the room. And if we're talking about idealistic, I would choose a hotel that is suspended over the water, just off the beach. And my ideal hotel would be not a hotel where the rooms are all connected but rather rooms being separate villas or bungalows and those villas to be situated just above the water so when you wake up in the morning, you're literally above the water already. You're already on the beach and to get from your room to the beach you have to walk out and you wade in the water until you get to the beach, so a place like that, definitely my ideal hotel would be, you know, something like that. \nMy ideal hotel would have to be situated in nature and I would really love it to have a location that would provide me with opportunities to do a lot of cool activities. You know, perhaps adventure stuff in nature dealing with animals that type of thing, being able to see the local color of the area. So that would probably be my ideal hotel. One other point I would like to make is that the hotel would have to have unbelievable food and I think a hotel with good food and not just good food but a lot of options for food. So when you wake up in the morning and you go for breakfast buffet, you have a choice of virtually any different type of food that there is. A lot of good hotels are limited to what kind of food they offer even if the food is high quality so that would be another aspect for me that would be quite important for my ideal hotel.Erina: Yeah, it sounds like a nice hotel what you just described.Mike: Yeah, absolutely.",

Some people would say that's not a bad habit but what do you think about that makes it a bad habit?Erina: I do waste money, a lot of money on Starbucks and I am not a coffee person. I just like to be in an environment where I can just sit down and drink coffee, I guess.Mike: Understandable, you know, especially in Starbucks and other coffee shops it is, they do a good job of creating a nice atmosphere and it makes people want to stay but then having said that, overspending is definitely a bad habit.Erina: Yeah, it is for sure a money drainer to go to Starbucks all the time but people know where to find me so I guess that's a good thing.Mike: Yeah, there are always benefits to bad things. Now besides overspending at Starbucks, can you think of any other bad habits that you might have?Erina: Well, I get this from my husband a lot but I touch my hair all the time apparently but I really don't notice myself doing it so, you know, my husband fidgets a lot and he doesn't notice it and I think it's one of those things that other people will, you know, point at you, you know, point it out what your bad habits are and for me it's apparently touching my hair.Mike: Right, I guess that bad habit is kind of in the same category as fidgeting, right?Erina: I think so.Mike: Although that might be a calming action for you, for other people it looks like you're nervous or you're not sure what to say so that might be a bad habit that you could work on.Erina: Yeah, I can work on it by tying my hair up I guess.

        "transcript": "Abidemi: So Rory, do you think holidays these days ... do you think they're too commercial? What do you think?\nRory: I mean, they really are commercial aren't they? Christmas especially. It seems to start earlier and earlier every year, so now you hear Christmas songs like in November and maybe even in October, and the stores start to have decorations. It is too commercial? I don't know. I love Christmas, you know. So I love all the Christmas lights, but there is a lot of pressure on people to spend a lot of money at Christmas.\nAbidemi: That's true. I think I am with you on that. I love Christmas. I love everything that comes with it: the songs, the food, the family time, so I can't really complain about it, but I think the year, the calendar year, has just become one big holiday thing, where you start off, you know ... I don't know, you start whenever. December Christmas finishes and we're already looking forward to Valentine's Day. Valentine Day finishes -- Easter, St. Patrick's Day. So it's like one continuous holiday coming up right after the other. So ...\nRory: And things like St Patrick's Day --- when I was a kid --- my family's Irish. We never celebrated St. Patrick's Day at all. I mean nothing. Didn't even talk about it. But now, all the pubs, and the bars, have promotions. The restaurants have promotions. You can buy green beer. People are wearing funny hats. It seems to me like completely a commercial holiday.\nAbidemi: That's true. \nRory: It doesn't seem to be related to St Patrick at all. \nAbidemi: That's true. That's true. Why do you think it's becoming more and more like that?\nRory: I guess just that companies see it -- the way to sell more products.",

        "transcript": "Ana:\tSo Michael, I heard you really enjoy going to the movies. What kind of movies do you like? \nMichael:\tI like many kinds of movies. But actually, I enjoy going to movies, but these days, I'm so busy with work that I don't really get to see that many movies in the cinema. But when I fly on an airplane, I like to watch many movies in one night. \nAna:\tOh really? Wow, okay. Can you tell me about a movie you've watched recently on an airplane? \nMichael:\tYes. The last time I flew in an airplane, I watched a movie called the Dallas Buyer's Club. \nAna:\tOh, okay. Yes, I think I've heard about it. What's the story? \nMichael:\tWell, it's about HIV and AIDS. And it's basically about the early years of new drug treatments for people with AIDS. And the story is about an American guy in Dallas or in Texas. \nAna:\tYeah, Dallas in Texas. Yeah.\nMichael:\tOh yes. Sorry, I don't – I'm from South Africa so my knowledge of America isn't that great. But yeah, it's about someone who's been diagnosed with HIV and then how he sort of comes to terms with it and how it's difficult for him to accept at first. And then he starts undergoing treatment for it, experimental treatment. \nAna:\tOh yeah, I think I've watched the trailer actually. It's really interesting. So what did you think of it? Did you like it? \nMichael:\tYes, yes. I thought it was a very good movie. And it deals with some difficult topics or some maybe upsetting topics but overall, it was a very interesting movie to watch. And I think the acting is also very good in this movie. Do you know the name of the actor? I forgot his name. \nAna:\tYes. I think it's Matthew McConaughey. \nMichael:\tAh yes. And did he win an Academy Award for that? \nAna:\tYes, he did. I think he just recently won several awards for his performance in that movie. \nMichael:\tHmm, that was very impressive. \nAna:\tSo earlier you said that the movie talks about some difficult topics. Could you tell me what those are? \nMichael:\tThat's true. Well, the whole question of AIDS, and how society dealt with it at that time before it was a widely known disease. \nAna:\tBut I think it also focuses on the treatment of AIDS, and what's available out there, doesn't it? \nMichael:\tYes. At that time, there were different drug treatments available. There were actually not that many available but they started doing trial runs in hospitals of different kinds of drugs. But I think that's part of the drama in the movie but some patients were given the real drug and some patients were given placebo drugs or sugar pills. And then, it also it sort of the whole question of ethics in medicine and that some people have to die of their disease before a medicine can be approved – before it can be proved that the medicine is effective in the first place. \nSo it was…\nAna:\tOh, I see. That's very interesting. \nMichael:\tIt talks about some maybe unpleasant topics. \nAna:\tOh, that sounds very somber. Do you still recommend I watch it? \nMichael:\tWell, yes, I think so. It's exactly a feel-good or a happy movie but I think it raises people's awareness of how sufferers of HIV and AIDS had to deal with it and what sort of issues they faced and still face today even though the treatments have improved a great deal since the time depicted in the movie at least. \nAna:\tGreat, thank you. \nMichael:\tMy pleasure.",

        "transcript": "Michael: So Ana, I was wondering, are you familiar with the term inferiority complex? \nAna: Yes. I think I've heard it before. \nMichael: Well, you know, sometimes when a person feels he is not quite as good as other people at something then he can feel inferior or not as good. But this is also true for countries sometimes. For example, if there's a very small country and it's next to a very big country, such as Portugal and Spain, would you say that's the case in your country? \nAna: Yeah, that's interesting. I think that's definitely the case in our country. Spain is a big country and in terms of the economy, they have been doing a lot better than Portugal recently. And actually, we're starting to get a lot of products from Spain. So things that used to be produced nationally before, now are being imported from Spain. \nMichael: I see. \nAna: And also in terms of other things like banks, a lot of our major banks in Portugal are Spanish now. And a lot of Portuguese students are moving to Spanish universities because the education is better there. \nMichael: Really. But you have some very old universities and a very old tradition or academic tradition in Portugal as well then, do you? \nAna: Yes, we do. And actually, our universities are full but I think the problem is that they're not growing enough, so there aren't enough places for Portuguese students in our universities. So many of them are moving to Spain. It's very interesting but also a little bit sad that we can't provide the education that these students need nowadays. \nMichael: I see. If you look at Portugal on the map, you can see it's much smaller than Spain. What about the population? How many people live in Portugal? \nAna: I think we have about eleven million people. \nMichael: Eleven million people. \nAna: Yeah. So it's not very big. But actually, it might have changed in the last few years because so many Portuguese people are moving to other countries around the world. Since the credit crash and everything that's been happening with the economy, there haven't been a lot of jobs in Portugal. \nMichael: All right. I read a story in the newspaper of the – was it the minister of foreign affairs or the minister of the economy in Portugal advised young people, young Portuguese people to leave the country and find jobs elsewhere because there are no jobs for young Portuguese people. Is that true? \nAna: Yes. That was a big scandal actually because, yeah, the government recommended young Portuguese people to move to other countries when in fact we think that they should be creating jobs in Portugal for new people. \nMichael: So people were quite angry. So how was that? What were the people's reactions? \nAna: I think people were quite angry. It's a reality though. So many young people are moving overseas. But we understand that at this point, it's more of a survival instinct and we should go if we want to get a job. \nMichael: And then maybe – do young people who leave the country want to come back and work in Portugal again when the economy is better? \nAna: Yes, I think so. I think most people want to go back to Portugal but I think we might have to wait a few years before things are back on track.",

We're actually quite small compared to most countries in the world. \nMichael:\tBut you are next to some pretty big countries in Europe, right? You're next to Spain, and France, and Germany, which are all bigger countries. \nAna:\tYeah. Yeah, we are. Right by Spain. Spain is so much bigger than Portugal. And it kind of covers some of the Portuguese borders, so it's very interesting. \nMichael:\tOkay, yeah. I've even heard Portugal being referred to as a province of Spain. What do you think about that? \nAna:\tYeah. And they think it might be in South America or part of Spain, but not really. Actually, Portugal and Spain, they have a lot of things in common but also a lot of differences. \nMichael:\tAll right. \nAna:\tSo the people are similar but our food is actually very different. \nMichael:\tHow so? What are the differences between Portuguese food and Spanish food? \nAna:\tWell, I think Portuguese food, we have a lot of grilled fish, and we're right by the ocean so for us, fish is really important. \nMichael:\tAh, I see. \nAna: Whereas in Spain, I think you get a lot of meat and food that's a little bit less healthy, I think. But maybe that's just my opinion. \nMichael:\tAll right. So is Portuguese food very healthy? \nAna:\tIt can be but not always. Our desserts are really rich, so you should be careful. There is a lot of egg and flour and sugar in there. So you don't want to eat too much of that. \nMichael:\tAnd you like very rich, cured meat, and sausages as well as they do in Spain? \nAna:\tYes, we do. Smoked ham, and cheese is also very important. \nMichael:\tOh, that sounds good. \nAna:\tBut you know there are also a lot of similarities between Portugal and Spain. \nMichael:\tOh really? What sort of similarities? \nAna:\tFor example, our love for football is very important. \nMichael:\tAh, of course. \nAna:\tSo both Portugal and Spain have very big football teams that are important in the whole world. And when we play against the rest of the world, Portugal and Spain really unite and we support each other. \nMichael:\tWhat's the name of that famous football player from Portugal? \nAna:\tOh, Cristiano Ronaldo. \nMichael:\tOh yes, Ronaldo. \nAna:\tYeah, yeah. He's really good. I think he won the best player – well, yeah, the title of world's best player recently. \nMichael:\tReally? Wow. Are you big fan of football? \nAna:\tYes, I am. I used to be a big supporter of Porto, so that was really interesting. And Portugal also hosted the European tournament a few years ago. \nMichael:\tAh, I see. And Porto, is that a place in Portugal? \nAna:\tYes, it is. It's in the north. Even though I'm from the Lisbon area, I actually support another team. \nMichael:\tAnd why do you support Porto? \nAna:\tI don't know. I guess, I just like Porto when I was growing up and that's why. \nMichael:\tAll right. Have you visited Porto? \nAna:\tYes, I have. It's really a beautiful city. \nMichael:\tOh well, maybe I should visit there as well when I go to Portugal this summer. \nAna:\tYeah, you should.",

        "transcript": "Sarah: All right, Adam. So we’re going to talk about lifestyle choices. First question for you is would you rather have a roommate or live alone?\nAdam: I’ve had some really good experiences with roommates, but right now I live alone. And I really enjoy to have my own space and I like to keep it a certain way. I’m kind of a clean person, so I probably choose to live alone.\nSarah: Okay. That leads me to my next question which is house or apartment. So if you choose to live alone, would you like a house or an apartment?\nAdam: I’d love to live in a house. Right now I live in an apartment and it’s okay. But yeah, I really like the outdoors, and like to have a yard or a small garden or something would be great. So I love, like, privacy. I like to play my music really loud or something, so in a house maybe I could do that. And in an apartment, it’s a bit difficult.\nSarah: So a house usually means a pretty big commitment of like where you’re living. So if you could have a house anywhere where would it be?\nAdam: Maybe in my hometown. It would be nice to have a house in Seattle. But I am not a person that likes to be tied down so much, so that would be kind of tricky for me. Apartments are also nice too because you don’t have the upkeep and the responsibility that you might have with a house. So that is nice. I wish I could just have a house and just move it with me wherever I go.\nSarah: So if you could move that house anywhere, would it be like a town or a city, like what do you prefer?\nAdam: I’d definitely live outside of the city, but close enough to where I could commute within like 20 minutes, 30 minutes to be able to go shopping and do my everyday life. But I like peace and quiet and nature, so definitely outside of the hustle and bustle of the big city.\nSarah: So how about pets? Would you like to have a pet or not have anything or one live in your house?\nAdam: I love animals. I have always wanted to have a dog or really, any sort of pet. But I move so much that it makes having a pet difficult. So I’ve never really had one although if I ever do settle down somewhere, I would absolutely get maybe several pets. I love, I love animals.\nSarah: Nice. Thanks.\n[End of Transcript]",

        "transcript": "Adam: Hi Sarah. Today we’re talking about lifestyle options. So my first question would be would you rather live with a roommate or live by yourself?\nSarah: This one would definitely depend on who the roommate is. I have lived alone many times and I’ve also had lots of different roommates, and I found that any roommate that’s extroverted does not work well with me. I find that like if I come home and they’re there, like I don’t want to be there. So I leave again, or I just go in my room, close the door.\nI think the worst situation was when I lived with my sister. She is very extroverted, and we were working the same types of jobs and spending a lot of time together. When I came home, I just wanted to be alone. And so I would go in my room and she thought that I didn’t love her, I didn’t want to spend time with her. But really, you know, I just needed my space. \nSo in that case, living alone is better. But if I have someone who is more similar in personality to me, then it works well to have a roommate. I currently have a roommate and we get along really well because we have similar temperaments. And so, yeah, it works well for us.\nAdam: So would you say that opposites don’t attract?\nSarah: When it comes to living together, absolutely not.\nAdam: Hmm. How about your living situation in terms of a house or an apartment, which one would you prefer?\nSarah: Definitely an apartment because to me a house seems permanent. And I love change. So I also move a lot. I have moved to a new place every two years or less for like the past 12 years of my life. So the thought of having a house and being stuck in one place doesn’t really appeal to me.\nAdam: I can understand that. This apartment of yours, would you prefer it to be in the city or in the countryside?\nSarah: I would naturally say city, but ironically, most of the places I have lived have been more countryside or rural because that’s where I found work. But in the future, I think I would like to live in a larger city.\nAdam: Any cities in mind?\nSarah: Not right now. I’m still trying to decide about what country I want to move to next.\nAdam: How about this apartment of yours in the city, would it be furnished or unfurnished?\nSarah: Interesting you ask that, because the apartment I’m currently in is unfurnished. And when I moved here, it was really complicated to try to furnish it because I live on the fifth floor and there is no elevator. And it became quickly very problematic when I moved in trying to get things.\nBut when I was coming, the apartment agency that I was dealing with told me that there weren’t any furnished apartments in the area where I lived. So I thought it was the only option when really it wasn’t.\nAdam: Yeah, the fifth floor, you must have got some good exercise carrying all that stuff up there.\nSarah: Definitely.\nAdam: How do you feel about pets?\nSarah: I love animals. I would love to have a dog or a rabbit. When I lived in China, I had a rabbit. But it’s just not practical for my life because I live overseas and I go back and forth between the States visiting family. And it’s just not practical to have one. So maybe one day if I ever settle down.\nAdam: A dog, a rabbit?\nSarah: Probably a dog. Dog would be first option definitely, a Dachshund. My favorite animal is Dachshund.\nAdam: Those are cute.\nSarah: Yeah.",

        "name": "Using AirBnB",
        "transcript": "Todd: Okay. So we’re talking about housing Meg. You know, these days, a lot of people can actually stay in houses when they travel. Like they don’t stay in hotels, they stay in a house. Have you heard about Airbnb? \nMeg: Yeah, I have heard of it. I’ve looked at the website a couple of times. Do they have Airbnb where you’re from? \nTodd: They do. They actually do have Airbnb in San Francisco but I have not used it in San Francisco, I’ve only used it actually traveling in other countries. I used it Thailand and I was going to use it in Japan but I ended up – I couldn’t use it because of the travel problems but yeah. \nMeg: So how does it work?\nTodd: Basically, what it works is if somebody owns a house, they can rent out a room. And so, you find a house online and then you book it with the scheduling system online. And then you pay Airbnb the money and then the people let you stay in their house. \nMeg: What are the cost usually? Is it expensive? \nTodd: It can be really cheap or really expensive. You have both ends. I mean, sometimes you can just rent a room and sometimes, you can actually rent the whole house. \nSo, you know – and now, in places like Thailand or other places in Southeast Asia, what they do is a lot of condominiums now are kind of turning into mini-hotels. So rather than try to find long-term tenants, they just search for – or they just rent out their apartments on Airbnb. \nMeg: Right. Well, it sounds like a good way to stay some place you haven’t been before. \nTodd: It is good. I mean, when I used it in Thailand, what I liked about it was you feel like you have a real, you know, you have real roots there. You’re not in the hotel so nobody is kind of intruding on you or nobody is coming to clean your room everyday. So you feel like you have more privacy and you feel like you really live in the place. And usually, the apartments are in real neighborhoods so they’re not in touristy areas. So there are definitely some advantages. \nMeg: Would you say that it’s safe? \nTodd: Yeah. I guess that’s the biggest concern. It seems to be safe. I mean, from what I see – although there was an interesting case recently in California where they’ve had problems of squatters. And a squatter…\nMeg: What are squatters? \nTodd: A squatter is somebody who, they take the Airbnb house and then they just never leave. \nMeg: Oh. \nTodd: Yeah. And then they’re hard to evict. So that was one interesting thing. And then also, recently, the company has been in the news because people that have low-income housing, like government subsidized housing, they’ve been trying to rent out their apartments on Airbnb. \nMeg: On Airbnb.\nTodd: And then the city or the government said, “Hey, you can’t do that because we give you this house at a discount to help you because you’re low income. So you can’t use it to make a profit.” So it’s been a very debatable situation. \nMeg: Yeah. I guess it’s kind of like double dipping.  You’re getting a discount or paid in a way to live there and then you want to get paid more. So it sounds like a problem. \nTodd: Yeah. So what do you think? Would you be interested in doing something like Airbnb? \nMeg: Yeah. I definitely think so. After researching a place, maybe if I have a lot of pictures and it seemed clear that it would be safe, yeah, I think I’d like to do it. \nTodd: And actually their website is fantastic. Like if you go to their website, you can, let’s say, choose a house in Paris or Madrid or whatever. And then they often have like the Google street cam thing so you can see what the house looks like on the inside. And then you could actually do the rotating camera and see what the neighborhood looks like. \nAnd then everybody leaves reviews about the owner and about their stay there, so you’d get a good feel about what the place is like. So it’s kind of a new way to travel, and it’s kind of cool. \nMeg: Yeah. It sounds interesting especially the reviews. I think knowing someone else has had a good experience, I would definitely be interested in doing it. \nTodd: Yeah, definitely.",

        "transcript": "Meg: So Todd, I heard that you’re from San Francisco and that it’s really expensive there maybe to live. Is it – is that true? \nTodd: Yeah. It’s ridiculously expensive. It’s obscene actually. It’s so hard to get other people to realize how expensive it is. You have to actually live there and then you can experience it firsthand. \n                                But basically, you know, your average small apartment is a minimum, a minimum of like $3,000 a month. \nMeg: Wow. That sounds really expensive. \nTodd: Yeah. \nMeg: Well, so I don’t know much about the San Francisco area. Is that like just in the main downtown part or anywhere in the city is it that expensive? \nTodd: It’s actually – yeah, it’s pretty much the entire peninsula. And the high pricing affects all of Northern California. And the reason is because companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, Yahoo, Cisco – all these really big rich, rich companies pay people a lot of money. And so, there’s a lot of money in San Francisco for the tech world, and that just drives up the prices for everything. \nMeg: So everyone who lives there like must be pretty rich? \nTodd: Yeah. So it’s very high income. I think the average income is over $100,000 a year or something crazy like that. \nMeg: Wow.\nTodd: Yeah, it’s a lot. \nMeg: So if apartments are $3,000 a month, what about houses? \nTodd: Houses are ridiculously expensive. So your average house is probably – in San Francisco, a really small rinky-dink house can go for almost $1 million. \nMeg: Wow. \nTodd: Yeah. \nMeg: Wow. That sounds impossible. \nTodd: Yeah. It sounds obscene. Yeah. Years ago I worked on the construction crew, and this was 15 years ago. And we were just renovating or painting a very small little shack. I mean, the house wasn’t even that big and it was going for $1 million. \nMeg: Wow. So when you were working there, were you living in San Francisco also? \nTodd: I was. And that’s actually why I became a teacher in Asia, why I moved to Japan because we were losing our lease on our apartment, and I had to go find new housing. And not only is the house inexpensive but even if you have the money, you might not get a house because you have to go through this long process. It’s almost like getting into college. \nYou have to get through this interview process. And just going and finding an apartment is such a complicated process in San Francisco that I thought, “Oh, forget it, I’m just going to take the easy way out and go back and start teaching overseas again.”\nMeg: So if someone were interested in living in San Francisco, what would your advice be?\nTodd: Don’t, or make sure you have a lot of money or you have a really good job. I guess there are some ways around it. You can rent rooms and things like that. But it’s doable because there is low-income housing. And if you live in the outskirts and if you are going to commute into the city, you could probably find something around $1,500 a month. But still, it’s pretty expensive. \nMeg: So work for Google first, then move to San Francisco. \nTodd: Right. Exactly. Make sure you get that job at the tech company. And then once you have that job, then you’re set. \nMeg: Great. Well, thanks for sharing about San Francisco. \nTodd: Sure.",

        "transcript": "Abidemi: So Rory, talking about schedules, do you ever think that life is too busy or too much that we’re trying to fit too many things? \nRory: Maybe for some people. Not for me, actually. I take life quite slowly. But I noticed with my daughter that we’re always sort of rushing her to do things. So when she comes home from school, she has to do her homework. And then one night a week, she has to go to swimming then she has piano, then she has like an acrobat lesson. \nWhen I was a kid, we did nothing after school, you know. We went to the park by ourselves and played. But nothing was scheduled, so we just did what we wanted. \nAbidemi: I see. \nRory: So do you think like kids today, we try and make them do too much or they try and do too much. \nAbidemi: That’s a really good question. And I think, yes, you’re right. It feels like a lot – that we expect a lot more from kids these days. Whereas similar to your background too, when I was growing up, I thought sometimes that I was bored out of my mind because there was just nothing really much to do except for maybe going to the library and borrow some books to read. And I had all the time in the world to read them. \nBut these days, you see kids running around trying to do it all. Play soccer or some kind of sports or do some club activities or just something. They are always busy, the kids I see around me. So…\nRory: Yeah. Yeah. I think we’re trying to make them maybe grow up too quickly or do too much too soon. When I was kid, you could sort of find your own path. You know, when you became a teenager, when you start to get to university, starting to make these choices. \nBut now, parents seem to – okay, the kid is going to do piano and they’re going to do soccer and they’re going to study hard for, you know, exams, do extra math tuition. I don’t know if kids can handle it. \nAbidemi: I don’t know either. It also seems that it comes with our world today. It’s a lot more competitive. And what I’ve heard is like people are trying to prepare their kids as much as possible. I’ve heard, for some universities, you need to show that you can handle a lot. \nRory: Right. \nAbidemi: And because everybody is the same place, they’re all racing for the same positions that if you don’t distinguish yourself in some way, you can’t make it. So in response to that, parents are trying to pile as much on the kids as possible. \nRory: Yeah. I was reading something that said that employers really look now for extra-curricular things that kids do. So not just their grades but what clubs were they members of. Were they acting in the theater, were they a member of a sports team and these things seem to be becoming more important now. \nAbidemi: Than just school work. \nRory: Yeah. Yeah.\nAbidemi: I think it’s a shame. I like the way I grew up. Yeah. I’ll like if my kids could have a bit more freedom but I can also see that with the way the world is going, I would probably be anxious for them to do as much as possible so that they can have the best in the future. \nRory: Yeah, because it’s a balance between giving them the freedom and then giving them the opportunities to excel at various things. \nAbidemi: There you go. That’s it. Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Rory: So I was thinking about my current job. \nAbidemi: Uh-hmm. \nRory: And I think like my work schedule is so good.  I work Monday and Tuesday, then I have a day off. Then I work Thursday and Friday, and then I have the weekend off. And I get five months holiday, yeah. \nAbidemi: Wow. Sign me up. \nRory: So I mean, what’s a good work schedule for you? \nAbidemi: I think what you’ve just described sounds really good as well. When I was younger actually, I don’t know where this idea came from but my ideal work hours were 9:00 until 2:00. \nRory: Okay. \nAbidemi: Not 9:00 until 5:00 like you usually hear in a lot of Western countries, but 9 o’clock to 2 o’clock. \nRory: Right. \nAbidemi: I don’t know. So maybe for me, if I could do it, if I could find something like that, it would be really good because you can sleep in until maybe 7:00 or 8:00, go to work, finish at 2:00, still come back and have a good chunk of that day to do other things. So…\nRory: Yeah. So my previous job was quite – I started at 9:30 and I finish at 12:30. I worked five days a week but it was great because work was finished by lunch time. I had the whole day free. And that was a good job. \nAbidemi: And you still got a full time salary?\nRory: And that was a full-time salary, yeah. \nAbidemi: Wow. Sounds even better than this one, maybe. \nRory: Yeah. In the past – I mean, I’ve worked in restaurants where you work only in the evenings. So I’d start at 5:30 and work until around midnight. I didn’t like that as much because all day, I was thinking, “I’ve got to go to work later.” So I think I prefer working in the morning and get it behind me as soon as possible. \nAbidemi: I think maybe I’m the same way as well. I prefer to get it down and then have the rest of the day to enjoy. Also, I had a job where I was working during the weekend. And I would have Mondays and Tuesdays off. And I didn’t really like that. I missed seeing friends on the weekend and then going out. So I don’t think I would like anything like that. \nHow about not working? Do you think – how long do you think you could go without not having to work?\nRory: Well, it’s funny because this job now I have really long vacations but I’m not happy when I’m not working. Like my wife gets very frustrated with me because if I have nothing to do, I tend to be a bit annoying around the house, just getting depressed, just arguing all the time. \nBut I don’t need much work. Like if I could just do like an hour a day, I think that would be enough to make me happy. \nAbidemi: Okay. How long could you go would say? A week or two without having to touch work? \nRory: I could probably go a couple of months. \nAbidemi: Okay. Without having to work at all. \nRory: Yeah, if I have other things to do, you know. So if I had other projects like if I was doing a lot of training for running or if I was studying, if I had a good book then I could probably go quite a long time. \nAbidemi: Yeah. I get pretty restless myself, too. I think after three, four days of not having anything to do, I just want – I really need something. Maybe, like you said study or learn or go out and do something, have a project, have a goal. I think, yeah, my personality type needs to constantly do something, produce. Yeah. \nRory: Yeah. When I worked in Europe, I used to do – I used to teach for one or two weeks intensively, and then have three or four weeks off. And it was quite nice because I had lots of free time but after two or three weeks of free time, I was quite looking forward to the next block, the next block of teaching. \n                                But teaching these intensive blocks can be quite – it can be quite tough as well. Like I have to – I did a six-week block in Russia once, and after three weeks, I just wanted to go home. Six weeks was too long. \nAbidemi: Wow. I see. \nAbidemi: How intensive was it? \nRory: Well, the job in Russia was really intensive because I was living with the students in a residential university. And so we had breakfast together and then I taught them from half past eight in the morning until half past six in the evening. \nAbidemi: Wow. \nRory: We had lunch together, and then we had dinner together in the evening. And there was one bar in the university, and we all went to the same bar in the evening as well. \nAbidemi: And you had the same group of students?\nRory: The same group of students.\nAbidemi: For six weeks? \nRory: For six weeks and it was six days a week of teaching. \nAbidemi: Wow. I can – if you the teacher felt like that, I can only imagine how the students must have felt. They must have wanted a break badly. \nRory: Yeah. We all wanted a break.",

        "transcript": "John: So we've been talking about women's roles in society. And are you a stay-at-home mom or a working mom?\nSarah: Well, I guess I'm both. Right now, I'm on maternity leave and I'm on month six of maternity leave. \nJohn: What does that mean?\nSarah: So maternity leave is when you have a job but then you become pregnant or you're going to have a baby, maybe adopt, too. So you're going to have a baby, and so you take time off of work to stay home with the new baby. \nJohn: Oh, I see. Do you still get paid?\nSarah: I do. I get about half of my wage. So I do still get paid and I'm very grateful for that. So I've been at home with the new baby for six months. And I'm going to go back to work next month. \nJohn: Oh. What will happen with the baby? \nSarah: So I have two kids actually. I have a toddler and a baby. And both of them will go to daycare during the day. \nJohn: I see. \nSarah: So I signed up for the daycare before the baby was even born. It's really hard to find good daycare that you can afford, that's near your house. So you have to start planning before the baby is even born if you're the type of person who wants to go back to work. \nJohn: I see. I don't think many men worry about getting good daycare for their children…\nSarah: No.\nJohn: When they think about their jobs. \nSarah: No. Even when there's a family, and the mother and father both work, still it's the mother that has to do everything with the kids, usually. Usually, the mom has to for example, get the bag ready for the kids to take to daycare. They have to arrange the daycare. They have – the daycare has the mother's phone number, usually. \nAnd so, the mom has to do a lot of extra work even though mom and dad both have full time jobs.\nJohn: I see. Are you saying that things should be different?\nSarah: Yes. I think things should be different. I'm so lucky my husband agrees with me. And my husband, he drops the kids off at daycare and he picks them up and he does the laundry and the dishes. And it helps me to be – and it helps me focus on my career so that I can stay late at work if I need to. I can go to an extra meeting on a weekend. And it makes me feel more fulfilled that it's not my husband's job that comes first. \nA lot of times women make less money than men and they put their job second to their husband. And it's not equal, and it's not fair. And so, I think that people should work on making things more equal.\nJohn: Well, I agree with you. \nSarah: Thank you.",

        "transcript": "John: Okay. So Sarah, you said you participated in rodeos before but I thought only men ride horses in rodeos?\nSarah: Yeah. Like 99.9% of the time, the men do all of the rodeo sports. There's like two sports for women and the rest of them are all for men.\nJohn: Oh.\nSarah: When I said I wanted to do the traditionally male events, they said, \"You can't do that. You're a woman. You have to do these other events that are not dangerous. They're safe.\" \n                                For example, the men do calf roping. You work with a baby cow, a calf that's about 100 pounds. The women do goat roping. \nAnd they work with a tiny goat that's about the size of a small dog. So I just always thought the difference was stupid. I don't want to do the easy, safe event. I want to do the difficult event and people were really surprised. And first, they said, \"You can't.\" And I said, \"I'm going to anyways.\" \nJohn: Wow!\nSarah: And the first time I did the saddle bronc, they said, \"Look, look, look. We got you a girl horse because you're a girl.\"\nJohn: Oh my. \nSarah: And I thought, \"Well, you didn't need to draw more attention to it. I just want to compete like everyone else.\"\nJohn: Right. \nSarah: And my first time, I fell off the horse and I was really injured. And I was laying there and one of my friends came running out. And he said – I thought he was going to help me up and help me leave because I was really hurt. And instead he said, \"Hurry up! You got to get off the – you get out of the arena because the next person wants to go.\"\nJohn: Oh, wow!\nSarah: And I was really happy that he said that actually because he was just treating me the way he treated any other competitor. \"Oh, get up. Be tough. You're fine.\"\nJohn: Yeah. \nSarah: And I didn't want anyone to help me. \nJohn: So he didn't help you. \nSarah: Right. And I was really glad that he was treating me like everyone else. And when you see a rodeo, you'll see that the women do events where they can dress really nice. They always wear nice clothes, beautiful hat. They even have earrings and things on. \nAnd when the men do events, they're doing events that they really have to use their muscles and get dirty, and I really liked doing those instead. I'm not saying one is better than the other, I'm just saying I like to do the other one and I think that maybe other women like to do the other events, too.\nJohn: So do you think that the situation is improving? Are more girls joining rodeo now?\nSarah: I don't think so. I think the sport of rodeo is becoming less popular. So I think in the future, there won't be more women in rodeo. There will just be fewer people in rodeo.\nJohn: Oh, I see.\nSarah: Because the rodeo events, they're not very kind to the cows or the other animals. And as people get older, maybe they get more softhearted like me, and they don't want to make the animals get tied up or chase the animals. And so I think fewer people are interested in rodeo these days.",

        "transcript": "John: So Sarah, you talked about competing in a rodeo. Have you done any other sports on horseback?\nSarah: Yeah. Well, not a sport. I used to have a job, and my job was to take people on horseback into the mountains in Wyoming. And it was a really fun job. \n                                Everyday, we would saddle up, maybe 15 or 20 horses. And then we would take beginners, people who had never ridden horses before, and we'd show them how to lead the horses and get on the horses. And then, we'd go up into the mountains for two hours or four hours or sometimes all day. \nJohn: Well, that sounds great. \nSarah: Yeah. \nJohn: That was your job?\nSarah: That was my job, and it was really fun. We would walk along these cliffs, and people would get nervous and they'd say, \"Oh no, isn't my horse going to fall down the cliff?\" And I'd say, \"No. Your horse doesn't want to fall down the cliff just like you.\"\nJohn: Yeah. Right. \nSarah: And the horses were really good. And to be honest, the horses mostly ignored the people on their backs. \nJohn: Really?\nSarah: The horses, they knew the path that we were taking. \nJohn: Oh.\nSarah: And sometimes, people would want to do something that's dangerous like go too fast or go a different way. And the horses would ignore the people and go the way they're supposed to. \nJohn: That's probably better. \nSarah: Yeah. \nJohn: What about wild animals? You're out going on horseback trail rides through the mountains, right? \nSarah: Yeah. And the area we went through was famous for elk. We saw lots of elk. And, you know, where there's elk, there are also the animals that eat elk. So there were mountain lions and bears. \nJohn: Bears?\nSarah: I never saw a bear. But I always told the people I was with, I said, \"Don't worry guys. If you see a bear, you don't have to be faster than the bear. You just have to be faster than the slowest horse.\"\nJohn: Oh, that's a good one.  Did the visitors like that joke?\nSarah: They did. They thought it was really funny until I pointed out which horse was the slowest, and then that person got really nervous. \n\nJohn: Did you ever see a mountain lion?\nSarah: I never saw a mountain lion. But one time, the horses were all acting really nervous and they wouldn't go forward. And I didn't know why they were acting this way. \nJohn: Oh.\nSarah: They refused. And so, I ended up turning around and we went off the trail, and we had to make a big circle. \nJohn: Really?\nSarah: And then, later, I found out that there had been a warning, that there were mountain lions in the area. And so, I think that's why the horses refused to go. \nJohn: Wow. Those horses sound pretty smart. \nSarah: Yeah. Sometimes in the morning, when we are the first people on the trail, I would see tracks, like wolf tracks or cougar tracks. But I never saw the real animal.\nJohn: That's probably lucky. Sounds like you had a really fun time at that job. \nSarah: Yeah. It was really fun and we were outdoors everyday. That was my favorite part. The air was so clean and I loved working with the animals and being in the sunshine. It was great.",

        "transcript": "John: So Sarah, I was wondering, what kind of sports do you like to play?\nSarah: Well, I love riding horses. And actually, when I was in college, I took a lot of classes about horseback riding. So I can do all sorts of sports on horseback. \nJohn: Wow! That's amazing. Don't you think riding horses is scary?\nSarah: I think, it's part of the fun. For example, I used to be in the rodeo and I did a sport called saddle bronc riding. And the way you do this is they put the saddle on the horse and then they let the horse just go crazy. And the horse runs, and bucks, and tries to get you off, and you try to stay on.\n                                And it's really scary but it's also really exciting. \nJohn: Wow! That's what's called a bucking bronco, right? \nSarah: Yeah. And it's really hard to stay on. In fact, you win if you can stay on 8 seconds. \nJohn: Oh, that doesn't seem very long. \nSarah: It's really, really long. When I was – it's really long when you're on the horse. My first time, I only stayed on about 4 seconds and then I fell off in the middle of ring and I got knocked out.\nJohn: Whoa!\nSarah: Yeah. And the rest – yeah, and I had a big black eye for about two months.\nJohn: Wow! From falling off a horse. That's why it seems scary. Isn't it really dangerous?\nSarah: It is. It is really dangerous. And they don't make you wear helmet or any safety gear. I didn't wear a helmet my first time. I think it was pretty stupid. \nYou start – so the horse starts in a metal cage. So the horse can't move. And then you sit on top of the horse, on the horse's back in the saddle. And then you say, I'm ready and they open the door. And the horse explodes and just starts jumping, and turning and twisting. And the horse did about three or four jumps and I fell off. \nJohn: Wow! How many seconds did you make it?\nSarah: Three. \nJohn: Three? \nSarah: Probably about 3 seconds. \nJohn: So you would have to do that more than twice as long to win.\nSarah: Yeah. I got better at it, but I never could stay on for 8 seconds. \nJohn: Did you try any other rodeo events?\nSarah: Yeah. I tried to do calf roping. \nJohn: What's that?\nSarah: This is a sport where you have your horse and your horse is trained. It's not the wild horse from before. And there's a calf, and you try to throw your rope so that you catch the calf. And a calf is a baby cow.\nJohn: Wow! And so, what do you have to do if you get your rope around the cow?\nSarah: Then you have to run up to the cow and you have to tie the cow's legs together. And when you finish tying the cow's legs together, the timer stops. So you want to do it as fast as you can. \nJohn: That sounds really fun. And it doesn't sound as dangerous as the saddle bronc competition. \nSarah: No. It's not as dangerous. But after a while, I started to feel bad for the baby cow. \nJohn: I see.\nSarah: It's just he's a small little baby and he's really scared, and he's trying to run away. And I started to feel bad about catching him with the rope and tying him up. So I stopped doing it.",

        "transcript": "Rory: So Abidemi, do you remember we were talking about food combinations which people find strange. \n\nAbidemi: Hmm. \n\nRory: Well, I was wondering, are there any foods which just freak you out, which you’d never eat? \n\nAbidemi: Well, I think the older I have gotten, the more I’ve become, kind of, hesitant to try new food, which is strange. \n\nRory: Yeah. \n\nAbidemi: Before, the thought…\n\nRory: I thought you were going to say more adventurous. It’s the opposite. \n\nAbidemi: It is the opposite, unfortunately. Before, the thought of eating insects or cats and dogs didn’t do anything for me. It didn’t do anything bad. It was just like, “Oh sure, I’ll try it.” Before, my philosophy was if it’s food, and if I see somebody else eating it, I’ll try it. \n\nRory: Right. \n\nAbidemi: But now, just the thought of it, of trying to eat a dog or a cat, I don’t want to. \n\nRory: So did you try some strange foods when you were younger? \n\nAbidemi: Yes. I traveled to Northern Canada, and I lived in an Inuit community for a little while. And there, they eat a lot of different sea animals. \n\nRory: Right. \n\nAbidemi: For example, whales, what else? They eat caribou as well. Just different animals and I tried a lot of that. And I really liked it. It was good. \n\nRory: Okay. \n\nAbidemi: It didn’t do anything bad to me or…\n\nRory: Right. \n\nAbidemi: Yeah, I didn’t get sick or anything from it. \n\nRory: And you didn’t have a problem with the connection between this animal, the whale, which people have now raised to be like this is so important for our planet? \n\nAbidemi: Personally, no. I didn’t. I think – I don’t want to say I’m being selfish but to me, if you’re doing it for – not to sell, not for commercialization, and for these people, for those people, the Inuits, it’s their way of living. It’s their way of surviving. \n\nRory: Right. \n\nAbidemi: So I didn’t have any problems with that. \n                                So I think maybe in general, too. That’s where that philosophy before was if somebody else is eating it, and it’s okay, I’ll try it. Why not? \n\nRory: Okay. \n\nAbidemi: So I don’t know. \n\nRory: I’ve never tried anything like that but if I see…\n                                When I traveled in Southeast Asia, I did try some insects. \n\nAbidemi: Okay. \n\nRory: And they looked terrible, and it’s really hard to get your mind around the fact you’re going to eat it. When you eat it, it doesn’t – I mean, it tastes okay. \n\nAbidemi: Okay. \n\nRory: They normally cook that maybe candied, served a little bit salt or a little bit salty. \n\nAbidemi: Oh. All right. \n\nRory: So they taste okay. But your eyes continue to tell your brain that there’s something wrong. \n\nAbidemi: Okay. Okay. Do you think you would try it again? \n\nRory: I think I would. I think the future is insects. \n\nAbidemi: Okay. The future is insects. That’s funny. \n\nRory: Yeah. \n\nAbidemi: It’s funny, in Nigeria, we used to, when I was a kid, we would – I don’t know what you call them. They were like – I don’t want to say termites – I’m not sure. But they were flying. A certain type of flying insects that will come at a certain time of the year and they were only there maybe for two or three weeks. And we will just catch them and fry them. Just salted and fried. It was really good. \n\nRory: Yeah. \n\nAbidemi: And back then to me, it wasn’t anything strange. It was just like nice. \n\nRory: Right. \n\nAbidemi: I would think that I would like to try it again because it was just so good, just from my memories. But I don’t know I might hesitate now to eat it. \n\nRory: Yeah. I think people can quickly become use to strange foods. \n\nAbidemi: Okay. \n\nRory: So like nobody ate raw fish in England, say, 25 years ago. But with Japanese food becoming more popular, now it’s perfectly acceptable. Lots of people like to eat like raw, raw fish. \n\nAbidemi: Okay. Okay. I think, if you say, if you say something it’s healthy, it can quickly gain in popularity. \n\nRory: Yeah. Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Rory: Hi, Abidemi. \n\nAbidemi: Hi Rory. \n\nRory: So I was thinking about food in different countries. \n\nAbidemi: Oh, my favorite topic. \n\nRory: Yeah. \n\nAbidemi: I love eating. \n\nRory: Okay. Some countries have foods which other countries seem to find a bit strange. Okay. Something in England which people find quite odd which we think is perfectly normal is do you know lasagna? \n\nAbidemi: Yes. \n\nRory: The Italian food, lasagna?\n\nAbidemi: Yes, I do. \n\nRory: In England, if you go to a pub, it’s always served with chips – French fries. So lasagna and French fries together. \n                                And people just seem to think this is weird, but in England it’s completely normal. So I was wondering if you’d come across anything similar to that in countries you’d visited or even in your own country. \n\nAbidemi: All right. I think for me, when I was in Japan, I had – they have the combination of bread and noodles. So they would have noodles inside of bread, which to me is strange because it’s carbohydrates plus carbohydrates. \n\nRory: Well, that’s quite similar to lasagna and chips, isn’t it? \n\nAbidemi: You’re right. You’re right. I would expect bread with hamburger or something more proteinous. But yeah – so that’s strange. And I’ve also heard in Thailand, they have corn on ice cream. \n\nRory: Yeah, I tried that. \n\nAbidemi: How was it? \n\nRory: It was strange. It was really strange because like in England, we always think corn is something you have with your main course even though it’s very sweet. But actually, it matches quite well with ice cream, but it looks strange because it’s unexpected. \n\nAbidemi: Interesting. Interesting. Maybe a bit like in Japan – back to Japan again, where they have mayonnaise on their pizza. And at the beginning for me too it was very strange when I first tried it. But now, I think from that experience, I’ve grown used to put in mayonnaise on my pizza, and actually love it. \n\nRory: Okay, yeah. I haven’t caught to that one yet. \n\nBut I know when I went to Belgium, in Belgium, they always have French fries with mayonnaise. \n\nAbidemi: Okay. \n\nRory: And again, when I first tried it, it seemed very strange because in the UK we always have chips with ketchup. \n\nAbidemi: I see. \n\nRory: But with mayonnaise, it’s actually pretty good. \n\nAbidemi: Yeah. I think so, too. I think what I like is French fries, mayonnaise, and ketchup. \n\nRory: Together? \n\nAbidemi: Together. \n\nRory: You mix the ketchup and the mayonnaise. \n\nAbidemi: I do, yes. You should try it sometimes. \n\nRory: I will try it, but I do think that’s a bit strange. Okay. \n                                So in Nigeria, are there any foods, which to you are normal but maybe you think people from other countries might find a bit strange? \n\nAbidemi: I think the whole idea of eating with their hands, and also the fact that we eat a lot of – I don’t know how say it, describe it but solid food, we call it. \n\nRory: Right. \n\nAbidemi: So we have food that’s made from yam like we call it pounded yam. A lot of food that’s made from – it’s hard to describe. So they’re like solid. They're kind of like mash potatoes but thicker. \n\nRory: Right. So a yam is a type of potato? \n\nAbidemi: A cousin of potatoes, I would say. Kind of but it’s starchier than potatoes. So we have a lot of food that’s made in that way. So to people that might not be used to that, they find it quite strange that we’re eating something so starchy and thick. So I think we have that. \nAbidemi: One thing that’s strange to us from the Japanese side is eating raw food. \n\nRory: Right. \n\nAbidemi: Like raw meat or raw fish, raw fish especially. For us, even vegetables, we don’t – that’s another thing actually. And almost anything that’s raw, we don’t really like. I remember the first time I had salad. It was “What is this? Am I an animal? Why am I eating uncooked carrots or lettuce?” So it needs to be cooked. \n\nRory: Right. \n\nAbidemi: Maybe it goes back to our history. If you don’t cook, we didn’t have a lot of refrigeration so maybe we’re still in that mode a little bit. If you don’t cook it, it’s not as healthy. So we always want to cook it and make sure it’s hot or spicy. \n                                So I think maybe that would be it. Raw food, raw vegetable, we’re still kind of like, “No,” I think.\n\nRory: So one thing, when I first came to Japan, I used to – I mean, in England, people often eat rice with something else. So they might put soy sauce on it. They might have it fried, like an egg fried rice or something. And it was strange for me to eat plain rice when I first came here. \n\nAbidemi: Actually, I had a similar experience too when I was in Japan. I remember the first time they served me rice, just plain rice. In Nigeria, maybe now it’s changing a little bit, but in Nigeria, eating plain, white rice is the epitome of poverty. You have no money; you have nothing but plain rice. \n                                So for me, it was like, “Whoa, what is this? This is really strange. I need to put something on this rice.” And when I did that, I think I kind of like saw the Japanese people around me…\n\nRory: Yeah. They never do it, do they? \n\nAbidemi: No, they don’t. Yeah. \n\nRory: The other thing is if you put soy sauce on rice, it makes it really difficult to eat with chopsticks. \n\nAbidemi: That’s true. That’s true. It’s not as sticky anymore. \n\nRory: Yeah. So in England we just use a fork. I think if you use the fork for your rice in Japan, probably, also you might cause a bit of a scandal. \n\nAbidemi: A little bit. I think the longer you live in that country, the more you’re expected to eat chopsticks, right?\n\nRory: You’re right. Yeah. \n\nAbidemi: At least, you’ll be able to. Yeah. But now I think I’m more used to it. I can eat white rice with something on the side, of course. But not necessarily with the sauce or something on top of it. Yeah.",

So yeah, I think I'm quite good at sports. \nAbidemi: Wow. \nRory: How about you? \nAbidemi: No, not really. It's something that I never really practiced when I was a child so I'm not really good at sports. But when people look at me, they always say, \"You look like you can run so fast. You look like you can play all these sports.\" I can run, but I don't do it often or played so many sports. Yup.\nRory: Okay. And are you good at math? \nAbidemi: Yes. I feel like I'm bragging when I say that but I enjoy math. And when I was in school, I did well in it. I think up to high school level math, I'm good. What about you, Rory? \nRory: Yeah, the same. So I think I'm quite good at math. I enjoyed it at high school but I didn't do it after that. Now I help my daughter with her math homework, and yeah, I think I'm pretty good. \nAbidemi: Lucky her. \nRory: And how about computers? Are you good at computers?\nAbidemi: I think I have the basics down. So I'm good at the basic things in computers. But overall, when it gets too complicated, I'm not too good at it. What about you, Rory? \nRory: Yeah, I'm okay. I can use a computer but I can't – I'm not good at programming, things like this, you know. I don't understand this. \nAbidemi: I think this is a big one for people. Are you good at getting up early? \nRory: I'm really good at getting up early. \nAbidemi: How early? \nRory: You know 5:00 or 6:00 o'clock is no problem for me. \nAbidemi: Wow. \nRory: And I think it's because ever since I was young, I've always got up early. I used to do a paper round when I was a kid. \nAbidemi: I see. \nRory: I get up before 6:00 o'clock. So how about you? Are you good at getting up early?\nAbidemi: No, not really. I like to sleep in. Especially when it's winter, I'm not good at getting up early at all. My body just wants to sleep the whole day. In the summer, I'm a lot better with the sun. \nRory: Okay.",

I think it's too bad. I think that it's really important for students to take these art classes or music classes. I think it's important for adults to be well-rounded. Even though math and science are so important, I think it's also important that we know a little bit about poetry and art and music and things like that. \nJohn: Yeah. So in these schools where art programs and music programs are being cut, maybe sometimes they still have clubs so students can join the music club after school. But I think it's not enough. Students should have the option of taking band class during school. Maybe they can't stay after school and join a club. \nSarah: Yeah, that's right. You say they should have the option. But I think students should be required to take a few classes like that. \nJohn: Oh, that's a good idea. \nSarah: Uh-hmm. \nJohn: Do you think that students should be required to try all of those classes? \nSarah: Maybe. I think so, but of course, maybe they don't have time to take a full year of art class. But I think they can take a class where they can study art and music and things like that. \nJohn: And poetry and theatre.\nSarah: Yes, all together. \nJohn: Oh, that's a good idea. \nSarah: I think maybe it's related. Even in elementary school these days in America, they're making recess time so short. They say, \"We don't have time for recess, for art class, for music. We have to focus on math and science and reading.\" But I think students won't listen and learn as well if they don't have time to play or sing or dance. \n recess and they said, \"Before kids can play by themselves, they must run three laps on the track.\" \nSarah: Oh. \nJohn: So they took away the gym class and they take away the free time. \nSarah: Boy, I don't want to go that school.\nJohn: Yeah.",

        "transcript": "John: So Sarah, do you play any musical instruments? \nSarah: Yeah. I play two. I love to play the guitar. I started playing in college, and I like to play the piano, too. I started learning the piano when I was really young. How about you? \nJohn: Oh that's interesting. For me, I started playing the trumpet when I was really young, and I don't play it much anymore. But I started playing the piano when I finished high school, and I still play it now. \nSarah: Oh wow. So you started learning the piano when you were older. \nJohn: Yes. \nSarah: Do you think people can start to learn an instrument at any age? \nJohn: Yes, I think so. Do you have a theory about that? \nSarah: Yeah. I think that if people start to play an instrument when they're older, I think they enjoy it more because they chose to learn it. And I think they're going to play it longer. But if you have to learn an instrument when you're younger, I think you won't continue playing it. \nJohn: Oh, because you have to practice for homework or something like that. \nSarah: Yeah. I have five brothers. And we all learned how to play the piano, but as soon as my brothers graduated from high school and went away, they stopped playing the piano. And they don't play it now. In fact, they forgot everything. \nJohn: Oh, wow. \nSarah: Yeah. \nJohn: Well, I do think that music education is very important for children because reading sheet music is like reading a language. And children can learn it much easier than adults learn. So no matter what instrument you play, if you're a child you learn how to read music. \nSarah: And I think too, it's really important for kids to be a part of a group like that. For example, singing in the choir or playing music in the orchestra, I think it's really good for kids to learn to work together and make music as a team. I have some really good memories about being a young kid in the orchestra. \nJohn: Me too. I was also in choir and orchestra and marching band. So I don't play the orchestra instruments anymore and I don't play the marching band instruments anymore but I'm very glad that I had the experience of learning to read music and learning to work together as a team. \nSarah: That's true. Me too. Okay. I changed my mind. Even little kids, they should learn how to play a musical instrument.",

        "transcript": "Widuri: Now, can you tell me more about another famous place in Sri Lanka?\nDanu: Sure. As I mentioned before, Sri Lanka is a beautiful island. \nWiduri: Yes. \nDanu: So Tooth Relic and the city of Kandy is right in the middle of Sri Lanka. \nWiduri: Oh, I see. \nDanu: If you go to the coastal area, there are so many beautiful beaches. \nWiduri: Wow. \nDanu: And I will talk about the place called Marble Beach. \nWiduri: Marble Beach. \nDanu: Why do you think we call it the Marble Beach? \nWiduri: Marble Beach. Maybe because the sands look like marble?\nDanu: Exactly. When you get in the sea, the sea bed looks like exactly like marble. \nWiduri: Wow. \nDanu: It's so blue, it shines when the sun is bright. You can see even from far away the blue sea bed of Marble Beach.\nWiduri: Wow. \nDanu: And the best thing about the Marble Beach is for about 1 kilometer, the depth of water is the same. It's really, really shallow. \nWiduri: Oh yeah? \nDanu: So nobody drowns if you swim in Marble Beach. You can swim even if you cannot swim. \nWiduri: Oh really? \nDanu: Yes. And since Sri Lanka is a tropical country, if it is not the rainy season, Marble Beach will be filled with people from outside Sri Lanka as well as with the people from Sri Lanka, local people and foreign people because tourists, they love to do sun bathing. \nWiduri: Yeah, they are. Have you visited that Marble Beach? \nDanu: Yes, so many times. Usually, my friends and we do road trips to this place because the road to Marble Beach is very beautiful and especially, there is no police in this area so you can drive freely. \nWiduri: Oh I see. So you mentioned that Kandy is in the middle of Sri Lanka and this one is in the southern part. \nDanu: No. Kandy is in the central part of Sri Lanka and Marble Beach in northeastern part of Sri Lanka. \nWiduri: Is it far? \nDanu: It is roughly 170 kilometers from my city.\nWiduri: Oh, not so far. Interesting. Any other famous place near those two places? \nDanu: Oh yes, sure. Near Marble Beach, there's another Hindu temple. \nWiduri: Okay. \nDanu: And the landscape of this temple is very interesting because in Sri Lanka, usually, around the beach, around the coastal area, there are no highlands or mountains. But this exact Hindu temple is situated on a little mountain right next to Marble Beach. And if you look down from the Hindu temple, it's like a cliff. It's like a straight fall into the water. \nWiduri: Wow. \nDanu: So there had been people jumping off from here and trying to suicide as well. \nWiduri: Oh really? \nDanu: As an offering to the god. \nWiduri: Wow. \nDanu: Yeah. \nWiduri: That's a bit scary. But it's so interesting. So near that Marble Beach, we have the beautiful cliff plus the Hindu temple. \nDanu: That's true. \nWiduri: Very interesting. Wow, I definitely want to go there. I will stay at your house and then we go to both…\nDanu: Temple of the Tooth Relic…\nWiduri: Yes, and then…\nDanu: And the Marble Beach.\nWiduri: The Marble Beach and then to the Hindu temple. \nDanu: Definitely, I'll be your guide. \nWiduri: Oh thank you, Danu.\nDanu: Thank you, Widuri.",

        "transcript": "Katie: So, we're talking about going local as we're in a different country. How much of the local culture do you absorb? How much, like local ... cause we both live in Japan right? How much in percentage for example? How much Japanese food would you say you eat?\nGilda: Oh, I would say probably like 80% of my food is Japanese food. Yeah, I like it because most of it is healthy and it's actually like what I can get in the cafeteria at work so ...\nKatie: That's convenient. \nGilda: It's convenient. What about you?\nKatie: I mostly make my own food, and Japanese food is really difficult to make I think. I'm really challenged when it comes to cooking anyway. I'm really bad a cooking. And to have to try to learn a new style of cooking is just too much for me. I'm really lazy. So I would probably say if I'm cooking food myself, I never cook Japanese food. Zero percent of the time. I never, but if I go to a restaurant then sure, I can eat Japanese food sometimes. \nGilda: I sometimes watch the TV and learn how to cook Japanese food. There's some easy recipes. Do you ever watch that - Japanese television?\nKatie: I try, but like you said there's a lot of cooking programs\nGilda: That's what I was about to say, there's tons of cooking TV shows, programs. \nKatie: And I watch cooking programs and I just get angry that I can't cook! I can't do it like that so I get frustrated, so I stop watching. \nGilda: Yeah, I see.\nKatie: What about other kinds of shows? Like, not just cooking shows?\nGilda: Well, they have, I guess they have pretty funny shows, but I don't understand what they're saying, but I try to follow them, and yeah, sometimes they are very interesting. They also talk about the clothing season, what's trending in Japan. What young would people would do, and they have some interviews sometimes, and they're always teaching you something, so that's something I like about Japanese TV, you always learn something, from other countries as well. That's true. \nKatie: That's true. So how about your friendship circle? How much percent of your friends would you say are Japanese versus International?\nGilda: Oh, I would say probably 40% are Japanese. Yeah, the rest of them are international people cause I work with intenational people, so I spend most of the time with them. \nKatie: And when you're with your Japanese friends, so you speak mostly in English, or mostly in Japanese?\nGilda: Oh, I would say like probably 70% Japanese and the rest would be English because normally when they know a second language, it's English not Spanish, so I like zero percent Spanish, a lot of Japanese, but yeah like I would say 70% of the conversation is in Japanese also because I want to practice my Japanese.\nKatie: Right.\nGilda: What about you?\nKatie: Well, I would say out of my friends, recently, I've had like no time to socialize, so probably like 30% of my friends are Japanese, but when I speak with them it's mostly in Japanese. I don't like speaking in English. For me, for the same reasons as you, like, I want to practice my Japanese\n\nGilda: But I would say that from my Japanese friends, like most of them, probably like 80% of them always want to speak in English because they want to practice English too, so it's like a give-and-take, like we speak a little bit in Japanese, but sometimes we speak more in English. It depends also the topic and what you're talking about. \nKatie: If it's a topic you can talk about, then, yeah, go for it in Japanese, but if it's a difficult topic ...\nGilda: Yes, exactly, yeah!",

I hope in the future I can be a math teacher. \nSarah: That sounds interesting. \nJohn: Yes, I think so.

Do you study online?\nJohn: That's exactly right. I study online from various websites and these websites connect you to free online courses from real universities around the world. \nSarah: Oh wow. \nJohn: Yeah. So I signed up for a free algebra class from a university in the United States. \nSarah: Will you get a degree when you finish? \nJohn: Well you can. For every course you finish you can get a certificate that says you passed this course. And if you sign up for a series of courses, you can get a certification in a field like math or science.\n                              Sarah: Oh really? And it's all online?\nJohn: Yeah. And it's not only math or science, you can choose any field you want. I've been thinking of studying Spanish language there and you can study computer programming or history or law. \nSarah: Oh, interesting. Maybe I'll try it. \nJohn: You should. They have different types of classes. You can study by yourself by watching videos or you can even have an interactive class with a real teacher and you can meet through video chat. \nSarah: Wow.

        "transcript": "Sarah: So do you think we should sent people to Mars or Moon to spend all this money on space travel?\nJohn: Well, I think we should. Space travel can give people hope for the future, and space travel can unite people from different countries for a common goal.\nSarah: But do any countries work together to travel in space?\nJohn: Oh certainly. The International Space station has astronauts from different countries working together. And I think that a joint effort is the best way to do space missions. I think that we could go back to the Moon and learn much more by going there than we can learn if we don't go there.\nSarah: I see what you mean, but I think we could learn more and we could improve more if we can help the people on Earth. Think of everything we could learn from the children that can't get an education these days. Maybe the next Einstein is a poor little girl who doesn't have the money to go to school. If we spent more money on school or clean water and vaccines, maybe we could learn more from ourselves than from going to space and going to Mars. \nJohn: I agree with you that more should be spent on education, but we don't need the next Einstein if were not doing space travel. The problem is what are people with money willing to spend it on. I think that it would be nice if we could have all the rich countries spend money on education for poor people, but if you look at the numbers, the cost of one space mission is much cheaper than the things we spend money on now.\nSarah: Like what?\nJohn: Well, the first example that comes to mind is war. One day of war is so expensive for all the governments and the militaries that are involved. One day of war costs more money than one space mission. But war goes on and on for days.\nSarah: Yeah, and years.\nJohn: So, if you think about money in terms of ... sorry ... so the money for a space mission is expensive by itself, but when you compare it to other things it's actually kind of cheap. \nSarah: I see what you're saying. You're comparing the cost of space travel to war, but I would compare the cost of space travel to the cost of, for example, getting rid of malaria. I think we could get rid of a terrible disease like malaria for as much as we would spend on a trip to Mars.\nJohn: Getting rid of malaria or going to Mars? Well, of course I would also choose that we get rid of malaria.\nSarah: Maybe we'll have to agree to disagree.\nJohn: We might have to disagree this time.\nSarah: OK.",

In the soil on Mar's surface the found frozen water. Now they found evidence of liquid water flowing.\nSarah: Do you think people can go to Mars? Do you think we should send people to Mars?\nJohn: I definitely think we can go there. We've already sent a number of spacecraft to Mars, starting with satellites many decades ago. Then there were landers, where satellites landed on the surface and sent data back to Earth. Then we sent the rovers. Little robot cars that drive around on Mars, so we've already successfully sent many missions to Mars. I'm sure we can do it with humans.\nSarah: But none of the satellites or landers or rovers, they've never come back. Do you think we could send people and they'd come back safely?\nJohn: Well, that is a problem. We could definitely send people to Mars, but bringing them back, having the astronauts come back to Earth, would be a much more difficult problem to solve. \nSarah: So you think maybe we would send astronauts to Mars? They would never come back safely?\nJohn: Well, if you think about the old explorers, in the olden days ... explorers used to leave their home, and find new regions and not plan to go back. People used to take a risk, and maybe they couldn't return, so I think there are people who are willing to go on a one-way trip to Mars. I'm sure there are people willing to do that, but are the rest of the people willing to send someone on that mission? I think some people will say yes, and some people will say no. I don't know what the percent would be, but I'm willing to allow someone to do that. If someone says I want to go to Mars. I know it's a one-way trip, but I want to go. I think that's OK. We should let them go.\nSarah: How about you? Would you volunteer to go?\nJohn: Oh, no. Not me. I'm staying here on Earth.\nSarah: OK.",

        "transcript": "Aimee: How about you? Have you ever cheated on a\n                              test, Gilda? \nGilda: I did. I did once in junior high school,\n                              too. Probably, I was 12 or 13. I remember this test\n                              about art, plastic art or something like that subject.\n                              And I forgot. And when I got to school and everybody was\n                              telling me, \"Today we have a test.\" I was like, \"Oh no,\n                              I didn't have time to study.\" So I tried to keep my\n                              notebook open under my chair. \nAimee: Sneaky. \nGilda: Yes. And when I was trying to look at it,\n                              the teacher caught me and she gave me a zero. \nAimee: Oh, a well-deserved zero, I believe. \nGilda: Yes. But I didn't, you know, I didn't\n                              look at it but yeah, it was really a bad experience. And\n                              after that, I decided not to do it anymore. \nAimee: You learned from that experience it\n                              sounds like. \nGilda: I learned from that, yes. \nAimee: You know, once –\nGilda: Actually it's better to – if you approach\n                              the teacher and you say, \"Oh teacher, I didn't have time\n                              to study or I forgot, is there any chance I could take\n                              this test later?\" Maybe they might consider your request\n                              if you are a good student, of course.\nAimee: Yes. That depends on your attitude\n                              leading up to the test, doesn't it? \nGilda: Yes, exactly. \nAimee: I mean, if you're a terrible student, a\n                              teacher is not likely to give you a chance, I think.\n                              Once –\nGilda: Yeah. How about you? \nAimee: Well, not exactly cheating but once in an\n                              exam in university, my – I had a nosebleed all over my\n                              exam paper. \nGilda: Gross.\nAimee: And I just stood up and left. I was a bit\n                              upset and I stood up and I left. And I just went home\n                              and didn't deal with that appropriately. And the examiner obviously got worried because she stood up and\n                              realize my exam paper had blood on it. So she called my\n                              house looking for me and I had to retake – I had to\n                              reset the test, the exam at the end of summer. \nGilda: Okay. But at least you got…\nAimee: So it was a biological sort of a pass, I\n                              guess. \nGilda: Yes. Interesting. \nAimee: A bit disgusting really, isn't it for the\n                              poor examiner to be met with it. \nGilda: Yeah. You should have taken it with you,\n                              the test instead of –\nAimee: The test? \nGilda: Instead of returning it with your blood\n                              on it. \nAimee: Yeah, I should have taken it, shouldn't\n                              I? But maybe I would be accused of cheating if I did\n                              that. \nGilda: Yes. Yeah. But that happens though. I've\n                              seen students with nose bleeding. \nAimee: They're rare for me. I was very\n                              surprised. That's why I was upset because I don't get\n                              nosebleeds. But suddenly, that day, I did very suddenly.\n                              It was very surprising. A real shock. \nGilda: I see. Aimee, you got children, right? \nAimee: Uh-hmm. \nGilda: How would you feel if you caught them\n                              cheating or if you heard that they were cheating on a\n                              test? \nAimee: Oh, that's a good question. I guess I\n                              would be upset emotionally. I would have to – I'd have\n                              to talk to talk to them and find out their reasons for\n                              it, why are they cheating. Why did they – I find out if\n                              it was cheating because of panic, because they haven't\n                              managed to study or cheating because they just don't\n                              want to do the work. So I think you have to find the\n                              motivation for it and take it from there, I guess. \nGilda: You know, sometimes when we ask them or\n                              when we tell them that, they are like, \"But you did that\n                              once. I'm sure you did that once.\" So how do you think\n                              you will deal with that if your daughter says to you,\n                              \"I'm sure you did it once. Why are you blaming me now?\"\nAimee: I think I have to divert that question\n                              away, I think. It's not about me though, is it? It's\n                              about you right now. \nGilda: Exactly. Yes, yes. \nAimee: I'm finished with school, unfortunately.\n                              So I think that would be my strategy. I would divert the\n                                attention away.\nGilda: Yes. \nAimee: I think, you know, remaining calm about\n                              these things is probably the best way to go because I\n                              know my daughter would fully expect me to be livid about\n                              being caught cheating on a test. So I think I would have\n                              to surprise her and remain calm because I get really\n                              grumpy with her anyway over stupid things. So I think\n                              she – if I stay calm and I talk to her about it, she\n                              thinks rationally. \nGilda: Yeah. I think it's the best thing. \nAimee: Yes.",

        "transcript": "Aimee: Hey, Gilda. We're both teachers. I have a\n                              question. Have you ever caught a student cheating on a\n                              test? \nGilda: Many times. \nAimee: Oh my goodness. \nGilda: Yes. And I don't know other countries but\n                              Venezuela, it's pretty common especially in high school. \nAimee: Is it? \nGilda: Yes. And when it comes to the time of midterms, we have to be ready. We have to create like\n                              five models of the same test to avoid any cheating\n                              events during the test. \nAimee: Really? \nGilda: Yes. Also, they come up with all some\n                              sort of supporting material to the class that… Yeah,\n                              every day something new, like nowadays, with the use of\n                              cellphones and smart phones in the class they do\n                              incredible things. So we have to be like police officers\n                              during the midterm, checking their hands, their pockets,\n                              their hair, because some girls with long hair, they\n                              paste a piece of paper, they glue it to their hair. \nAimee: Oh my goodness. \nGilda: And they are like looking at it. Yeah. So\n                              they're experts in, yeah, in cheating. \nAimee: It sounds really common. So you've had to deal with that quite a lot. \nGilda: Yes, yes. Just based on my experience. So\n                              all these cases, I've had them in my class. Yes. \nAimee: And what – how did you deal with that?\n                              What do you do when you catch a student cheating? \nGilda: Well, it's very uncomfortable because you\n                              have to stop the class. And so, the students are, some\n                              of them, like, most of them are concentrated in the\n                              test. And then you have to stop and call their\n                              attention, normally, out loud because otherwise if you\n                              go like slowly, quiet, they might carried off of the\n                              paper or whatever they have. So yeah. But then, you kind\n                              of gotten used to it and teachers ask them to leave the\n                              classroom. \nBut nowadays, with the law, with this new law we got in\n                              teenagers and children in Venezuela, so if you caught\n                              students with a piece of paper cheat sheet, you have to\n                              take it from him or her and ask them to continue with\n                              the test. \nAimee: Okay. \nGilda: Or just like eliminate those parts with\n                              the answers that a person had on their paper. Yeah. \nAimee: Sounds like you're still giving them an\n                              opportunity to continue then.\nGilda: Yes, yes. Exactly. Although, like you\n                              feel really upset, you kind of understand like, okay,\n                              give me that please continue to do your best. That is\n                              what we are supposed to do. Yeah.",

It's\n                                like too hot. Like if I eat a piece of chocolate, I need\n                                to drink a lot of water. \nKatie: Wow. \nGilda: It feels – I don't like it. Yeah. \nKatie: I will gladly eat all your chocolate. If\n                                you have chocolate you don't want, I'm here. \nGilda: Yeah. It's weird because when, you know,\n                                chocolate is very popular as a gift. Somebody is always\n                                giving you chocolate and I take it because I don't want\n                                to say to everybody like, \"I hate chocolate actually.\"\n                                But yeah, what about you? What's something you don't\n                                really like? \nKatie: Well, I have something I don't like that\n                                I think is really popular. And every time I say I don't\n                                like it, I always get the same like, \"What?\" kind of\n                                reaction, but I don't like ice cream. \nGilda: What? \nKatie: I don't like ice cream. I don't think\n                                food should be that cold. I don't like it. Food\n                                shouldn't be too cold to eat. \nGilda: Really?\nKatie: It's just not…\nGilda: You don't know what you're missing. Ice\n                                creams are really, really good especially in summer. \nKatie: Chocolate is really good. Chocolate, I'll take chocolate over ice cream any day.\nGilda: Well, you can try chocolate ice cream. \nKatie: Oh, chocolate ice cream is the worst.\n                                Chocolate ice cream is the worst. No, thank you. \nGilda: What about a second one? Do you have any\n                                second food that you don't like? \nKatie: I don't like tomatoes. Which is strange because I eat lots of\n                                pasta with tomato-flavored stuff in it. But just\n                                tomatoes by themselves is not something I enjoy.\n                                Whenever I have like a hamburger with a tomato, I always\n                                have to take it out and give it to someone else. Just, I\n                                don't like it. It's just juicy and not in a good juicy way. \nGilda: I don't like garlic. \nKatie: You don't like garlic? \nGilda: I like garlic in food but I don't like to\n                                see it or eat it and have this, the taste of garlic, I\n                                don't like it. \nKatie: Once you've got the taste of garlic, you\n                                don't get rid of that for about three days. \nGilda: Exactly. That's another thing. Yeah. So\n                                when my mom is cooking and using garlic, she ... after that,\n                                she had to remove it. She cannot leave any evidence that\n                                she was using garlic in her food. Yes. \nKatie: Is there another food that you don't\n                                like? \nGilda: I would say sprouts, Brussel sprouts. \nKatie: Yeah. No one likes sprouts. \nGilda: Yes. It's bitter and even though some\n                                people say it's good for your body, I don't like them. \nKatie: I think, yeah, sprouts are just universally hated. No one like sprouts. \nGilda: Yeah. But when you are a child, your\n                                parents, for some reason always giving you that.\nKatie: Yeah. Cruel.\nGilda: Yeah. I don't like it. It looks like – I feel like a cow eating those things. Yeah. \nKatie: Yeah. I can imagine. It's just—ugh!\nGilda: What about you? Any other? \nKatie: I have one more but it's really strange.\n                                I've never actually eaten them but looking at them makes\n                                me really uncomfortable, and that's olives. I hate\n                                olives. \nGilda: No. I love them. \nKatie: I can't stand olives. Just looking at\n                                them makes me want to scream.\nGilda: Really?\nKatie: Like I think it's the hole. I don't like\n                                the hole in olives. I'm like scared of olives. It's\n                                really strange, but no. \nGilda: I like them. \nKatie: You can have my olives.\nGilda: Very tasty green, black.\nKatie: No. If I see them in a jar at the\n                                supermarket—\nGilda: Better than chocolate. \nKatie: Just no. No. No, no, no. I don't like\n                                them. Scared of olives. It's the craziest thing ever but\n                                no. I don't like olives. Keep them away from me. \nGilda: Good.",

        "transcript": "Katie: So what are three foods that you                absolutely have to have that you can't live without? \nGilda: I would say that I could not live without arepa. It's like my daily breakfast in Venezuela. \nKatie: What's that? \nGilda: Arepa is made of corn flour, and it looks\n                                like a hamburger. So you put anything you want inside\n                                and it's very tasty. And I would say like 95 percent of\n                                Venezuelans eat arepas every day. Well, it's kind of like a high-carb diet in my country.\n                                So I need rice also for lunch, and bread. Bread is\n                                another thing. In the afternoon, a piece of bread, sweet\n                                bread with coffee is kind of like mandatory. \nKatie: So lots and lots of carbs in your diet. \nGilda: Yes. What about you? What about in\n                                England? \nKatie: Well, English breakfast is not the\n                                healthiest of breakfast. It's like a big plate with\n                                fried eggs, fried sausages, hash browns, like hash\n                                potatoes, beans, just everything fried and everything\n                                delicious. And I would say that I can't live without that, but if I ate it every day, then I would probably\n                                not be able to leave my house because I would be so, so\n                                fat. But it's definitely a food that is in my top foods of all time. That's probably my favorite. But recently, I've been eating lots of tofu. It's\n                                breakfast. \nGilda: Oh, okay. \nKatie: Yeah. So a little bit of tofu, a little\n                                bit of soy sauce just for breakfast, which is just –\n                                it's a bit of a boring breakfast. But it's really\n                                healthy, I guess. So I've been eating that a lot every\n                                day. So I probably can't live without that recently. And also, pizza. Pizza. \nGilda: Oh, pizza. Yes, very good. \nKatie: Pizza. I think everyone can't live\n                                without pizza. \nGilda: Yes. \nKatie: Pizza is the best. Pizza is definitely a\n                                food that I can't live without. \nGilda: Yeah, I try to have pizza probably once a\n                                week, I would say. Yeah. \nKatie: What's your favorite topping? \nGilda: That would be cheese. \nKatie: Cheese. Classic. \nGilda: Definitely. Bacon. \nKatie: Cheese and bacon. Oh it sounds good. \nGilda: Yes. Very, very tasty. \nKatie: Just cheese and bacon or anything else? \nGilda: No, no. I'm going for anything actually\n                                but I will always need to have cheese and bacon on my\n                                pizza. \nKatie: Pizza is not pizza without cheese. \nGilda: Yes. Yes. \nKatie: It has to have cheese. \nGilda: So what else do you have? So you said\n                                tofu, pizza, what other food can you live without? \nKatie: Well, my grandma is part Italian. So we\n                                have lots of like pasta and lasagna in our family.  So I try and eat – well, I try not to eat\n                                a lot of pasta because I'll get really fat. But pasta is\n                                definitely something that I can't live without. So good. \nGilda: Yeah. Italian food is so good. \nKatie: Yeah. And again, lots of cheese. \nGilda: Yeah. We also do a lot of lasagna but,\n                                well, we call it pasticho.\nKatie: Pasticho. \nGilda: It's a different name but it's the same\n                                lasagna. And it's also very tasty. \nKatie: So good. \nGilda: Yeah. But high fat food. \nKatie: So like a real like comfort food, isn't\n                                it? Lasagna. \nGilda: Yeah. Yeah. \nKatie: So good. So what would you say is your\n                                comfort food? \nGilda: My comfort food – that would be arepa,\n                                again. Yeah, definitely. \nKatie: You said you're going to have lots of\n                                like fillings in that. \nGilda: Yes. So my favorite would be black beans\n                                with cheese inside. It sounds a little bit like a mix up\n                                of things but it's really, really tasty. We do eat a lot\n                                of black beans every day in Venezuela. It's very common.\n                                What about you? \nKatie: My comfort food, I can't eat it as much\n                                as I would like to these days but it's probably my mom's\n                                spaghetti Bolognese. So good. It's so good, like lots of\n                                pasta, lots of tomato, lots of herbs, lots of cheese. \nGilda: Sounds good. \nKatie: It's amazing. I would like live with my\n                                parents if it meant I could have spaghetti Bolognese\n                                every day. So good. So tasty. I think it's the best",

        "transcript": "John: So I was wondering about disciplining kids\n                                in public. You have kids, right? \nSarah: Yeah. I have two kids. I have a\n                                three-year old and a one-year old. \nJohn: Are they ever naughty when you're out in\n                                public? \nSarah: Yes. They are naughty out in public. And\n                                I think that you shouldn't discipline your children in\n                                front of other people. So if I'm out in public and my\n                                three-year old starts to be naughty and she's crying\n                                because she wants a toy from the store or something, I\n                                will pick her up and I take her somewhere quiet until\n                                she's calm. Like I might take her to the family bathroom\n                                or a quiet hallway, so she can stop crying and stop\n                                making noise. \nJohn: I see. So you wouldn't just give her the\n                                toy she wants. \nSarah: No. I don't think you should do that sort of\n                                thing to make your child be quiet, just give them\n                                something until they are quiet because then they'll be\n                                bad more in the future. If they know they can cry and\n                                scream, and mom and dad will give them what they want,\n                                they'll just be worse and worse. \nJohn: Oh, I see. They'll learn that it's okay.\n                                They can get what they want by crying. \nSarah: Yeah. \nJohn: But don't you think you'll – won't you\n                                lose more time if you have to take your kids to some\n                                quiet place to calm down? \nSarah: Yeah. You lose time but I think it's\n                                worth it because I think of the future and the time I'll\n                                save by making sure that my child is better behaved in\n                                the future. And the other thing too is I'm always trying\n                                to think about other people. So I don't want other\n                                people to have to listen to my child scream and cry. And\n                                I also don't want them to see me talking sternly to her\n                                because they'll maybe be annoyed or feel uncomfortable.\n                                And maybe my child will scream more because she can feel\n                                that. So I try to go somewhere quiet. \nJohn: Oh, I see. \nSarah: Sometimes that's impossible though.\n                                Sometimes, if you're on the plane or on a train, you\n                                can't go anywhere or do anything. You have to stay in\n                                your seat. \nJohn: What if you're on an airplane, then do you\n                                give your child whatever they are crying for as soon as\n                                possible? \nSarah: Yes, I do. I try to plan ahead and I\n                                think, okay, I need to have enough toys. I need to have\n                                lots of snacks, lots of fun things so that I prevent\n                                them from becoming naughty or crying or screaming. But\n                                sometimes, you can't help it. And if you're child or\n                                baby starts to be loud at that point, I will. I'll give\n                                them candy or food or toy, whatever they want. \nJohn: Oh, I get it. So I think you're saying,\n                                you think there might be a different reason why kids\n                                become naughty. Besides what they want…\nSarah: Yeah. \nJohn: For example, they're hungry or bored. \nSarah: Yeah. I think a lot of the times,\n                                children are naughty because maybe they're tired or\n                                they're hungry, or they want to play and stretch their\n                                legs but they can't because they're on the plane or\n                                they're in a stroller at the shopping mall. \nJohn: So instead of waiting for bad behavior and\n                                then doing some discipline like yelling at your kids or\n                                grabbing their arms, maybe it's better to prevent bad\n                                behavior by making sure the kids sleep enough and don't\n                                get bored. \nSarah: Yeah. That's what I'm saying. And, you\n                                know, my kids are young. Just three and one. So a\n                                one-year old can't really be naughty. They're just a\n                                baby. So if they need something, I give them food or\n                                what they need. But a three-year old, they can throw a tantrum. And so, they can be very naughty. \nJohn: A tantrum? \nSarah: Yeah. When they scream and maybe they\n                                fall down on the floor, and they kick their legs.\n                                Sometimes they try to hit you. It's really bad. But I\n                                think all two-and-three-year-old children sometimes they\n                                do them. \nJohn: Oh, I've heard of that. It's called the Terrible Two's. \nSarah: Yes. But it also lasts into three. \nJohn: Well, it sounds like you're a good parent. \nSarah: Oh, I try.",

        "transcript": "Katie: So imagine that I was going to go to Venezuela, what are three things that I absolutely have to see if I go there? \nGilda: Well, it depends where you go. But if you go to Caracas, the capital, definitely visit the wealthy side of the city. You can go shopping at very nice shopping malls. And also, you have to go to the disco. There are so many nightclubs.\nKatie: Nice. \nGilda: Enjoy salsa. Yeah. What else? Oh. Well, we are very close to the beach side from the city. So like normally, every weekend, people in Caracas, the capital go to the beach and spend the day there after having – after spending the whole night dancing, so.\nKatie: That sounds amazing. \nGilda: It's like connecting two days. \nKatie: Amazing. \nGilda: Yeah. If you go to the south, definitely you should visit the Canaima National Park. It's a famous park because it has the highest waterfall in the world. It's called Angel Falls. \nKatie: Yeah. \nGilda: Yeah. So, and obviously, if you go there, you will get to see how the indigenous people live and try some of their food. Yeah. Arepa, which is mandatory if you got to Venezuela, you have to eat that.\nKatie: What's that? \nGilda: It's made of corn, yes corn – it's sort of like corn flour. It's only in Venezuela, you can find it. And it's daily breakfast. So like I cannot live without arepas every day. I have to eat it.\nKatie: So is it like a sandwich or…?\nGilda: It looks like a hamburger\nKatie: Okay. \nGilda: And in the middle, like you put stuff in. It could be anything you want; cheese, meat, whatever you want. So there are so many styles of arepas. Yeah. \nKatie: Sounds amazing. And speaking of food, what other Venezuelan food could you recommend? \nGilda: We also eat a lot of empanadas. I think you can find those in all the countries in South America. But every country has their original style.\nKatie: What's that? \nGilda: It's also made from corn flour, and it's baked. Some of them could be fried. And they have meat or chicken inside. It's very tasty. And it's always like a breakfast thing. Yeah.\n\nAlso, if you go there during Christmas, you can try hallaca. It's a traditional dish in Christmas. And it has all the four types of meat. It has pork, it has chicken, beef, fish, plus vegetables. It's very tasty. I know it sounds a little bit like oh, all together, but it's very tasty but you get a lot of weight after Christmas. \nKatie: I can imagine. That's what Christmas is for, right?

        "transcript": "Aimee: So why do you think Britain never wins? Is it because their songs are always terrible? \nKatie: Well, I mean, I disagree as a British person. I think the songs are always awesome, of course. But usually, how people win Eurovision is when you want to vote for a country, you have to ring up. And people always vote for the countries that are next door to them.  So countries that are close to them. So the UK really only has Ireland next door.  So we only really ever get votes from Ireland.  We're not close to any other countries. \nAimee: Not friendly. \nKatie: Not friendly. \nAimee: Yeah. I guess that's it. \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: It's not physical closeness, it's like emotional closeness as well, isn't it? \nKatie: We're not either. We're not physically close or emotionally close to any countries in Europe, so.\nAimee: That's true. \nKatie: We don't get any points. \nAimee: So which countries typically manage to get a lot of votes then? \nKatie: Countries that are in the middle, that have countries all around them. So like Austria has lots of countries surrounding it. Germany has lots of countries surrounding it. Yeah. England just doesn't have a chance of winning. The UK will never win Eurovision song contest ever again. \nAimee: Unless they change their foreign policy, perhaps. \nKatie: Or unless we just move the entire country in the middle of Europe. \nAimee: Well, that's not going to happen, isn't it?\nKatie: We can dream. We can dream. \nAimee: So it's not possible to vote for your own country? \nKatie: No. You can't vote for your own country. You have to vote for any other country except for yours. \nAimee: Oh, I see. \nKatie: Otherwise, Russia would just win it every time. Russia is so big. \nAimee: That's true. I didn't think about that. It has a massive population. So how does it work exactly? You're sitting at home. You're watching the TV, and then you have to pick up the phone and call, is that it?\nKatie: Yeah. When everyone sung their song, they will show you telephone numbers for each country. And you have to choose the country that you liked the best.  And then you call that number, and that counts as one vote for that country.  And then the country that gets the most votes gets 12 points.  And then the next country down gets 10 points and then 8 points, all the way down to 1 point.  But a lot of countries in Eurovision sometimes get 0 points for the entire show. \nAimee: Oh dear. \nKatie: The UK often gets 0 points. \nAimee: Do they? \nKatie: Yes. \nAimee: That's embarrassing, isn't it? \nKatie: Very embarrassing. Very embarrassing. \nAimee: And what is the hosting language?\nKatie: Well, they always speak in English. And usually, the host country will also speak in their language. So if it's France, they'll speak in French. If it's Germany, they'll speak in German. But when they are announcing the points, they'll speak in English and French. \nAimee: English and French only?\nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: Oh that's interesting. And I assume that each individual country who's watching the show has their own presenters speaking in their native languages though. \nKatie: Yes. Yes. \nAimee: To help translate everything. \nKatie: They have their own commentators who will talk throughout the entire show and explain everything. \nAimee: Okay. Wow. It's such a massive scale, isn't it? \nKatie: Yeah. \nAimee: Really huge. \nKatie: It's the best event of the year. My favorite thing ever. \nAimee:  So since you can't vote for the UK, then who do you normally vote for? \nKatie: Well, I normally vote for the country that I thought was the most interesting, which is how I think you should vote in Eurovision. Seeing that it's a singing competition then I think it should be judged on who is singing the best or has the best song or who has the most exciting outfit. But yeah, it changes every – it depends on who I think was the best. \nAimee: Right. That sounds like a good, fair strategy. \nKatie: I think so. I think the rest of Europe should do that as well. \nAimee: Yes. I guess they should.",

And countries from all over Europe have an entry in the competition. \nAimee: Right. \nKatie: So big, big music singing competition. \nAimee: And it's Euro…\nKatie: Eurovision, yeah. \nAimee: Okay. \nKatie: Eurovision, and yeah, every single country in Europe send somebody to sing in the competition. \nAimee: Okay. \nKatie: And all of Europe watches it, and all of Europe votes for a winner, and it's huge. It's huge. \nAimee: It does sound huge, continental competition. \nKatie: Big battle with music. \nAimee: And where is it usually hosted? \nKatie: It's hosted in the country of the previous year's winner. \nAimee: Right. So this year then, do you know where it was? \nKatie: I don't remember who won it last year, but the previous year, two years ago, it was won by someone from Austria. \nAimee: Okay. \nKatie: So last year, the competition was in Austria. \nAimee: Right. That sounds like a wonderful event for the hosting country. \nKatie: Yeah. And I'm from the UK, and the UK hasn't won it in such a long time. And I really, really want to win because I wanted to go and see a live Eurovision competition. \nAimee: Right. So over the – you mentioned that you're such a big fan. Over the Eurovision history, do you have any personal highlights?\nKatie: Probably my favorite entry was from ages and ages ago, before I was even born by an English entry called Bucks Fizz.\nAimee: Okay. \nKatie: They were really awesome. They were singing a great song, and then suddenly, halfway through the song, the boys ripped the girls' skirt off. \nAimee: Oh. \nKatie: Not that way. But they were wearing a long dress and then they were suddenly wearing a skirt. And it was amazing. \nAimee: They kind of costume changed then. \nKatie: Yeah, costume change. And it happened in the '70s, I think, '70s or \nAimee: '80s, maybe?\nKatie: Yeah. And at that time, it was probably the most exciting entry in Eurovision ever. \nAimee: Oh really. \nKatie: It's very exciting. \nAimee: A real shock. \nKatie: Real shock. A big costume change, big drama. \nAimee: And how was the song?\nKatie: Eh. The song was okay. No one remembers the song. Everyone remembers the skirts.\nAimee: Okay. So I take it, they didn't win then? \nKatie: I don't think so. \nAimee: Did they?\nKatie: I don't, I don't know. I can't remember. Also, I remember the costumes but not if they won or not.\nAimee: Yeah. Not the song. \nKatie: Isn't that funny?\nAimee: Costumes, too are important.",

        "transcript": "Sarah: So John, you told me about the paleo diet and what it is. But why did you decide to eat like that?\nJohn: Well, let me tell you. I was feeling sick for a long time. \nSarah: Oh, I'm sorry. \nJohn: Oh, it's okay now. \nThanks though. I started to feel sick three years ago, and then it got worse and worse in my stomach. I had lots of stomach trouble called indigestion, and I didn't know why until I found out that some foods are healthier than others. So that's why I started learning about the paleo diet and eating healthy. I found that we should eat fresh fruits and fresh vegetables and we definitely shouldn't eat fast food. And we shouldn't eat very many snacks either. \nSarah: Oh. \nJohn: And because I was sick with my stomach trouble, I was also feeling depressed. But I learned that our moods and our emotions can be affected by what we eat. \nSarah: Really? \nJohn: Yes. I was very surprised to learn that. But it makes sense because our brain chemistry comes from the foods we eat. When we eat healthy foods, we get good chemistry in our body and our brains can function normally, and we can have good moods and good emotions. \nSarah: So you feel happier and healthier now that you changed your diet. \nJohn: That's true. But changing my diet wasn't enough. Even though I fixed my diet, I still didn't feel 100 percent. So I had to do more research. And I found something else that's very important. \nI didn't realize before but everyone needs to get enough exercise every week. In fact, it's best if you can exercise 30 minutes every day. \nSarah: Everyday? \nJohn: Well, of course you can take a day off. Two days off each week is okay. And you don't have to do very difficult exercise. Just riding a bicycle or jogging is enough. But I also found that having a healthy diet and getting enough exercise is still not enough because you need two more important factors. \nSarah: What are they? \nJohn: One is called stress management. When we feel stressed, our body has a reaction to stress, and it can make you feel sick, and it can put you in a bad mood. So we need to learn ways to manage our stress. So we need to learn how to breathe deeply and relax more. And when we encounter stress, we should learn healthy ways to react and not react in unhealthy ways, such as getting angry or feeling frustrated. \nSarah: What's a healthy way to react? \nJohn: Well first, you should breathe and relax your body by slowing down. And then you should think calmly and clearly about the best way to handle a problem. So don't just worry about the problem and think about what can go wrong, but think calmly about ways to solve problems. \nSarah: Okay. \nJohn: But I found the most important factor in feeling healthy was a big surprise to me. \nSarah: What was it? \nJohn: We need to get enough sleep. \nSarah: Oh. \nJohn: Everyone knows we should sleep more but very few people sleep enough. Most adults should sleep 8 hours every night. I was only sleeping 5 or 6 hours every night. \nSarah: Oh wow. \nJohn: Yeah. So sleeping at night is like recharging your battery, right. So do you have a cell phone? \nSarah: Sure, of course. \nJohn: What do you do when the battery is dead? \nSarah: I plug it in. \nJohn: Yeah. And you need to leave it plugged in until it has a full charge. Well, not sleeping enough is just like unplugging your phone before it's charged. So it's much better to have a healthy diet and get a regular exercise, learn stress management skills, and most importantly, get enough sleep every night. \nSarah: Okay. I'll try hard. Thank you.",

And the idea is that a lot of the problems we have with health, a lot of modern human health problems, come from the foods we eat. So the idea is that maybe we should eat a diet which is closer to what early humans ate before. \nSarah: Early humans ate? Like what did they eat? \nJohn: Well, they mostly ate fruits, and berries, and nuts, and meat. They didn't eat grains because grains come from agriculture, from growing plants on purpose. \nSarah: Uh-hmm. \nJohn: And they didn't eat bread and cake and cookies and crackers. \nSarah: It sounds like a hard diet to keep. \nJohn: It's a little difficult at first. What you have to realize is that these foods are refined foods. Refined foods are not really natural foods because humans have to do a lot of cooking processes to make these foods. \nSarah: Uh-hmm. \nJohn: When you want to eat natural, you should eat food just the way it comes like raw vegetables and fresh fruit and meat that isn't processed. So you can't eat hotdogs. \nSarah: Okay. \nJohn: And sausage. \nSarah: Okay. \nJohn: But you can have steak…\nSarah: It sounds…\nJohn: And fish. \nSarah: It sounds like an expensive diet. \nJohn: Well actually, it turns out that when you eat fresh vegetables and fresh fruits, it can be cheaper. Processed food, refined food, comes in lots of packaging from the store, and sometimes it can be more expensive for convenience. Modern humans eat these processed foods for convenience. You don't have to wash it. You don't have to do the chopping and preparation when you eat refined foods. \nBut when you go on paleo diet, you buy the fruit and you eat it. You buy the vegetables, you have to wash it and chop it and then you eat it. So it's not processed, and it's much healthier for you. \nSarah: How do you feel since you started this diet? \nJohn: I feel much better actually. When we eat carbohydrates, we can feel tired. Carbohydrates are in processed foods like anything that comes from grains. Like I said, bread, cookies, cake, crackers. They have lots of carbohydrates. And when we eat them, our body has to use lots of energy to digest carbohydrates. It takes away energy which could be used for doing activities. That's why if you eat lots and lots of bread and cake, maybe you feel tired. \nSarah: Oh, I see. \nJohn: If you just eat fresh vegetables and fruit, you can feel like you have lots of free energy. \nSarah: Are there any foods that you miss?\nJohn: I think the food I missed the most is pizza. Pizza was my favorite food before. I used to eat pizza three times every week. Now, I rarely eat pizza. Pizza has a crust. The crust is bread, so the crust has lots of carbohydrates. Also, pizza has a lot of processed meats including pepperoni and sausage. Those meats are not very healthy for you. Also, pizza has lots of cheese on it. Cheese is another processed food. So if we cut out pizza from our diet, we can eat healthier and feel like we have more energy. \nSarah: Well, that's great. Thanks for telling me about paleo. \nJohn: You're welcome.",

        "transcript": "Danu: Okay, Widuri. So you are from Indonesia. \nWiduri: Yes. \nDanu: So I would like to hear about some typical Indonesia food. Let's talk about breakfast. \nWiduri: Breakfast. Okay. Let me see. Actually, Indonesian eat rice. We eat rice every day, three times a day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. \nBut there is no specific and typical breakfast actually in Indonesia. For example, in my house, my mom will prepare both bread and rice. And sometimes, we also have porridge. But usually, people will prefer rice rather than bread. But then, we will eat that and drink milk every morning. \nDanu: So what is your favorite breakfast?\nWiduri: My favorite one, I prefer the lighter one, which is bread than strawberry jam, and of course, the milk. \nDanu: Okay. I see. So what about lunch, Widuri, in Indonesia? \nWiduri: But lunch, of course, I will eat rice. In cafeteria, at my school, we have a lot of menus, rice menus. For example, fried rice. That one is very famous in Indonesia. And then rice with curry, rice with soup, rice with chicken, fried chicken. There are a lot of menus actually in Indonesia. But basically, of course, we eat rice. \nDanu: Okay. That's interesting. Do you have any snacks during the evening time? \nWiduri: That's not really common actually. We don't really have snack time or tea time like that in Indonesia. But if you want to have snacks, then the snacks will be traditional foods from Indonesia like cakes. \nDanu: So what kind of cakes are they?\nWiduri: Wow. If I mention the name, it's probably hard to remember, but the name is like kue cubit. Do you know that food? \nDanu: Kue cubit. \nWiduri: Yeah. \nDanu: That's interesting. That sounds very funny. \nWiduri: Yeah. It is. The cake is very small. That's why we call it cubit. It's like you pinch the cake. So small but it's very sweet. You can have chocolate toppings or green tea toppings and strawberry jam on it. \nDanu: I see. So Widuri, could you talk about dinner in Indonesia? \nWiduri: Dinner. Hmm, actually, there are a lot of menus like pasta or rice again or other things. But for me and my family, we usually have fruits and salad for dinner. You know, it's healthy lifestyle. \nDanu: I see. So Widuri, you said you usually eat rice for three times a day. \nWiduri: Yes. \nDanu: So do you eat the same rice with same side dishes or curry or soup? \nWiduri: Yeah. Usually, my mom will cook every morning and then, she will cook again in the afternoon. But usually, same menu. \nDanu: Okay. Widuri, so salad and some fruits. That's interesting. Is it normal in Indonesia? Could you talk a bit about the salad and the fruits? \nWiduri: Yeah. Even though Indonesian eat rice three times a day, but my family prefers a healthier lifestyle such as salad and fruits. \nMy friends also do that, I think, because we don't want to get fat, and fruit and salads for dinner is the best way to keep your body slim. And we usually have salad without toppings. You know, sometimes, the toppings makes you fat. \nDanu: So what kind of salads and what kind of fruits do you eat?\nWiduri: Indonesian is tropical country. There are a lot of fruits like watermelon, apples, oranges. And then we also have srikaya. Do you know srikaya? \nDanu: I have not heard about it before. \nWiduri: Then it's fruit from Indonesia. Its name is srikaya. The shape is like pineapple but it has different taste, of course. It's not sour. It's sweet. Its name is srikaya. \nAnd for salad, we eat the usual salad like lettuce and the tomatoes, something like that mixed with the fruits. \nDanu: Oh, you mix the salad with the fruits. \nWiduri: Yes, of course. \nDanu: That's interesting. So what's your favorite fruit? I mean, fruit. \nWiduri: My favorite fruits will be orange, I think. \nDanu: Okay. Sounds like a healthy way to live. \nWiduri: Yeah. \nDanu: That's why you have such a nice slim figure. \nWiduri: Yeah. Thank you. \nDanu: You are welcome. Thank you very much. \nWiduri: Thank you.",

        "transcript": "Sarah: So John, what do you think about tattoos and piercings? \nJohn: Oh. Well, I think they're okay. Personally, I have my ears pierced, and I have many tattoos. But in the professional world, different people have different ideas. So I had to make sure all of my tattoos can be covered by a t-shirt, so any person who sees me doesn't know that I have any tattoos. \nBut I personally think tattoos are okay. So if I saw a police officer with many tattoos on her arms and her neck, I wouldn't have a problem with it. What about you?\nSarah: Do you think in the future, maybe as you and I grow up, it will become more common to go to the doctor or maybe go to the bank and you see people, and they are professional people, but they have visible tattoos or earrings? \nI also have a tattoo. So I think they're okay. \nJohn: I agree. I think that in the future, it will be more and more commonplace to see people who have visible tattoos and piercings. \nOf course, right now, people are having more and more visible tattoos that are very small. But maybe in the future, tattoos will be bigger and bigger. I think it's the same with piercings. \nNowadays, it's normal to see women and men who have their ears pierced. But it's still not common to see a professional working with their nose pierced or their eyebrows pierced. Maybe in the future that will be common as well. \nSarah: I think so. But one thing that I think won't change is professional clothing. I think these days and the future, I think a nice suit, a professional collared shirt, ironed pants – I think those type of clothes are really important for your job or for the type of job if you want a promotion. \nAnd I think in the future, we'll see people with really nice professional clothing and then they might have visible tattoos or earrings. I think your clothes show how important your job is to you. \nJohn: I see what you're saying. If I was trying to hire a lawyer and I saw two lawyers and both of them had tattoos and their ears pierced, but if one of the lawyers was wearing a suit, even if that person have tattoos and piercings, if they're wearing a suit, I would rather choose that lawyer than someone who had tattoos and piercings who was wearing a t-shirt and shorts. \nSarah: Uh-hmm. \nJohn: So I agree with you that the clothing is more important for professional image. \nSarah: What do you think – these days, some of the computer companies or tech startups, the CEOs are young people and they'll go to work wearing jeans or shorts and a t-shirt. And they like to portray a casual atmosphere through their clothes. What do you think about that? \nJohn: Well, in my opinion, the environment at a job, as long as everyone working there is in the same environment, maybe they should be able to choose what kind of professional attire is appropriate inside of that company. But the problem would arise when those workers have to interact with people from another company. \nSo if another company has a dress code where everyone is wearing suits and these two companies have to work together, there might be a problem. \nSarah: It's strange that clothes seem like they're so important. The knowledge and the product should be important but I think everyone looks at the clothes and makes a judgment. \nJohn: Yeah. It's interesting that we all know the saying \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" but we can't help but do that. Everyone is judging people by what they wear, and that's not going to change. \nSarah: I agree.",

        "transcript": "Sarah: Okay, John, let's talk about fashion. You know, I have students and I think sometimes they don't, they don't dress appropriately for the classroom.\nJohn: Oh yeah. Sometimes, it looks like students are wearing the clothes which they will plan to wear at night, to go out and go to a party with friends. \nSarah: Yeah. So actually, I think school uniforms are great. I would make the teachers wear the school uniform, too. \nJohn: I agree with you. \nSarah: Because I think when we talk about appropriate clothing, I think girls very often take most of the blame for that. But I think it's our society, and we can fix the problem by having a uniform for girls and boys and teachers, and we can feel like part of a team. \nJohn: I know there are a lot of problems of school uniform. First of all, students don't want to all dress the same. \nSarah: Hmm. \nJohn: But there's other problems. Usually, when schools have a uniform, the boys wear pants and the girls have to wear a dress or a skirt. I don't think that's fair. \nSarah: I agree. I don't think that's fair either. I think a lot of schools these days they can let the girls choose. And so the girls can wear shorts or pants. \nJohn: Well, that's good. I think even beyond the pants or a skirt issue, there should be some flexibility to customize your uniform, whether you want to wear shirts that are a different color, even if they're in the same style. Or you want to have some pins or patches or some other accessories. \nSarah: Do you think as a teacher, would you say something to your student if your student if your student came to class and maybe, for example, it was a boy and his pants were very low and you could see his underwear. Or maybe it was a girl and you thought, \"Oh no, her shorts are a little too short.\" What do you think you would do? \nJohn: Hmm, wow, that's a difficult question. I have to say, I don't think I have been in that situation. I guess I'm lucky enough my students haven't pushed the limit too far. But I feel that I would say something if a student came to class in clothing that was, in my opinion, too inappropriate. I would ask them to, probably to, if not leave the class, at least don't wear clothes like that next time. \nWhat about you?\nSarah: Well, I had a student, and he came to class with a jacket. And it looks like a very expensive jacket but it had a very bad word written on the jacket. \nJohn: Oh. \nSarah: And after class finished, I told him to, \"Wait, please.\" And I told him that he probably shouldn't wear that jacket to class, or maybe, he shouldn't wear it anymore at all. It just isn't very appropriate. And he came to class next time and he had the jacket but he had taken it to a shop and they had taken the bad word off of the jacket. \nAnd so, I was very happy to see that, that he changed his behavior and now he could dress the way he liked but also be appropriate. \nJohn: Well, that sounds very good. That's very effective.",

And like the whole country get to see what's happening in this Miss Venezuela organization. And they are always looking for something trendy, like what's popular in America. \nAimee: Okay. \nGilda: If there's a blonde girl or a brunette or – and normally, tall with all the perfect, 90-60-90 – is it?\nAimee: Hmm?\nGilda: 90-60-90 I think is the perfect…\nAimee: Oh, you're talking about measurements?\nGilda: Yeah, the body.\nAimee: Like body size measurements. \nGilda: Yes. Yes. \nAimee: Right. So that's important too, obviously. \nGilda: Yes. Yeah. That's really important. Yeah. Also the hair, the eyes, the teeth, everything. Yeah, so they think about many, many things. \nAimee: So it's all based on physical appearance. \nGilda: Yes, yes. \nAimee: Of course it's a beauty pageant. \nGilda: Of course, they go under a training, I heard, of almost one year. \nAimee: Wow. \nGilda: So they train them in terms of how to express themselves using proper language.\nAimee: Yeah. \nGilda: And yeah, and also beauty; how to make-up, how to fix their hair or something like…\nAimee: Okay. So like maintenance and self –\nGilda: Yes, exactly. \nAimee: Self presentation, I guess. \nGilda: Yes, yes, yes. Yes. \nAimee: Wow. What about – I don't know much about beauty pageants, so but I've heard or I've noticed that you have to have a skill as well, don't you? An extra, a special skill like what's your, what are you going to present to the judges as your additional skill. Is that the case?\nGilda: That's more like American beauty pageants. \nAimee: Okay. \nGilda: So in Venezuela, they are not introduced like, they don't introduce to the audience a skill. \nAimee: Okay. \nGilda: They just go there and do the swimsuit competition and the evening gown. \nAimee: Yeah. \nGilda: And then, a question.\nAimee: Yeah. \nGilda: And then they're crowned. \nAimee: What kind of question might it be?\nGilda: Well, they have many kind of questions but sometimes the questions are really difficult. \nAimee: Yeah. \nGilda: But normally, it's about life, about world peace, about helping others, philanthropic activities. Yeah, that kind…\nAimee: Off the top of your head, can you give an example of a question that…?\nGilda: An example? \nAimee: Yeah. \nGilda: Like once, a girl was asked what's the difference between forgive and asking for permission. Like she had to explain what's the difference when you as for a permission and when you ask for forgiveness. \nAimee: Oh so, it's like a grammar question? \nGilda: Some sort of. The thing is that she fainted. \nAimee: She fainted? \nGilda: Yeah. \nAimee: No. \nGilda: She couldn't answer. It was too much. And because, they're young. I mean, we're talking about girls 17, 18 years old, students. They were wearing lots of things. They're nervous. They're in front of millions of people and…\nAimee: It's a lot of pressure. \nGilda: Yeah. And yeah, maybe you say like, \"Oh, that's an easy question.\" But at that particular moment, it might not be easy. \nAimee: Yeah, of course.\nGilda: And plus, they don't eat because they need to fit in their dress. \nAimee: Oh my goodness. \nGilda: Yeah. \nAimee: That just sounds so intense. \nGilda: It is.

It's like the Super Bowl in America, for Venezuelans it's beauty pageants. \nAimee: Really? \nGilda: The Miss Venezuela, that's how they call it. \nAimee: Oh my goodness. \nGilda: Yeah. \nAimee: Okay. So from what age are children…? \nGilda: It's like almost 90 percent of Venezuelan girls dream of being once in the, in this beauty pageants because once they got in, they get all some sort of surgery and, you know, they make them really, really look beautiful. And then after that they get jobs like models or actress. You know, Venezuela is also into soap operas. \nAimee: Right. \nGilda: So most of them want to be an actress one day. \nAimee: That's so specific though, isn't it? A model or an actress. Ninety percent of the population—of the girls?\nGilda: Yeah. Well, it's because of the economic situation. So it's easy money, in a way. \nAimee: Right. \nGilda: Yeah. \nAimee: How about boys? Are boys interested in it? \nGilda: No, not really. There are more into probably sports; baseball, becoming a police officer or…\nAimee: Okay. \nGilda: Yeah. \nAimee: So what happens if, you know, if 90 percent of the population, as you said, are so keen on beauty pageants, and then they want to become a model or an actress, what happens to those who cannot make it?\nGilda: Well, some of them will have probably a sort of frustrated life, some of them. Yeah. Some of them might change their mind once they, you know, grow up. Think of something different. But like, I work in a high school and most of the first year junior high school students, girls, they wear a lot of make-up. And they want to become one day, Miss Venezuela. Yeah. \nAimee: Wow. Wow. Do you find – or what's your opinion about that? What do you think? \nGilda: Well, I'm not supporting that. But since the country has so many crowns, there are many different pageants like Miss International, Universe, Miss World, Miss South America. There are so many. And Miss Venezuela has won a lot of crowns. So every time they get a new crown, it's a huge thing for the country. So they got the attention of everybody. \nSo as a teacher, I don't support it. But it's kind of like something nice, you know, for the country. You're getting something. \nAimee: So it sounds like it's a big source of national pride, would you say so?\nGilda: Exactly. Yes, yes. That's the way it is. Yeah. \nAimee: Interesting. \nGilda: So many people stay at home when they're broadcasting the Miss Venezuela. \nAimee: Hmm.\nGilda: Yeah.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Hey Katie. I'm having a party, Super Bowl party at my house on Sunday in a couple of weeks. Would you like to come over?\nKatie: Okay. But I have absolutely no idea what a Super Bowl is. \nTodd: Well, you know, the Super Bowl is a big sporting event and we have it once a year. But it's okay if you don't know anything about American football because actually, the Super Bowl is kind of like our unofficial holiday. \nKatie: Okay. \nTodd: Yeah. So what happens is, is everybody comes over to somebody's house, and you have a big party and you watch the game but nobody really watches the game. There's lots of other stuff going on so it's should be good. \nKatie: Do you have like Super Bowl food that you eat?\nTodd: Exactly. Exactly. So it's kind of like a big feast. So we'll have, you know, like hamburgers and stuff we'll barbecue. And we'll have lots of like chips and dip and stuff like that. So you don't have to bring any food but it's potluck. So if you do want to bring something, yeah, I would recommend it. \nKatie: Do you have to be like a supporter of one of the teams in the final? \nTodd: No. And actually, the game is not for a couple of weeks so we don't know who the two final teams are going to be. \nKatie: All right. \nTodd: They still have to decide, but actually, there's a bunch of things that have nothing to do with football on the Super Bowl that you'll probably like. The first is, they have the halftime show. You may have heard about the Super Bowl halftime show. \nKatie: Okay. \nTodd: You like music, right?\nKatie: I love music. \nTodd: Right. So they always have a really big musical act. And actually this year, I don't remember who it is. I'll have to check but it's usually somebody like Bruno Mars or U2 or somebody like that. \nKatie: I think last year, it was Katie Perry, was it not? \nTodd: It might have been. Yeah. But it's always a really, really big person. Another thing that's really cool about the Super Bowl is the commercials. So the commercials, you know, the companies spend a lot of money on the commercials, and they're usually really good. So the commercials—the people are often more into the commercials than the game. \nKatie: Okay. \nTodd: Especially if one team is kind of – if it's a lopsided win. So yeah, so the commercials are fun. \nKatie: What kind of commercials do they have? \nTodd: You know, like companies like Pepsi or Coke or like really big name companies. \nKatie: So the really big ones.\nTodd: Yeah. They'll spend like millions and millions of dollars. These are usually the most expensive commercials because it's one local game and one local audience. Like the World Cup is a more watched event but the commercials are regional for all the different countries, whereas the Super Bowl, the commercials are just for Americans.\nKatie: Yeah. \nTodd: So yeah, these are usually the most expensive commercials like around the world. So they're usually really well done. \nKatie: Is it just American teams in the Super Bowl?\nTodd: Yes, it's very, you know, Americanized name, I'd say. But, you know, like I said, the game is really not that important. But there is one way that you can make money. \nKatie: Okay. I'm interested. \nTodd: So what happens is, we have like a pool and you can draw numbers. And like you don't have to know anything about football but you can have like, you know, draw numbers for the first person to score a touchdown, or the first player to get a penalty or things like that. And you just fill out the chart and then if your player gets that, then you can get money. \nSo you have to contribute. You have to pay like 10 bucks to play. But then it's in the pool and then you could win money at different points during the game. \nKatie: Have you ever won at the Super Bowl before? \nTodd: Yeah. It's kind of like how it works out where everybody wins a little money and everybody loses a little money. So, you know, gambling technically is illegal but…\nKatie: Of course. \nTodd: Yeah. But it's like just one of those things that everybody does. \nKatie: It's not for big money. \nTodd: No. \nKatie: Just a little bit of money. \nTodd: Just a little bit of money.\nKatie: So it's okay. \nTodd: Just to have fun. Yeah. So, and then, once I find out what teams are in the finals then I'll tell you about the colors. And it's usually best that you choose one team that you're going to support. \nKatie: Okay. \nTodd: So I'll fill you in about who the teams are later and all that. \nKatie: Right. \nTodd: So are you willing to come? \nKatie: Yeah. Sounds like fun. \nTodd: Okay, cool. \nKatie: I'm in.\nTodd: All right. So it's going to be at my house at 3:00. So if you can show up around 2:00-ish.\nKatie: Should I bring some food? \nTodd: You can. Like you can bring some type of maybe salad or like a bean dish or something like that if you like. But we'll – like the main food, we'll provide. We'll have pizza. We'll have burgers. Oh, and it's BYOB. \nKatie: Okay. \nTodd: So if you want to drink, you have to bring your own alcohol. \nKatie: All right. \nTodd: But we will have some beers and stuff. Do you drink? \nKatie: Sometimes. \nTodd: Okay. Cool. \nKatie: Like tenths of the time. \nTodd: All right. So see you there. Glad you can come. \nKatie: No worries.",

        "transcript": "Meg: Hey Todd, so continuing talking about then and now, I was thinking we could switch to talking about just life in general.\nTodd: Sounds good.\n                              \nMeg: So my first question for you is are movies today more interesting than before?\nTodd: Well. I'm gonna sound like an old guy, but I would say no, movies are not more interesting today. Movies were much better, twenty, thirty years ago. The stories were better. They were more interesting. These days movies just have too much special effects, and there's too many movies about superheroes. I hate movies about superheroes. So yeah, I think movies used to be more interesting. What do you think?\nMeg: I have the opposite opinion of you. I think movies today are more interesting than before. Maybe I'm too used to a lot of special effects, so when I watch some older movies, the story might be interesting, but I get a little bored watching it and actually I love superhero movies.\nTodd: Oh really?\nMeg: So I would say that yes, any superhero movies - Spiderman or Batman especially is my favorite so those movies for me are more interesting than in the past.\nTodd: OK, well we're talking about comparatives, so who's cooler Batman or Spiderman?\nMeg: Oh, Batman. Hands down.\nTodd: I'm sorry. I think Spiderman's really lame. I've never liked Spiderman.\nMeg: He kind of whines a lot.\nTodd: He looks like a kid in his pajamas. \nMeg: He is a kid in his pajamas.\nTodd: Maybe that's it.\nMeg: Whereas Batman has a lot of skills that he's developed himself, so.\nTodd: True, true. OK, well how about Batman, so like who is better?\nMeg: Who is the best Batman?\nTodd: Yeah, so who is better? Who was the last one? It was ...\nMeg: Well, the most recent Batman was Ben Affleck, but I didn't watch that one\nTodd: OK.\nMeg: So before that, there was Christian Bale\nTodd: Oh, that's right.\nMeg: So without having seen Ben Affleck, I would still say that Christian Bale was a better Batman. \nTodd: Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure. OK, so let's talk about other things. How about the news? With news are you more knowledgable these days than before, say five ten years ago?\nMeg: Actually, I think I am less knowledgable than before. There's a lot of news out there, and it's easy to access the news but there's so much news coming from so many sources, I'm now sure which news service is more trustworthy, so I think it's more difficult now to find the correct news. The true news. What do you think?\nTodd: I agree. Sadly I think I am less knowledgable because before I would read the newspaper, or I would read magazine articles or I would listen to better news stories on the news. These days I just look at a Facebook headline and I don't even read the article, so I don't even know what's going on sometimes. Which is terrible for a man my age.\nMeg: Terrible for anyone I think.\nTodd: Yeah, I think it's because I think the news was more honest than before, than now, sorry. I think the news is less honest these days. It used to be more honest. I just don't trust the news anymore.\nMeg: Yeah, I don't really trust it either.\nTodd: Yeah, less trustworthy. \nMeg: So along those lines, would you say social media makes like better or worse for people?\nTodd: I think it's both, like I think it's you know, three points better, two points worse, so it's a negative. It's better because you can keep track of so many family members, especially if you're far away, so I like how it connects people, yeah, it just makes people sad sometimes, or makes them frustrated about their life maybe, so yeah, I don't think it makes life better. But I'm an old guy, so...\nMeg: Yeah, I think it's true. I think there are scientific studies to show that because of social media, people compare themselves too much so it's quite appropriate that we are talking about comparison because people will see other people's lives on social media that look quite good and they will compare themselves and feel bad about themselves, o for some people I think it has made it worse, but like you, I agree that some points are better like seeing pictures from my family. \nTodd: Yeah, so true.",

        "transcript": "Todd: Hey Meg, so I thought we would talk about then and now, the present and the past.\nMeg: Sounds good.\nTodd: So, it's very easy to compare things, compare things now, and sometimes people think things were better in the past, or things were worse in the past, so let's see what you think. The first one is are you happier now than you were last year?\nMeg: Am I happier now? I think I'm about the same happiness level, so last year I was happy with my job and my family and my friends and this year I'm still happy. What about you? Are you happier now than last year?\nTodd: I am happier because last year I was still in college in graduate school and I finished. \nMeg: Congratulations.\nTodd: Yes, and I have more free time now and because of that, I'm happier this year. Less stressed.\nMeg: Less stressed always makes up happier.\nTodd: OK, so the next one is do you think you are healthier these days than you were before, say ten years ago?\nMeg: Actually no. I think I am not healthier than I was about ten years ago. Lately I've been so busy that I haven't been taking enough time to exercise or cook healthy food, so I would say I was probably healthier ten years ago. What about yourself? Are you healthier now or before?\nTodd: I think I'm healthier actually. Even though I'm a little fatter than I was ten years ago, I drink less and I eat more vegetables. I eat less fast food. I think I get more sleep, and I feel less stressed, so I think I am a little bit healthier than I was ten years ago.\nMeg: Yeah, that definitely sounds healthier. \nTodd: But I'm older so that's ... you know.\nMeg: Right, well older and healthier.\nTodd: Right. OK, so how about stress? Are you more stressed now than you were five years ago?\nMeg: That's a hard question. Probably I'm about the same, so I wouldn't say that I'm more stressed now, but five years ago I was finishing my master's degree, so that was also a stressful time, and lately I've been quite busy so I'm probably at the same stress level as five years ago. What about yourself? Are you more stressed now?\nTodd:I think I'm less stressed now actually because now I worry less than I did before, so before I was more stressed because I worried about everything, and now I've learned to let it go, let things go. I don't let them bother me. \nMeg: That sounds like a good policy.\nTodd: Yeah.\nMeg: So, you think you're less worried now, but what about your future. Are you more worried about your future than before?\nTodd: Ooh, you know what, yeah I do think I'm more worried about my future now because I'm older so I'm more worried about money. I'm more worried about what I'll be doing in ten years, job security, things like that, so sadly I am a little more worried about that.\nMeg: There's a lot more to think about.\nTodd: Yeah, so but I'm less worried about my life day to day. Everything happening around me, so I guess that's why I feel less worried than I was say five years ago\nMeg: Right.\nTodd: How about you? Are you more worried about your future these days?\nMeg: I don't think so. I have a good job and I like where I live so I don't feel too worried about what I'll be doing next year or in five years, but probably I should plan ahead a bit more. Maybe I should be a little more worried, but I feel OK about the future.\nTodd: Well, that's a very healthy attitude to have.\nMeg: Yeah, it helps with the stress level as well.",

Could you tell me some good places to visit while I'm in Nepal?\nJin: Yeah, sure. It's really nice a nice place. I mean, you should totally come to my country. I would recommend that you should go to a place called Pokhara because that's the most famous tourist site in Nepal. There's a really beautiful lake there, and then I know that you like sports, so then there are so many different kinds of activities like bungee jumping, rafting, kayoking... I don't know. What is it?\nAdam: Kayaking?\nJin: Kayaking, yeah! So yeah, I think you'll love it there. That's the best place I would say. \nAdam: Oh, cool! How far is that from the capital?\nJim: Ah, you have to take a mini-bus, and it will take you around six hours and you'll be there.\nAdam: OK, cool! When's the best time to go there?\nJin: I think during spring would be better.\nAdam: Yeah?\nJin: Yeah. It's really nice there, like, and the people are really nice. The food is amazing, and there's a really good nightlife there because people ... like there's ... what do you call it ... pubs, and like live music, so yeah, it's a really fun place to be at night and in the daytime.\nAdam: That's great. I love live music. Do you have any like events or festivals that I should go to when I'm in Nepal\nJin: Actually, in Nepal there's a lot of festivals, but I would recommend you to go there when there's a festival called Holi. It's around February ... March. (Laughter) So yeah, the festival is around March and what we do is we play with colors. We throw colors at each other, and then even throw water balloons. It's really fun, like the whole environment is really colorful, bright and everyone is very happy. \nAdam: Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun. I think I've seen pictures of that before. How many days is that celebration?\nJin: It's actually only one day.\nAdam: Oh, really?\nJim: Yeah.\nAdam: Cool, I really want to go. Anything else you can tell us about Nepal?\nJin: If you like hiking, then Nepal has a lot of mountains. Actually, Mt. Everest is in Nepal so you can even try going there. \nAdam: Wow, that would be amazing. I really look forward to going there. Thank you so much for your time today.\nJin: Sure anytime!",

        "transcript": "Todd: So, Abidemi, you were talking about living with the Inuits in Northern Canada. What were some things that they do differently, like for example food or games or traditions?\nAbidemi: Food was a big thing that was different there. They eat a lot of meat, I could say, if I can say that from the sea, so because they're surrounded by the sea, they have access to a lot of food from there. They eat beluga, seal, whales. Anything that's found in the sea I think they basically eat it, and they eat just about all the parts of the animal, so that was quite interesting.\nTodd: That's so interesting. What does it taste like, seal and whale?\nAbidemi: Very ...?\nTodd: Is it cooked?\nAbidemi: Sometimes they cook it, yeah. They also freeze it. They have different ways of preparing it. Sometimes to do eat it raw. They say that is the best way to eat it to get the most amount of energy from it, and sometimes they freeze it, and they eat it frozen. They eat a lot of fish, frozen fish like that. Attic char - delicious, and sometimes they boil it, but I don't think that's their preferred method of eating it. One thing to note is that the younger generation, they seem to prefer more the meat - beef - and the meat that more of everybody eats now, whereas the older generation, of course, they still prefer their traditional way of cooking and eating. Also, they eat caribou, like land animals, caribou, rabbit and one or two other animals that I can't remember.\nTodd: Now did you try all these foods?\nAbidemi: I tried as many as I could. I love eating, and if everyone else is eating it, I'll eat it too, so I try them all. I have my, the ones I like more, but I didn't find anything disgusting. I enjoyed it.\nTodd: That's so cool. Did you learn how to prepare it or cook some of it? \nAbidemi: No. I'm laughing because I'm not a huge cook anywhere, so I just do the eating and cleaning up. \nTodd: Yeah, OK cool. You mentioned that they played some games. They have their own style of games. Do you remember any games that they play?\nAbidemi: They have games, where one was like wrestling. They have a lot of body contact games where they would wrestle on the ground, or you had to hold up your leg a certain way for how many minutes, just really games that had to deal with strength and endurance is what I would say, and then they played a lot of games using dice where you would win prizes. I think a lot of these things were designed for the long winter months, so they could stay indoors and still keep themselves entertained, and because in those days, in the past they didn't have TV or have the kind of entertainment, Internet, which they do have there now, so they have a lot of games that they still try to play sometimes to keep them entertained.\nAnd music is a large part of their life too. A lot of people play different instruments and they square dance. They're really good dancers. They can dance all night, so that was fun as well.\nTodd: Oh wow, sounds like a great place. \nAbidemi: Yes, it was. \nTodd: So do they have their own type of instruments? Their own traditional instruments? \nAbidemi: I would say no. The instruments that I saw were more things that had been brought up to them, for example the fiddle, guitar, stuff like that. Thinking back on it now, maybe there were one or two things that they had made, but I didn't feel like, I can't really remember the name. I didn't really remember the names, so.\nTodd: Nice, anyway, thanks for sharing. \nAbidemi: My pleasure.",

        "transcript": "Todd: So Abidemi, you were a teacher in Canada. correct?\nAbidemi: That's true Todd.\nTodd: Now, where did you teach?\nAbidemi: I taught in Northern Canada in a province called Nunavut.\nTodd: Nunavut.\nAbidemi: Nunavut.\nTodd: Nunavut. Wow is it like a native Americans  type ..?\nAbidemi: Yeah, and except we call them Inuits.\nTodd: Inuits?\nAbidemi: Aboriginals and First Nations.\nTodd: So what was it like?\nAbidemi: I really liked it. It was great. Very different from other parts of Canada. Very cold obviously because it's in the far north, and the communities are very isolated. Very few people live there. In the particular community were I lived, there were about a thousand people, maybe less living there. So everything has to be shipped in, or flown in by ship that comes in the summer when the oceans melt, and then in the winter, they usually fly them in, so food was quite expensive, housing expensive. Yeah, it was a different experience for me.\nTodd: Wow, what's life like that far north?\nAbidemi: Life happens, and it's interesting how similar it is to what we have down south in Southern Canada, the other parts of Canada. Like they have TVs and similar housing, but you do have to be careful when using water because the infrastructure is a little different. The ground is frozen, so they don't have indoor plumbing. They have plumbing but they don't have running water. The water has to be brought to each house almost every day and sewage also has to be taken away, so you have to be careful how you use water. That's one part. Also, you don't get access to all the things that you want to buy. Sometimes you go to the supermarket, and maybe all the bread is gone, or the milk has not been flown in yet, so you have to be patient with that as well, and you don't get the same variety of products as you would get in larger places, so yeah, and as winter ... As you get more and more into the winter months, it gets darker earlier, so maybe around four o'clock in the afternoon it's already dark outside, and by the time you go to work in the mornings too, when you're going around seven, eight o'clock, it's dark outside, so you're like ... it's dark a lot.\nTodd: Wow, what was it like being in an environment where you had so little sunlight?\nAbidemi: It was hard, but I kind of feel like, I'm used to it. I took vitamin D tablets to help with that. So, yeah, but because I was working for the most part, I didn't feel like it was too hard, and then during the holidays, I would come back down south to my family, so I wasn't there too much during downtimes. I did spend part of Christmas vacation there, and that was nice. They had a lot of activities outside for community members: ice sculpturing, winter games on the ice, Inuit games, different things like that. So it was fun. It was really an experience that was culturally enlightening. If I could say that for me. I really enjoyed it. I really, really enjoyed it, though there were challenges as well. The isolation and the fact that if you wanted to go to other places that weren't in the community, you had to fly out, so it's very expensive to go there.\nTodd: Oh, what an experience. Sounds cool.\nAbidemi: Yes, I loved it and I would like to do it again someday.",
