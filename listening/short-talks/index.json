        "transcript": "Generally speaking, the types of investments you make should be based on your tolerance for risk. In other words, how much money can you stand to lose? The stock market is the best way to earn the most money over time, but it's also the riskiest. You could also lose the most there. We recommend that you don't buy stocks with money you're going to need in the next five years. Bonds are less risky than stocks, but the flip side is that they will earn you less money. They might not earn enough so you can afford your retirement. We urge you to consider what we call an investment \"sleeping scale, \" which helps measure the safety of your investments by how much sleep you might lose worrying about them. We find most people sleep comfortably with a balance of stocks, bonds, cash, and other investments, such as real estate. This balance changes as you get older, becoming more conservative over time. Here, let me show you a few examples of some typical investment pie charts.",

The president called the legislation a \"vital stimulus\" for the country's education system.

For the next month, at least one lane of traffic will be closed between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. There will be orange signs diverting traffic to detour routes along Second Avenue and Waterfront Road. Businesses on Main Street will remain open during the road work, and police officers will be directing traffic. If you need to use Main Street during this time, expect delays and remember that traffic violations in work zones carry a penalty of double the maximum fine. Thank you for your patience and understanding. The main street resurfacing project is one of six road improvement projects the city will undertake this year.

I'm going to a movie tonight, but I'll check my voice mail when it's over and if you leave a message I'll call you back. Bye.",

Taking a peek at our eastside real-time camera, we see heavy congestion on Highway 605 east of the convention center, thinning out south of the airport. Traffic on Route 2, meanwhile, looks to be moving steadily until the town of Roserock, where a maintenance crew is fixing a large pothole in the center of the roadway. Finally, looking west along Highway 14, we see a backup near exit 93 that appears to be caused by a dairy truck that has spilled part of its load of milk in the center lane.

Dr. Kidd is a native of Florida, where he earned a bachelors in science before moving here and getting his masters and PhD at State University. He has spent the past two years studying cell-phone radiation under a grant from the National Institute of Health. Next year, he has been invited to join a prestigious committee of international scientists to continue his work in Stockholm, Sweden, for three more years. Dr. Kidd plans today to give a Power Point presentation outlining the preliminary results of his research, followed by practical recommendations about cell-phone use. Please hold all questions, and we'll have about 15 minutes at the end of the presentation for a question-and-answer session. Also, while we're on the subject of cell phones, a friendly reminder: please turn off or mute all cell phones, beepers and other alarms during the presentation. Thank you, and without further ado, please join me in extending a warm welcome to Dr. Wesley Kidd.",

The economy will turn around -- who knows, maybe because of something you do. The glass is half full, people! You're leaving a world that you know, a comfortable, exciting world, to enter another world -- a big, full, breathtaking arena, bursting with opportunity. It's a little scary, but it also should be tremendously exhilarating. Remember that when you first stepped onto this campus, fresh from high school, for many of you it was a moment of great fear and trepidation. Now, that fear is conquered, and you're ready for the next step. Great moments are bred of great opportunity. This is your opportunity. This is your moment. Make the most of it! Thank you.",

Do wear nice clothes -- no jeans, sneakers, or T-shirts. Do comb your hair and brush your teeth. First appearances are important. Don't ask about salary until the end of the interview. Otherwise they will think you're more interested in money. Don't say anything bad about your previous employer. It sounds like sour grapes. Finally, don't avoid difficult questions. If you don't know the answer or aren't sure, it's better to be honest than to try and pretend. This has been Marcy Millen for Job Talk. See you next week.",

Face the tough decisions, but don't let cutbacks stop you from seeing the windows of opportunity that are suddenly open. For example, we've seen research that only 13 percent of people who tighten their budget will go back to their old spending habits when the economy improves. This was a great chance for our company to make explicit what we knew implicitly: Our products are a great value. So we spent money for a new advertising campaign with phrases like \"Quality for less,\" \"shop smart,\" and \"style on a budget.\" As a result, our sales have increased each of the past three quarters. Think creatively. Act aggressively. We can't predict exactly when the broad economy will recover, but your company's recovery can begin whenever you're ready. Don't wait; innovate!",

In this role, I've been able to work doing two things I love -- cooking and meeting new people. The Household Gourmet was founded thirty years ago to provide people with kitchen products that reduce both cooking and clean-up time. Tonight I'll be preparing two easy, delicious treats for you. The first is an appetizer that can be made very quickly using several prepared items from the supermarket. The second treat is a dessert that takes a little bit longer to make, but is well worth the trouble. As I prepare these dishes, I'll be demonstrating some of our efficient, effective, inexpensive kitchen products for you. And at the end of the demonstration, we'll all be able to sample the results; then I'll help you place your orders for Household Gourmet products.",

Louise Carson, a spokesperson for Governor Moore, said the state also expects to receive $100 million from the federal government for flood recovery, noting that President Theodore Cleaver has declared the flood a national emergency.

Ned Bryson, a PhD biologist, makes these and other fascinating creatures come alive in his new book, Marsupials, by Universal Press. Bryson's superb photos alone are worth the $20 cover price, and his encyclopedic knowledge makes this volume a real bargain. Kids will love these small furry animals who have pouches and large, luminous eyes. And they'll get a kick out of some of the offbeat details that Bryson includes. Did you know, for example, that mother koalas make a special kind of poop, called pap, that the joeys eat while they are weaning? There is much here for everyone, including an afterward in which Bryson explains how he rigged his cameras with special infrared lights to photograph the mostly nocturnal marsupials. Though clearly an educated man, Bryson's breezy writing style presents complex ideas in an easy-to-read, kid-friendly manner. This would make a great Christmas or birthday gift for young curious minds.",

There will be four acts, with a 20-minute intermission. If you don't have a program, they're available for free at either of the booths at the side of the stage. During the show, we ask that you remain seated on the grass or in lawn chairs, and please keep children behind the yellow rope lining the front of the stage. If your little one needs to use the restroom, it would be a good idea to take them now. Restrooms are located in the fenced area to the right of the stage. Also, if you're in contact with friends and family who are still arriving, tell them the north lot is full, but there is additional parking in the east and west lots. When the curtain drops to signal the start of the action, please turn off all your cell phones and pagers, and be considerate of your neighbors. Thank you for coming, and we hope you enjoy it!",

I'm honored to be here this evening, and to be able to share with you some simple financial strategies that have worked for me, and can work just as well for you. I don't offer any magic formula to \"get rich quick,\" and no, you won't walk out of here tonight and become millionaires tomorrow. However, if you listen carefully, study dutifully and apply the strategy I'm going to teach you, I guarantee that you can substantially increase your wealth in a relatively short period of time. To give you a personal example, just a few years ago I was like most of you - a middle-class businessperson, doing OK but not fabulous. After I learned this wealth-building strategy, and began applying it, my net worth tripled in the space of two years, and has kept rising steadily since then. I was able to retire five years ago, and am now blessed to be able to travel the country and share with others some of the tricks I have learned. So, let's get started...",

I'm 35 now, and I feel great. The knee injury I suffered last year is completely healed. It feels like I could play for four or five more years. Of course, once the season starts, that could change. Maybe my knee will get hurt again, or else another part of my body. I don't want to be out there playing if I'm not able to compete at a high level. They're paying me five million dollars a year, and I want to prove that I'm worth it. If I ever reach the point where I feel like I'm not giving the fans their money's worth, then I'll be glad to retire and let a younger player take over. I've been playing this game since I was seven years old, and professionally since I was 21, I'm thankful that I've lasted this long and done as well as I have. It's already been a great career.",

This is due mostly to economic factors beyond our control, particularly the gas-price increases. The good news is that our fourth-quarter earnings are projected to rise nearly 3 percent, or about 75 cents a share. That's partly because we've implemented an energy conservation program at all our plants - for instance, cutting fuel usage by 10 percent - and partly because the economy is on the rebound. Going forward, the company remains healthy, and we anticipate increased energy earnings for each of the first two quarters next year. Our challenge will be finding creative ways to remain well-positioned in a bear economy, and planning for flexibility to meet our goals without compromising the quality of our product.",

I want to thank all of you, all the editors, writers, photographers, page designers, printers -- everyone who helped make this paper a city institution for the past 150 years. It's been a pleasure and an honor working with you and supervising you. As you've heard, we will continue to have an online news site with a staff of 25. This re-designed website will begin tomorrow. We hope that it will help fill the gap left by the departed print product. Meanwhile, we have one more issue to put out. Let's get to work and make it the best it can be.",

We have an outstanding lineup this season, which kicks off tonight with a 21st century adaptation of Shakespeare's classic, \"Romeo and Juliet.\" At this time I would like to turn the microphone over to the author of this production, Martin Bourgette. Mr. Bourgette is renowned for putting fresh spins on classic tales, as he did at last year's festival with an updated version of \"Taming of the Shrew.\" Martin started his drama career right here in Muston, earning his first starring role in our outdoor festival at age 14. He appeared in several other festival plays before majoring in drama at Muston University. For the past 10 years, he has tried his hand at writing and directing, earning nationwide acclaim -- and a fair share of criticism -- for his unique perspectives and modern renderings of many classic plays. \"Romeo and Juliet\" is Mr. Bourgette's 21st stage production, and his fourth for our festival. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Martin Bourgette.",

        "transcript": "Are you stuck in traffic as you listen to this? Wouldn't you rather be sitting in a plush seat, reading a good book or sipping a cold drink while you wait? You could, you know, if you were riding a County Transit bus or light-rail train. Light-rail trains run twice daily north-south and east-west during rush hour periods, with 12 convenient stops along the way. And there are now more County Transit buses, and bus routes, than ever before. Recent studies show that taking a bus or train, instead of driving, could save you up to $10,000 a year. That's money that could be used for vacation, that new kitchen you've been wanting, or to help your children go to college. Studies also show that trains and buses, on average, get you to work and back quicker than cars do. So what are you waiting for -- besides that car bumper just ahead of you to finally move? Climb aboard a County Transit bus or light-rail train. Then relax, and leave the driving to us. For more information, call 1-800-TRANSIT, or visit us online at www.countytransit.com.",

First, yes, the quote to enlarge the conference room does include installing new carpet. Sorry if that wasn't clear on the spreadsheet. You had also asked why we quoted a range for the cost of lighting. That's because it depends on the type and style of lights you decide you want. The low figure is for standard lighting, and the high one is for fancy, canned track lights. As for painting, we subcontract that, so I'll have to check with my painters and see when they can come give you an estimate -- hopefully by the end of the week. I'll get back in touch with you about that later today. If you have more questions, give me a call or shoot me an e-mail. My cell phone is 344-612-0985, and the office is 344-555-7249. E-mail is josh at levine dot com. Otherwise, I'll put you in touch with the painters and wait to hear from you. Thanks Ms. Whitehurst, and have a good day!",

My father was a doctor, and my mother was a teacher. I have two older brothers and a younger sister. I grew up in Maryland, but we moved to Chicago when I was 12. I've been interested in science my whole life, so I was ecstatic to receive a scholarship here at Northwestern University to study biology. After earning my bachelor's degree, I got a master's at Stanford. I stayed on there as a researcher for about six years before moving back to Illinois and joining Bio-Tech. I was with Bio-Tech for 10 years before leaving last year to start my own research company, GreenEarth. We employ six full-time researchers, and in the past year we've made a couple of exciting new discoveries, which I'm going to tell you about in just a minute. First, though, I just want to thank the Northwestern president, John Roche, and the faculty of the biology department for inviting me back to speak to you today. It's an exciting moment, and I'm honored.",

But it's not OK to get behind the wheel of a car after you've been drinking. With winter weather already making driving tough, don't make it any harder on yourself - or others - by trying to drive while you're intoxicated. If you plan to drink, arrange a designated driver before the party begins. If you notice someone who shouldn't be driving, talk them into giving you their keys. If they refuse, call 911. Remember, friends don't let friends drive drunk. Finally, if you do happen to find yourself too drunk to drive, call 555-TAXI for a special, free holiday lift. That's 555-TAXI for a free ride anywhere in the county. The state patrol wishes everyone a happy, and safe, holiday season.",

We'd like to remind all students that effective Monday, November 12th, the university campus connector is going back to its original route down Main Street toward the Madison Park Campus. The original route was changed two months ago due to Main Street construction. Now that most of the work is complete, the campus connector will be more efficient for riders, and will have stops in more practical locations for students traveling between campuses. Please note that the route will no longer service the Fourth Avenue corridor, and the stop between 8th and 9th avenues at Marshall Street will be removed. New stops have been added near the School of Business and the School of Engineering. Service hours will remain the same -- 6:30 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. Maps of the new campus connector route are available at the student center, and also on the campus website. If you have any questions about this change, please contact transit coordinator Miriam Morris at 555-2421, or e-mail morrism@vcu.edu. Thank you.",

To multiply 11 by any two-digit number, say 11 times 43, add the two digits together, then insert the sum between them. In this case, 4 plus 3 equals 7, so the answer would be 473. For numbers with two-digit sums, such as 11 times 84, use a slight variation. Eight plus 4 equals 12, so add the 1 from the 12 to the 8 and leave the two in the middle: 924. Here's another quick trick, one you could use to impress your friends at a party. Ask someone to think of a number. Then have them double it, and then add 12, and then divide by 2. Finally, have them subtract their original number. Before they're finished, tell them the answer: 6. It will always be the same.",

Looking at the five-day forecast, this high-pressure front moving in from the east this morning will drive out rain clouds, and the rest of the week looks to be sunny and clear, with highs in the low- to mid-70s and lows dipping into the upper 40s. Chance of rain is 40 percent today but drops to 10 percent by Friday. As you can see, there's a low-pressure front headed our way from the north which is expected to reach us by the weekend, and may bring some more clouds and a chance of rain.

Through the years, Art has been a steadying influence and a guiding light.

I grew up in the Los Angeles area, and got my BA degree at Cal Poly-Pomona. I then earned a master's in literature from UCLA. I worked as a journalist for a few years, and tried my hand at writing poetry and a couple of novels. My second novel, \"LA Life,\" was published by a small firm, but I had decided by that time that I wanted to teach writing. I taught in high schools in Southern California for six years, then at a junior college. Finally, I was hired at San Diego State University, and was there for four years before coming here. I was married four years ago, and I have a three-year-old daughter, Theresa, and a six-month-old son, Antonio. OK, now I'd like to know a little about each of you.",

Elsewhere, traffic is flowing smoothly except on eastbound State Route 440, where an overturned semi truck has traffic backed up from the Lake Bridge onramp to mid-span of the bridge.

Tomorrow will be partly sunny, with a high of about 60, but increasing clouds Tuesday night will bring rain and colder weather later in the week. The chance of rain is 60 percent on Wednesday, increasing to 75 percent Thursday and 90 percent Friday, with highs those days in the mid-50s and lows dropping into the low 40s. It should clear a little by the weekend, with the rain chance falling to 40 percent on Saturday and 20 percent Sunday. Look for partially sunny skies and highs returning to the mid-60s.

There will be no cubicle walls or partitions. Instead, desks will be arranged in clusters for each department. The desks in each department will be facing each other in clusters of four or six. We feel this will facilitate better communication between workers in each departments. It will also create a more welcoming environment for clients. The department managers will still have their own offices, but each will have large windows and glass doors, to make employees and clients feel welcome to come inside. We're also going to paint the walls and put in new carpeting. The project will start on the first of next month and should take about three weeks to complete.

If you're an amateur player, aim for the inside borderline of 8 and 16 on the dart board. Even if your aim is off, you'll still likely score decent points, since the 8 and 16 are surrounded by 11, 7, 14, and 19. If you're above average, focus on the triple 19 ring, and if you fancy yourself an expert, target the triple 20. Of course, you can always aim at the bulls-eye in the center of the board, which is worth 100 points, but if you miss, you might wind up with less points than trying these other strategies.",

The blaze, which has been raging for three days, destroyed nearly 500 acres of land and damaged 10 homes. No injuries have been reported. Fire chief Mike Montgomery said the department is still investigating the cause of the fire, and it's too early to determine if it was set intentionally. Montgomery said fires start easily in this dry weather, and cautioned people again to be very careful with matches and lighters. Campfires have been banned in the eastern foothills, where the fire danger is high, but are still allowed in the northern and western foothills, where the fire danger is currently rated medium. Montgomery said it will take crews another day or two to completely douse the flames, and then cleanup will begin. The city estimates that clean-up costs could exceed $3 million. This has been Wendy Wilkens for the 5 p.m. news.",

Our Premium plan has a $2,000 deductible and includes all aspects of our Basic and Plus plans.

You can get $900 off a brand new pickup truck, or drive home in a new four-door sedan for only $12,500 after a $2,000 government rebate. That's right, up to $2,000 off hundreds of new cars and trucks! And if you have an old clunker that gets less than 20 miles per gallon, bring it down and trade it in. Not only will we give you a great price for that gas guzzler, we'll also give you an extra $1,000 off the price of a new vehicle under the government's \"cash for clunkers\" program. But you'd better get a move on. Prices this low won't last long. We're on Tri-Cities Motorway near the junction of Interstate 40. Right now we're open 9 to 9 Monday through Friday, and 8-10 on Saturday and Sunday. Tell them Tammy sent you, and we'll give you your car's first oil change for free!",

Volume on the two major east-west roadways, Interstate 50 and Highway 44, is very heavy this afternoon as people head out of town for the holiday weekend. There are no accidents on either road, but on Interstate 50 there is a 90-minute delay getting over the mountain pass. North-south traffic looks good at this hour. Interstate 3 is mostly clear in both directions, with a little slowing northbound near the City Center exit due to an earlier two-car collision that has been moved off to the shoulder. We're getting reports now of a backup on Highway 10 southbound near Rodgers Street, where some furniture has fallen off the back of a pickup truck in the far left lane. Police are on the scene, helping the driver pick everything up. This is Tom Moran from the KST-AM traffic center, which provides traffic updates every 20 minutes.",

Our current top CD rate is 5 percent for 48 months, with a minimum investment of $5,000. We also offer a CD of 4 percent for 36 months, with a minimum of $2,000. To purchase either of these CDs, you must first have a Lincoln Bank checking account. Our money market account is currently paying an interest rate of 3.50 percent. You don't need a previous checking account to open a money market account, but you do have to make an initial deposit of at least $1,000. I hope this answers your questions, Mr. Lyons. If there's anything else I can help you with, please give me a call. My name's Janelle Archer, and my number is 555-2002. Have a great day.",

Highs will be 60 degrees today and 65 tomorrow, while lows both days will dive into the low 40s. Looking at the five-day forecast, this high-pressure system moving in from the south will bring more rain later in the week, interspersed with periods of partial clearing. Highs toward the end of the week will inch down toward 60, with lows possibly reaching the mid-30s. As we look out over the eastern part of the state, things look dryer there, with no rain expected and highs holding steady in the mid- to upper-70s for the next week or so.",

Crowley, who was 88, was one of the original smoke jumpers, firefighters who parachute into wilderness forest fires to try and put them out. On his first-ever smoke jump, Crowley's parachute lines became tangled and he landed in a tree. Nonetheless, he and a partner were able to control the fire by the following morning. Their feat marked the beginning of the national smoke jumpers program, and Crowley later became the organization's first superintendent. His career wasn't flawless; in 1959 he directed the crew battling the famous Morgan's Gulch fire, in which 10 smoke jumpers lost their lives. Crowley never forgot that tragedy, but his confidence didn't waver. \"I don't know why,\" he once said, \"but I was never afraid to jump.\" A memorial service will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at the St. Thomas Cathedral. Mr. Crowley is survived by his wife, Ruth, sons Tim and Ryan, and daughter Julia, as well as four grandchildren.",

If you're coming from the east side into the city, Highway 622 or State Route 314 are better choices, as traffic is flowing freely on both roadways right now. Volume is starting to build on roads leading out of the city, because many people are leaving work early to get a head start on their three-day weekends. There are a lot of large campers and SUVs on the freeways, which are starting to cause backups on Interstate 6 both north and south of downtown. Heavy traffic is expected on the mountain pass this afternoon and evening, as well as on Monday, when people return from vacation. The only other problem at this hour is on Highway 109 near exit 17, where a pick-up truck has run out of gas and is blocking the right lane. This has been Sheila Strothers with your 4 p.m. WJKZ traffic update. The next traffic report will be at 5.",

        "transcript": "Well, the short answer is yes, I do believe that the stock market is still a good place to invest your money. You pointed out that stock investors have lost a lot of money the past two years, and that's certainly true. The market has tumbled down. But you have to take an historic perspective. Over the past 100 years, the stock market has averaged a 9-percent return. That's pretty good, much better than the 2 or 3 percent most bank accounts pay. So this is a down period for the market, but it will bounce back, and it's still a good avenue for the average investor. In fact, now is actually a great time to buy stocks, while the market is depressed. However, I do not recommend that clients put all their money in the stock market. I advise people to invest in many different things. For example, they should have bonds, real estate, and maybe gold or silver as part of their investment portfolio. That way, they have some assurance that when stocks fall, their other holdings will rise to balance their total investment package. There's a lot of truth in the old saying, \"Don't put all you eggs in one basket.\" Bearing that in mind, each investor is different, though. The types of investments I advise for each person depends on many factors, including their age, their income, and the degree of risk they are willing to take. Stocks provide a good return, for instance, but they are riskier than say, bonds.",

Because most charities are nonprofit, their effectiveness cannot be measured financially, as with the stock market. This makes it difficult to know how well they are spending the money that is so generously donated. Fortunately, there are a number of organizations that analyze charities and rate them according to a variety of different criteria. Their idea is to help givers channel their donations to entities that will ensure the money goes where it's supposed to -- to help the needy -- rather than into the pockets of the charity's leaders. These organizations typically rate charities like movie reviews, giving them from one star for poor performance to four stars for outstanding work. Some also invite customers to write reviews of charitable organizations. Before you make your next donation, you might want to investigate the charity you're considering online.",

I was referred to you by my neighbor, Doris Magnusson, who says you've been cleaning her home for a couple of years. I own a four-bedroom house in Green Haven, and I'd like to have someone come and clean it twice a month. Could you please tell me how much that would cost? Do you send just one person, or a team of two? Also, what type of cleaning materials do you use? Are they environmentally friendly? Do I need to provide anything? Oh, one more thing. Do you charge extra for pets? I have a dog and two cats. Again, my name's Darcy McGuire, and if you could please call me at 555-6996, I'd appreciate it. You could talk to me or my daughter, Daisy Meyers, who lives downstairs. I'd like to get started next week, so I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you.",

If you are in one of these programs and normally ride the special-activity bus, listen carefully. The special-activity bus will leave today directly after the final bell rings, and it will load in the east parking lot. Regular buses will leave as usual from the west parking lot. If you are being picked up by a parent today instead of riding the bus, your parent must come to the main office first and sign you out. Please do not leave school with your parent unless you were signed out at the office. All buses will be on snow routes this afternoon. They will drop you at your snow bus stop. Again, the special-activity bus leaves directly after school from the east parking lot, and all buses will be on snow routes. Thank you.",

        "transcript": "How do we attract and retain customers? That's a great question, and for a retailer, probably the most crucial one to address. First, we pay a lot of attention to detail -- the way our stores look, the lighting, the cleanliness. Is the parking lot clean? Are the signs visible and easy to read? Second, we invest in our associates. We pay merit increases, we pay bonuses, and make contributions to their retirement plans. We believe that satisfied workers equals satisfied customers. We just introduced something we call power hours. In the hours that traffic is heaviest, we stop all activity that the customers can't see, like back-room unloading and storing, and put every associate out on the main floor. It's really that belly-to-belly experience that makes people want to come back. We hear from about 100,000 customers each week, and they rate us on a number of attributes. So far, they tell us that we're doing the right things.",

So why do I work so hard to start one, get it going, and then walk away to start another one from scratch...? I don't know, really. It's not for the money. If I wanted to get rich I'd make one business enormously successful, then sell it. I guess it's in my DNA. I love the challenge of creating something -- of seeing my dreams spring to life. But once they do, the excitement's gone, and I'm ready for something else. I think the first sign I would be a businessman was when I was nine, and a friend and I started renting our used DVDs to the neighborhood kids. I started my first business at age 13 -- a lawn-mowing service -- and I've been creating companies ever since. Not all of them have been successful, but I think I've learned more from my failures than my successes. This current venture is my 12th start-up company. Five have failed, but six are going strong, so I'm batting better than five-hundred. I'm 60, I'm still in good health, I love what I do -- so I see myself doing this until the day I die.",

Ms. Johannsen had inquired about our advertising rates. In a nutshell, they depend on the size of the advertisement, volume and frequency. Our basic rates range from $20 for a one-column-by-one-inch ad to $5,000 for a full-page color ad. We offer volume discounts for multiple ads, as well as discounts for ads that run more than twice in one week or four times in a month. We have a fantastic ad-design department, and we also accept camera-ready ads, which should be submitted at least one day before publication. OK, I hope this answers your general questions. If you want more specific details, please call me back at 555-0904, ext. 654, or e-mail me at Van Hoffman - that's V-A-N H-O-double F- M-A-N dot g at Times-News dot com, and I'll be happy to give you more information.

A special feature of Toronto is the downtown area covering about twelve square kilometers where many shops and buildings are located underground. There are five major shopping centers and a convention center with hotels. A subway and underground passageways connect these buildings with each other and the streets above. The architectural design is appropriate and popular because of the weather conditions in Toronto. The temperature fluctuates widely from summer to winter by as much as 40 degrees Celsius within a year. This underground area has also helped to keep business in the city center instead of moving out to the suburbs, which is happening in many other cities. We think that makes Toronto a special place.",

I remember entering our apartment, and all the furniture was gone, our two cars were sold, there was no air-conditioning. Our whole life had changed. A couple of years later, my parents took me to the park, where I saw orphans with no homes to go to. That made such a big impression. When I started having success, when my second CD sold 12 million copies and I was suddenly an international star, I decided to establish a foundation for children, and I've donated half the profit from my subsequent four CDs to it. In addition, I'm planning a big benefit concert early next year to raise more money. The foundation focuses on providing nutrition and high-quality education. So far, we've helped more than 5,000 kids.",

It has not been properly taken care of, and it needs a lot of work. Everything from the foundation to the heating system will have to be restored and repaired. It will be expensive, but the work must be done if the church is to last another hundred years. Now I am going to describe all of the problems in detail.

There is a huge backup right now on the interstate freeway southbound near the Fifth Street exit, due to a car-truck collision. Police and aid cars are on the scene, and it looks like it's going to take awhile to clear it up. The right two lanes are blocked, but the two left lanes are open, and there's a police officer directing vehicles. Northbound traffic on the interstate is also bottle-necking through that area as drivers slow to take a look. But that congestion should ease in a few minutes, as we see traffic authorities getting ready to switch the special express lanes from southbound to northbound at 3:30. Traffic on other major roadways looks normal at this hour. This is Abby Adams from the WJAM eye in the sky.

        "transcript": "If we have a great deal of uncertainty and distrust in the world, then consumers and corporations want to trust companies and brands that they believe will deliver on their promises. You asked where our opportunity was. It's in customer service, because if we can provide a higher level of certainty in a world that is uncertain, that gives us a competitive advantage. For example, we're doing a \"back to the future\" on the charge card. That's our pay-in-full product at the end of 30 days. Consumers want discipline, and if we can bring that discipline of paying in full at the end of the month along with the service levels that we provide, plus the rewards and other programs we have, we think that's a tremendous opportunity for us to grow. We also believe there are substantial opportunities in partnering with banks to issue Vista-branded credit cards, and we've had very strong success doing it globally. Another area we feel strongly about is that we have information we can use in very effective ways for a range of partners. We believe that our information, which we use in our own business and marketing, can be used by retailers, restaurants, and other corporations to improve their business, and that's an increasing area of focus for us.",

If you plan to donate, please wait until at least two hours after eating, and make sure to drink plenty of water the night before. Donations are limited to employees only; no family members please. If you will be out of the office Thursday morning, but would like to still donate, see your manager to arrange a time that you can go to the County Blood Bank and donate during working hours.

I have been named the lead architect. We understand that serious problems have led to the current situation at the museum. The museum building is 100 years old. It has not been properly taken care of, and it needs a lot of work. Everything from the foundation to the heating system will have to be restored and repaired. It will be expensive, but the work must be done if the museum is to last another hundred years. Now I am going to describe all of the problems in detail. Then I'll explain the work that needs to be done and how we will do it.",

        "transcript": "Hi, Dori Madson here, host of the KORG-FM afternoon show. My dog, Spot, loves to run. The trouble is, she was always running out of our yard into the neighbors' yards. Once, she even ran into the street and nearly got hit by a car! That's when I called my friends at InvisiFence. They came right over, explained their program, and within a couple of hours had erected an invisible barrier around our yard that keeps Spot on our property just like a real fence would. Spot can now run happily around our yard, and me and my family don't have to worry about her running away. She'll go right to the edge of the yard, but won't go past it. The Invisifence process was smooth, quick, and surprisingly affordable -- much cheaper than putting a real fence around my yard would have been. If you're looking for an effective way to keep your dog on your property, call Invisifence now. They're right here in town, at 789-9876. Or, check them out on the web at invisifence.com. Take it from me, you'll be glad you did.",

The discounts are up to 40-percent off, and they can be used immediately. To attain the discount rates, employees need to use our company identifier at the time they buy tickets or make reservations. Our identifier is TWA00Z. Please make a note of that, so you can pass it on to your staff for anyone who wants to use it this week. Make sure you tell them that they can use each discount only once a year. In other words, they can't take their family to the water park once in June using the discount, then return in August and get the special rate again. And let's give a big thank-you to the marketing department for securing these great perks!",

Dave's voiceover career began early, when he was chosen narrator of the school Christmas play in third grade. After earning a broadcasting degree from State University, Dave worked for a variety of radio stations and communication companies before launching his own businesses, Variety Voices, in 1998. His crisp diction, standard accent and attention to detail have made Dave Niesel, and Variety Voices, one of the nation's leading producers of voiceover talent. Without further ado, let me introduce a man who will make my voice sound like a pubescent teenager's: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome Dave Niesel (applause).",

Hurricane Harry is moving south-southeast about 25 miles off the Florida Coast, and is predicted to strike southern Florida early this evening. Winds are forecasted to be 75- to 100-miles an hour, with ocean swells up to 10 feet high. Florida authorities have ordered residents of coastal cities to evacuate their homes for the next 24 hours, and two units of the National Guard have been dispatched to assist elderly and disabled residents. Forecasters at the national weather center have labeled Harry a level-2 hurricane, and say it might decrease to level-1 by the time it reaches land. Residents of islands in the Florida Keys have also begun evacuating in case Harry suddenly veers farther south. This is Mitch Bloomfield reporting for WROJ. The next update will be at top of the hour, or whenever news breaks on news radio WROJ, 920 a.m.",

Even though these classes are free to our employees, some of you have complained that workers in your department aren't taking advantage of them. Staff have complained that they are too tired and too busy to drive to the IBD campus after work. But I have a hunch that most of them don't recognize the benefit expanded computer skills will have for their job performance. I can understand this, since most of them already have the skill they need to perform their current jobs well. So, I propose that we hire a presenter, Jim Jefferson, to give our staff a motivational lecture about why continued learning is important in their careers.",

But I kept applying to universities, and finally, I found one -- Carver University -- that offered me a scholarship. This changed my life. Without that experience, there is no way I'd have ever gotten a job at the Cornerstone Company, let alone be standing here as company president. Now it's overwhelming to be back at Carver, looking at the faces of so many eager men and women who are anxious to get out there and make a difference. My message to you is: never give up. Ever.

Last year Mr. Sparks signed a distribution agreement with a national distributor, and soon Tina's Tea will be a household name. Tonight Christopher, who's only 24, will discuss what it's like to be successful at such a young age, and where he will take his young company from here. Mr. Sparks will speak for about 60 minutes. Please save all your questions for the end of his speech, when there will be a 30-minute question-and-answer session. If you have a question for Christopher at that time, raise your hand, and one of our ushers will bring you a wireless microphone so that everyone in the room will be able to hear you.

Like everyone else, we need to tighten our belts, and we've been talking about the best way to do this. One measure we've decided to enact is a temporary hiring freeze. I can assure you that none of you will lose your jobs, but effective immediately, we will not hire new employees for at least the next two financial quarters. I know we're short-handed, and that some of you have been doing the work of two positions. Unfortunately, you will have to continue doing so, and others of you will have to take on new duties to help us through this difficult time. We are not in a position to remunerate you for these sacrifices, but we will note what you are doing, and when things pick up in the future we will try our best to compensate you for them. In addition, we need to cut back on office supplies, and make extra efforts to save costs on electricity. Mr. Thompson will now share a few tips on how to do this. Thank you for your cooperation.",

Ask for me, Patty, when you come in. We'd like you to arrive about 15 minutes early so you can fill out some financial information for us. You'll need to bring copies of your most recent bills, and information about any investments you have, like stocks, IRAs, real estate, and so on. Also, we'll need an idea of your monthly income and expenses. Could you please call and me know if this time works for you or not?

Based on what's happened in the past, it's a bit difficult to talk about the future, because, if you had asked me this question five years ago, there's no way I would have predicted that our company could grow this much, and would have become the leading domestic brand in our industry. It still seems surreal. So, I'm hesitant to look too far forward. There are two things that I hope will happen, and that we will certainly strive like heck for. One is to make sure we don't rest on our laurels, but look for ways to constantly improve our product. The other is to compete more on the worldwide market, so that in a short while our name is as well known in Iceland as it is in Iowa. Those, I guess, would be our two main short-term goals. Honestly, I don't think much beyond that.",

Rush hour is in full swing all over the valley, and volumes are heavy on all major thoroughfares. Traffic is gridlocked on Interstate 11 from Maple Street clear to Valley Market Center, where it finally begins to thin out. Interstate 305 isn't much better; pretty much bumper-to-bumper through the six-mile stretch from Belleville to Redland. The only blocking slowdown at this hour is on State Route 10, where a car in the left lane has apparently run out of gas near the Mountain View exit. There is a tow truck on the way to the scene to help out, and we can see some people trying to push the car onto the left shoulder. The only other major bottleneck at this hour is on Westmont Avenue, where the right lane is closed for a couple of miles due to ongoing road improvements. It's better to take Eastlake Way instead. I'm Miguel Lopez for \"Eagle Eye\" traffic. Now back to you in the studio, Dave.",

Last year, our advertising revenue grew by 3 percent. This year, our goal is to double that figure, to 6 percent. How can we do that? We've discussed running an auction for on-line advertisements. The highest bidder will get to put their ad at the top of our web page. The winner of the auction will be the company that is willing to pay the most money per click. That means that each time someone clicks on their ad, they pay us. But they have to tell us, in advance, how much they are willing to pay. I think this is a good idea, but we have identified some software problems that have to be worked out so that we can set up an auction system. Let's put Jamie and Chris to work on those problems. We'll talk about this again in two weeks.",

Today, living dangerously engages our intellect, advances society, and even makes us happier. A 2005 German study found that people who take above-average risks have a higher degree of life satisfaction. A study by Colson University revealed that among North American business managers, those who take greater risks are more successful. So the more risk you're willing to take, the more reward you'll reap and the better you'll feel. It's important not to go too crazy, though -- know your limits, and calculate the odds.",

She knows basketball well, not only because she was a college player herself, at Western University, but she also comes from a basketball family. Her father, Jerry, was a long-time high school coach, and her mother, Brenda, has coached youth basketball for more than 20 years. Her two sisters, Linda and Abigail, also played hoops in high school and college. After a brief pro career, MaryAnn returned to Western as an assistant coach for two years, and then moved up as an assistant at Tech University for four years. She got her first head coaching job at Valley State, which she led to the league championship before moving to Hickstown U, where she's gone 64-18 and won two league titles the past three seasons. So, without further ado, I'll turn the microphone over to MaryAnn to answer your questions.",

This won't affect the layout of the paper or the way you do your jobs -- not initially, at least. I don't know what's in store down the road, but I have confidence that only good things are ahead. Dick  Blaha has a demonstrated record of success. He has been in newspapers all his life, and has a passion for community news that will serve this paper well.

When you are called upon, please wait for a microphone to be handed to you before asking your question. Now I am pleased to welcome Brolio Segui,, last year's champion. He'll talk about this year's tournament and answer questions.",

As you can see on the tri-county weather map behind me, there's a storm front moving into the area from the north, which will bring rain tonight and tomorrow, with possible thunder and lightning storms by tomorrow afternoon. After that, this ridge of high pressure air here in the south will blow the rain clouds out; so we should see clearing on Wednesday with partly sunny skies. High temperatures will rise to 70 degrees on Thursday, and next weekend is shaping up to be clear and sunny. Now let's take a look at weather around the state. You can see that the high temperature today is over here in the eastern part of the state, 102 degrees at Wallace Falls. The low is in the north, where the storm front is now -- 52 degrees at Wrightville. It's currently 58 degrees and mostly cloudy in the tri-county area. Expect to see partial sun breaks this afternoon, turning to cloudy skies and showers this evening as the storm front moves in. Winds are currently blowing out of the northeast at a gentle 5 miles per hour. This is meteorologist Ray Rodriquez with WJAM weather. I'll see you again with a new update on the 5 p.m. news.",

Investigators have not yet determined the cause of the fire, which caused an estimated $500 million in damage to homes in the Mount Capistan area. A look at the KPUT weather map shows clouds moving into the area this afternoon and evening, which are expected to bring rain and possible thundershowers. But they should pass through by tomorrow evening, and the weekend is expected to be clear and dry. The stock market is up by 150 points at this hour after hitting a morning low point, marked by the red dot, of minus 35 points. Finally in sports, the Eagles lost 3-2 to Cincinnati yesterday, and have the night off before hosting New York tomorrow. I'm Casey Carpenter for KPUT news.",

This is why I'm focusing on regional collaborations. For example, our state police are being deployed in partnership with the city police. We have to be able to share resources like that, and find other areas where resource-sharing makes sense. Another thing we have to do is to re-train workers. I believe it is the government's role to help them prepare for new careers. So, even though the budget is tight, I have proposed to the state Legislature that we pay college tuition for people to get degrees in areas of need, like nursing. We have 80,000 vacancies in that field, even though we have high unemployment. There is a skills gap.",

Northbound 9 starts to slow near Gigantic Mall, and is heavy from there all the way to Shoreview Heights. On eastbound Route 222, traffic is flowing again across the bridge now that an earlier accident has been cleared to the side. On west 222, we're getting reports of a stalled car blocking the right lane of the First Avenue on-ramp. Traffic is backed up along First Avenue to the scene. Otherwise, the roads look pretty good, and there are no blockages to report at this time. WPMZ traffic reports are sponsored by Dick's Delis.

        "transcript": "That's a fair question, and the short answer is no, we don't plan to lay off any employees at this point. In a tough economy, we're going to act just like our customers -- tightening our belt and looking for ways to save money. We'll be looking at ways we can conserve energy, operate our stores more efficiently, and integrate new procedures that cut the costs of gas and power. We're also going to re-examine our pricing structure. We might have to lower prices and operate on a thinner profit margin for awhile. We value each and every one of our employees, and we won't let them go until we've first tried everything we possibly can. So I can't promise there won't be layoffs down the road, but your listeners can rest assured that we're committed to trying and avoid them at all costs.",

If you need to buy tickets for the light-rail train, use the automated ticket machines located just inside the main doorway, or go to one of the booths on the left side of the main lobby. There are rail route maps and information about the light-rail system at the kiosks on both the main and lower floors. Passengers traveling on the blue track should go downstairs and board on the right. Passengers for the yellow and red tracks will board downstairs on the left. There are wheelchair-accessible ramps next to the stairs, and an elevator along the rear wall. Trains will arrive and depart every 10 minutes, so if you miss your first train, don't worry. There is free coffee, hot chocolate and donuts today on the upper level for your enjoyment. At 1 o'clock, there will be a ribbon-cutting ceremony with Mayor Greg Nicholas outside the front doors, to celebrate the grand-opening of this station. We hope you will enjoy your light-rail experience. If you need any assistance, look for one of the workers wearing a yellow jacket. They'll be happy to answer your questions and help guide you. You can also learn more about the new city light-rail system and this station online at www.cityrail.com. Thank you for choosing Metro light rail.",

We will spend the next six months working out logistics -- how to best absorb their employees and buildings and assimilate them into our corporate culture. Once this transition process is completed, we will be the largest company in our industry. Though there will be several changes, none of you will lose your positions. And please inform your employees that all of them will be retained. We don't know yet how many workers from the Smith Company that we will keep, or exactly what positions they will have with us. The biggest advantage for us is that we get Smith's nearly two million customers, to complement the three-and-a-half million we have now. Our focus will be on retaining the Smith customers during the transition. We want you to think about how to do this, and we will meet again next week to brainstorm specific ideas. You can announce the news to your staff this afternoon, but please caution them not to say anything until the public announcement is made tomorrow morning.",

I say new because he's new to those of you sitting at this table, but not to many of you personally. John Clayton has been with the firm for almost 20 years now. He started as a hardware technician and worked his way up to senior manager, then systems director, and finally to his current position of vice president in charge of research and development. Since you're all familiar with John's work, I want to tell you a little about his personal life. John is married with three wonderful children, ages 12, 9 and 7. Last year, his 9-year-old, Luke, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. This was of course terrible news for John and his wife Karen, but they have helped Luke battle the sickness, and he is doing very well. During this difficult period, John was able to do his job despite missing several weeks attending to his family. His election to our board of directors is a testament to his courage, perseverance, and high personal standards. John replaces Martin Lynch, who retired last November, and though those are big shoes to fill, I am confident that he is more than up to the task. But enough blather from me. John...",

According to our website statistics and independent polling, our biggest customers are young adults, particularly young women. Sixty-six percent of all women age 18 to 25 are aware of our brand, compared to only 47 percent of women age 25 to 40. With men, sixty-two percent know our brand in the 18 to 25 demographic, but that falls to 43 percent in the 25 to 40 age range. The trouble is, young adults have less money than older adults. Only about 35 percent of all people over 40 - men and women - have heard of us. Interestingly, that percentage is higher with teenagers: 40 percent of all girls and 39 percent of all boys know our brand. But again, teens don't have money.

At this time, there are three students in the district who have been diagnosed with the chicken flu or have displayed symptoms of it. Those three schools -- Sunrise Elementary, Kennedy Middle School, and Clinton Elementary -- will be closed today and tomorrow as a precautionary measure. All other district schools are open and operating on regular schedule. If your child displays flu-like symptoms, you must keep them home from school. Symptoms include a fever of 102 degrees or higher, sore throat, diarrhea, and persistent coughing. To prevent the flu, make sure your children wash their hands frequently, blow their noses into tissues or handkerchiefs, and get plenty of water and rest.

        "transcript": "Hi, this is Mindy Rollins with your 4 p.m. front-seat traffic update. A couple of problems to report at this hour. A two-car collision is blocking the right lane of Interstate 12 near the Broad Street on-ramp, and traffic there is backed up for about two miles. On Highway 33, a milk truck has overturned near the junction of Holden Road, which has created a parking lot while work crews clear debris from the roadway. Other roads look normal for this time. Interstate 14 slows coming into Millburg, but picks up again near Smithport, and State Route 7 is slow off-and-on from the downtown S-curves through Lake McDonald. If you need to cross the lake right now, both roadways look pretty good, but Interstate 80 is a little bit better bet than State Route 320, where volumes are beginning to build on the west side. This is Mindy Rollins with front-seat traffic.",

We'll start here at the pier, which seems natural since this city was founded 150 years ago as a major seaport. Next we'll explore the three major hills that surround downtown -- First Hill, Pill Hill, and High Point. These will include stops at the Native American Center, the Art Museum, and a ride to High Point via cable car for a picnic lunch. Then we'll take the Goose on a short cruise around Lake Lincoln, and end with a tour of the downtown historical district. Please keep your hands and feet inside the Goose at all times. If you have any questions, hold them until the end of the tour, when we will have a 15-minute question and answer session. Thank you for joining us today!",

I have known Miguel Soriano for more than 20 years, and I think of him first not as a famous director but as a citizen, father, teacher, and friend. Yes, it's true that he has directed some of the greatest motion pictures of our time, and that he has made famous actors such as Roberto DiNardo and Martin Braun. But it's also true that he has raised five fine children, volunteered for his local church, and given millions of dollars to charities such as this one. Ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Mr. Miguel Soriano! (loud clapping and cheering).",

Next, Geoffrey will update us on research trends in the industry, and suggest ways we can use those in marketing our product. Finally, I'd like to have a group brainstorm for 30 minutes or so on marketing ideas and the future direction of marketing for our company. I hope we'll be able to adjourn by 4:30.

At Corporate Electric, I learned how to be a general manager. It was the best factory I ever saw for that. I spent time on the staff of CEO Bishop Walsh, and watching him up close showed the power of being adaptive, aggressive, and competitive -- but still, as he always said, we can be hard-hearted in business yet softhearted when it comes to taking care of people.

What you might not know is that Mr. Jamison founded two businesses that failed prior to Beta Soft, and that starting his third - and most successful - venture was actually his wife's idea.

The tall white building behind that is the Ricks Tower, which was the tallest building in the city for almost 100 years. Coming up on the left-hand side is the oldest building in town. Constructed in 1835, it was originally the county courthouse. It's gone through several reincarnations since then, and is currently the Pit Stop, one of the city's finest watering holes. Ahead on the right is the Gazette Building, home of the city's largest newspaper. OK, now we're leaving downtown and headed for the University District, to check out some historic architecture at the state's most prestigious institute of higher education. After that, we'll have lunch at 12 o'clock at the historic Rose Inn, prior to our afternoon cruise on the lake.",

Interstate 13 is slow between Westgate and the First Street exit due to an earlier accident which has now been cleared. On eastbound 202, a stalled SUV is blocking the right lane just west of Diamond City, and volume is building as we wait for a tow truck to arrive on the scene. Road work continues to slow traffic on Interstate 9 south of downtown, where two southbound lanes will remain closed through the rest of the week. An alternative route, Highway 20, looks good right now southbound, but on northbound 20 a couch has fallen from the bed of a pickup truck, which is starting to jam things up near milepost 18. The rest of the roadways are normal at this time. This has been Kelly Kykendall for KRPM-AM. Traffic has been brought to you by FarmCo Insurance, who reminds you that one phone call could your life.

Here are some tips to help you stay safe while on the road. First, the Do's. If you're traveling with more than one driver, try to switch drivers occasionally so that you don't spend too much time behind the wheel. Remember to stop frequently and take a break. Make sure you know the signs of drowsiness: missing road signs, difficulty focusing, and yawning. Now the Don'ts. Don't count on distractions such as the radio or an open window to keep you awake. And even though a cup of coffee might give you a lift, remember that the effects of caffeine wear off after a short time. Finally, don't drive between midnight and morning. Tune in again tomorrow and we'll talk about vacation destinations that both adults and children will enjoy.",

The funding for this project was courtesy of a donation from the Historical Museum, and the statue was sculpted by a local artist, Mr. Kyle Chamberlain. We are honored to have Mr. Chamberlain with us this afternoon. Kyle is a native of our state, and moved to our city when he was 16. He comes from a family of artists, and graduated from the New York Institute of Art. He has been sculpting statues ever since. His work is displayed at the downtown art museum, as well as several other museums around the country. Today Kyle will tell you about carving this statue from an old portrait of Chief Nokahoma, a process which took 18 months. Please join me in welcoming Mr. Kyle Chamberlain!",

I'm hopeful that we'll start to see more pronounced improvements in several areas. One is increased technology spending. Another is more growth in travel and entertainment spending, because corporations need to get out there and grow their business, and they need to travel and spend. I'm also hopeful that affluent customers who have the capacity will start to spend more. We just did a survey of some of our credit-card holders, and only one of four felt that the worst of the recession was over. That's just perception, but it's important. We then asked, \"If you found $500, how would you spend it?\" They said they'd pay off regular bills and pay down debt. On the positive side, 60 percent said their spending will remain the same or will increase. Young professionals were the most optimistic and said, \"We think we'll start to spend more on discretionary items, like smart phones and vacations.\" So at least some attitudes are starting to change. Nonetheless, I feel it will take a year or so before these types of attitudes become widespread.",

But now a flat tire doesn't have to ruin your trip. Due to revolutionary new technology, Ruble Tires let you drive up to 100 miles after a flat, so you can change the tire in a safe, comfortable environment. Ruble's new Rugged Wear tires are side reinforced, so the rubber on the side of the tire supports a car's weight even when the bottom of the tire loses air. Rugged Wear tires are the latest in a long line of Ruble innovations. At Ruble, we make driving safer. For more information on all Ruble Tires, visit our website at www.ruble.com.",

We're getting a report of a two-car collision on Highway 12 just south of Kinnear Street that's blocking the left two lanes there. The only route that looks pretty good right now is Interstate 306, which is bottle-necked at the convention center but clears west of there and then is off and on into Rockway. This report is brought to you by Koala Cola, the drink that is refreshingly different. This has been Patricia Prentice for WRAP-FM. Our next Koala Cola update will be at the top of the hour.",

He has spent the past five years working closely with me, and contrary to what some critics are saying, I can assure you that he is well-prepared for this change, and is qualified to keep this company among the leaders in an increasingly competitive high-tech industry.

Prior to that, Ms. Farmer's only previous writing experience was in a college English class. Now she's already written a sequel due out next month, and is at work on a third book, but she insists that success hasn't changed her. She's still a devoted mother and wife.

After considering several factors, including the questionnaires you completed last spring, we've decided that we're going to switch to four-day workweeks, beginning next month. We will work 10 hours a day, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., on Monday through Thursday. The office will be closed Fridays. Though we will still work 40 hours a week, we estimate that this change will reduce our energy use by 15 percent, and will also save each of you, on average, about $20 a month in gas and transportation costs. Overall, this change will significantly cut our company's greenhouse transmissions and reduce our carbon footprint. To save even more energy, we will be installing compact fluorescent light bulbs -- CFLs -- in every light socket at the start of next week. During the changeover period, we understand that some of you, particularly those with young children, might need special accommodations as you adjust to a four-day week. If you have troubles or concerns, let your manager know. We'll be happy to help you any way we can. Though this might be traumatic at first, we're confident that most of you will like the new schedule once you've grown accustomed to the change.",

Interstate 12 is flowing smoothly again now that cars involved in an earlier accident have been cleared to the shoulder, but volume on State Route 95 is starting to build. Traffic there is backed up near the city center exit due to a stalled vehicle in the right lane, and again north of the city due to a two-car injury accident on the Statesville off ramp. Interstate 1 is bumper-to-bumper on the bridge crossing the river, where work crews are re-paving part of the roadway. All other major routes look good right now, though traffic on Vine Street near the freeway entrance is slowing because of a malfunctioning traffic light. For KOKO, this is Kathy Hendricks with birds-eye traffic.",

A former newspaper reporter, Mr. Fellows' 22 novels include 14 number-one best-sellers, and 10 of his stories have been turned into major Hollywood movies. Last year's novel, \"The Third House on the Left,\" won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction as well as the Pen Faulkner Award, making Jason one of only a half-dozen writers to win both of these prestigious honors in the same year.

When I was in college, I had a couple of short stories published in the campus literature magazine. But I majored in business. When I was 28, I wrote a short story in my spare time. My wife read it, and submitted it to a magazine behind my back. Well, it was published. That encouraged me to start writing more in my spare time. By age 32, I had completed my first novel. To my great surprise, it became a best-seller. So I quit my business job and began writing full time. Now, after six best-sellers, I finally consider myself to be a writer.",

Hair Apparent's experienced doctors combine the use of hair from other parts of your body with their patented growth gel to give you a full, natural-looking head of hair within six- to eight-weeks.

Next, timesheets are to be turned in to your department manager by 5 p.m. each Friday. It's your responsibility to make sure they are filled out properly. If they aren't, your paycheck will be delayed. If you have any expense vouchers or overtime documentation sheets, paper clip - do not staple - them, to the back of your timesheet. Overtime must be pre-approved by your direct supervisor, and you have to get a documentation sheet from the supervisor before working the overtime hours. Pay days are the 15th and 30th of each month, or the closest Friday if one of those dates falls on a weekend. Finally, please note carefully company policy in regard to keeping your work stations clean and projecting a professional appearance in your personal dress.",

A car-bus collision in the southbound lanes has brought Interstate 35 to a virtual shutdown in both directions near Northcenter. There appear to be numerous injuries, and the state patrol and aid cars are on the scene. Three lanes are closed southbound, and northbound traffic on I-35 is crawling through the area as people slow to take a peek. Other area roadways appear normal for this hour. Highway 4 is smooth sailing through downtown, and State Route 20 has off-and-on slowing from Wideview through Treeland. If you're crossing the river the Sky Street bridge is your best bet, as the Key Bridge is still slow due to the effects of an earlier debris spill in the left eastbound lane. For WYFF-FM, this is Marcy Maradona. We'll be back with more news after this word from our sponsor.",

This is in response to the aggressive push by online depositories and credit unions, which are enticing customers with higher interest rates. This is squeezing our interest margin and decreasing our profitability. We can't lend money that we don't have, right? At the same time, we will be switching the title of \"loan officers\" to \"relationship officers.\" A large part of their job now will be to recruit, and retain, new deposits.",

So we need to find ways to make it seem fresher, and more relevant to today's younger generation. One way we will do this is through a new advertising campaign, featuring radio, TV and print ads. Victoria and Sam are heading this project. Another thing we're going to do is introduce two new key products, which are in the testing stage now. Robert and the R & D team have been working on these for over a year, and we hope to have them ready to come to market in a couple of months. Finally, we're going to start working on re-designing our logo. Mariana and Barbara in marketing will be starting on that immediately. As you all know, we've lost market share to our competitors, and sales have been slow recently. The good news is, we're still profitable, and many members of the focus groups indicated that they still trust our brand. So that's the broad plan for change. We'll focus more on the details in coming weeks. Do you have any questions before we move on?",

I am pleased to announce that we will be opening a new Furniture City store this April at 53 Parkway Street, opposite the Parkway Mall. This will be our third location in the city, and our largest store yet, with 6,000 square feet. Our stores are renowned for providing quality furniture at reasonable prices, and this store will be no exception. It will employ 30 persons, and we expect it to generate more than $2 million a year for the city in tax revenue. This is another measure of the growth of Furniture City, which began four years ago in a small office on Clark Street. Maurice Alberts, our founder and president, has expanded the company in the space of that time to one of the fastest-growing firms in our state. Revenues for Furniture City rose 10 percent last year, and are up to 2 percent for the first quarter of this year. In addition to this new store, we have plans to expand soon into other cities in the state. At this time, I will field any questions that you have, either about our new store or our company in general.",

At the end of our six-week course all of you, hopefully, will be able to pass the real estate exam and become Richmond agents. Here are some things to note before we begin our training. First, you need to hand in your blue class registration forms at the table in the front of the room. Then, go the table against the right wall to find your name tag and a packet of course information. Next, go the table in the back corner to pick up your text book. Once you have done all these things, find a seat and sit down. When everyone's ready Nathan Richmond, our company president, will say a few remarks. After that, we'll head for the conference room and tonight's first class. Okay? Are there any questions?",

        "transcript": "Have you ever have found a job, a home, or a lover through people you know? If you have, then you've networked successfully. Networking is not a new idea, but most people don't use it very effectively. Today I'm going to teach you a system called Super Networking that allows you to easily build a network of people around you, so that you have everyone and everything you need close at hand. You can accomplish this with a simple strategy: Raise your visibility through increased interactions. The Super Networking System provides this effectively. First, we?ll discuss three basic concepts. The first concept is called the rule of 250. The average person knows about 250 people -- family members, friends, work colleagues, neighbors, club members, all the people you've done business with, and so on. But the average person doesn't work hard at meeting new people. Super Networkers do. While the average person knows 250 people, Super Networkers know an average of thirty-five hundred people. That's fourteen times more than the average person. So, you're going to focus on Super Networkers, based on the rule of 250. That's the first concept. Now,?",

Well, if you're on the roads listening to this, you already know that traffic is pretty much a mess everywhere. On Interstate 7, it crawls from downtown to the county line. Vehicles crossing the lake on State Route 50 are gridlocked both eastbound and westbound, and the valley freeway is stop-and-go from Mayberry through Winwood. Highway 17 is slow through the city, then clears out until Overpass Road. If that weren't bad enough, an injury accident is blocking Main Street downtown, causing a 15-minute backup for cars waiting to get onto the freeway. This has been Betty Bellarussa with your 5 p.m. WARP-AM traffic update. Our next traffic report will be at the bottom of the hour.",

Guys, just go out there and play, and stop thinking so much. I've seen you at practice, and I know you can do this! When the going gets tough, the tough get going! You guys are tough! If we play our game, we'll be fine. We're better than them, and we can win this thing! Think about your assignments, and carry out your assignments on each play.

Q3 With great persistence - he never gave up - he worked his way up to become the company’s leader. Even in this last year of his service to New Star, Mr. Kim initiated a market research study to reevaluate our company’s performance and ensure its continued profitability.

I have been with J&8 Limited since the beginning, when Jeff and I was just a couple of guys working in a rented garage. We’ve gone from producing and selling audio recordings of local musicians to being Q2 one of the nation’s largest and most respected providers of quality entertainment products. We now produce and distribute everything from music to movies and video games. And while I appreciate the honor you’re bestowing on me this evening, Q3 I want to stress that my success would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of my wonderful colleagues, many of whom are here tonight. With our success as a company has come responsibility - to our industry, to our community, and most of all to our loyal customers who have, contributed to support and purchase our products. I’m looking forward to many more happy years with J&B Limited.",

Well done! Now I want to discuss our revised product development process.  Q2 As you can see from this flowchart, we’ve added a step between \"create a design\" and \"build a model\". This new step means you’ll need approval from the executive board before creating your prototype. Lately,  Q3 there’s been some concern about the amount off time being spent on prototypes that never actually become products.

Q3 We'll be having a live performance of some of the moves that we will be teaching people to master this Saturday at 12:00 P.M. We would like to invite all members of the community, young and old, boys and girls, to come down to the Recreational Center and enjoy the performance.  Springfield Dance Troupe will of course be continuing to teach the courses that we have always offered, with one exception. Sally Jones, who many of you know from her fantastic Nutcracker performances, will be moving back to Westport. As a result, after this week we will not be offering ballet classes until we can find a teacher to replace her. I hope to see you all at the Recreation Center this Saturday at noon!",

Q1 I’d like announce a few changes in our health and safety policy that are designed to conform to the new government regulations. Firstly, we can no longer work a shift longer than six hours without taking a one-hour break. We’ll be using a clock-in system that is automated to send you a text message once you reach six hours. You will also wear a device that monitors your time on the shift.  Q2 It’s a very simple device, you just attach it to your work belt and it will do the rest, so you won’t need any training with that. Q3 Sharing helmets and work boots is also now prohibited. You will have to buy your own equipment, and then later you can claim the money back on your tax return.",

As the CEO of Metro Studios, it is my great pleasure to witness this amazing opportunity to work with such a high caliber company like Walker Studios. They possess a number of studios that are capable of producing cutting edge quality 3-D films. This will allow our company to begin producing 3-D films.  Q2 And why wouldn’t we? The majority of our films are science fiction, and I believe a transition into 3-D is an excellent path for US. I have ensured that we will have full access to Walker Studio’s equipment, and in return they will become a shareholder in our company.  Q3 I suggest that our studio staff should spend the next following weeks studying how this new type of equipment works, so we can begin producing content as soon as possible.",

We had a win rate of 98% this year. We have beaten all the competition, with the second highest at 92%. This means a lot for us. This result will allow US to move into corporate law, which is the most highly profitable area in the world! This is due to the diligence and hard work of our legal team.  Q2 So let’s keep moving up! Corporate law is very technical however, so I will be sending out a lot of information through email over the next several weeks.  Q3 I’m going to need all of you to study this material, so we can maintain our win rate and continue growing as a firm.",

We’ve received donations from some community groups to assist in buying trees to plant in the park, but we still need additional funds for purchasing playground equipment and benches. I think we should contact some local businesses to see if they'd be willing to make a donation.  Q3 So what I’d like us to do now is come up with a list of shop and restaurant owners who might be interested in helping with this project.",

Q1 Despite its name, Sunlight House was designed by Edgar Thompson not as a residential home but as the office for his architectural business. It was here that he worked on many of the industrial buildings that he's so well-known for today. You'll see when you enter the building that it's simply one large room with cleverly designed modular workspaces for Thompson and each of his associates. Q2 That type of floor plan is quite common today, but it was revolutionary for Thompson's time. As we walk around, feel free to take photographs, but please Q3 do not handle or lean against anything, as many of the items on display have become fragile with age.",

Q3 Also, if you are planning such a large event, we have an excellent planner in the office named Shubert Mendez. If you want to speak with him just ask for extension 12 when you call to confirm.

Q3 It has come to my attention that the Human Resource Department has been overwhelmed lately with reports about messes in the common areas. As your regional manager, I feel it is my responsibility to take ownership of this problem before it gets completely out of control. Just so everybody is clear, the common areas include the kitchen, the foyer, recreation room A, and lounge c on the second floor. I don’t know who is responsible for this recent run of uncleanliness, but from now on we are going to assign a staff member to monitor the condition of each area and sign off on it at the end of every day. We will do this until I feel everyone has learned to respect the space. Be sure to check the schedule to see which area you will be responsible for.",

The next film we are going to show is particularly special. The film is called “Beyond the Blue” and is the debut release from documentary film maker Michael Harris.  Q1 The film captures the deepest parts of the ocean and explores the complex eco systems that exist in the areas of the ocean that humans cannot survive in. Q2 The film has already been nominated for multiple awards, most recently at the BAPTA Film Festival. Remember, this is the first film Mr. Harris has made. Q3 After the film, Mr. Harris will come to the front for a short Q&A session. Anyway, please enjoy the show.",

Q1 Here are some tips to help you stay safe while on the road. First, the Do’s. If you’re traveling with more than one driver, try to switch drivers occasionally so that you don’t spend too much time behind the wheel. Q2 Remember to stop frequently and take a break. Make sure you know the signs of drowsiness: missing road signs, difficulty focusing, and yawning. Now the Don’t’s. Don’t count on distractions such as the radio or an open window to keep you awake. And even though a cup of coffee might give you a lift, remember that the effects of caffeine wear off after a short time. Finally, don’t drive between midnight and morning. Q3 Tune in again tomorrow when we’ll talk about vacation destinations that both adults and children will enjoy.",

Cycling is a great way of doing just that, and you can get to work just as quickly as you can by car for most journeys under five miles. And you don’t have to pay for parking. Q2 As part of National Bike Week, our cycle forum is holding a bike riders’ breakfast on Thursday, July sixteenth in front of the Collins Building.

Q3 You order a set of knives for example, and you choose how you want to customize them – have your family name engraved, choose what type of handles you want, and so on. I think you’ll be happy to place an order for your retail stores with us once I’ve shown you some of our products. You can always send them back for a full refund if you’re not delighted with your sales.",

Q1 The bad news is, the newest entry into our market, Strange Brew Ales, has a directly competing beer and is making strong gains. In order to stay competitive, we must be able to introduce new styles of craft beer to our consumers. Our analysts agree, if the current trend continues, Strange Brew Ales will bump US out of the top five by this time next year. Our master brewers have come up with four new styles of beer that we will introduce to a focus group at the upcoming Northcut Beer Festival.  Q2 Once we get consumer feedback we will select the two most popular offerings and create an aggressive marketing campaign. Our sales must increase by at least 5% over the next quarter in order to maintain our market share in Northcut.",

Q2&3 Sam’s Salon has been volunteering to give the homeless in our community shampoos, shaves, and haircuts in order to help them get back on their feet. To further this effort, Sam’s Salon is having a Saturday only haircut special, where half of all sales will go to help the local homeless shelter.

Our newest line of office security systems is really impressive, and I am sure it will meet your needs. We have developed four options to choose from.  Q2 Let me just say that Option 1 is by far the best value because of the backup system that we offer with this package. It is not as expensive as Option 4, but don’t let that fool you. Option 1 still offers all of the security that your business could want. All of our options include state-of-the-art video surveillance.

The architectural design is appropriate and popular because of the Weather conditions in Toronto. Q2 The temperature fluctuates widely from summer to winter - by as much as 40 degrees Celsius within a year. Q3 This underground area has also helped to keep business in the city center instead of moving out to the suburbs, which is happening in many other cities.
