        "transcript": "Generally speaking, the types of investments you make should be based on your tolerance for risk. In other words, how much money can you stand to lose? The stock market is the best way to earn the most money over time, but it's also the riskiest. You could also lose the most there. We recommend that you don't buy stocks with money you're going to need in the next five years. Bonds are less risky than stocks, but the flip side is that they will earn you less money. They might not earn enough so you can afford your retirement. We urge you to consider what we call an investment \"sleeping scale, \" which helps measure the safety of your investments by how much sleep you might lose worrying about them. We find most people sleep comfortably with a balance of stocks, bonds, cash, and other investments, such as real estate. This balance changes as you get older, becoming more conservative over time. Here, let me show you a few examples of some typical investment pie charts.",

The president called the legislation a \"vital stimulus\" for the country's education system.

For the next month, at least one lane of traffic will be closed between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. There will be orange signs diverting traffic to detour routes along Second Avenue and Waterfront Road. Businesses on Main Street will remain open during the road work, and police officers will be directing traffic. If you need to use Main Street during this time, expect delays and remember that traffic violations in work zones carry a penalty of double the maximum fine. Thank you for your patience and understanding. The main street resurfacing project is one of six road improvement projects the city will undertake this year.

I'm going to a movie tonight, but I'll check my voice mail when it's over and if you leave a message I'll call you back. Bye.",

Taking a peek at our eastside real-time camera, we see heavy congestion on Highway 605 east of the convention center, thinning out south of the airport. Traffic on Route 2, meanwhile, looks to be moving steadily until the town of Roserock, where a maintenance crew is fixing a large pothole in the center of the roadway. Finally, looking west along Highway 14, we see a backup near exit 93 that appears to be caused by a dairy truck that has spilled part of its load of milk in the center lane.

Dr. Kidd is a native of Florida, where he earned a bachelors in science before moving here and getting his masters and PhD at State University. He has spent the past two years studying cell-phone radiation under a grant from the National Institute of Health. Next year, he has been invited to join a prestigious committee of international scientists to continue his work in Stockholm, Sweden, for three more years. Dr. Kidd plans today to give a Power Point presentation outlining the preliminary results of his research, followed by practical recommendations about cell-phone use. Please hold all questions, and we'll have about 15 minutes at the end of the presentation for a question-and-answer session. Also, while we're on the subject of cell phones, a friendly reminder: please turn off or mute all cell phones, beepers and other alarms during the presentation. Thank you, and without further ado, please join me in extending a warm welcome to Dr. Wesley Kidd.",

The economy will turn around -- who knows, maybe because of something you do. The glass is half full, people! You're leaving a world that you know, a comfortable, exciting world, to enter another world -- a big, full, breathtaking arena, bursting with opportunity. It's a little scary, but it also should be tremendously exhilarating. Remember that when you first stepped onto this campus, fresh from high school, for many of you it was a moment of great fear and trepidation. Now, that fear is conquered, and you're ready for the next step. Great moments are bred of great opportunity. This is your opportunity. This is your moment. Make the most of it! Thank you.",

Do wear nice clothes -- no jeans, sneakers, or T-shirts. Do comb your hair and brush your teeth. First appearances are important. Don't ask about salary until the end of the interview. Otherwise they will think you're more interested in money. Don't say anything bad about your previous employer. It sounds like sour grapes. Finally, don't avoid difficult questions. If you don't know the answer or aren't sure, it's better to be honest than to try and pretend. This has been Marcy Millen for Job Talk. See you next week.",

Face the tough decisions, but don't let cutbacks stop you from seeing the windows of opportunity that are suddenly open. For example, we've seen research that only 13 percent of people who tighten their budget will go back to their old spending habits when the economy improves. This was a great chance for our company to make explicit what we knew implicitly: Our products are a great value. So we spent money for a new advertising campaign with phrases like \"Quality for less,\" \"shop smart,\" and \"style on a budget.\" As a result, our sales have increased each of the past three quarters. Think creatively. Act aggressively. We can't predict exactly when the broad economy will recover, but your company's recovery can begin whenever you're ready. Don't wait; innovate!",

In this role, I've been able to work doing two things I love -- cooking and meeting new people. The Household Gourmet was founded thirty years ago to provide people with kitchen products that reduce both cooking and clean-up time. Tonight I'll be preparing two easy, delicious treats for you. The first is an appetizer that can be made very quickly using several prepared items from the supermarket. The second treat is a dessert that takes a little bit longer to make, but is well worth the trouble. As I prepare these dishes, I'll be demonstrating some of our efficient, effective, inexpensive kitchen products for you. And at the end of the demonstration, we'll all be able to sample the results; then I'll help you place your orders for Household Gourmet products.",

Louise Carson, a spokesperson for Governor Moore, said the state also expects to receive $100 million from the federal government for flood recovery, noting that President Theodore Cleaver has declared the flood a national emergency.

Ned Bryson, a PhD biologist, makes these and other fascinating creatures come alive in his new book, Marsupials, by Universal Press. Bryson's superb photos alone are worth the $20 cover price, and his encyclopedic knowledge makes this volume a real bargain. Kids will love these small furry animals who have pouches and large, luminous eyes. And they'll get a kick out of some of the offbeat details that Bryson includes. Did you know, for example, that mother koalas make a special kind of poop, called pap, that the joeys eat while they are weaning? There is much here for everyone, including an afterward in which Bryson explains how he rigged his cameras with special infrared lights to photograph the mostly nocturnal marsupials. Though clearly an educated man, Bryson's breezy writing style presents complex ideas in an easy-to-read, kid-friendly manner. This would make a great Christmas or birthday gift for young curious minds.",

There will be four acts, with a 20-minute intermission. If you don't have a program, they're available for free at either of the booths at the side of the stage. During the show, we ask that you remain seated on the grass or in lawn chairs, and please keep children behind the yellow rope lining the front of the stage. If your little one needs to use the restroom, it would be a good idea to take them now. Restrooms are located in the fenced area to the right of the stage. Also, if you're in contact with friends and family who are still arriving, tell them the north lot is full, but there is additional parking in the east and west lots. When the curtain drops to signal the start of the action, please turn off all your cell phones and pagers, and be considerate of your neighbors. Thank you for coming, and we hope you enjoy it!",

I'm honored to be here this evening, and to be able to share with you some simple financial strategies that have worked for me, and can work just as well for you. I don't offer any magic formula to \"get rich quick,\" and no, you won't walk out of here tonight and become millionaires tomorrow. However, if you listen carefully, study dutifully and apply the strategy I'm going to teach you, I guarantee that you can substantially increase your wealth in a relatively short period of time. To give you a personal example, just a few years ago I was like most of you - a middle-class businessperson, doing OK but not fabulous. After I learned this wealth-building strategy, and began applying it, my net worth tripled in the space of two years, and has kept rising steadily since then. I was able to retire five years ago, and am now blessed to be able to travel the country and share with others some of the tricks I have learned. So, let's get started...",

I'm 35 now, and I feel great. The knee injury I suffered last year is completely healed. It feels like I could play for four or five more years. Of course, once the season starts, that could change. Maybe my knee will get hurt again, or else another part of my body. I don't want to be out there playing if I'm not able to compete at a high level. They're paying me five million dollars a year, and I want to prove that I'm worth it. If I ever reach the point where I feel like I'm not giving the fans their money's worth, then I'll be glad to retire and let a younger player take over. I've been playing this game since I was seven years old, and professionally since I was 21, I'm thankful that I've lasted this long and done as well as I have. It's already been a great career.",

This is due mostly to economic factors beyond our control, particularly the gas-price increases. The good news is that our fourth-quarter earnings are projected to rise nearly 3 percent, or about 75 cents a share. That's partly because we've implemented an energy conservation program at all our plants - for instance, cutting fuel usage by 10 percent - and partly because the economy is on the rebound. Going forward, the company remains healthy, and we anticipate increased energy earnings for each of the first two quarters next year. Our challenge will be finding creative ways to remain well-positioned in a bear economy, and planning for flexibility to meet our goals without compromising the quality of our product.",

I want to thank all of you, all the editors, writers, photographers, page designers, printers -- everyone who helped make this paper a city institution for the past 150 years. It's been a pleasure and an honor working with you and supervising you. As you've heard, we will continue to have an online news site with a staff of 25. This re-designed website will begin tomorrow. We hope that it will help fill the gap left by the departed print product. Meanwhile, we have one more issue to put out. Let's get to work and make it the best it can be.",

We have an outstanding lineup this season, which kicks off tonight with a 21st century adaptation of Shakespeare's classic, \"Romeo and Juliet.\" At this time I would like to turn the microphone over to the author of this production, Martin Bourgette. Mr. Bourgette is renowned for putting fresh spins on classic tales, as he did at last year's festival with an updated version of \"Taming of the Shrew.\" Martin started his drama career right here in Muston, earning his first starring role in our outdoor festival at age 14. He appeared in several other festival plays before majoring in drama at Muston University. For the past 10 years, he has tried his hand at writing and directing, earning nationwide acclaim -- and a fair share of criticism -- for his unique perspectives and modern renderings of many classic plays. \"Romeo and Juliet\" is Mr. Bourgette's 21st stage production, and his fourth for our festival. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Martin Bourgette.",

        "transcript": "Are you stuck in traffic as you listen to this? Wouldn't you rather be sitting in a plush seat, reading a good book or sipping a cold drink while you wait? You could, you know, if you were riding a County Transit bus or light-rail train. Light-rail trains run twice daily north-south and east-west during rush hour periods, with 12 convenient stops along the way. And there are now more County Transit buses, and bus routes, than ever before. Recent studies show that taking a bus or train, instead of driving, could save you up to $10,000 a year. That's money that could be used for vacation, that new kitchen you've been wanting, or to help your children go to college. Studies also show that trains and buses, on average, get you to work and back quicker than cars do. So what are you waiting for -- besides that car bumper just ahead of you to finally move? Climb aboard a County Transit bus or light-rail train. Then relax, and leave the driving to us. For more information, call 1-800-TRANSIT, or visit us online at www.countytransit.com.",

First, yes, the quote to enlarge the conference room does include installing new carpet. Sorry if that wasn't clear on the spreadsheet. You had also asked why we quoted a range for the cost of lighting. That's because it depends on the type and style of lights you decide you want. The low figure is for standard lighting, and the high one is for fancy, canned track lights. As for painting, we subcontract that, so I'll have to check with my painters and see when they can come give you an estimate -- hopefully by the end of the week. I'll get back in touch with you about that later today. If you have more questions, give me a call or shoot me an e-mail. My cell phone is 344-612-0985, and the office is 344-555-7249. E-mail is josh at levine dot com. Otherwise, I'll put you in touch with the painters and wait to hear from you. Thanks Ms. Whitehurst, and have a good day!",

My father was a doctor, and my mother was a teacher. I have two older brothers and a younger sister. I grew up in Maryland, but we moved to Chicago when I was 12. I've been interested in science my whole life, so I was ecstatic to receive a scholarship here at Northwestern University to study biology. After earning my bachelor's degree, I got a master's at Stanford. I stayed on there as a researcher for about six years before moving back to Illinois and joining Bio-Tech. I was with Bio-Tech for 10 years before leaving last year to start my own research company, GreenEarth. We employ six full-time researchers, and in the past year we've made a couple of exciting new discoveries, which I'm going to tell you about in just a minute. First, though, I just want to thank the Northwestern president, John Roche, and the faculty of the biology department for inviting me back to speak to you today. It's an exciting moment, and I'm honored.",

But it's not OK to get behind the wheel of a car after you've been drinking. With winter weather already making driving tough, don't make it any harder on yourself - or others - by trying to drive while you're intoxicated. If you plan to drink, arrange a designated driver before the party begins. If you notice someone who shouldn't be driving, talk them into giving you their keys. If they refuse, call 911. Remember, friends don't let friends drive drunk. Finally, if you do happen to find yourself too drunk to drive, call 555-TAXI for a special, free holiday lift. That's 555-TAXI for a free ride anywhere in the county. The state patrol wishes everyone a happy, and safe, holiday season.",

We'd like to remind all students that effective Monday, November 12th, the university campus connector is going back to its original route down Main Street toward the Madison Park Campus. The original route was changed two months ago due to Main Street construction. Now that most of the work is complete, the campus connector will be more efficient for riders, and will have stops in more practical locations for students traveling between campuses. Please note that the route will no longer service the Fourth Avenue corridor, and the stop between 8th and 9th avenues at Marshall Street will be removed. New stops have been added near the School of Business and the School of Engineering. Service hours will remain the same -- 6:30 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. Maps of the new campus connector route are available at the student center, and also on the campus website. If you have any questions about this change, please contact transit coordinator Miriam Morris at 555-2421, or e-mail morrism@vcu.edu. Thank you.",

To multiply 11 by any two-digit number, say 11 times 43, add the two digits together, then insert the sum between them. In this case, 4 plus 3 equals 7, so the answer would be 473. For numbers with two-digit sums, such as 11 times 84, use a slight variation. Eight plus 4 equals 12, so add the 1 from the 12 to the 8 and leave the two in the middle: 924. Here's another quick trick, one you could use to impress your friends at a party. Ask someone to think of a number. Then have them double it, and then add 12, and then divide by 2. Finally, have them subtract their original number. Before they're finished, tell them the answer: 6. It will always be the same.",

Looking at the five-day forecast, this high-pressure front moving in from the east this morning will drive out rain clouds, and the rest of the week looks to be sunny and clear, with highs in the low- to mid-70s and lows dipping into the upper 40s. Chance of rain is 40 percent today but drops to 10 percent by Friday. As you can see, there's a low-pressure front headed our way from the north which is expected to reach us by the weekend, and may bring some more clouds and a chance of rain.

Through the years, Art has been a steadying influence and a guiding light.

I grew up in the Los Angeles area, and got my BA degree at Cal Poly-Pomona. I then earned a master's in literature from UCLA. I worked as a journalist for a few years, and tried my hand at writing poetry and a couple of novels. My second novel, \"LA Life,\" was published by a small firm, but I had decided by that time that I wanted to teach writing. I taught in high schools in Southern California for six years, then at a junior college. Finally, I was hired at San Diego State University, and was there for four years before coming here. I was married four years ago, and I have a three-year-old daughter, Theresa, and a six-month-old son, Antonio. OK, now I'd like to know a little about each of you.",

Elsewhere, traffic is flowing smoothly except on eastbound State Route 440, where an overturned semi truck has traffic backed up from the Lake Bridge onramp to mid-span of the bridge.

Tomorrow will be partly sunny, with a high of about 60, but increasing clouds Tuesday night will bring rain and colder weather later in the week. The chance of rain is 60 percent on Wednesday, increasing to 75 percent Thursday and 90 percent Friday, with highs those days in the mid-50s and lows dropping into the low 40s. It should clear a little by the weekend, with the rain chance falling to 40 percent on Saturday and 20 percent Sunday. Look for partially sunny skies and highs returning to the mid-60s.

There will be no cubicle walls or partitions. Instead, desks will be arranged in clusters for each department. The desks in each department will be facing each other in clusters of four or six. We feel this will facilitate better communication between workers in each departments. It will also create a more welcoming environment for clients. The department managers will still have their own offices, but each will have large windows and glass doors, to make employees and clients feel welcome to come inside. We're also going to paint the walls and put in new carpeting. The project will start on the first of next month and should take about three weeks to complete.

If you're an amateur player, aim for the inside borderline of 8 and 16 on the dart board. Even if your aim is off, you'll still likely score decent points, since the 8 and 16 are surrounded by 11, 7, 14, and 19. If you're above average, focus on the triple 19 ring, and if you fancy yourself an expert, target the triple 20. Of course, you can always aim at the bulls-eye in the center of the board, which is worth 100 points, but if you miss, you might wind up with less points than trying these other strategies.",

The blaze, which has been raging for three days, destroyed nearly 500 acres of land and damaged 10 homes. No injuries have been reported. Fire chief Mike Montgomery said the department is still investigating the cause of the fire, and it's too early to determine if it was set intentionally. Montgomery said fires start easily in this dry weather, and cautioned people again to be very careful with matches and lighters. Campfires have been banned in the eastern foothills, where the fire danger is high, but are still allowed in the northern and western foothills, where the fire danger is currently rated medium. Montgomery said it will take crews another day or two to completely douse the flames, and then cleanup will begin. The city estimates that clean-up costs could exceed $3 million. This has been Wendy Wilkens for the 5 p.m. news.",

Our Premium plan has a $2,000 deductible and includes all aspects of our Basic and Plus plans.

You can get $900 off a brand new pickup truck, or drive home in a new four-door sedan for only $12,500 after a $2,000 government rebate. That's right, up to $2,000 off hundreds of new cars and trucks! And if you have an old clunker that gets less than 20 miles per gallon, bring it down and trade it in. Not only will we give you a great price for that gas guzzler, we'll also give you an extra $1,000 off the price of a new vehicle under the government's \"cash for clunkers\" program. But you'd better get a move on. Prices this low won't last long. We're on Tri-Cities Motorway near the junction of Interstate 40. Right now we're open 9 to 9 Monday through Friday, and 8-10 on Saturday and Sunday. Tell them Tammy sent you, and we'll give you your car's first oil change for free!",

Volume on the two major east-west roadways, Interstate 50 and Highway 44, is very heavy this afternoon as people head out of town for the holiday weekend. There are no accidents on either road, but on Interstate 50 there is a 90-minute delay getting over the mountain pass. North-south traffic looks good at this hour. Interstate 3 is mostly clear in both directions, with a little slowing northbound near the City Center exit due to an earlier two-car collision that has been moved off to the shoulder. We're getting reports now of a backup on Highway 10 southbound near Rodgers Street, where some furniture has fallen off the back of a pickup truck in the far left lane. Police are on the scene, helping the driver pick everything up. This is Tom Moran from the KST-AM traffic center, which provides traffic updates every 20 minutes.",

Our current top CD rate is 5 percent for 48 months, with a minimum investment of $5,000. We also offer a CD of 4 percent for 36 months, with a minimum of $2,000. To purchase either of these CDs, you must first have a Lincoln Bank checking account. Our money market account is currently paying an interest rate of 3.50 percent. You don't need a previous checking account to open a money market account, but you do have to make an initial deposit of at least $1,000. I hope this answers your questions, Mr. Lyons. If there's anything else I can help you with, please give me a call. My name's Janelle Archer, and my number is 555-2002. Have a great day.",

Highs will be 60 degrees today and 65 tomorrow, while lows both days will dive into the low 40s. Looking at the five-day forecast, this high-pressure system moving in from the south will bring more rain later in the week, interspersed with periods of partial clearing. Highs toward the end of the week will inch down toward 60, with lows possibly reaching the mid-30s. As we look out over the eastern part of the state, things look dryer there, with no rain expected and highs holding steady in the mid- to upper-70s for the next week or so.",

Crowley, who was 88, was one of the original smoke jumpers, firefighters who parachute into wilderness forest fires to try and put them out. On his first-ever smoke jump, Crowley's parachute lines became tangled and he landed in a tree. Nonetheless, he and a partner were able to control the fire by the following morning. Their feat marked the beginning of the national smoke jumpers program, and Crowley later became the organization's first superintendent. His career wasn't flawless; in 1959 he directed the crew battling the famous Morgan's Gulch fire, in which 10 smoke jumpers lost their lives. Crowley never forgot that tragedy, but his confidence didn't waver. \"I don't know why,\" he once said, \"but I was never afraid to jump.\" A memorial service will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at the St. Thomas Cathedral. Mr. Crowley is survived by his wife, Ruth, sons Tim and Ryan, and daughter Julia, as well as four grandchildren.",

If you're coming from the east side into the city, Highway 622 or State Route 314 are better choices, as traffic is flowing freely on both roadways right now. Volume is starting to build on roads leading out of the city, because many people are leaving work early to get a head start on their three-day weekends. There are a lot of large campers and SUVs on the freeways, which are starting to cause backups on Interstate 6 both north and south of downtown. Heavy traffic is expected on the mountain pass this afternoon and evening, as well as on Monday, when people return from vacation. The only other problem at this hour is on Highway 109 near exit 17, where a pick-up truck has run out of gas and is blocking the right lane. This has been Sheila Strothers with your 4 p.m. WJKZ traffic update. The next traffic report will be at 5.",

        "transcript": "Well, the short answer is yes, I do believe that the stock market is still a good place to invest your money. You pointed out that stock investors have lost a lot of money the past two years, and that's certainly true. The market has tumbled down. But you have to take an historic perspective. Over the past 100 years, the stock market has averaged a 9-percent return. That's pretty good, much better than the 2 or 3 percent most bank accounts pay. So this is a down period for the market, but it will bounce back, and it's still a good avenue for the average investor. In fact, now is actually a great time to buy stocks, while the market is depressed. However, I do not recommend that clients put all their money in the stock market. I advise people to invest in many different things. For example, they should have bonds, real estate, and maybe gold or silver as part of their investment portfolio. That way, they have some assurance that when stocks fall, their other holdings will rise to balance their total investment package. There's a lot of truth in the old saying, \"Don't put all you eggs in one basket.\" Bearing that in mind, each investor is different, though. The types of investments I advise for each person depends on many factors, including their age, their income, and the degree of risk they are willing to take. Stocks provide a good return, for instance, but they are riskier than say, bonds.",

Because most charities are nonprofit, their effectiveness cannot be measured financially, as with the stock market. This makes it difficult to know how well they are spending the money that is so generously donated. Fortunately, there are a number of organizations that analyze charities and rate them according to a variety of different criteria. Their idea is to help givers channel their donations to entities that will ensure the money goes where it's supposed to -- to help the needy -- rather than into the pockets of the charity's leaders. These organizations typically rate charities like movie reviews, giving them from one star for poor performance to four stars for outstanding work. Some also invite customers to write reviews of charitable organizations. Before you make your next donation, you might want to investigate the charity you're considering online.",

I was referred to you by my neighbor, Doris Magnusson, who says you've been cleaning her home for a couple of years. I own a four-bedroom house in Green Haven, and I'd like to have someone come and clean it twice a month. Could you please tell me how much that would cost? Do you send just one person, or a team of two? Also, what type of cleaning materials do you use? Are they environmentally friendly? Do I need to provide anything? Oh, one more thing. Do you charge extra for pets? I have a dog and two cats. Again, my name's Darcy McGuire, and if you could please call me at 555-6996, I'd appreciate it. You could talk to me or my daughter, Daisy Meyers, who lives downstairs. I'd like to get started next week, so I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you.",

If you are in one of these programs and normally ride the special-activity bus, listen carefully. The special-activity bus will leave today directly after the final bell rings, and it will load in the east parking lot. Regular buses will leave as usual from the west parking lot. If you are being picked up by a parent today instead of riding the bus, your parent must come to the main office first and sign you out. Please do not leave school with your parent unless you were signed out at the office. All buses will be on snow routes this afternoon. They will drop you at your snow bus stop. Again, the special-activity bus leaves directly after school from the east parking lot, and all buses will be on snow routes. Thank you.",

        "transcript": "How do we attract and retain customers? That's a great question, and for a retailer, probably the most crucial one to address. First, we pay a lot of attention to detail -- the way our stores look, the lighting, the cleanliness. Is the parking lot clean? Are the signs visible and easy to read? Second, we invest in our associates. We pay merit increases, we pay bonuses, and make contributions to their retirement plans. We believe that satisfied workers equals satisfied customers. We just introduced something we call power hours. In the hours that traffic is heaviest, we stop all activity that the customers can't see, like back-room unloading and storing, and put every associate out on the main floor. It's really that belly-to-belly experience that makes people want to come back. We hear from about 100,000 customers each week, and they rate us on a number of attributes. So far, they tell us that we're doing the right things.",

        "transcript": "You know, that's the question I'm probably asked the most: Why? Sometimes I wonder myself. It's hard work to start a business, any business. So why do I work so hard to start one, get it going, and then walk away to start another one from scratch...? I don't know, really. It's not for the money. If I wanted to get rich I'd make one business enormously successful, then sell it. I guess it's in my DNA. I love the challenge of creating something -- of seeing my dreams spring to life. But once they do, the excitement's gone, and I'm ready for something else. I think the first sign I would be a businessman was when I was nine, and a friend and I started renting our used DVDs to the neighborhood kids. I started my first business at age 13 -- a lawn-mowing service -- and I've been creating companies ever since. Not all of them have been successful, but I think I've learned more from my failures than my successes. This current venture is my 12th start-up company. Five have failed, but six are going strong, so I'm batting better than five-hundred. I'm 60, I'm still in good health, I love what I do -- so I see myself doing this until the day I die.",

Ms. Johannsen had inquired about our advertising rates. In a nutshell, they depend on the size of the advertisement, volume and frequency. Our basic rates range from $20 for a one-column-by-one-inch ad to $5,000 for a full-page color ad. We offer volume discounts for multiple ads, as well as discounts for ads that run more than twice in one week or four times in a month. We have a fantastic ad-design department, and we also accept camera-ready ads, which should be submitted at least one day before publication. OK, I hope this answers your general questions. If you want more specific details, please call me back at 555-0904, ext. 654, or e-mail me at Van Hoffman - that's V-A-N H-O-double F- M-A-N dot g at Times-News dot com, and I'll be happy to give you more information.
