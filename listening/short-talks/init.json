We lost almost $20 million last year, and the owners have tried to sell the paper but no one wants to buy it in this economy. I want to thank all of you, all the editors, writers, photographers, page designers, printers -- everyone who helped make this paper a city institution for the past 150 years. It's been a pleasure and an honor working with you and supervising you. As you've heard, we will continue to have an online news site with a staff of 25. This re-designed website will begin tomorrow. We hope that it will help fill the gap left by the departed print product. Meanwhile, we have one more issue to put out. Let's get to work and make it the best it can be.",

Well, if you're on the roads listening to this, you already know that traffic is pretty much a mess everywhere. On Interstate 7, it crawls from downtown to the county line. Vehicles crossing the lake on State Route 50 are gridlocked both eastbound and westbound, and the valley freeway is stop-and-go from Mayberry through Winwood. Highway 17 is slow through the city, then clears out until Overpass Road. If that weren't bad enough, an injury accident is blocking Main Street downtown, causing a 15-minute backup for cars waiting to get onto the freeway. This has been Betty Bellarussa with your 5 p.m. WARP-AM traffic update. Our next traffic report will be at the bottom of the hour.",

Once you have your tickets, each passenger must exchange them for a boarding pass, including young children. When you have obtained your boarding pass, you are ready to access the platform.

        "transcript": "Hi, Dori Madson here, host of the KORG-FM afternoon show. My dog, Spot, loves to run. The trouble is, she was always running out of our yard into the neighbors' yards. Once, she even ran into the street and nearly got hit by a car! That's when I called my friends at InvisiFence. They came right over, explained their program, and within a couple of hours had erected an invisible barrier around our yard that keeps Spot on our property just like a real fence would. Spot can now run happily around our yard, and me and my family don't have to worry about her running away. She'll go right to the edge of the yard, but won't go past it. The Invisifence process was smooth, quick, and surprisingly affordable -- much cheaper than putting a real fence around my yard would have been. If you're looking for an effective way to keep your dog on your property, call Invisifence now. They're right here in town, at 789-9876. Or, check them out on the web at invisifence.com. Take it from me, you'll be glad you did.",

I'd like to reschedule for later in the week, if that works for you and Pete. I'm available late Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, but early morning Wednesday or Friday would actually be best for me. We could still meet at Pete's office, as we planned, or I'd be able to meet somewhere else if it's more convenient for you. Sorry about the cancellation. Please call me as soon as you can after hearing this. My cell is 886-2468, or you can call my office at 351-9823 and leave a message with my secretary, Crystal Gains. Thanks, Ron.

This is due mostly to economic factors beyond our control, particularly the gas-price increases. The good news is that our fourth-quarter earnings are projected to rise nearly 3 percent, or about 75 cents a share. That's partly because we've implemented an energy conservation program at all our plants - for instance, cutting fuel usage by 10 percent - and partly because the economy is on the rebound. Going forward, the company remains healthy, and we anticipate increased energy earnings for each of the first two quarters next year. Our challenge will be finding creative ways to remain well-positioned in a bear economy, and planning for flexibility to meet our goals without compromising the quality of our product.",

Highs will be 60 degrees today and 65 tomorrow, while lows both days will dive into the low 40s. Looking at the five-day forecast, this high-pressure system moving in from the south will bring more rain later in the week, interspersed with periods of partial clearing. Highs toward the end of the week will inch down toward 60, with lows possibly reaching the mid-30s. As we look out over the eastern part of the state, things look dryer there, with no rain expected and highs holding steady in the mid- to upper-70s for the next week or so.",

Hair Apparent's experienced doctors combine the use of hair from other parts of your body with their patented growth gel to give you a full, natural-looking head of hair within six- to eight-weeks.

Call Hair Apparent at 555-1209 today for a free consultation, or visit one of their two locations: 123 Main Street downtown or 345 Pine Street on the east side.

A two-car collision is blocking the right lane of Interstate 12 near the Broad Street on-ramp, and traffic there is backed up for about two miles. On Highway 33, a milk truck has overturned near the junction of Holden Road, which has created a parking lot while work crews clear debris from the roadway. Other roads look normal for this time. Interstate 14 slows coming into Millburg, but picks up again near Smithport, and State Route 7 is slow off-and-on from the downtown S-curves through Lake McDonald. If you need to cross the lake right now, both roadways look pretty good, but Interstate 80 is a little bit better bet than State Route 320, where volumes are beginning to build on the west side. This is Mindy Rollins with front-seat traffic.",

Would 4 o'clock work for you? If not, I'm available Friday morning at 8 and 11, and in the afternoon at either 2 or 3:30. Otherwise, we'll have to aim for next week sometime. Monday and Wednesday afternoons work best for me, but I also have a couple of morning openings on Tuesday and Friday. Why don't you call me and let me know what works best for you? My office number is 555-3084, extension 111. If I'm not in, you can set an appointment with my secretary, Lori Crowther. Or, you could try my cell at 555-3169.

At the end of our six-week course all of you, hopefully, will be able to pass the real estate exam and become Richmond agents. Here are some things to note before we begin our training. First, you need to hand in your blue class registration forms at the table in the front of the room. Then, go the table against the right wall to find your name tag and a packet of course information. Next, go the table in the back corner to pick up your text book. Once you have done all these things, find a seat and sit down. When everyone's ready Nathan Richmond, our company president, will say a few remarks. After that, we'll head for the conference room and tonight's first class. Okay? Are there any questions?",

Sixty-six percent of all women age 18 to 25 are aware of our brand, compared to only 47 percent of women age 25 to 40. With men, sixty-two percent know our brand in the 18 to 25 demographic, but that falls to 43 percent in the 25 to 40 age range. The trouble is, young adults have less money than older adults. Only about 35 percent of all people over 40 - men and women - have heard of us. Interestingly, that percentage is higher with teenagers: 40 percent of all girls and 39 percent of all boys know our brand. But again, teens don't have money.

Rush hour is in full swing all over the valley, and volumes are heavy on all major thoroughfares. Traffic is gridlocked on Interstate 11 from Maple Street clear to Valley Market Center, where it finally begins to thin out. Interstate 305 isn't much better; pretty much bumper-to-bumper through the six-mile stretch from Belleville to Redland. The only blocking slowdown at this hour is on State Route 10, where a car in the left lane has apparently run out of gas near the Mountain View exit. There is a tow truck on the way to the scene to help out, and we can see some people trying to push the car onto the left shoulder. The only other major bottleneck at this hour is on Westmont Avenue, where the right lane is closed for a couple of miles due to ongoing road improvements. It's better to take Eastlake Way instead. I'm Miguel Lopez for \"Eagle Eye\" traffic. Now back to you in the studio, Dave.",

Tomorrow will be partly sunny, with a high of about 60, but increasing clouds Tuesday night will bring rain and colder weather later in the week. The chance of rain is 60 percent on Wednesday, increasing to 75 percent Thursday and 90 percent Friday, with highs those days in the mid-50s and lows dropping into the low 40s. It should clear a little by the weekend, with the rain chance falling to 40 percent on Saturday and 20 percent Sunday. Look for partially sunny skies and highs returning to the mid-60s.

Based on what's happened in the past, it's a bit difficult to talk about the future, because, if you had asked me this question five years ago, there's no way I would have predicted that our company could grow this much, and would have become the leading domestic brand in our industry. It still seems surreal. So, I'm hesitant to look too far forward. There are two things that I hope will happen, and that we will certainly strive like heck for. One is to make sure we don't rest on our laurels, but look for ways to constantly improve our product. The other is to compete more on the worldwide market, so that in a short while our name is as well known in Iceland as it is in Iowa. Those, I guess, would be our two main short-term goals. Honestly, I don't think much beyond that.",

A former newspaper reporter, Mr. Fellows' 22 novels include 14 number-one best-sellers, and 10 of his stories have been turned into major Hollywood movies. Last year's novel, \"The Third House on the Left,\" won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction as well as the Pen Faulkner Award, making Jason one of only a half-dozen writers to win both of these prestigious honors in the same year.

We're looking at state patrol officers sweeping glass and debris from that collision over to the side of the road, while the left lane remains closed to traffic. Taking a peek at our eastside real-time camera, we see heavy congestion on Highway 605 east of the convention center, thinning out south of the airport. Traffic on Route 2, meanwhile, looks to be moving steadily until the town of Roserock, where a maintenance crew is fixing a large pothole in the center of the roadway. Finally, looking west along Highway 14, we see a backup near exit 93 that appears to be caused by a dairy truck that has spilled part of its load of milk in the center lane. This is Brandon Bacchio with your WILK traffic report. Now back to you, Eda.",

I don't offer any magic formula to \"get rich quick,\" and no, you won't walk out of here tonight and become millionaires tomorrow. However, if you listen carefully, study dutifully and apply the strategy I'm going to teach you, I guarantee that you can substantially increase your wealth in a relatively short period of time. To give you a personal example, just a few years ago I was like most of you - a middle-class businessperson, doing OK but not fabulous. After I learned this wealth-building strategy, and began applying it, my net worth tripled in the space of two years, and has kept rising steadily since then. I was able to retire five years ago, and am now blessed to be able to travel the country and share with others some of the tricks I have learned. So, let's get started...",

Looking at the five-day forecast, this high-pressure front moving in from the east this morning will drive out rain clouds, and the rest of the week looks to be sunny and clear, with highs in the low- to mid-70s and lows dipping into the upper 40s. Chance of rain is 40 percent today but drops to 10 percent by Friday. As you can see, there's a low-pressure front headed our way from the north which is expected to reach us by the weekend, and may bring some more clouds and a chance of rain.

The tall white building behind that is the Ricks Tower, which was the tallest building in the city for almost 100 years. Coming up on the left-hand side is the oldest building in town. Constructed in 1835, it was originally the county courthouse. It's gone through several reincarnations since then, and is currently the Pit Stop, one of the city's finest watering holes. Ahead on the right is the Gazette Building, home of the city's largest newspaper. OK, now we're leaving downtown and headed for the University District, to check out some historic architecture at the state's most prestigious institute of higher education. After that, we'll have lunch at 12 o'clock at the historic Rose Inn, prior to our afternoon cruise on the lake.",

I own a four-bedroom house in Green Haven, and I'd like to have someone come and clean it twice a month. Could you please tell me how much that would cost? Do you send just one person, or a team of two? Also, what type of cleaning materials do you use? Are they environmentally friendly? Do I need to provide anything? Oh, one more thing. Do you charge extra for pets? I have a dog and two cats. Again, my name's Darcy McGuire, and if you could please call me at 555-6996, I'd appreciate it.

She knows basketball well, not only because she was a college player herself, at Western University, but she also comes from a basketball family. Her father, Jerry, was a long-time high school coach, and her mother, Brenda, has coached youth basketball for more than 20 years. Her two sisters, Linda and Abigail, also played hoops in high school and college. After a brief pro career, MaryAnn returned to Western as an assistant coach for two years, and then moved up as an assistant at Tech University for four years. She got her first head coaching job at Valley State, which she led to the league championship before moving to Hickstown U, where she's gone 64-18 and won two league titles the past three seasons. So, without further ado, I'll turn the microphone over to MaryAnn to answer your questions.",

But otherwise things look better than usual for your afternoon commute. We're just getting word of an overturned semi on the Valley highway near Mayberry, so we'll give you more details on that next hour.

But it's not OK to get behind the wheel of a car after you've been drinking. With winter weather already making driving tough, don't make it any harder on yourself - or others - by trying to drive while you're intoxicated. If you plan to drink, arrange a designated driver before the party begins. If you notice someone who shouldn't be driving, talk them into giving you their keys. If they refuse, call 911. Remember, friends don't let friends drive drunk. Finally, if you do happen to find yourself too drunk to drive, call 555-TAXI for a special, free holiday lift. That's 555-TAXI for a free ride anywhere in the county. The state patrol wishes everyone a happy, and safe, holiday season.",

This is in response to the aggressive push by online depositories and credit unions, which are enticing customers with higher interest rates. This is squeezing our interest margin and decreasing our profitability. We can't lend money that we don't have, right? At the same time, we will be switching the title of \"loan officers\" to \"relationship officers.\" A large part of their job now will be to recruit, and retain, new deposits.",

There appear to be numerous injuries, and the state patrol and aid cars are on the scene. Three lanes are closed southbound, and northbound traffic on I-35 is crawling through the area as people slow to take a peek. Other area roadways appear normal for this hour. Highway 4 is smooth sailing through downtown, and State Route 20 has off-and-on slowing from Wideview through Treeland. If you're crossing the river the Sky Street bridge is your best bet, as the Key Bridge is still slow due to the effects of an earlier debris spill in the left eastbound lane.

Yes, it's true that he has directed some of the greatest motion pictures of our time, and that he has made famous actors such as Roberto DiNardo and Martin Braun. But it's also true that he has raised five fine children, volunteered for his local church, and given millions of dollars to charities such as this one.

I was unable to book a flight on the 30th, so I booked a flight at 8:30 a.m. the 31st with Arizona Air. You'll need to be at the airport two hours before departure, and your tickets will be waiting at the check-in counter. When the plane lands in Arizona Springs, Mr. Tim Lazarro will meet you at the gate and drive you to the Desert Oasis hotel. Look for a man holding a sign with your name on it. You're booked into the Desert Oasis for four nights, with a return flight scheduled for 3 p.m. on the Fourth. If you have any questions, Mr. Pierce, please give me a call at 559-3447. Again, my name's Sheila Lancaster, and thank you for choosing Terrific Travel.",

If you are in one of these programs and normally ride the special-activity bus, listen carefully. The special-activity bus will leave today directly after the final bell rings, and it will load in the east parking lot. Regular buses will leave as usual from the west parking lot. If you are being picked up by a parent today instead of riding the bus, your parent must come to the main office first and sign you out. Please do not leave school with your parent unless you were signed out at the office. All buses will be on snow routes this afternoon. They will drop you at your snow bus stop. Again, the special-activity bus leaves directly after school from the east parking lot, and all buses will be on snow routes. Thank you.",

You said your Hyashi has only 20,000 miles on it. I'm wondering if you're the original owner, and also if those are mostly highway miles or city miles? I'd also like to know if it's been in any accidents. I'm very interested in looking at it and taking a test drive. I'm available tonight and all day tomorrow, and I live in the north part of town, not far from you. If it's still available, could you please call me at 555-8448? That's my home number. My cell phone is 555-4884. Again, my name's Ted, and I hope to hear from you soon. Thanks. Goodbye.",

Unfortunately, as you know, the economy has been tough lately, and management has had to make some very difficult decisions. It's never easy letting someone go, especially someone as talented and loyal as you are. But the hard truth is, we've got to cut 3,000 jobs to stay solvent, and yours is one of them. We'll pay your salary through the end of the month, and of course you're eligible for unemployment. You also get to keep all your company stock options, and I'll personally write you a letter of recommendation. I'm awfully sorry. I know you have a wife and kids, and believe me, this isn't easy for any of us. All I can say is keep your head up. I'm sure you'll land on your feet once the economy recovers again.",

I worked as a journalist for a few years, and tried my hand at writing poetry and a couple of novels. My second novel, \"LA Life,\" was published by a small firm, but I had decided by that time that I wanted to teach writing. I taught in high schools in Southern California for six years, then at a junior college. Finally, I was hired at San Diego State University, and was there for four years before coming here.

Hope everything's OK, and I'll try you on your cell phone too. If you get this, remember that I have a new cell phone number. It's 554-8448. You could also try Ronni on her cell: 555-6509.

I came from a poor family, and when I finished high school I didn't think I'd be able to go to college. But I kept applying to universities, and finally, I found one -- Carver University -- that offered me a scholarship. This changed my life. Without that experience, there is no way I'd have ever gotten a job at the Cornerstone Company, let alone be standing here as company president. Now it's overwhelming to be back at Carver, looking at the faces of so many eager men and women who are anxious to get out there and make a difference. My message to you is: never give up. Ever.

He helped start Freedom International, along with Roger Montoya, and it's due mostly to his great charisma, drive, and wisdom that we have enjoyed so much success. Through the years, Art has been a steadying influence and a guiding light.

I assume that you've all read the story in this morning's paper accusing us of unfair trade policies in South America. We all know this is untrue, and that several facts the writer cited were inaccurate. But most readers don't know that, and the reality is that suddenly, we've got an image problem. We need to counter this right away, and the purpose of this gathering is to figure out how. Research shows that a non-response or a delayed response from us will imply that the article is true, so time is of the essence. To begin with, I'd like to go around the table and hear your initial thoughts and ideas. Margo, let's start with you.",

In a tough economy, we're going to act just like our customers -- tightening our belt and looking for ways to save money. We'll be looking at ways we can conserve energy, operate our stores more efficiently, and integrate new procedures that cut the costs of gas and power. We're also going to re-examine our pricing structure. We might have to lower prices and operate on a thinner profit margin for awhile. We value each and every one of our employees, and we won't let them go until we've first tried everything we possibly can. So I can't promise there won't be layoffs down the road, but your listeners can rest assured that we're committed to trying and avoid them at all costs.",

This accident at the King Street off ramp is adding about 15 minutes to the commute on Interstate 50, but as you can see a tow truck is on the scene and it looks like it'll be cleared soon. On Highway 15, work crews are repaving the right lane near the Hawthorne Creek exit, which is bottlenecking traffic for a couple of miles. If you're heading east right now your best bet is State Route 1, which is starting to flow now that this car that ran out of gas has been moved to the right shoulder. This is Monica Lewis for WING-5.",

Renaldo Lopez, my co-star, brought out the best in me, and the whole cast was unbelievably talented. Oh, and I can't forget Sheena Ross, our scriptwriter, who wrote such a fantastic story.

Diane Farmer was a stay-at-home mother of three and says she simply \"wanted something to do\" when she began inking The Magic Mushroom four years ago. She wrote the book while waiting to pick up her kids from day care, at night after they were asleep, and in spare moments at basketball games and school plays. Prior to that, Ms. Farmer's only previous writing experience was in a college English class. Now she's already written a sequel due out next month, and is at work on a third book, but she insists that success hasn't changed her. She's still a devoted mother and wife.
